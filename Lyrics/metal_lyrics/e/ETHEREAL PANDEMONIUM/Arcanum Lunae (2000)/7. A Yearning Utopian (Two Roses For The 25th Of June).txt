[Music and lyrics by Rhaa]

Just a siren stayed from the soul of a swan,
Extincted one day like Herakleit's sun,
Thinking of glory in your dreaming heaven
During one night of June 1997
Feelin' so stranded in your dismal shell
I hope it was snow what you for the last time felt...

The last tear flowing down your hot cheek,
Suffering, memories and the last tick...

Wrath! Despite the knowledge

Without the godsend... snuffling the candle off,
Gospel condemned... Next fawn to dark
Her eminence Hyaena... decided again
To embalm her... Woe of soul

With May, the time of the blossomed lichens did not come,
A grim meadow full of forsaken straits.
Embers dabbed her inside and now she knew
That the crescent would become a fullmoon no more...

I see the sun in the mist and the darkness
The fallen beams to the withered flowers
Sadly flowing all your life
Your tears were changed into the ash

Perhaps one day I will comprehend
Wrapped up in the sea of the dismal memories,
Seeing only your closed eyes,
Thinking only of your lifelong pains

Thee seared her sooner than she died, Neferthiti of my heart
Forgotten in the temple of laments
And so much she wanted to live...
"Life is a beautiful flower, but we must have a courage to sever it
On the edge of the horrible abyss..."

Barbarian dew on my cheeks from the ivory
I implore the evangelical beehive of her disillusion,
I can't dishearten being face to face my inertia
A bee in disgrace? Thee fucking parasite!

The diocese with the emblem... Of Chrysanthemum
Congenitally kept running... With her chandeller
Blackness of goldlines... Doomed to suffer
As the colourless leaves of begonia

And this gossam was that last
For Antigona of my trivial ebonies
Oh, my wish utopian to put together her splinters

Passing by meridian of hope, finding a serenity until it urn,
Harrased, heavy as the sea level
No daintiness for her china smile

The flame of your candlelight will burn forever,
You'll never be forgotten, goodbye my friend...
