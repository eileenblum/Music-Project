Imagine your future like the truth was not told
Ahead lies destruction salvation ignored
The vast generation some found an empty throne
Same people claim they are razored to the bone

Razored to the bone

Chained are all saviours and tame are no lords
Succeed with your passion die by the sword
Lost in temptation destructed fuck up close
Trash doomed messiah razored to the bone
