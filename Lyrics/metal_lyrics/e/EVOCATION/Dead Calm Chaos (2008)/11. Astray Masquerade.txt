Hammering and
Sucking the sin out of me
Tearing and
Ripping my calm in to pieces
Soul fight
Twisted conflicts inside
Confusion
Invisible retribution

Punishment cause
False faced was our crime
Non euphoria found
Tasteless fruit our seed
Decadence now
Re-awoken from its sleep
Rooted down deep
Our infected wounds bleed

Faded paled and chained to this damned masquerade
