Tomorrow has no sunrise
We've now reached our final dawn
The new empire arisen
The start we all have spawned
Angels burnt to stone
Lies buried down below
Their wings stripped and broken
The rain has turned to snow

Changes when conflicts made its cause
Awaited this war our final fall

Landscape turned to ice
Naked trees surrounded us all
Stiff dead are the beggars
And cold are the poor
Hypocrites as leaders
False preaching under law
Circles bent and broken
No sun forever more
