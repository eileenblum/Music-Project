Lowered in her fire
Reborn in her flames
We asked for much desire
Consuming down our lanes
Strong currents are killing me
Seduced between our dreams
I found her in my faith

My angel of torment
So strong the bizarre angel of torment
My angel

Built upon bizarre
Fading loss of shame
Tempting twinkling stars
Poisoned bullets made
Wrong currents are holding me
Beneath the surface of sanity

Held in scarlet our fantasy
The vast of all virginity
I sold my soul for purity
Under the surface of sanity
