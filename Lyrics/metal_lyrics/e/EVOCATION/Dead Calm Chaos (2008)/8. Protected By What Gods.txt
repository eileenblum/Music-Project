Through ancient rites you speak the words
Once holy god arise
Religious battles gods command
Hand in hand combined

Raise your hands praise your lord
Forgive us for our sins
In his command slave all false
And break them till they bleed
Tortured nations beggars bleed
Defended by some sign
You know your wrong but still proceed
You think you are protected
Protected by what gods

Defined by death you strike the world
Since promised land awaits
Strike the past blood behold
Tyranity unfold

Beheaded sane close your eyes
We have no calm at sight
With toxic blood we stain the pure
No holy god we'll find
