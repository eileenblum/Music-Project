Deadly sins tear you apart
An ancient evil kind of art
Bound to hell why can't you tell
Seek the truth down in your well

Demons beg you to end this dwell
Eternal flames will burn you in hell

Fading past as darkness shading
Regrets you feel when faith you steal
Truth will show do feel no fear
Scars inside to tough to hide

Eye enemy

Emotions hurt but pain no more
A question of hate that is for sure
Words of wisdom is no more
You burnt the bridge to safety shore
