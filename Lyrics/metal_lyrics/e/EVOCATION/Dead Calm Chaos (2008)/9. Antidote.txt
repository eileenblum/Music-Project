I'm running around in circles
Lost my guideline to see
Searching what for
This silence I need I need it so
Where to find my antidote I do not know
Trauma panic increase so slow
My hell inside it slowly floats
I can feel its fire glow

I vanish into never
I'm bleeding into numb
Chased in the forever
I float into my slumber
How to find my antidote I have to go
Trauma panic increase too slow

How to found my antidote I still don't know
Trauma panic it makes me low
My hell inside in silence float
I can feel the fire glow
