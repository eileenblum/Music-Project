psychosis warfare
in deepest tombs
our helpless saviors
divide our minds in half
brightless human
mind left blank
emty landscape
runs a sword in thee
utopia gone inside our selves
for nothing we feed our darkest thoughts
distant shallows swarms our inner truths
obliteration frames our naked walls
and stains our memory more
breathe your enemy
loose your sane
target mindways
follows with watching eyes
heartless movement
breathless room
darkened worlds
flamed inside our cells
