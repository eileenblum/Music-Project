murder in passion
now death is on its way
shadowed obsession
her darkest obey
muder in passion
intruder found wrong
too dark was her session
then her lonely hours seemed to grow
I dived into her hollow thoughts
I drowned in misery
murder in passion
precede the delete
when facing destruction
no forgiveness she leaves
murder in passion
was hiding among
so cold was our session
soon our passion ceased to grow
so I fell into her holocaust
the construction made me fall
