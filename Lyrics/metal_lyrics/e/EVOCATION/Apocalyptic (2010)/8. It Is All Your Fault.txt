diseased for no sake I burn in open fire
impulsive overdose frantic overload
evoked from its shade the beast came back for more
blood for sacrifice our weakness was our threat
rage at me
throw me against the wall
spill your hate
determination from inside
aim at me
leave me deadly thought
hate your self
its rise is all your fault
its all your fault
who was there to win, who released our sorrow
defected symmetry, rejected empaty
we found our god impaled
our god lives no more
god for sacrifice, we godless faced our death

burn our answers save us from your sins
break the silence bleed the fever more
turn the fire into toxic breed
see the liese and taste our infamy
