aimed at with precision
I'm lost inside your tuf
the faceless demolition
my antichrist rebirth
when stranded in between
reboot me
I'm aiming, I hod the trigger I'm your victim
my battle now reformed
it follows my direction
it consumes me whole
it stains my crucifixion
it calms my soul
I'm a target in you distance
your eyes observe my moves
forgivenss through devastation
the penetration drills its hole

sweet obsession, dark and cold
chain me in you deep vaults
sweet obsession chills my blood
embrace me in your shade once more
