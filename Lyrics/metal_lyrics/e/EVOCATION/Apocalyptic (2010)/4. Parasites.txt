burn off them leaches
bleed out the filth from your skin
stone all the preachers
hunt them until they all fall
drench them in fire and see them all burn
bow for no masters
loneliness gives you more strength
left is the failure release of the beast
bastards who do you think you are
bastard, what is left for me
rotten is what's your lifeline is
we do not need to preach
kill all the weakness
fade all the fear deep inside
clean of the dust
freedom in sight gained control
we spit in the face of the filth
parasites

we burn all your churches
we burn all your lies
