the panic seize me through
as the dark side takes control
now the blame towards me
it raptures my soul
we longed for his arise
found the mad man in his eyes
hate regardless towards all
a ruleless battle we fought
die in darkness consume me whole
a vast invasion a last formation
damnation frame no destination train
black is our answer we drown in its shade
when careless I lost my soul
I lost salvation in its cold
how the pain gained control
down tortured us all
one day we will die
in the darkness in the night
lit our fire feel it burn
as time heals no more
we pray for mandatory
protection from its blade
red eyes from blood vision
destruction flames our graves
