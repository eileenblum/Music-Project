cast aside with broken shield
I was abandoned by my god
left as dirt among the lonely race
it painted dark my space
open wound from a dagger hand
left open for no cause
rewinded thoughts I endlessly gazed
I found conviction in it's claws
reunion in war
traumatic point in a useless breath
I'm choking on its curse
faded role into dark absence
I was divided into half
a serpent's sting and a spit within
soon the poison starts its search
open casket headless bones
and my fight revived much worse
it tortures my thoughts
it leaves me in vain
it tortures my nights
it drives me insane
failure and frustration
