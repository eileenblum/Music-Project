The arrogance in the bitter sweet
The serpent queen now is born
Constructed deep in your destiny
Inside the eye of the storm

I the true messiah
Show life in true pain
And as your death draws near
I'll be your suicide

The ignorance in your deepest fear
Confronts the soul of the sick
Like a cancer from a tragedy
Another dark hole in life

I the true desire
Show lust in pure filth
As anger shades your sun
I'll be your suicide

Freedom
The lust of this darkness we share
Orgies between you and me
Mindless we bonded for life
We bonded for death
We fear the taste of the bitter bright
Demonic cult we acclaim

I filth we find the release
Aligned reflection never lies

I the true messiah
Show life in true pain
And as your death draws near
I'll be your suicide

I the true desire
Show lust in pure filth
As anger shades your sun
I'll be your suicide
