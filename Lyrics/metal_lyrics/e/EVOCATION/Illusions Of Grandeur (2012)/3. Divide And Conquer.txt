[Music: KenttÃ¤kumpu, PalmÃ©n, lyrics: Josefsson]

With strong corruption force
From soil so hard and cold
The somber empire silently rises tall
Based on broken time they've built a state of mind
In darkest hours the serpent was reborn

Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer

Masters of seclusion and rulers of our game
With strings of poison, we're kept restrained
We're fed not to reflect and framed into this time
In falsehood mayhem the treachery is born - ah!

Shattered and torn apart
Our sight shows hate
Chaos and emptiness
This retribution consumes

Victimised in pain and desensitized in fear
We're fed with error, no sympathy obtained
So those who see it clear
Rise up and speak your truth
Our time for slaughter is always now

Shattered and torn apart
Our sight shows hate
Chaos and emptiness
This retribution consumes

[Lead: KenttÃ¤kumpu]

[2x]
Chaos and darkness forever to be shown
The emptiness runs through, our road is dark and cold
Terror and bloodshed forever to be told
In the mind of mutiny our trail is always black
