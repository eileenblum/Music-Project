welcome inside the well of despair
here emotions are based upon fear
where truth is nothing but pain
and your punishment is to survive

no more inside
rejected and twisted insane
trapped in a rootless cyclone
that puts your puzzle apart

alone and left in this cage
the masters are pulling your strings
too late you became aware
that you live in this well of despair

welcome onboard your oneway to hell
that tracks to your darkest inside
utopia is what you lose
when you're trapped in this dome of despair

no more outside
reflecting and waiting in vain
chained with you demons behind
drained and now empty inside

it hurts to conquer in this darkness
to burn the bridges to your past
it hurts when no one knows you failing
the pain when no one's there to catch your fall
