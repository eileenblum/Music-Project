Down the aggression path we ride
Blood our blood temperature rises
Beware of the bullets we send
Late is the time for solutions
The soil under your feet
Is about to be red and nasty

Through the past we became an obscurity
By today we are the beast's you've created

Pain one secret lust emotion
Bleed it never hurts to bleed
Seek the release fight the disease static overload
Death is the future we see left empty are our thrones

So roll up your map show me where you are
Twisted little fuckers idol servants suckers
The colour of evil cast shadows on thee
In the mouth of hell soon we all will be
