I know that you will go
As a fallen no kharma no
It turned back as pain inside
Into nothing your soul I throw

Who were you and what you left
Means nothing I hope you bleed
I know you know you didn't shine
Wrack on crack your soul in black

I see your hands they bleed
Oh my god they bleed

Never ever ever
Ever forever never again

Ride the dagger and fuck the pain
Blow a bullet right through your brain
Seek forgiveness save your prayer
Down in hell you'll be my slave
Dirty needles on which you feed
Addictive deadheads blind you lead
One way ghost ride last stop hell
Latent fever chronic hell
