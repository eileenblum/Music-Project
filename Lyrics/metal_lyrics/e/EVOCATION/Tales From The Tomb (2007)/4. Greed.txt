I seduced the feeding hand then found myself deep down
Now here I stand the fool king of the lost prince of decay

Abandoned man
Drifter soul
Slave to shame
I've lost it all

I abused the feeding hand by the hunger and greed
You gave me some I wanted more you had less so I took it all

The demons grew inside the devils asked for more
I never saw what happened until I now lost all

I now await my fall soon the final call
And in shame I crawl hear the bells of doom
