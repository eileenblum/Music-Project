Twisted formations surround the road we ride
Rejected salvation towards chaos mouth we glide
We never had a reason nor even had a choice
Here we stand before thee listen to our voices

Abstracted reflections hallucinating truth
Silent ignorance communicate refused
Demons piss in our wounds mistakes dig our tombs
Ring the slaughter hell and welcome to our hell

Feed the fire
