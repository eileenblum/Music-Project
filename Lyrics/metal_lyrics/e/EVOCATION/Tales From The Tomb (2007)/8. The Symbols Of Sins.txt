Awakened is the fool's subconscious reality
Blind we say psychosis tyrannity
Alive are the dead sane are the mad
Stained are the clean of blood from the damned

Release your pain your wounds wide open
Ease the blame your eyes blood soaked
Illusion Christ once promised paradise
See my thoughts I'll show you pure pain

Repeated illusions dead end destiny
Death we say or release from captivity
See do the blind hear do the deaf
Bleed do your wounds physical sins

The symbols of sins
