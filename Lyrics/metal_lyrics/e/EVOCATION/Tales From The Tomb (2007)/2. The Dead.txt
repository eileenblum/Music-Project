I only observed when hordes of hell spread their
Wrath and made thee flee
I saw the flames beyond the horizon as dark shadows
Were falling from the sky

Make way for the unburied ones
Bow down salute your death
Make way for the unholy ones
Step aside here comes the dead

I too heard distant explosions
The major blasts spread ashes through the air
I heard the cries from non-believers
They sacrificed and left piled dead

I kneel down I'll join the sky
