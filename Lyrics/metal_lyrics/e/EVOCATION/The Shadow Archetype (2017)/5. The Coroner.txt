I spoke with Lucifer, he gave me light
I found my inner sight to burn so bright
I climb my walls, in my darkened womb
Last breaths for air went weak to none
Now the coroner walks outside my door
I turn into fire
Because my soul has started to glow
And I feel this desire
To let myself go and never be born again

[Lead: Exner]

Inside my soulless tomb, incarnate mass
The curtain fell and ceased my day
It stains my skin, it's full of blood
Dark fiction lives to be my only friend again
As the coroner walks outside my door
