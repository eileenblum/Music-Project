I saw a trace of your weakness, it surfaced through your smile
It was relentless, untamed and so divine

Down the tomb in the valley, we felt the trench of death
We saw some crooked vultures as they dove for flesh
On chunks from my disasters
They fight for every part
Your time is running out
I don't need no reason
You're condemned to the grave

So now your bones starts to shiver, your lips are turning blue
Distorted by the panic I forced inside of you
Cold steel in your back, blood will be split 

I am the man that hang you on a sharp meat hook
