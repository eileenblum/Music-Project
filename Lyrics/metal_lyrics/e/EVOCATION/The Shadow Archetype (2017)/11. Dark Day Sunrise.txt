So cold empire of lies
Full of black watching eyes
Valley of the dead
On crimson skies we see our sun go
Down the sewers of the truth where the joker fake wears his crown
Sound was the master of all lies, muted puppet still lived his life
Bound to the circle of the fools, heâs insane and so lost in time
Slow, the withered shaded son full of deep incisions scared for life
Here he dwells in fire
Since the dark day sunrise
Blind in the city of the deaf, the sheep are not aware of wolves
Blood on the altar of the church, blinded zombie through a misled youth
Oh, the smell of the sacrificial flesh, last in line he sees no other truth
Down on his knees was his last move, he slit open his soul for a lie
Now he dwells in fire
Since the dark day sunrise
