[feat. Vesa KenttÃ¤kumpu]I shut down as we entered the conflict zone
My fragile borders silently collapsed
Evangelists that hang up high in constant rows
The underworld has lost its sacred fence
They lost their pride and glory under a shaded sun
The opposites now known to be the blame
They lost their oracle to the lords of sins
The pillars of creation were silenced when they set them all afire
A new world has risen beyond the red eclipse
Its pragmatism illuminate what overlords has built
Sucked in to its silent orb, its everlasting blaze
We're observing the survival of the sickest
Now hail to the mortals
The children of stone
And death became their truth
When bastards rule their throne

[Lead: KenttÃ¤kumpu]

So dark this side of story and all loaded guns
The parasites now known to gained control
They killed their oracle with a dirty win
The pillars of creation were silenced when they set them all afire
