[bonus track]

Deep shadows above the black-blue sea,  
The eyes of the storm are watching me  
A murderous silence is gasping for air  
Dark clouds are resting, can't flee  

I see my breath, it's cold and clear  
My eyes show emptiness, not fear  
I feel the hungry sea around  
I slip into the muddy ground 
(this muddy street)

The silence is like a brother to me  
It gives me sense behind my mind  
I feel the hands of silence and peace  
Salvation - makes me blind

1997 Nuclear Blast
