Summer has gone and winter is near
If life means hope then hope means fear
Beloved soul...
Enslavement is close at hand

...end... end... end...

Crawl on your knees, little scum
Sanity's fool - obey your sons
Elysian wounds...
Embraced by solitude

Aahh - with cold blank eyes
Aahh - with an empty smile

(Here are) your demons
Your clandestine demons
Yearning for a sign...
Your demons
Your clandestine demons
...to sneak up from behind...
Here they are...

Aahh - with cold blank eyes
Aahh - with an empty smile

Elusive cries from a distant prey
Deceiver's LAMB in the heart of dismay... dismay...

Face all your demons
