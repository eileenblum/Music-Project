I am the fire of the earth
The inner stream of burning blood
A grain of sand - the fastest stone
I am the fertile soil below
I am dreadful like a violent gale
And gentle like a summer breeze
I am the changing, rushing tide
The tears you try to hide

You longed for me in deepest seas
On mountains high
But still you cannot...
You longed for me inside the earth
Beyond the moon
And still you cannot...

(But) I see the truth
I can see, I see right through you

I am the sun - promising life
The blue and hopeful morn
I am the waning moon above
Cold shadow of the night

Your MANIA, your greed, your anger, your conquest
Your hate and your needs - I will have none
