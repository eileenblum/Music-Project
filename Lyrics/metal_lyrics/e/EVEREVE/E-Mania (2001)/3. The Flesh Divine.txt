"Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly,
save only through the weakness of his feeble will" -Joseph Glanvill-

Someone told me there is a war within
And the wor (l) d became flesh
Someone told me about a handmade sin
Denying all you once confessed

Don't bow to me
Don't worship me
We are torn apart by silver lunacy
Because weak I am
As weak as no man has been before
Don't you pray anymore...

And you will never be the same again
(Non-believers raze the stray)
And you will never be the same again
(No longer will your faith remain)

Someone told me it is worth crying for
Any grace is built on lies
Making love with defiled angels
Your tongue in mine

I saw YOU in my darkest dreams
Gliding into a sea of snakes
I saw the flesh divine
And the flesh became spirit

FLESH!
