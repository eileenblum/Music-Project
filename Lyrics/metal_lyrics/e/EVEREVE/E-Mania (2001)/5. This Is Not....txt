When something stains your pride
And leaves you back with despite
Your vain attempts to blank it out
Troubled, in a state of doubt

Both inside and outside
Demons stalk your hide
No chance for you to get away
Without their affliction

Everything you ever wanted
They turn into hideous shards...

They are haunting your thoughts now
They are probing your soul
Examine with indifferent eyes
How you are WRITHING in shame

(But) This is not my burden
(But) This is not my cross

For it...
Keeps me away, keeps me away...
Keeps me away, keeps me away...

(But) This is not my burden
- bathe in desire
(But) This is not my cross

Eyelids open and in peace
You are staring ahead

Haunting me...
