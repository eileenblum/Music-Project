Seconds come and seconds go
In decay's silent flow
Don't you ever question me or...
You will reveal my vanity

Used as a bait for mercy
I am undignified
Why don't you dare to show me
The White Light

Kill me -
come for me, come...
Kill me!

Get me out of here... Get me out!

I am nothing more but dirt
The curse upon us all
There is no time left for piety
When the SAVIOUR takes his toll

I have never had my chance
I was never meant to be
Why don't you dare to show me
The White Light
