Across the sea, across the waves - foaming waves of time
Bound to these earthly shores we are lost - surrender to our fate... our fate
Waiting for some changing TIDE - deep inside
Will we remain forever here - alone within ourselves?

And now the tide is coming in
The rolling, crushing waves
Deep waters rising high
Take me away...

Someday
You will find the undertow - all the secret streams below
Someday
You will find the rivers flow - follow me - just let things go

Resting here inside these walls - shrouding walls within
This temple of my inner thoughts - a vanished place to stay

Rolling - crushing - deep waters rising high...
