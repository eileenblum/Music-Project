Inspired by E. A. Poe

Dear child, are you scared tonight?
Your body is trembling
Dear child, you are a tragic bride
With a blemished mind

Dear soul, I will take you
To the very ends of the earth
Dear soul I will break you
The marble BREED is mine

"Out - out are the lights - out all!
And over each quivering form,
The curtain, a funeral pall,
Comes down with the rush of a storm, ..."

Dear worm, are you strong enough?
I will defy you
Dear worm, I will rise up high
From the glowing embers

"...And the angels, all pallid and wan,
Uprising, unveiling, affirm
That the play is the tragedy, "Man",
And its hero the conqueror Worm".
