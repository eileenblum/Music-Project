Release me - don't hide in the shadows all the time
Release me - love me under a bloodred sky

Believe me - devotion purifies your mind
Believe me - leave it all far behind

Suzanne - would you die with me - Suzanne
Suzanne - whatever will be - Suzanne
Kiss me!

Mistreat me - DELIVERANCE cuts so deep
Mistreat me - just give me what I need

Suzanne - world is open wide - Suzanne
Suzanne - (but) I feel cold inside - Suzanne
So cold...

Can't you hear my calling?
Baise-moi!

Suzanne - the sky is still red - Suzanne
Suzanne - and world is dead - Suzanne

(Would you die? Would you die with me?)

Suzanne - what have we become?
