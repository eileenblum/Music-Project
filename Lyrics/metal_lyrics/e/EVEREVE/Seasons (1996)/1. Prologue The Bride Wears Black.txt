Masks concealed the real mourning
No noise were allowed
Misfortune came with large steps
Enveloped the future into a shroud

The bride wears black tonight

Valleys got deeper and deeper
The summits disappeared in beautiful
Clouds a path
In sick infinity
Deep abysses and beside it

Travelled in endless trains
Try to solve my existence
Sins, often pure temptation
Praised, hallowed, just lies [repeat]

Voices to bear, inner futility
Be it true, be it my love
Coming to torture you...
...To torture you with my devotion

[repeat 1st verse]
