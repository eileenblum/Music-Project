The phoenix

"And from the ashes a Phoenix rose - with
Wings made of gold it
Gently touched me, a touch of relief. I was
Ready to start a new
Circle, hoping it would never come to an
End.
"Never too late for hope" - the grey ice
Melted - slowly..."

SPRING

Where is my world,
The beggining of my life bound,
Surrounded by light,
Wandering aimlessly around.
Hearing voices calling my name
While I hover, world`s dark stain.

Where is my summertime?
I`m longing for its warmth,
Far too long I shivered
In winter`s icy force
Clouds are above me
Mid air caresses my lungs
I let myself drift, waiting for spring sun.

Soft grass - but it hurts to go over it,
Pointed stings - running between I stick
Brooks are roading, the water blood red
Please let me drink, but I can`t, I`m dead.

Souls are screaming, mothers and sons
Are slaughtering themselves, am I teaching
A dream...

[Repeat 1. + 2. verse]
