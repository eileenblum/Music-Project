The Dancer

"And then, with a glistening beam of vivid light,
Spring was gone and summer drew near,
Pervading our minds and our eyes were blinded with delight.
For a short moment we joined in the dance of life and
Time disappeared, leaving us behind in our embrace..."

UNDER A SUMMER SKY

The air - massive like lead
Too sultry to give, to give a sigh
Sheer unbearable she lies on me
Your love to me feels so dry

To beat - unable to move
Every attempt just a rude glide
The sweat runs on bare skin
Comes and goes like your love shine

[Repeat verse 1]

Under a summer sky of love
I see your soul above
Under a summer sky of love
Your name in my heart I`ll carve

No sleep - a total repose
The warmness pervades my blood
No wind that breathes life
A existence without you would be like being blind

You`re gone - like the summer will leave
One day it will... be over
The time slings yet slowly
Like your love from my shoulder
