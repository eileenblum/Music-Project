In a plkce where no shadows fall
I will meet you again
Below the moon and the stars
Where it all began

Where no shadows fall
We will meet again
Where no shadows fall
Where it all began

We all feel the presence
Of our destiny draw near

In this place where no shadows fall
We will have to surrender to our fears
