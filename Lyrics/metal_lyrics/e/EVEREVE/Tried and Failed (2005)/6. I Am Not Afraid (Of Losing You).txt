There's a demon inside of me
It is buried in my heart
It's a need unsatisfied
Right now it is lying in wait
Right now it is tearing me apart
This addiction to delight
When I'm left here all alone
When there is nothing to see
There is no turning back
I feel pity for myself
For all my unconscious guilt
I reveal my frailty
Time heals nothing
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid of losing you again
I'm neither grateful nor am I giving up to you
There's a frown, a perfect reproach
That is still imprisoning me
In your alabaster walls
It's impossible to fly
When you clip someone's wings
And push him on the ground
I'm not afraid of leaving you again
I' m really sorry
But I never ever needed you
Only bad dreams come true
They do!
My lips move but I hear no sound
My legs tremble 'cause I lost the ground
The king is dead, long live the king
You wouldn't think about rain in spring
