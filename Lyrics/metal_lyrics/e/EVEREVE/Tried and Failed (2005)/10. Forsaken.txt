You used to control me
No more than a puppet on a string
You used to behold me
Writhing down on the ground
Destiny is a waste of hope
Pardon my compassion
A pathetic man in a pathetic world
Each night - another needle in my skin
So look into my eyes
I'm forsaken
Let my spirit receive the light
You used to exploit me
No more than a face in the crowd
You used to terrify me
For the sake of delusion
Come with me, don't leave me now
In liquid neon chaos
Thorns of joy ignite my veins
Each day - another needle in my skin
I'm blind - Let your sterile harvest
Be reduced to dust
No faith - Let your false messiah
Testify his lust
I'm blind - When your shallow wastelands
Are redeemed by the tide
No faith - Hear the crimson choir
"Let there be light!"
Collapsing, misleading, no shelter, I'm freezing
Raising my shadows, my ruins are hallowed
You used to control me...
