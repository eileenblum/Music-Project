Before sunrise
All fears will drown in my eyes
Before sunrise
The earth will devour my cries
And I will feel an ease
I'm godless, I'm blind
I am the king of depravity
I am the slave of decay
Now insanity / serenity is closing in
I'll go my way
It's time to leave...
Before sunrise
This pleasant fiction of mine will be vaporized
Before sunrise
A deathwish will capture my mind
I'm godless
