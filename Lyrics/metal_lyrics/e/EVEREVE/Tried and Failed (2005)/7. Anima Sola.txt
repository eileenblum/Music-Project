I'm a sinner but I know
The skin is often harder than the core
I hold on
Contemptousness will follow me...
No more will the glory of grotesque
Adorn your lifeless limbs
Like an eerie arabesque
Locked in you
Anima Sola - World keeps turning
Anima Sola - World keeps burning
So burn for me / burn with me
I'm a servant of your grace
Captivated in sobriety
Why am I crawling further on?
In apathy
It's been too many words and too many lies
It's been too many years without being alive
It's been a long long road, never reaching the end
Too many wasted moments
No more will I be pushed again into your golden cage
No more will I lay my arms around your bait
