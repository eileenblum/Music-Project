Look inside me
Stare into the void
The blooms of weakness I have shattered
A broken pride lies in this broken glass
A crystal shiver
I'm starving, starving
Dance with me for the last time
Betray me like before
Sing with me for the last time
It's all about desire
Beneath the hollow
There's no will to fight
The ashen fragments of indulgence
I can't talk, I can't move
I'm out in the cold
I'm starving, starving
This misery we call our life
This senseless struggle deep inside
This paranoid disloyalty
It's all about desire
I conquered my Eden
But it was only for the blink of an eye - We've gone too far
You say you never wanted to hurt me
Always by my side
As we climbed up to the sky - We touched the sky
Betray me one more time
It's all about failure...
