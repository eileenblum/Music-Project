Scorn has come when affection has gone
A serpent queen with a filthy crown
Cover me with your scarlet tongue
Believe me, my dear
I won't let you down
Purified by supremacy I bleed
The urge to overcome this loss - save me
Those who always hunt for infinity - save me
Will be the ones on the cross
A scornful laugh remains
I can't forgive
A scornful laugh remains
I can't forget
Today is the day...
Truth is nothing but the knife in my hands
An empty look, the will to proceed - save me
The party is over when the music ends - save me
How can it taste so sweet
Today is the day
Our dreams come to an end
I share my tragedy with you
Today is the day
A scornful laugh remains
I share my tragedy with you
Now suffer with me
Scorn has come when affection has gone
