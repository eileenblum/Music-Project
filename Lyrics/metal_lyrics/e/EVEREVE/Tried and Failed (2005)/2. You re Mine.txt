Maybe crimes must be done
Your fallen prophet's on the run
Surrender to your deepest rage
Celebrate the dying age
For I am the scar in you
All is done - is done for the best
For I am the crack in you
All is done
You adored me
You called for me
Licked your wounds just for me
As light began to fade
Anxiety prevailed
I destroyed you - I am your blood
Broke your wings in two - I am deep within
Penetrating you I embraced you - I am your flesh
Took your breath away from you - I'm in your dreams
Suffocating you
You belong to me
You're mine
Maybe you just wonder why
Is all I told you worth the price?
Trust me, I will show you bliss
Caress you with my poisoned gift
I betrayed you
I mislead you
Still I hold you
Anxiety prevails
