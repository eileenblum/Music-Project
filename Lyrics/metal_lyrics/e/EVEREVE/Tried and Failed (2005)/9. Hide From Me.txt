I saw merciful deceivers in the shadow of death
They cannot break the chains
I saw consecrated mourners in the shape of a cross
Taking part in the game
It's just a game we're playing - I can't find you
Like fools we're playing - I look for you, where are you?
Despite all swearing
You made away
Why do you hide from me?
What has become of my belief?
Who'll be the one to set me free?
Why do you hide from me?
I saw admirable dictators trying hard to maintain
The burning veil of time
I saw beautiful avengers in black limousines
Saw them struggling in vain
It's more than betrayal
Much more than betrayal
Be careful what you pray for
'Cause you walked through that door
It's just a game
