Do you accuse me for my deeds?
Do you think I am just a hypocrite?
A man of contradictions I am
If everything is possible
Seize the day without regrets
A man of contradictions I am
I'm deep in your feelings - I'm breathing, breathing...
I'm deep in your thoughts - I'm bleeding, bleeding...
I'm deep in your body - I'm breathing, breathing...
I'm deep in your heart - ...in you
I won't go away
It's the rotten kiss
Of paradise - the scent of fear
It's how you feel
When you walk on thin ice
For the first time of my life
Devotion is a sacrilege
A man of contradictions I am
Though everything is possible
We're nothing more but cynical
"Per aspera ad astra" ...ad astra?
It's the guilt you see
In lovers' eyes - the hand of fate
It's how you feel
When you walk on thin ice
So dine me and wine me then 69 me
And redefine me
Again and again and again and again and again
As best as you can
