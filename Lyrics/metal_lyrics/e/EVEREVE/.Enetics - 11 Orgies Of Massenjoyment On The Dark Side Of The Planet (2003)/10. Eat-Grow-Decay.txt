What the hell should i fight for?
What the hell should i know?
What the hell should i care about?
Is there somewhere i should go?
I'm the slayer of my brother, It dosent matter much to me.
You asked me not to follow this path.
But i'm craving for more. I eat, I grow and I decay.
(Break away). I eat, I grow and I decay.
(I break away / so feed me).
Deep inside i'm feeling, my time is running out.
Deep inside i'm feeling, what it's all about.
Spinning around... I am grateful to my creator.
I still have to put up with.
You asked me not to carry this load.
But i'm craving for more. Don't trust me.
