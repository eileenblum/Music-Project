No-one seems to care about.
No-one seems to ask.
Behind this face there's wasted memory.
Caught beneath a mask.
This heart will beat another day.
This heart will lead us both astray.
Believe me... this heart will be silent (come back to me).
For all eternity/for us it's clear to see.
Now swallows your night (and put me back on track again).
And share this heart with me (forever free).
This heart. You punish me for self-respect.
Still reasoning your life. But everywhere is walking distance.
If you have time. It is mind-it is cold.
It is soul-it is cold. It is heart-it is cold.
It is love-it is cold. It is you-it is cold.
