Along... along comes a fool.
Hey now, along... along comes a fool.
Prozac-sedatives-silver shot.
Flood your brain, worship the dogs.
Tonight your shivering, filled with ease.
But life goes on the great deceit.
Razors-needles-acid prick.
Free your mind, untie the strings.
Tonight you're feeling all alone.
You're unforgiven, welcome home.
Your smile is the mirror of your fear.
(Your smile is the mirror)
Strip down for the entire world to see.
(Strip down for me).
Too long you have struggled to be sane.
(Too long you have struggled).
Beware, don't let them push you away.
It's like a snowball's chance in hell...
Your skins you prison tonight...
Hurt Me.
