Give me one more day. And i'll keep on running.
And i'll keep on hiding. I wish i could have stayed here with you.
I'm on the loose. Looking for the answers.
Looking for the madness. Once again i'll perish in doubt.
Give me one more day... another day... another night.
I'm running-running for cover.
I'm running-far, far away / for my life.
Running faster and faster and faster.
And falling. Far away.
Falling down one more day.
I need one more day. To dare my senses.
To cease from thinking.
It meant that much to me. A taste of shame.
Someone did it again. And i'll keep on hiding.
I wish i could have stayed with you.
