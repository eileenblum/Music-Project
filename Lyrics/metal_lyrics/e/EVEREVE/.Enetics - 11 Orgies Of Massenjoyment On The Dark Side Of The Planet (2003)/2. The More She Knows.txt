You saw me dancing on top of the world.
You saw me down below.
I try to fly but i might not come back again.
Do you wonder why?
Don't count on me (don't you ever).
Don't count on me (don't you ever).
Souls entwine for the very last time.
Tainted pictures occur. I can't deny it.
I can't deny what i've done.
I can't deny it... anymore. Don't count on me.
The more she knows. Don't count on me.
The more she hates me, the more she condemns me.
Now she's fed up (what have i done?).
She's fed up with all my shit.
She's really giving in. (why did i hurt you?).
She's finally had enough, She's finally had enough of it.
