Light is fading.
And she is anticipating.
The dawn of the age. The dawn of the age.
When she laughs, when she cries, When she looks up in sorrow.
When serenity dies. She longs for the sundown.
Remember when she laughs, when she cries.
Remember her time, She looks up in sorrow,
Remember her time. Serenity dies. Come back again.
Remember her time. She longs for the sundown.
Remember, white is her freedom.
God seems to hide away.
i mostly succeed in fooling myself.
And i miss you, I love you.
When she laughs, when she cries, She longs for the sundown.
It's her last summer and the heavens bleed.
Life is fading... Remember her eyes.
I still remember her eyes.
