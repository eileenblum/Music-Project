It's not my fate to ignore these vicious thoughts.
I act like a stranger, I'm not supposed to be strong.
I come undone. Don't even know where to start.
It's like a storm inside my head...
I'ts like a bad storm inside my head... I'm free... Yeah
Existence is futile cause pain is surreal / so real.
I'm free... yeah. Morality is a word i can't accept.
I'm moving in circles.
The hardest things to handle are failure and success.
They are promises worth breaking.
You have to rely on your sanctuary.
You know that you have to.
You have to rely on your mental health.
You know you have to.
