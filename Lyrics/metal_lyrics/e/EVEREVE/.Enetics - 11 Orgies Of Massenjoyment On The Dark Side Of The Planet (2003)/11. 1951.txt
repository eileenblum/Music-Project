There's something cold inside of us.
There's something empty inside out hearts.
The bitter-sweet harmony of gentle crimes.
Can't you see? it's burning.
Afraid of being honest, afraid of showing pride.
The shade of self-deception, it's rising.
A little black devil want's to be free again.
A little black devil yearns for his dignity.
Return... repent... deliver us from evil.
Open your heart, open your heart for me.
I'm on the verge of thinking but i can hardly tell.
What drives us on and on, i'm shaking.
A little black devil want's to be free again.
A little black devil yearns for his dignity.
Return - Open your arms (open up).
Repent - Await your fallen star (wait for me).
Remind - Open your heart (open up wide / and shine on).
Shine bright like the sun. It's 1951, shine on...
forevermore. Defying what i used to be.
Defying my belief, Defying what i sacrificed.
Pretending sanity.
