Hush my child, i'll stay with you.
As long as you want me to.
In all these years. I've seen them clear.
December wounds on pale skin.
I believe in you, like i always do.
I believe in you, like i always do.
Hush my child, faith is mine.
Leave all your tears behind, but speak to me.
What's wrong or right?
Remorse is just out of sight.
I know you are suffering-choking-trembling.
You cannot escape from the past.
Suffering-Choking.
You cannot escape from yourself.
Choking-Trembling.
You cannot escape from the past.
Suffering-Trembling.
You cannot escape from yourself.
Will you fall asleep tonight?
You wont fall asleep tonight...
Hush my child, i'm still with you.
December wounds on pale skin.
