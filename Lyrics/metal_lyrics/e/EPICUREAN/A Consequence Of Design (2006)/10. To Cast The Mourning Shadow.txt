And when the rain came down,
over the hills and through this valley,
the midnight moon shined down on me illuminating all that shimmers in this place.
I haven't spoken since it happened, words turn to dust in my mouth.
By tonight, bring solace
to cast the mourning shadow.
But I still see her face every moment that I'm awake.
I haven't spoken since it happened, words turn to dust in my mouth.
By tonight bring solace.
Was it the impact that broke her body? While I sat beside unscathed.
The windshield shattered from the concussion;
the class scorched my face, that burned so
I held her head by the roadside and wiped the blood from her face.
The words that, sent from her mouth, could only keep me silent.
And with the breath of those words aside, her last tear touched the pavement.
I pulled her close to my chest to hear her heart beat faster.
Her trembling voice cut through me,
will I make it through this night. I tried to conjure an answer, but my tongue had frozen.
My love, the source of my yearning, not long for this world.
I sat blindly as she slipped away and died in my arms.
The aroma of gas still soaked in my clothes, and blood not of my own.
Now at this moment, my body went numb.
All life's red lust was gone, it all dies with her that night.
All of my sins, all of my soul, all I'd given won't gain control yet I know.
All of my fears become one.
And within this tragedy I know life's fragility, burn;
that nothing remains unbroken, and forever is a myth that liars have spoken.
Dark unfolding, cast the shadow over me.
Bleak unfolding, cast the shadow of us all.
To cast the mourning shadow
