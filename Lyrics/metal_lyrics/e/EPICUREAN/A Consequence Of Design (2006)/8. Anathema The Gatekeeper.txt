Now, as the storm parted away, reveal to me his face;
the narrator of my whole world.
And as he spoke to me my soul could only tremble with each word that passed his lips.
He spoke to me, "my son, the path is yours to take.
Your purpose is greater than you'll ever know".
Now, hear these words my child of light,
understand only her soul can lead you home.
As I gazed into, the ocean of those eyes, the same blue as mine and I knew.
Without the words I needed to say,
that from my tongue would give life to this fear.
There's no time to decide, my son this is the path you chose.
Let it guide you to her and the greatness divine that awaits you
if you can overcome the world before you.
Give your life and your soul; you must not fail us the world rests on your shoulders.
And yet I feel your pain,
as though it's mine the same.
all the hurt remains,
and may not ever change.
This is, a compassionate calling to arms.
For all this time divide the distance between us both.
Along the way, fueled by the fire within your soul.
Your life is more than a consequence of design,
desire guides you towards your fate.
If I could shift the weight of the world
I would give you a choice, to turn back the time
Our lives lie within this moment, and all it's misery waits for you.
Go to her now Gabriel, deny fate and be doomed.
Now, hear these words my child of light,
understand only her soul can lead you home.
Seek her with all you have within your soul,
you'll find the answers in her hands.
What will guide my way? What will light my path?
You'll find the answers in her hands
