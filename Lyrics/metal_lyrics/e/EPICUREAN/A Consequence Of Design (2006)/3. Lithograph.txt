I've felt this presence for a lifetime,
And if you keep your silence I promise to close my eyes.
These days can't be undone, but one day you'll understand
Why I turned away.

All I ever wanted to become more than the vision of I
Yet in these moments I'll be defined

Language construct of my decline, and still I feel nothing
I've gone where death cannot follow and within those words be born again...

Will I see our temple left in ruins, in the absence of love?
Though my intentions remain,
I've severed my ties and I will pull you out from shelter,
To stand within the fire and in passing,
You'll realize the point, the cause at which my rage can know no bounds...
I've felt this presence for a lifetime,
And if you keep your silence I promise to close my eyes.
These days can't be undone, but one day you'll understand
Why I turned away.

And I have not lost my way I'll return in the shadows of our last day.
And I have not lost my way I'll return in the shadows of our last day.

I have looked upon that distance
And rely beyond my vision
I have given more than I can stand,
And I still remain until the bitter end when I stand before you.
Now it is this in which I endure to see her face in this life or the next, wherever I find my place

It's in the veins of my design, and still I feel nothing
I've gone where death cannot follow and within those words be born again...

And I have not lost my way I'll return in the shadows of our last day.
And I have not lost my way I'll return in the shadows of our last day.

I feel my focus, stray off this distance of me is it still my face,
Hidden behind the mask where I...
