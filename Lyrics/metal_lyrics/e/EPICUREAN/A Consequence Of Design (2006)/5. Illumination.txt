Upon the storm that gathers here, the torment reigns like fire on my soul.
Yet I'd cross this ocean with both eyes open wide,
and dream of the day that I set free my sorrows into your world.
And when your heart ceases to shine, I'll show you illumination;
divide the distance between I and I to regain all the strength I'd lost.
What she it's life for you and I, could endure a lifetime in our minds and in our veins.
Though the moments slowly pass that burn my soul,
I'd spend a lifetime letting go and what will remain in its place is the thought,
that I gave the world to itself to destroy.
Upon the storm that's gathering, rides a lifeless burning god like me
dying to divide the soul from life and cast the darkness aside.
Yet through it all, words of passion crumbling within my grasp.
My angel of darkness, spread your wings.
You're mine this time; when I decide.
Now, take my hand as our life burns away turn to dust
When your heart ceases to shine, I'll show you illumination
divide the distance between I and I to regain all the strength I've lost along the way.
As the moments slowly pass, that burn my soul
Through it all, words of passion crumbling within my grasp,
and fall as ashes at my feet. My angel of darkness spread your wings, you're mine this time,
when I decide.
And fly, on crimson wings towards the sun.
We are, no longer children of this earth.
The light would cast a shadow over us both, before our willing eyes.
So, now as my life has turned away, what remains is the fire in its place.
I know the time is ticking by. Time will change us. Time will run.
Upon that storm that's gathering rides a lifeless burning god like me
who would divide the soul from life to turn the darkness aside and when your heart ceases to shine
I'll show you all illumination, the further lights us all. Illumination cast a shadow. Illumination cast it over me. So if I could gather life, I would stand there as I am: as lifeless, burns away.
