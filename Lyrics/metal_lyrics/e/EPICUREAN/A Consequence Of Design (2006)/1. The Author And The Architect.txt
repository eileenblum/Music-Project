With this pen,
I use invoke to describe how it felt
in wanting to have you again and again.
I'll hold my breath as our world comes undone
and catch the bullet if you hold the gun.
Now, life waiting for words to define
how to repair the seams of my soul.
Because of you, the architect still sleeps.
A consequence of design, that life will not pass by.
What has been said
of a yearning that stands as high as mountains
became of glimpse of a time to lose myself.
And I'll hold my breath as our world comes undone
and catch the bullet if you hold the gun.
Now if only that passion within myself could command the conflict between us both.
The beautiful denial forced me to stay;
I can not let go.
Even when my body's broken,
long before my soul fades away.
If I gave all control,
the destructive love we hide will be defined in the shadow of mourning to come
Where I stand free before life
for the first time I'll bask in its glow with all of my soul
