Light the dawn, realization unfolding
That this tortured mind is unworthy yet inside this light
I spoke the words that severed barriers of silence
And though at times I may suffer, I never lost the perception
as a result, forced to witness horrors that most cannot imagine
though I command the armies of forever, I only dream of death
to exude the emptiness I felt, as eternal youth birthed its gift.
And when the passion falls away
only madness remains in the eyes that navigate the darkness
and when you scream your tears run dry
all the light you gave soon fades my darling
Days that stretched on for a lifetime
Only in death unite us both
these words live on in my craving for everlasting life to shine through me
now my soul has been torn into, subtle pieces of a memory
I soon take flight through the burden of the burden is eternity
I'll tear them down, utter words I've been longing to speak
so, to unleash, of the burden that slips off my tongue
the end that draws us on, drawing closer with each passing moment
the light you cast is mine, in this lightless chasm
Unyielding malice overtaking, seeps into my soul to seek forgiveness
may this path lead the way to find the end of all those memories I hold dear
lie in ruin ashes at my feet
Now I'm a witness, to the destruction of another
a witness to the demise of me
and all the anger left consuming won't set me free from its grasp
the blood in my veins flows like sand, through my heart and out of my hands
fill the burden of life, this life isn't mine
I'll tear them down, utter words I've been longing to speak
so, to unleash, of the burden that slips off of my tongue
the end that draws us on, drawing closer with each passing moment
the light you cast is mine, in this lightless chasm
