Now, I'm ready upon the journey,
with my eyes open wide.
A journey across the distance, though I'm so terrified,
to discover the failure in time and challenge the course of my world
if only the sound of your voice sustains.
Only between the lines of broken denial,
you'll find me lying trapped under the weight.
Dear Ana, my whole life to find you
if you would only help guide my way.
Just, light the course because I need you
more than ever now beside me through constant fear,
before I get lost again.
Watch over me from wherever you might be
and I promise that I will not fail you.
Give me acceptance of all to understand the past
now I'm stronger than rage and I won't bend or falter again.
I became of this fate, and so my heart let go
just guide the course of my hands, across a great, unknown world.
Like I was, I became again, to the deepest fraction of myself.
Speak to me the distance now, of life, the consequence I must accept.
As I, will descend on the world with the fury of the soul.
Mine was the way, before life relinquished my control.
The war inside my mind will soon become all the world
in victory divine
Ready to cross the distance, though I'm so terrified
To journey beneath the sunset, with my eyes open I'll
give life to the choice if I'm wrong, but without you I cannot last
beyond the burden that hangs at my soul because
Only between the lines of broken denial
You'll find me lying, trapped under the weight
Dear Ana, my whole life to find you,
if you would only help guide my way.
Dear Ana, I need you by my side,
to guide me through the darkest of days
