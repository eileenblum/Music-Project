Behind these eyes, fearful of failure;
depart towards a new world to find her and stand before her like a god on high with my arms wide.
And I will shift the tides at my willing to step through the fire.
My world defined, who I've become.
Yet I cannot allow the distance before me,
to have me completely.
These could be the last words I speak.
But all that matters is that you hear me
when I scream, call out your name
as I depart from this place.
Our time will come, when our world's undone. To all divine, it's in the tides.
In focus, I can see for miles, though our lives divide.
Though you and I are not the same, in time with the tides we both can change.
I have dreamt of this day,
I just wish I could stay in the wake of the day and remain unchanged.
If I cross the distant divide, light the way over me.
Though hopeless I won't refrain from the course.
The tides are shifting in my favor and all that lies before me is clear.
Give me the strength for the journey carry on towards...
I'll walk that line until the end of time.
Until I stand beside you Anna.
Through these darkest days that last forever, I will suffer by your side.
Though you and I are not the same, in time, with the tides we both can change.
I have dreamt of this day. I just wish I could stay, in the wake of the day and remain unchanged...
