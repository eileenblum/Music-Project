I've tried for so long to understand, my course of design.
These years I fear I've lost all of myself, without all hope to return yet, I'd walk to the ends of the earth in defiance.
The Narrator speaks in a precious tongue, of these days to come, but I will not stop until I stand by your side.
In our darkest days I hold the strength to carry on, as long as you stand within my line of sight.
The silence becomes the catalyst of my madness, and this may be the only way to unleash words I've tried to speak for so long.
Insight will guide the course of my willing hands upon, when all that I've known, will not support the weight of the world at all...
These are the days I've longed to define, beyond words, yet through my existence I've realized what I can't understand...
In our darkest days I hold the strength to carry on, as long as you stand within my line of sight.
These are the moments I've longed for to break the silence on the darkest of days...

In our darkest days I hold the strength to carry on, as long as you stand within my line of sight.
These are the moments I've longed for to break the silence on the darkest of days...
These are the moments I've longed(longed for) for to break the silence on the darkest of days...
