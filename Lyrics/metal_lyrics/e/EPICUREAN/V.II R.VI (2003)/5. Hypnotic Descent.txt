These journey's live in demon's eyes, a fall from grace ensues
Victimized in lies, too blind to see the truth
Eyes deceiving my mindless soul
Though carved in fire the ashes burn
Sins awaken now heed their toll
My life has taken a twisted turn
Unearth the madness from where evil lies
This is the epoch my dreams had died
Damned in chaos like falling leaves
Through twilight wonders lie memories
The past awakens, our lives been spent
Hypnotic cycle the world descends
A breathing shadow appears in the night
To defile this haven in blind reverence
As the great storm enraptures the beast
The servants of darkness emerge
Symbolic cantations pierce the frozen sky
The covetous ones, ardent yet desolate
Are disguised to man as the gods of second chance
Starlight erodes the mystery unfolds
The blessed and the cursed have transpired
The serpent of sin eludes prophetic lies
Through chasms and ruins I wander alone
Abhorrent dementia possesses my frail mind
Does light exist forlorn in the mist,
My eyes have assured me of nothing
Reality? Deception? Serenity fails to rise!
The shape of a frozen child lies bleeding in bliss
Withered, he speaks of a thousand nightmares
"All that you've seen is only a dream,
a sign of what could befall.
The world shall cease to find eternal salvation
I dreamed this winter of worlds unknown
Beyond the ages of lunacy
Screams formed terror, cold and alone
My life had passed me slowly by
