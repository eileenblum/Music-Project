Diluted in Animosity-A war grows within
Engulfing every clean and pure memory
It instills a dream, revealing a struggle
My voice is no longer mine
Psyche and logics are ripped from inside
An ocean of galling memories
A heart to display, beckoning delusions
My path to guidance
My palace awaits
Dreams bound by a song of silence
Forever caress bitterness
Alluring nights have unveiled
The pertinent rain
An ounce of pain...
Twisted mental portrayal of my thoughts-Short time
The repercussions of solitude
And the war rages on...
The demons have taken control
My will wanes slower still
I feel the nothingness shadow my soul
Forever I'll wander hell
An ocean of galling memories
A heart to display, beckoning delusions
My path to guidance
My palace awaits
Dreams bound by a song of silence
Forever caress bitterness
Alluring nights have unveiled
The pertinent rain
Dying inside....
The war is over
Psychecide
For I'm no longer...
What has bled will sow
For I am mesmerized
Prophetic visions of a long awaited self-demise
Still a willingness
To gain imperial might
The final candle flickers showing never-ending light....
An ocean of galling memories
A heart to display, beckoning delusions
My path to guidance
My palace awaits
Dreams bound by a song of silence
Forever caress bitterness
Alluring nights have unveiled
The pertinent rain
Blur the desolate mindset
Scintillation fades as contingency reigns
Relentless still the stigma burnt into my lore
Overthrow the past ardent retention awaits
