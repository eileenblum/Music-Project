We're gathered here tonight
All together we stand bt the side of lake
Remembering our journey

Endless water
Guided by the stars
Remembering the long cold nights
Endless water
Relentless sun
Or whipped by rain in the storms so fierce
But now here we stand by the lake
The lake of blood
The lake of Hunger

The mirror of the lake
The doorway to the Gods
Blood is everywhere
Sacrifice for a safe return
Horse, sheep, gold and slaves
All offered in the lake
The lake of blood
The lake of hunger
