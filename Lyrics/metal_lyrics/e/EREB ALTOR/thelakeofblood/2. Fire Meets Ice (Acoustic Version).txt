The cold mist in the land of shadows
Burning heat in the land of fire
The birth in a gaping hole where fire meets ice

Building the sleeping giant of rimfrost
Ymer, the father of the rimthurs awaken
by the fire of Muspelheim
Giving life to all kinds

Betrayal, defiance, act of Gods
Three gods, Ve, Vile and Oden, the slayers of Ymer
Drowning in blood
Destroying his heirs

Hatred was born
Born by blood, fire and ice

A world build by the flesh of the father
Surrounded by the ocean of blood

The sky, up high, carried by the four
North, South, East and West
The skull of the giant placed by the black elves
