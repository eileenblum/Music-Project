The god of truth and light with the power to heal
Loved by all he was
Protected by the oath of no harm nor death

Dreams of fright haunting at night
He saw his own demise
The one eyed god, he has forseen [x2]

The loss of truth, the loss of light
The end of all is coming soon
The one eyed god, now he knew [x2]

Mother of concern casting a spell of protection
Immortal now he is
Fire, water and stone on his side

The old woman in disguise scheming and plotting for his demise
A blind arrow piercing his heart
The world will fall with the truth and the light

The death of Balder, his ride down to Hel
Promises from everything of all nine worlds was not enough
Goddess of the underworld, Hel, please release him

Hel said âAll must cry in despair, I need all those tearsâ

The loss of truth, the loss of life
The long winter is coming soon [x3]
