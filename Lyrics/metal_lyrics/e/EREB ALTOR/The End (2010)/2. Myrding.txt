My weak cry sounding deep down from below
A sound of another world, so fragile
I'm telling a story of a destiny
So devastating, my soul can not rest
Murdered by the womb in cold blood
Shame forcing the mind and the will
A crime above all crimes
Never baptized, nor nursed

My vengeance will strike hard
All sinners must pay the price
Blood of their own blood
Mother descending down to hell

Please give me a name
Please give me my peace
Bury my body
Deep down in the dark soil to rest

Unwanted, left alone
Starving, rotting, screaming
Until the silence comes
Leaving the flesh
Where's the drink of life
Help me to find the well
Blood from the core
Lifeblood turns to death

Please give me a name
Please give me my peace
Bury my body
Deep down in the dark soil to rest

Say my name
Please save my soul
Bury me
In the dark soil to rest
