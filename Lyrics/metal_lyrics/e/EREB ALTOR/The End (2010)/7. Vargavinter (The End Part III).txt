The extreme long cold of Fimbul has weakened the chains of Fenris
All the signs are telling that the time of RagnarÃ¶k is near

The time of the Axe is here
The time of the Final War is here

Fimbul winter is coming upon us
Followed by winter and winter again
Brothers fighting against their own
So is the prophecy told by Odin up high

The time of the Axe is here
The time of the Final War is here

The Ground will burst and unleash the wolf
With his jaws open wide devouring all
The snake from the see is crawling up on land
See the blade of fire from Muspelheim

The time of the Axe is here
The time of the Final War is here

The sound of Heimdals horn, over the lands
The time has come, the time of the wolf
Gods awaken by, the sound of the horn
Beasts against gods, blood and steel
Brother will turn on brother, backstabbing their own
Apples of Idun falls, with them all will fall
The dagger of shadows, deceiver's blade
Silence is spread, all is lost
