After Balder has fallen and the attempt to bring him back from Hel has failed
The long winter of Fimbul was going to strike hard just like Odin has forseen

A wind blows through the trees
The moon shines through the clouds
The black Nordic sky brings sorrow
It's so cold and darker than before

The gods of the Nordic sky fear this winter is the one
The snow is raging down
Covering all signs of life

The birds are gone
Only shadows remains
Silence sweeps out over this frozen land
A tragic curse lies here
The cold black winter over forsaken fields
Nothing can disperse it

The sun can not be seen no more
In ages it's gone behind dark clouds
A tragic cure lies her, the cold black winter
Over forsaken fields, lasting until the end
