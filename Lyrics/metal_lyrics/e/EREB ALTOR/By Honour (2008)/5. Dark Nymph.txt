I heard the voice from the woods
A song of tunes from another world
A melody so seductive
Bewitched I became

Walking in some state of dreams
Towards this vioce enchanted
Deep into the dark forest of doom
The music is greeting me
The shape of beauty standing
In the line of my eyesight
Then she vanish shadows
Raising pulse makes me run
Over sticks and stones I run
In this maze of sighing trees
Just like they have witnessed 
This so many times before
The dark nymph of the forest

Deceiving and fair all at once
Laughing and teasing through the night 
Luring me from my sanity

Now I am lost in this magic dream
The night consumes my mind
All I think of is finding my love
As I fall down to the ground
