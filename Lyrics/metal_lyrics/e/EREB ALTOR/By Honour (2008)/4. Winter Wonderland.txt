Endless plains of snow ice and cold
Eternal land no sun at all to warm
All alone lost left to die
Don't know where to go in this frozen hell
Winter wonderland lost in this hell of ice
Icy plains everywhere gone in this frozen hell
Darkness in my eyes
my think about a world of light
Knowing my death will come freezing to death
