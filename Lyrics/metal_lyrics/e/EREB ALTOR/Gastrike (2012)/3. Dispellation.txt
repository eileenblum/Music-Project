Unholy seed, unholy breed
Poisonous death
Escaping from shame

She died alone in silent misery
The pain and loss of her newborn love

Her soul will never ever rest
See her pale face in the window so dark

The man of the church prays for her soul
The power of  God has failed again

Her haunting shadows still remains
Unstoppable powers from beyond

She died alone in misery
The pain and loss of her newborn love

The wisdom of the woman from the old age
The old ways of spirits and ghosts
Bury all traces of the newborn child
And she will leave you be
