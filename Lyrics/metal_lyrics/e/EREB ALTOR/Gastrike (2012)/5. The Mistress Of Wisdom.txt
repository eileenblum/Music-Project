A castle that holds goodness and wealth
Stands tall at the shore
In the land of the hammer
A mistress of wisdom so bright
And knowledge so fair
She Rules without fear
And without any despair
A castle of darkness at the other side of the river
With all of the trees tied to the blood 
Of the dark lady of total deceit
With a hunger for trophies
She sweeps through the lands to retrieve
Damned are the ones brave in their heart 
Who disobeys her command
In a gathering of power the two mighty ones
Finally have to meet

Darkness and greed is nothing compared 
To the wisdom and knowledge she said
The light is too strong for the dark to prevail
Deprived of her pride her defeat
Degraded she crawl back to her chamber
Biding her time in the shadows 
A seed of hate is starting to grow
Practice her dark arts to gain strength

The trees that she once gave her blood to be grown
Withered away to the ground
Strengthened her power and clouded her mind
Vengeance is all that she seeks
Hate has been growing in the past seven years
Building an army of darkness 
The white mistress hear the sound of the steel 
The sound of war inside the castle walls

Her inner eye can see
The day has come
The day of misfortune

She burn all the corners of her castle to fall
Upon the white horse she ride 
Escape from the darkness and flames

The winter so long tearing her skin
A ride from her home never to return 
The river she must cross
Warriors of the dark is at her heals
The breaking of the ice on a river so fierce
Seals her destiny, the world is in tears
