He was hiding behind four doors, north and south east and west
But there is no escape from his sins and his betrayal will be redeemed
One of his sons forever condemned to the shape of the greatest of wolfs
Destined to take his brother's life
The deceiver shall repent
Chained down to the three mighty stones bound by the chains of flesh
A poisonous snake above with an andless stream of venom tearing his face apart
Damned by all but his beloved, Sigyn is always by his side
She will ease his torment and pain with her cauldron of relief
The ground will shake along with his pain and wrath
Bound until the day of days
