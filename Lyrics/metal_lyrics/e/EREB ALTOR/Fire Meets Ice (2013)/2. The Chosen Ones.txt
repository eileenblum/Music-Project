From the black water we once came
Out on this water we will go
Ask and Embla, the chosen ones
The wise god gave us the breath of life
The god of wish gave us our mind
The god of holiness gave us our vision
Ask and Embla, the chosen ones
The gods gave us shelter and hope
In the castle of MidgÃ¥rd we thrive
The sons and daughters of the chosen ones
To the Gods we hail for them to grant us our strength
Our songs still echoes within the mighty halls of stone
Surrounded by the great ocean on the shore we stand proud and tall
And for glory and for longing we will search throughout the mighty Ash
