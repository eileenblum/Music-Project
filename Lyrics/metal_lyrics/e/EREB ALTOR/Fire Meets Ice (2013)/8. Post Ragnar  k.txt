Under the blackened sun the earth is drowning 
Stars burst into flames, falling
The mist, the fire, the heat touches the sky
All chains are broken, all seals are open
the world rises a second time
A new beginning
Resurrection of truth and light
Beneath dwells the snake of shadows
The shimmering cold snake
Will we succeed where the mighty has failed
To follow the true path
Beware of the cold that dwells in the dark
Waiting, longing for our sins
