Beware of the northern wind
Sacrifice to the mighty eagle
To spare our skin and bone
His cold wind that pierces through all

Shores of longing
Winter's gone
Guide us,
Sons of Oden
Ruler of the sky
Protect us
Don't take us
Down below

We set our sails
Our journey has begun
The mighty sea seals our fate
Waves so strong carries the dragon ship

Shores of longing
Winter's gone
Guide us,
Sons of Oden
Ruler of the sky
Protect us
Don't take us
Down below

To arrive in foreign land
To conquer, to trade
To depart from foreign land
Leave the shores in flames
To Nifelheim
They will travel
The cold waste land
Of the Ninth World
In Nifelheim
They will suffer
The wrath of the Snake
Of the Ninth World

Those who stand against us
Will fall by our hand
Send them down the river cold
To the shore of the dead

To Nifelheim
They will travel
The cold waste land
Of the Ninth World
In Nifelheim
They will suffer
The wrath of the Snake
Of the Ninth World
