Behold our land, our land of the North
Our legacy to keep untouched
The lakes are so clear
The forests, our dark forests
A nocturnal beauty that takes the breath away
The silence cries
The winter, the absence of the sun
Fires burning bright through our darkest nights
Fires burning bright within our hearts
