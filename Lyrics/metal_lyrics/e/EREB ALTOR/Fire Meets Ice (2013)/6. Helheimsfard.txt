Nine nights he ride through valleys of darkness
No light, nor shadows for nine nights so black
The river so fierce kills all the sounds
The bridge he must cross, the bridge of the dead
The path to Hel where only the pale can pass
The gates of Hel where only the dead can pass
Carry me Sleipner fast as the wind
Fly Sleipner, fly over the gates
To enter the halls of death
To enter the dead ones fate
To enter his brothers grave
To enter for his return
All must weep, all must sacrifice
Their tears of life for his return
