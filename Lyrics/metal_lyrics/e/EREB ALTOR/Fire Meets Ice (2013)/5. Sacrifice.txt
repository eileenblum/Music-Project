Sacrifice his left eye
Sacrifice for the well of wisdom
Sacrifice, the ash so old
Sacrifice, Oden's galow
Sacrifice nine long nights
Sacrifice, baptized in blood
The runes he found, the runes of power
Nine are the magic songs
Learn the nine magic songs to cease the power of the runes
The mead of wisdom, the tounge of poetry
And to speak with the dead with Miner's head
The magic runes, the ancient spell must be read and written from the heart
The scars of the runes are filled with blood
And not to fall a sacrifice must be done
