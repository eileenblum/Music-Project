Rebirth on the north side
Unsacred ground
A repenter of sin
A black shaped raven

Screams in the night
A rapid low flight
From east to west
From dusk till dawn

Full moon is rising
Over dark forests
The sound of the wings
Across black waters

Screams in the night
A rapid low flight
From east to west
From dusk till dawn

The sound of the wings
Across black waters
To the grave of christ

Nattramn

Over dark forests
Escaping daylight
Finding the rest
Releasing the soul

Screams in the night
A rapid low flight
From east to west
From dusk till dawn
