White landscapes in our memories
The cold hunger we have endured
Embracing the lukewarm winds
We hail our Gods we will prevail

Let us chant all through the night
In the never setting sun's light
Nine magic songs to the Gods up high
Then raise we our chalices up to the sky
We will sacrifice, we will not fall
Frej and Freja, please hear our call

The golden disc have now returned
Sol has escaped from the wolf
Blood sacrifice to our Gods
To keep the winter far away

Let us chant all through the night
In the never setting sun's light
Nine magic songs to the Gods up high
Then raise we our chalices up to the sky
We will sacrifice, we will not fall
Frej and Freja, please hear our call
