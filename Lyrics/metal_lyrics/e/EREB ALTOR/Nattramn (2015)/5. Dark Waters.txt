He is born unpure
With no humanity
He is deported
To the underworld
Beneath the surface
Of the darkest of waters
He is condemned to solitude
With dark eyes of envy

Abandoned, alone, eternal

He is one with dark waters
He is born of Lilith,
He is one with the dark
A legacy so old

His despise is so strong
For the ones who walks above
He is inviting them down
Beneath the black surface
With its dark reflections
The sound of his violin
Tunes from the dark world
A Deadly invitation

Abandoned, alone, eternal

He is one with dark waters
He is born of Lilith,
He is one with the dark
A legacy so old

The legend speaks of a song so old
A melody no one can resist
A song of dance and demise
Follow him beneath the dark

The legend speaks of a man so old
A dark creature no one can resist
His magic will control your mind
He will lead you beneath the dark
