It's back on the stary throne of chaos
It's back for the hunting mankind
It's back to arrange a new bloodbath
Incarnated in hate and wrath

We walk the path of the primordial Serpent
Watch its formations through the years
Bringing terror upon the fates of the weak
Lamps to the slaughter
The cry of men before the end

We provoke the race of the fallen
We have kept the best for our end
You feel sorry for your life
The lives you never enjoyed
but always wept for

It feels no sorry for the corpses
It smells your filthy burning flesh
It's back to hunt you oh mankind
Back on the throne where it belongs
The stary throne of chaos
The Enshadowed throne of hate
