I cut my flesh in pieces
I scattered my consciousness
I blew my mind, my essence
I will die later...
Somewhere, somehow

Until then I am the reason 
to butcher, to judge, to cut the throne
I will never get to know you
I don't need that permission
I just devour, it is fantastic

Untouchable levels of pleasure
The stars!
I'm going to cry: I'm free!
Dressed in blood
