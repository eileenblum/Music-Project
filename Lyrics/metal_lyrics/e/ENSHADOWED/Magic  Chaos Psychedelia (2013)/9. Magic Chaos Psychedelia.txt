It's a black star, dark star
A higher state of consciousness
A glimpse with the eyes of the insane
Vision through frames
the living paintings

It doesn't matter
I'm of no matter
Just vision
A sense pulled and drowned
in the horizon black and forth
I feel the living colors

I put together the fragments of reality
Puzzled left comforted in paranoia
Will it end soon or this is what it always has been?

This is magic
It's the awareness that chaos is my home
My only home and my astral endless
Beautiful prison
That's Magic Chaos Psychedelia
