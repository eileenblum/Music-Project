People just die, so you ate next.
This is the plan of the great magnet
The plan of the big black
Surrender your fate in the airy hands of infinity

I'm the nihilist, the order of empty space.
I'm the preacher of meaningless aims and oblivion
I'm the chessboard for the narcissist pawns made of flesh
That hung over the endless cold abyss

Where you're going there's no life human
No smell of death, no laughter of cry
Trust the void, totally fucking nothing
I am Charon, human! I'm your dream and your nightmare
Your happiness and fear 
What you were, you are, you'll always be
And I'm your every tined thought, the shiver of your body
But also the algorithm, the great concept
that runs your universe and all the other
There are no boundaries between my self and all

Oh! Deranged!
The epitome of the perplexed theories of Nihil and the unified one
This is the abstract zero
The essence of paranoia

People just die so you are next.
We'll find our way through the coffin
We yearn to find ourselves in the heart of space
We'll find ourselves in the nothingness of the void
