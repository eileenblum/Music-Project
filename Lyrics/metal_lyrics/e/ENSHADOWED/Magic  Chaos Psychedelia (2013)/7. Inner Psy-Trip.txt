Taken there where the line ends
Where the empire of nothing is devouring
all spirit all space and time
Take me there where desperation reigns
and silence in your mind is thick and absolute
Like darkness in the bottom of the frozen oceans
Beyond there is only your black cold immaterial self

And there I float between the stars
Leaving my screams behind
I can see my essence breathe and whirl
With the winds of fate, staring at all beauty
Turn to ash and then in colors again
The conception and decomposing
Daughters to prince death and queen existence
Dance and laugh in front of my eyes
Giving me the worlds in my hand
To admire and to abhor

Speechless, terrified, alone
The expansion of an atomic and universal soul
That fears the astral paths of heart
That fears the sweet smile of death
The warm human touch
The dead hand of the beast

Give me the worlds in my hand
To admire and to abhor
