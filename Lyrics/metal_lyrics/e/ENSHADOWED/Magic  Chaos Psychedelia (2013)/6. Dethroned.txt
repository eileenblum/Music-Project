Manifested, bloodstained
Ingrained, I breathe in depths

Formless, incorporeal
Paranormal
I release the hell's waves

Everything will be accumulated
Everything will be minimized

We will plague god
Whipping him with snakes
And the leper souls
The snake's venom taste

Everything will be accumulated
Everything will be minimized
Everything surrounds me unhealthy
Stigmata of this dethronement

Spill bloody tears on the face of god

Be the meaning of the unproclaimed knowledge

As you enter the new world
where the creator is inexistent
And the blasphemies are evidence of the artless
