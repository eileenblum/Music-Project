Learn your place in this space
Learn your place in this time
Embrace the universal law of the jungle
That applies in every aspect of being
Let the mind and soul float there
Where ÏÏÏ and ÏÎºÏÏÎ¿Ï fornicate
Giving birth to zero, to nothingness
Love and hate between the stars, to all energy

But accept this! Accept it!
We are not humans
We're the bastard sons of constellations
Kings from the black holes
Stardust of the death planets
Wormed of the lowest pit
Glorified Gods of the fallen
Parody is in our blood

Always lurk in shadow and blast always the suns
Filled with divine energy and fire at heart

But accept this! Accept it!
We are not humans
We're the fallen
We're the glorified outcasts
Touched by the sweet frozen smile of death
And we preach the unheard truth of life
To start is to end
All is nothing and nothing will be 
Always lurk in shadow and blast always the suns
Filled with divine energy and fire at heart

To start is to end
All is nothing and nothing will be
