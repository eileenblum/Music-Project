[Lyrics by Snegodron]

Groundless book of apostles
Their lies make us detest you god
Our dark hate will distort your faces
Christian cunts awake, prepare for failure

Your religion is a disgusting fraud!!!

I will always be recalcitrant to your commands!
I will always be in contrast to your advices!

Your are trapped by your religion
Enjoy life with its true pleasure
What paradite invaded your mind?
You believe in a religion based on an ancient story!

Liar...Failure...Liar.....Failure
Liar is the name of your god
Failure is the name of your christ
We scowl and spit at the christian icons of misery
We are very powerful to get your assistance

Your religion is a disgusting fraud!

Weakness only weakness is your sickness
I engrave your bodies with the sharp knife

I will never let you enter my mind
My spiritual fields are very strong
Your paradise will be desecrated
God your weakness is so prominent

Liar... Failure
