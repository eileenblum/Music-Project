[Lyrics by Snegodron]

Sucking your sanity, raping your presence
Destroying your will renovate mine
My domination upon you has begun
You realise that you are nothing exceptional

You hear your destiny speak: "Decadence will come for you"
My hate has know revivified.
The escaping can't be fulfilled.
I will prevail over you
I have attain!!!

You eyes are sewn shut
You feel now the pain
Which I cause to you
I am inside your mind
Can you touch me???

As you conform to the blackness of my thoughts
As is the horror and fear I see in your eyes
As is no escaping from this dominion of unpropitious reflections
Death comes and life fades, you lay now in the bottom of my
Hate - sence, guardhouse

You have filled a small part of that
I will never stop consuming you wishes
I am the messenger of the darkest dawn
Now you'll never see the light again

Mental irruption!!!!!!!!!!!............
