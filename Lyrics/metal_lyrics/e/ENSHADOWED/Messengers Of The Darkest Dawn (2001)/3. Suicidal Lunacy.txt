The malice of being alive
Your dark hidden desire, winner
The lust for another life
It' s the rebirth of your soul
A release in an other world
Here's a body for death
A soul to become a part of space
Watch the mortals from higher

See the filthy world and laugh
Fake life... you want to kill and die
You want to touch the face
Of the other side

You want to be an eternal king
Only feeling your serenity
You want to begin the eternal journey
Through the silent path of death

Exstasy of madness

World has been a place so mournful,
Man became a thing,
Laughter has been a secret weapon,
Life is just a dream

Death will reap it's way
But only for the insects
May suicide become
The expanding blessed disease...
