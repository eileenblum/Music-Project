From the coldest pit of genesis
From an empty (and unlimited) prophecy
I 'm coming searching
To satisfy my thirst

From your worst darkened dreams
From your deepest pain
I'm coming out
Your poor souls to lacerate

I need your blood
I cause your terror
I spill your brains out
Oh.......... I eat your flesh

I enjoy the ugly age with it's true rules
I enjoy what is called life through deaths kingdom

I flay your souls
I spit my venom
I feed the virus
Which make you pigs

The precious crown of obliquity, the entire parody of life
The minimum torment of a fist certifies your unexpected journey

I command the enslavement of every human life
Enslaved and tied from the great tongue of sickness
