Rape the human race

War... destroy the pigs of emptiness and despair
Fire and destruction... the millenniums of reprobation
Crush the grave... oxygen of lies, emerald polluted brains
Eminence of paranoia-paradise of the dead

Everything sorrounded by flames
Dead christian bodies cover the land
The demons control the human destruction
And hold us with their unholy blessing
With axes and swords in our hands
We' re fighting for mankinds execution

...Rape the race

Now that your morals choke your throats
Your god was burned between your churches
Rotting humanity, like a palsied army
Your god has failed, your god has failed...

Holy virgins drowned in vomit
The blasphemous lightning breaks out
Hail the unholy crime against humanity
The unending world war and damnation

Death fuckin' death
Pure demotion is your guide
Death fuckin' death
A funeral without escape
Death fuckin'death
The end already has it's shape
Death....
The termination of your pity faith

Oh......
Our prays is the bloody revelation
The screams of the immortals
The song of the last funeral
We have invoked the greatest curse
We have deepened the roots of madness

The end is here to teach the war
To those that tried to wake him,
Is here to push on the putred face of humanity
Into the dark blood of it's own secret heart
