As I remember the times of the past
My soul is traveling through centuries
Floating in the ages of the wastelands
I arrive in the castles of my memories

In the times when the mountains was the masters of my dreams
In the times when the forests was the leader of my dark desires

I know onetime I was a dark knight
In the lightless years my shadow traveled
Like the wind seeding the fear valiantly
Under the black cold imposing clouds

I know I was a dark knight
Having my sword dressed in blood
Blood of those I hunt
My thoughts belong to the glorious times
When wolves and witches had showed me the dark paths
And I will always think the dark ages
As a grim black hellish knight

On the horse of bravery
I am the punisher of those who bring the light
I am a knight of hell, my goal is their demise
Unleashing torture with the hatred on my shield
I am the punisher without a heart of fear
I will always be an avenger knight
Under the bless of the blacken years

I still raise high the flag of revenge
In the name of darkness and my enemies death
I hear the wispers of the northern winds
Recalling my soul to wake the battles song

I will always be an avenger knight
Under the bless of the blacken years
I will always follow the blackness of my heart
To blame humanity for all those wasted tears

Northbound...
