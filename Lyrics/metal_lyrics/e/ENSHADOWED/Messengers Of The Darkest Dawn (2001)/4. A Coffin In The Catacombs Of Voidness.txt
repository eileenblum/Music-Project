Conspiracy of idols and wasted thoughts
Creeping plans to nothingness
Left in paranoia, empty brains
You forgot to remember

Execution of christianity
The righteous will of honor that remains
I am a flame of a burning church
I am a flame...

Fury enragement only for you
The seas of a fiction I derange
Oh... what you've destroyed...
The black hammer will crush you
The black hammer will crush you

The ultimate power of the snakes venom
You will never escape from the cage
In the middle of nowhere, suffer
I' ve got the keys of mercy

Lust for life, forever damned

I take you
In a cemetery beyond death
And I throw you in the coffin of perdition
You, the holy angels of unreality
