You've lost your attention from the meaning of life
You're trying to teach me what's wrong and what's right
Your future is ending behind the blindness of hope
With no more achievements confuse your control

You're living in chaos, believing your god
See through the vast, you're trapped in your world
Your stupid ideas are locked in your head
Abusing your thoughts, your mind is now dead
Your negative prospects are hiding the truth
Die fucking victim in the bottom of doom
You think that you live in the grace of humanity
You'll never find truth to face the eternity

Priests and nuns with your fuckin' cross
Now you're hanged from satan's cock
Finally you fall before him

As your cross is inverted through your ass

Christian pigs in their vileness
Even now beg for their inexistent innocence
Accused from destiny confounded to the fire of hell
Confounded to the fire of time
Confounded to the fire of time

This will be the end
Of a sorrowful life
You've lived for us to let you
To the fierce daemons of hatred
You are the red target on our lives
And the shots of our guns bring you the end now

Drink the eternal darkness
Bow and die on your knees
As we laugh now that you realize your fake life
The lie of the cursed nazarene
There is no god on your bloodcovered eyes
There is no god and your stories are dead
