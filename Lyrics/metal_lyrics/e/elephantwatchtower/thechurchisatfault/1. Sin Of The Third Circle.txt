March
Charge
Towards the altar of your fallen god
Come
And gorge your taste for human waste
Submerge
Splurge
Just one more bite, your dearest vice
Converge
Serve
The gluttonous feast among the circle

Your disease is delusion
You're conscious of your choices
Whose hand fed you the poison?
The gluttonous crave their torment

Tie the noose 'round your neck
And indulge your flesh
Feeding your hunger

Tie the noose 'round your neck
And indulge your flesh
Feeding your disease

Breathe in feces
Weeping, screaming
As you're feasting
