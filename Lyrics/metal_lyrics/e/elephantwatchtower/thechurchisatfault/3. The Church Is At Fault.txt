Open your eyes
Taste and see the failure of our kind
Self preserved and prosperous we are
Nations of our brethren die and starve
We're to take the blame; we are at fault

Woe to us fools, ignorant to our ways
The Human condition of selfishness pays
âFather, provide for our brothersâ we pray
But we wonât lift a finger, weâd rather complain
Living in privilege, blind to our riches
Basking in our Narcissism
While the earth crumbles
We cause third world troubles
We taint the name of Christ

Impoverished and pained, they live in our waste
Who carries the weight of every cent we take?
Starvation prevails, our calling we've failed
The church is to blame for this world that weâve ailed
Famished by selfishness, Lives have been lost
And it is our fault
Lighting our stages with stolen donations
We taint the name of Christ

Seeing the consequence of our greed

We conjure pain, we taint the name
Yet we refuse to take the blame
Corrupt

The cost to clothe the naked,
on petty things it's wasted
How long until we waken?

Waste and pain, church is to blame
Are we failing God?
