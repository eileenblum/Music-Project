I'm plotting to tarnish your offerings
Lie, twist your emotions and profit
I long to defile the naked
Get rich off a gospel degraded; tainted

Be deceived
Unto me, tithe your beliefs
Be with me
Honour among thieves

Come unto my altar
Live under my power
Cleansed of living water
Psalm of indoctrine

By my hand
Faith will yield prosperity
Serve my greed
I'm the God you seek

You're blind to my intentions
Your tithes fund my deception

Your vision blurred
Seduced by polluted scripture
Absolved of paper

Grime
Perversion of bread and wine
Body of Christ victimized

Life left in ruins
Invest in indoctrination
Claim your damnation
Now, go forth in misfortune

Dead ministry
Follow me
And be born again of greed
Taste and see unbelief
Christ offers you nothing
