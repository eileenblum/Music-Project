No words could ever describe the feeling.
The feeling of holding onto your ghost.
But if there's just one more thing I could as of you. Just one more request.
Please don't ever forget me. No, don't you ever forget.
Everyday it's getting harder just to turn the page.
I keep replaying and reciting those mistakes you made.

And I'm trying to take my own advice.
That things will change. That things will change.
But whom am I kidding? I'm so afraid.
That things will change. That things will change.

I want you to know how it feels to be in love with the ghost that bears your name.
Know that my love was not in vain.

[Chorus]

But if there's one regret we can share, what shall we name him?
What shall we name our dead son? [x4]
