They will find my corpse on the shower floor.
And with my bleeding wrists will be a note that explains all of this.

"Dear friends and family, I hope that you can understand."

I could not handle the fear and regret, knowing I ruined my only chance.
A lesson in carelessness. Let my grave stand as proof.
You've only got one chance, so take advantage.
I will burn in hell for my selfishness. [x2]
I will burn in hell.
But you'll see me reach for angel wings.
You've only got one chance, so take advantage.
I know the backlash. Call me a coward all you want.
I know the truth is that I am free.
I am free! [x5]
