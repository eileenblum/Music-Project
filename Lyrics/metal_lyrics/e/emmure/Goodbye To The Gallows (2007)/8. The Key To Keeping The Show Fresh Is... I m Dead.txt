I just wanna rub it in your fucking face and make you remember everything.
No, you were never a friend to me. Just a part in all my movies.
Stabbing you dead in every scene.
And I'm not gonna stop until you realize how you made me feel.
And I swear it's all your fault. At least that's what I remember.
And I see right through you.
Jealousy pouring out your eyes.
So I ask for the great applause for this poor Capricorn.
I hope you enjoy living in my shadow.
When you signed the dotted line, did you think things would change?
I just wanna rub it in your fucking face and make you remember everything.
I, I can't help but laugh. And now we know that things will never change.
It's all about business
It's all about business now [x2]
