You know it's all a game that we play back and forth.
I leave, you chase, and we're back to square one.
We were not meant to be, and I tried my best to work it through.
I asked my friends, "What should I do?"
There only advice was leaving you.
But I'm glad I did or at least that's what I tell myself
I swear to God I never would've known your face or your name.
If every day is a constant reminder, you're a whore, liar, ghost, harlot.
And it's sad to say that I, I still cry to the Bayside CD everyday
Don't you know that those songs are about you?
Check tracks 8 and 9 then call me back
You ask me, "When is it over?"
You ask me, "When is it over?"
Over?
This isn't over 'til I say it's over
This isn't over 'til I say it's over
This isn't over 'til I say it's over
This isn't over 'til I say
Back to square one. Come on!
