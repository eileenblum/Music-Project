When all is said and done, please just let me out.
I will kill myself, if it means nothing else will keep me from sleeping tonight.
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
You did enough to ruin me.
My broken soul can't take another day.
I beg for you to leave.
God, if you're waiting for me, won't you please open the gates?
Open the gates.

"God, if you can hear me, open the gates."
