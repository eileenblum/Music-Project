Take me somewhere familiar so I can find myself again.
It hurts more then you know and I'll ask you "Why?"
Why would you lie to me? What was the point?
Was your intention to waste my time?
Thought I was digging deep. Thought I was breaking the bank.
But girls like you are just a dime a dozen.
Are just a dime a dozen.
Movie quotes and lyrics still connecting us like constellations.
I wonder if I can ever separate myself from this.
And it'll be a while 'til I can breathe again.
Slip me into something warm.
My eyes still scream childhood.
Childhood! [x2]
Slip me into something warm.
