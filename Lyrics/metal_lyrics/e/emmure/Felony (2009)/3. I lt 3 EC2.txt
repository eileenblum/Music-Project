It should've been 2 against the world
It should've been you and me removing disease
And once I'm dead you'll be leading the lost to a better land

And I'm so glad the world is coming to an end
Maybe now we'll grasp each others unloving hands
I wonder were we meant for more, was I meant to have you at all?

Time is running out, the shit is everywhere, the spread won't stop
Maybe they're the fortunate ones
The walking dead still walking towards the sun

It should've been the 2 of us
You and me removing disease
And once I'm dead you'll be leading the lost to a better land

We're all sick and dying
(Please don't go, I need you now more than ever)

Gypsies told me, we were soul mates
In a past life but not in this life

(I am cursed and so are you)

Always reaching
never there
but always reaching
