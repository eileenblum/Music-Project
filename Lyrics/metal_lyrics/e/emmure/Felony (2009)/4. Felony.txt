This might be your 2 years ago
But this pain is mine forever
Living well just wasn't good enough, I wanted my revenge

Blue Moon bottle
Right across your head
I broke your face
And all you did was snitch
You little bitch

I thought you were hard son
I thought that you were Mr. "I don't give a fuck"
Turns out you're the soft one

You've got 12 months so I suggest you get a gun
You should have just accepted that you got your ass kicked
Now you and all your friends are on my shit list

You're gonna die

And I'll be there in court to tell your mother why
She found her son with a knife in his chest
She found her son with a bullet in his head

My bad, I didn't mean to ruin your reputation
I swear the next time you see me
Well let's just say
You won't be so lucky

Say goodbye to all you cared about
See my face and know your death is now
