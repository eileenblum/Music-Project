I can see right through you
Now tell me does that sound familiar?

Now that I got your attention
I just wanted to say
I am so flattered that you mention my name
You've been paying my bills for way too long
And I'm so happy that you just can't stop talking shit

Keep running your mouth

I keep cashing checks
Snapping necks
So keep running your mouth

I keep them shook crews running
Like they supposed to
You come around but you never come close to

I can see it inside your face
You're in the wrong place

I implore you to comprehend
I'm more machine now than man

You're so vain
I bet you think this song is about you
Don't you

So much for plagiarism
So much for you to waste your breath running your mouth
A rat race to the top
Sore losers never satisfied with what they've got

Your career is flipping
So do me a favor
The next time you see her
Ask your girl what my dick tastes like

Yo
What
