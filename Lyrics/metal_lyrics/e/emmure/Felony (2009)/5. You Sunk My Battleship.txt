Looks like I'm digging my grave
Slowly but surely
This loneliness is what's killing me
And no I'm not afraid
And yes I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die

Grim Reaper
Of course I'll let you in
You bring truth, you bring destiny
So let the ending begin
No, there's no stopping the inevitable

Open the skies
Take me away

So let the ending begin

Looks like I'm digging my grave
Slowly but surely
This loneliness is what's killing me

No more oceans,
just the static of our television
