So here it is.
I'm in the Bronx.
I'm on the 1
I'm on the run
I'm going back to Queens.

I walk through the door, and look who it is.
I didn't think I'd see you but I'm glad I did.

I can't believe you didn't see this coming.
You should have read my lyrics a little closer.

Ask me how much I paid my lawyer.
You should have read my lyrics a little closer.

You've got that crazy look inï»¿ your eyes again.

So here's the deal.
I'm at the precint, not released yet
And they're calling you a punk
I thought you hated cops?
911 Speed Dial
Keeping the phone unlocked

Don't forget I know where you sleep at night.

Somebody help me please.
Somebody help me please.
I swear to god I'll pull this trigger.
Swear to god I'll pull this trigger.

And watch your soul flow out.
