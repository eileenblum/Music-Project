These dark days
I spent them all alone
And I lie here awake
Wishing you'd just answer the phone

1-718-No-You-Won't answer anyway
Why do I even bother?

Would it matter to you if I died tonight?
Would it matter to you, that you never got to say goodbye?

Just know that I loved you more than life
Follow your heart and do what's right

We never got to say goodbye

Here I go walking alone into the light

Pick up, pick up, pick up, before I enter the light
