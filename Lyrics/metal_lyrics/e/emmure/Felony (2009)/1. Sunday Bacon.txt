Top drawer
I grab the glock
I grab the ammo
Locked and Loaded

Blow your brains right out your skull
I'm addicted to your suffering
I came to bring the fucking pain

And now you're looking down the barrel of a gun
Sun of a Gun
Looks like you're not having any fun

Yeah, now you know that this is serious

Slow down, I can't keep up
You beg for mercy like I give a fuck

Scream Louder
Your screams are music to my ears

Listen to me
Put your face down on the ground

Oh shit, what the fuck did I just do?
