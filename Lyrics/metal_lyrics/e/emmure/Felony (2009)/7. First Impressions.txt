You're right, I'm the asshole
And this bitter, jaded attitude is getting me nowhere
But I love this feeling
God help me
What did you think?
What did you expect?
You thought you'd really get to know me?

Better hold your breath
Hold your breath for as long as you can

Why do you look so surprised?
This once was yours and now I made it mine
Don't look disappointed when I say

This is what I wanted
This is what I needed
This is what I'm looking for
And now you're gonna give it to me

Hold your fucking breath
