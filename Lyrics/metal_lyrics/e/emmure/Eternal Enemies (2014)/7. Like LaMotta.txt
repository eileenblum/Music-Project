Do you really wanna know
What it took to be all alone at the top of the food chain?
When I'm up there standing in front of cameras
A thousand eyes staring at you hoping you fall
I was made for this, I know the sound of glory calling and I couldn't resist

From what I've learned of the years of ups and downs
The whole game can change just when you figure it out
So let me give you, a little piece of advice
Just be yourself kid, the rest will fall into place

Like LaMotta, I'm only here to tell you, you better save yourself
Like LaMotta, I'm only here to tell you, you better save yourself

When did it start? Let me begin
Chapter 1 page 1, are you listening?

I wanna bring you back to the streets
Passing out my fucking demo for free
Passing fliers when it's 20 degrees
To promote my show
That's some shit you knew, just will never fucking know

Yeah that's some shit you knew, just will never fucking know

From what I've learned of the years of ups and downs
The whole game can change just when you figure it out
So let me give you, a little piece of advice
Just be yourself kid, the rest will fall into place

Like LaMotta, I'm only here to tell you, you better save yourself
Like LaMotta, I'm only here to tell you, you better save yourself
Like LaMotta, I'm only here to tell you, you better save yourself
Like LaMotta, I'm only here to tell you, you better save yourself

You better save yourself
I'm only here to tell you, you better save yourself
