This is my legacy
This is my life I know exactly how I want it to be
Don't you dare ever tread on me
I live and learn and try my best to not repeat my mistakes

There's no stones for my sins
Which I built a castle with

But I wonder, will I be remembered for the good I've done,
Or will my name be stained forever?

I stand as living proof that if you always believe
And never give up your dreams,
that anything is possible
Don't be afraid to face the world

Don't you try to fleeâ¦
You can't just run away
Never listen to those who don't believe in you

But I wonder, will I be remembered
For the good I've done?
Or will my name be stained forever
I wonder, will I be remembered?
Or will my name be stained forever

Promise me you'll fight
Until there's nothing left
Promise to me that you'll never give up
Promise to me that you'll never surrender

But I wonder, will I be remembered
For the good I've done?
Or will my name be stained forever
I wonder, will I be remembered?
Or will my name be stained forever
