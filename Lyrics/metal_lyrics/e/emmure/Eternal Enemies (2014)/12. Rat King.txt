We are the hate (we are the hate) that you created (that you created)
Born again in the grave you tried to put us in

No, no we will not be stopped
You can kill me, but you can't kill us all
Now my friend I've come to test your faith
Will you still believe in me?

Cause I believe in you, I believe in you
We are the scorned, pitiful and flawed

Nobody's perfect, don't believe the hype
This time you'll open your fucking eyes
And take a look inside, I am inside of you, I am inside of you

So no, you can kill me, but you can't kill us all
Now my friend I've come to test your faith
Will you still believe in me?

Cause I believe in you, I believe in you
We are the scorned, pitiful and flawed

Nobody's perfect, don't believe the hype
This time you'll open your fucking eyes
And take a look inside, I am inside of you, I am inside of you
