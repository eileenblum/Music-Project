It's becoming quite clear
I've dug myself a little deeper it seems
And there's no way out
Unless I die
Just to get you off the fucking back
Leave me alone, I'm only human
I never said that we're perfect
I'm saying sorry but it seems you only care for my faults
So I'm taking it back, now I don't give a fuck

You two-faced fucking coward
Why don't you say it to my face?

I bet you won't
Yeah you're just lucky that I'm someone with so much to lose
I bet you won't
Now I know better than to
Talk to someone who's so weak and so spineless
Remember without me your life doesn't mean shit

You fucking coward
I know you hate yourself
I know you hate yourself

(One punch to this guy, would knock him the fuck out)

Bring it
Give me your best shot, give me your best shot, give me your best shot
Bring it
Give me your best shot, give me your best shot, give me your best shot

I know you hate yourself
I know you hate yourself
