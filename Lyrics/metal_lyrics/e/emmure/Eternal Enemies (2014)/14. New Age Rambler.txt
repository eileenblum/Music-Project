Don't even bother speaking, don't ask me about how I feel today
It's just another city, another group of faces with no names
And I refuse to imagine a world outside this place
Just these four walls as I wait for this little bus

Seems all I've made are enemies who celebrate my misery
All that I they gave and took away
I have everything but what I
Need
Need
I have everything
Everything but what I need

You'll find me sitting in silence
Separating myself from the talking sheep
Searching for peace in empty bars
Tell me what I'm â¦

Seems all I've made are enemies who celebrate my misery
All that I they gave and took away
I have everything but what I
Need
Need
I have everything
Everything but what I need
