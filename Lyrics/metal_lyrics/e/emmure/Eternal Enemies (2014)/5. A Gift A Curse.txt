What I've done what I've seen
The lives I've touched, what does it mean?
Losing track of everything
I gave it all but what did I gain
And I don't care what waits for me
On the other side of life's release
Cause when I close my eyes your face is all I see
So even if I die I'll never rest in peace

I was desperate just to shine
Now I struggle constantly to survive

I, I have nothing to prove to you

What I've done what I've seen
The lives I've touched, what does it mean?
Losing track of everything
I gave it all but what did I gain
And I don't care what waits for me
On the other side of life's release
Cause when I close my eyes your face is all I see
So even if I die I'll never rest in peace

And I tried so many times
To show that what I feel is real
No this is not a joke, but you keep pushing me
You, you keep pushing me
Iâve never come so far
I guess Iâm coming back
And now I have my soul
Youâll fucking burn in hell
Burn
Nothing changes
All I know is that I'm alone in this
Silently I wait hoping youâll come back for me
All I know is that I'm alone in this
Silently I wait hoping youâll come back for me

Seems like I'll be waiting til the end
Knowing that I canât
Speak to you again
Just a silly love affair

I don't need your empty words or bullshit sympathy
So here's a gift for all those years of mocking me

Now I will shove this evil upon you
You deserve to feel what I'm going through
Now I will shove this evil upon you
You deserve to feel what I'm going through
