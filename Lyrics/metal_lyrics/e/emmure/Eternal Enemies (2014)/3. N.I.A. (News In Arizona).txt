I'm a god damn sociopath.
I'm a thief. I'm a liar. Devil in the flesh.
I only want to use you.
Fuck you. Leave you high and dry

I'm damaged goods,
I'm the toy you broke and threw away.
But I'll remain above it all stuck underneath

No one can face me now.

I'll keep your head for peace-keeping.
Whisper to your daughter
âShh be quiet now mommy is sleepingâ
They put my face on the news
To show people thereâs a killer on the loose
A jealous lover who has nothing to lose.

No, no, no.
No, why? No.

I'm a god damn sociopath.
I'm a thief. I'm a liar. Devil in the flesh.
I only want to use you.
Fuck you. Leave you high and dry

I'm damaged goods,
I'm the toy you broke and threw away.
But I'll remain above it all stuck underneath

No one can face me now.
No one can face me now.

You're gonna die in Sedona
