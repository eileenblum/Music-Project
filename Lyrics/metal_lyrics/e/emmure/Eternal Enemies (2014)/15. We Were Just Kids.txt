Too much too soon
Or is that simply my excuse?

Dear world, I must give this confession
I only hope it brings redemption
For far too long I played the victim
Hoping someone would pay attention

Too much too soon
Or is that simply my excuse?
Too much too soon
For everything I did to you
Too much too soon
Or is that simply my excuse?
Too much too soon
For everything I did to you

All of my mistakes
There's nothing I can do to fix it now
I didn't want to hurt you
I just wish you could understand
[?]

I'm sorry that I ever hurt you
And that your trust in me was worthless
And now I know what the fucking truth is
I want your heart but I don't deserve it

Too much too soon
Or is that simply my excuse?
Too much too soon
For everything I did to you
Too much too soon
Or is that simply my excuse?
Too much too soon
For everything I did to you
