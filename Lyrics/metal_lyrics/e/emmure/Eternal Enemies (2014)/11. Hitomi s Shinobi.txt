"You're my queen Tanaka-san
I swear I'd kill for you, I think I'd die for you
You're my dream, you're all I want
To love and worship you, it's what I'm born to do
May my next breath be my last
If just to touch you once, I don't care what it costs
Must I speak in foreign tongue?
Aishiteru, Aishiteru"

"What must I do?
To live this fantasy
What must I do?
You must belong to me"

"I've grown so weary of rejection
I beg to feel your perfection
Please let me be rewarded
You're everything I ever wanted"

"Please come to me, Hitomi
Please come to me
Please, Hitomi, please"

"You're my queen Tanaka-san
I swear I'd kill for you, I think I'd die for you
You're my dream, you're all I want
To love and worship you, it's what I'm born to do
May my next breath be my last
If just to touch you once, I don't care what it costs
Must I speak in foreign tongue?
Aishiteru, Aishiteru"

"What must I do?
What must I do?
Please come to me, Hitomi
Please come to me
Hitomi
What must I do?
What must I do?"
