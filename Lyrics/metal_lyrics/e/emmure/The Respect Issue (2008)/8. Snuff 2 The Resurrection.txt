Pay attention to what I'm about to say
This is a true confession
Mother, I killed someone today

I know I shouldn't throw it all down the drain
But she fucking deserved it
For everything she did to me

Getting away with murder is probably the hardest thing to do
I hope I get a good lawyer
Or else I'm calling my brother screaming "Where are you?!"

What the fuck was I thinking?
I should have known I couldn't get away with this
It was over dumb shit
And they already had my finger prints
That's how they know
IT WAS ME
I took her life away [x2]
But she fucking deserved it

I don't regret a thing [x2]

Pay attention to what I'm about to say
