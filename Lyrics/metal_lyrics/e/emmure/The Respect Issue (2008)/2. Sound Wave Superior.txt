I draw my line in the sand
Choose your side
If this is becoming a man
Then I am God-like
Bow down to me
I'm here to break the cipher
I never wanted it to come to this
But if your not with me
Then you can
GET OUT [x16]

All of your suffering is proof of my righteousness
I wish those Guido's fucking killed you
It feels so good to watch you fail
What the fuck did you think?
Did you think that we would be friends?
Karma has come to collect
Yeah this is what you get

I draw my line in the sand
Choose your side
If this is becoming a man
Then I am God-like
God-like [x2]

I pray, I pray her cancer is coming back
Your broken face won't be the only mess
Karma has come to collect [x2]
