I'll try my best to explain the situation, but there's only one way that I know how.
So listen up, now.
I will show no sympathy any chance I get I'm gonna pour salt in your wounds.
After you forgive me tell me why should I Ever fucking care.

Your

I know this sounds too familiar.

Sad

You would kill to be where I am.

Fate

Choices you make they will haunt you to your grave.
This will haunt you to the grave.
You, you're trying your hardest it makes me fucking sick.
Your sad fate.
I'm not the only one laughing at your fucking mistakes and I don't really gotta tell you 'cause you already know.
You are beneath me...

I came out on top.
