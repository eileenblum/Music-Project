There will never be a song that touches on the subject of how deeply I feel rejected
STAB YOUR LUNGS
I hope you're feeling so much better now
You don't got 5 than you're not hanging out
But being friends was all I ever cared about
LOOK AT ME NOW

I've lost faith in everyone
I'm burning my bridges
No apologies could ever mend
That gap that you created
Too much time has passed
You missed your chance to make this right

There will never be a song that touches on the subject of how deeply I feel rejected
STAB YOUR LUNGS
I hope you're feeling so much better now
You don't got 5 than you're not hanging out
But being friends was all I ever cared about
LOOK AT ME NOW

Backstabbing murderers [x2]
I hope the handle never leaves you

And the song ends and the audience stands [x5]
And the song ends
(time wasted, spent wasted) [x9]
