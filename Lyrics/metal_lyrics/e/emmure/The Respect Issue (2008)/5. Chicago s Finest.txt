There's a million things that I could say
If you're down for listening

I never thought I'd feel so alone
I never thought I'd want to come back home

But I chose my path 9 years ago
And now there's no turning back
No, there's no turning back
There's no turning back
No turning back

I lost everything just to have this
And now my dreams are coming true [x2]
I lost everything just to have this
And now my dreams are coming true

[x2]
Chase your dreams
Don't leave in fear
