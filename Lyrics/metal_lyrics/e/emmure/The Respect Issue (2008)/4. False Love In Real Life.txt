Let Me Take My Time
Let Me Work Things Out
I Could Be The Man You've Been Dreaming Of
Just Get On Your Knees
And Open Your Mouth
And Accept This Gift Of Lust And Let Downs
What Did You Expect?
You Think I Really Care?
You're Just Another Notch On This Belt I Wear
So I'm Taking Off
Yeah I'm Leaving Town
Don't Call Or Write
See You Ar-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ound

God Damn! (x5)
FUCK. Fuck. Her. Like. I. Never. Could.
Fuck Her Doggy Style First

I Fucking Die Just From The Thought (x2)

And If You Want It You Can Have It Baby!
Just Come And Sit By Me
God Damn, I Never Knew It Could This Easy
You Take My Money But I Take Your Time
All I Wanted Was To Stop Think Back And Rewind
All I Wanted Was A Memory So You Can Savor The Moment
THANK YOU, YOU FUCKING WHORE

I-I Fucking Die Just From The Thought (x2)

Let Me Take My Time
Let Me Work Things Out
I Could Be The Man You've Been Dreaming Of
Just Get On Your Knees
And Open Your Mouth
And Accept This Gift Of Lust And Let Downs
What Did You Expect?
You Think I Really Care?
You're Just Another Notch On This Belt I Wear
So I'm Taking Off
Yeah I'm Leaving Town
Don't Call Or Write
See You Around
