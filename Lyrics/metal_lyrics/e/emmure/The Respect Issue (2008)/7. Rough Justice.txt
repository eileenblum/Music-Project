We will teach them not to mistake our kindness for weakness
A search for honesty is right here before your hands
And I'll do anything to inspire those who feel brotherless

I know, I know this message will reach a few but what can I do?
What can I do?

This is the only war I wage
I am prepared to fight
With everything I've got
Just to prove I'm right
You'll grow a thirst for truth
After tonight, this is the only war I wage
The only war worth fighting for

I know, I know this message will reach a few but what can I do?
What can I do? [x2]

There simply is no saving you [x2]

Stand on your feet and fight!
