I did not pass the torch
just to be engulfed by the flames 

I'm breathing fire to survive

Burn it down

Rising from the ashes 
I'm here to take back what is mine
I used to call you friend
What a fucking waste of time

I cannot believe that you would ever try and fucking take away from me the only thing I care about or I believe 

Now I'm having trouble letting go of knowing you were always living, eating, breathing, cashing in on all my misery

Tell me now
Do you see?
You cannot do this without me

Tell me now
Do you see?
You cannot do this without me

I did not pass the torch
just to be engulfed by the flames

Do you know now?
You're nothing without me
