I am the Saturn God.
You are all my bastard sons.
Kneel before the chosen one.
If I were to cut you open I'd see my blood.

Where will you run to now?
When everything that you think you know changes.

Where will you run to now?
When all the lights they no longer shine for you.

Where will you run to now?
You're out of time, had your best years wasted.

Where will you run to now?
When all the love that you thought you had faded.

I am the Saturn God.
You are all my bastard sons.
Kneel before the chosen one.
If I were to cut you open I'd see my blood.

I don't need to listen to all you clones
You sound the same to me.

I cant stand it.
Little do they know that I've been waiting here so patiently

To come grab it.
Come and pay your homage but then get the fuck away from me.

Fucking maggot.
I'll see you never, I've got better thing to do.

Where will you run to now?
When everything that you think you know changes.

Where will you run to now?
When all the lights they no longer shine for you.

Where will you run to now?
You're out of time, had your best years wasted.

Where will you run to now?
When all the love that you thought you had faded.
