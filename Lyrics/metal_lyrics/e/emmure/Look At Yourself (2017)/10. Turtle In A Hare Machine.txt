What's the look upon your face?
You look like you got something to say.
Another sneak diss? Oh you're so fucking lame.
I'll have you know that I've been reading your mind for weeks.

Too tired to express how fucking sick you make me.
Drown under my burning bridge.

Have I made myself clear now?

These trying times.
I can not believe this is happening.

Here we go again.
More of the same
More of the same
The same old shit.

You're stepping like the ice
Is starting to get thin.

Have I made myself clear?!

These trying times.
I can not believe this is happening.

I've lost all my patience.
These are wasted moments.

I've lost all my patience.
Stay away from me.
