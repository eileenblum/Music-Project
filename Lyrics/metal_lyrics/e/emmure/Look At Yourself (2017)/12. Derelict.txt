I'm just a punchline 
I'm know when I'm nothing
I am the epitome of everything
you should never want to be
I have a coldness just for everyday life
and I struggle just to speak to the people who know me
press the smiles on the surface
just to hide what's really on my chest
I'll take a no I never keep people, 
to be me is easy you just have to be a piece of shit
