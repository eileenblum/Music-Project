Running in circles.
So it seems.

Running in circles.
Never ends.

Tragically, you are stuck
Stuck in time.
Unlike me, gliding free.
So linear.

Just like a dog.
Dirt on your paws.

Just like a dog.
You dig your own grave.

Run!

Show your teeth.
Now play dead.

Show your teeth.
Now play dead.

Show your teeth.
Now play dead.

Show your teeth.
Now play dead.

All bark
No bite
You dumb little bitch.
