What more could I possibly say. 
I've gone above and beyond of what you thought I'd be. 
There's no surprise to me you just can't relate. 
The depths I've fallen, you would never been able to take. 

But if you think you can then step up to plate. 

First you see it, then you don't believe it, 
Then you're gonna be there to question "Why?". 
Why am I the one who has to suffer and be crucified? 
Some will call it fate, or call it karma, or simply call it fucked. 
Say your getting older, moving forward, to me you're giving up. 

I am your fucking savior. 
I am the fucking anti-Christ. 

Do you think you can handle the nightmare, of being alive when no one cares? 

But if you think you can then step up to plate. 

First you see it, then you don't believe it, 
Then you're gonna be there to question "Why?". 
Why am I the one who has to suffer and be crucified? 
Some will call it fate, or call it karma, forget it, call it fucked. 
Say your getting older, moving forward, to me you're giving up. 

The critics and comments 
The press and the nonsense 
The fans who feel cheated and venues I damaged. 
The people who left me and those who I banished. 
Fuck it, I'm done. 
I've got one thing to say. 
Hate me if you it makes you feel better. 

I am your fucking savior. 
I am the fucking anti-Christ.
I am the one and only answer.
I am the fucking anti-Christ.

Hate me if you it makes you feel better. 
You can hate me if you it makes you feel better.
