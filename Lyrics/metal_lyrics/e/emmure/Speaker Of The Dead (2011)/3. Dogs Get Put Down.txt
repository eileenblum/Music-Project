I heard you wanted to kill me
So why am I still alive?
Some come on why don't you try
They put a price on my head
I stay bangin'
I stay strapped
I know it's hard to believe but sometime's dead is better
I'm not afraid to die
Do me a fucking favor
Take my fucking life
I'm not afraid to die so take my fucking life
