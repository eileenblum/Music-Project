We are the walking giants
Born against our mothers' will
Sons of fathers raised to kill
We were taught to protect
We were taught to build
Forty thousand strong and still we suffer
These days are coming to an end
Stand up
Get up
Don't let them do the same to you
Did you know the nephilim died alone?
