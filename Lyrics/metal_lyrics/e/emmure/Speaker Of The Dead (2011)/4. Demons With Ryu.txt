Tatsumaki Senpuukyaku
I am no one
I am the fighter with no name
I am no one
I've been training everyday
I am no one
I am the walking vagabond
I am no one
This devil in me lives
This never ending conflict is all I have
(This never ending conflict)
I've been spending everyday Under waterfalls
And yet I still cannot become the person I've been dreaming of
I wonder if I've been wasting my time
This conflict never ends
And still I try
Shoryuken [x2]
This never ending conflict [x3]
This never ends
(And still I try)
"Round One, Fight!"
