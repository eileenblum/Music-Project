Star climber please don't abandon us
Star climber please take me away from here
I was only a child
But I will always remember the night I saw you
Four feet from the window
I was frozen cold but not in fear
Please come back and save me
I don't deserve to be left for dead and forgotten
Tell me are you listening?
I am one of you
