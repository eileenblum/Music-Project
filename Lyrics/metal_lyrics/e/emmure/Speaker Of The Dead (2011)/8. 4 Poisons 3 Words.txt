Now I'm walking away
I don't need This
I don't need You
I have no interest to please or appease you
I'm done wasting my fucking life
on cowards wasting my fucking time
And if I'm alone in this fight
Then I'm walking away tonight
Get fucked
I'm standing on my own two feet
I don't need you
I don't need this
I'm ready to die for my beliefs
I'm ready to kill for my beliefs
Are you with me in this fight?
If not I'm walking away tonight
