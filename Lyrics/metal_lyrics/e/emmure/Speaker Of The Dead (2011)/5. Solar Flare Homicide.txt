I see a fire in the sky 
Lights go out I'm gonna finish what I started 
And now you better pray I don't know where you are 
Do you remember just like I always do? 
Ive been dying to remind you 
There ain't gonna be a jail sentence 
No more Fucking Consequence 
No there will never be another sentence 
Fire in sky 
This is freedom 
I see fire in the sky 
Now you'll suffer
