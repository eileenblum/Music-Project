Now they wanna talk about coming clean
Give up the ghost give up the dream
I hear them screaming beyond the trees
They're screaming
"Why?!"
"What have I done?"
Slow burns their lungs
"Father won't you save me?"
"What have I done?"
Burn down the bohemian grove
They got a secret they don't want you to know
I can hear them screaming
"Father, no"
