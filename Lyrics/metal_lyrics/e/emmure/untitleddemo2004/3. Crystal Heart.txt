I know I say 
Still I feel the same
Hold me as I fly away
Tell me how long you will stay

I could not forget the pain you once ripped out of my heart
I screamed you expect me to let this go

I know I say 
Still I feel the same
Hold me as I fly away
Tell me how long you will stay

We could work Breaking in the dreams of my childhood
There is no escape I'm the memory

Time going deaf again I can't forget the way you ripped out my heart and showed
me what it's like to be hollow

You will never know my pain
