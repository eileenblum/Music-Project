Watch your step

Season of impotent arrogance
I'm digging through the snow because of your footprints
How could I hunger when I swallow so much silence
My patience wearing so thin

And we are not the same
And we are not the same

Sitting in this corner
I feel the hatred racing through my veins
My heart

Love has blossomed into hate
These walls will never break
My voice still goes unheard
My thoughts are so impure

And we are not the same
And we are not the same

The sun digs through my eyes for the last time
Today I swear I'll die

The clouds smile to the concrete
The Earth spreads its legs
The innocence raped
And dust is all that's present
And dust is all that's present
Oh my one

This torment everlasting
Please God help me through this
My wounds will not heal
And the bruises call to demons, to demons
And the bruises call to demons

Pain is my legacy
I hold no sympathy
Pain is my legacy
I hold no sympathy
Pain is my legacy
I hold no sympathy
Pain is my legacy
I hold no sympathy

I hold no sympathy
'Cause this is my hell
'Cause this is my hell
'Cause this is my hell
My hell
'Cause this is my hell
'Cause this is my hell
'Cause this is my hell
