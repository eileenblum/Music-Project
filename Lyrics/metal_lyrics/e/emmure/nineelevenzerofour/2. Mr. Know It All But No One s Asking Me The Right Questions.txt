I sense who you are
Forcing me to break all forms of concentration
And I have never felt so weak

My heart worn on my sleeve lets me know you're gone
I saw you staring so I wore that smile

And I'm on top of the world like a god
Knowing more than I should
And I'm on top of the world like a god
Knowing more than I should

And I'm on top of the world like a god
Knowing more than I should
And I'm on top of the world like a god
Knowing more than I should

Knowing more than I should

The story book is closed
Life is nothing but a game
And I will never be the same
Don't you dare speak my name

Don't you dare speak my name

My heart worn on my sleeve
My heart worn on my sleeve
My heart worn on my sleeve for all of you to stab at me
you to stab at me, stab at me, stab at me

And I'm on top of the world like a god
Knowing more than I should
And I'm on top of the world like a god
Knowing more than I should

I'm on top of the world like a god
Knowing more than I should
I'm on top of the world like a god
Knowing more than I should

Knowing more than I should
God

The story book is closed
Life is nothing but a game
And I will never be the same
Don't you dare speak my name

Don't you dare speak my name
Don't you dare speak my name
Never

One more smile and I'll kill them all
One more smile and I'll kill them all
One more smile and I'll kill them all
One more smile and I'll kill them all

One more smile and I'll kill them all
One more smile and I'll kill them all
One more smile and I'll kill them all
One more smile and I'll kill them all
One more smile and I'll kill them all

Kill them all
Kill them all
Kill them all
Kill them all
Kill them all
Kill them all
Kill them all
