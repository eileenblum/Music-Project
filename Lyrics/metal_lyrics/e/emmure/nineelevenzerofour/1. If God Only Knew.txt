The tears paint silhouettes of who I wish you would be
My hands around your neck
Leave no room for you to scream
You're the angel that calls me in my dreams

I won't be saved
Just let me be
I won't be saved
Just let me be

My heart shall be avenged

With my hands around her neck
With my hands around her neck

The truth bleeds right through me
The pain won't wash away
And now I see the ending
I swear it's all the same

And she will not forget my name
No she will not forget my name

She will not forget my name
She will not forget my name
She will not forget my name
No

You're the angel that calls me in my dreams
You're the angel that calls me in my dreams

I won't be saved
Just let me be
I won't be saved
Just let me be

My heart shall be avenged

How dare you compel me to rip out your eyes
How dare you compel me to rip out your eyes

I never wanted it to be this way

And now I see the ending
I swear it's all the same
And she will not forget my name
No, she will not forget my name

She will not forget my name
She will not forget my name
She will not forget my name
