My pride is a razor cutting me from everything that I have ever loved
Let's go
Dead and gone; dreams are decaying right before my eyes
Everything is funny in Three's Law of Comedy
Senses dulled, I wish I was laughing
Break me in two
Break me in two why don't you?
Yeah bring it
This boy needs a hero
