I stare into a void.
My life is an emptyness.
Death, you are my mistress.

I would do anything for you
Please stand by my side
I would do anything for you.
Just tell me who must die
I would do anything for you.

You are the reason I'm alive.

Becoming a god, a hollow victory.

You are the reason I'm alive. [x4]

Death my bride!
(You are the reason I'm alive.)
(I'm alive)

I cannot live without you, but you don't need me. [x5]
