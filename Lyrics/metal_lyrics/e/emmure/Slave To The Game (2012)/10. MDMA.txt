It seems the lower that I go,
The better I begin to feel.
I donât want this life,
If nothing I feel is real.

Donât act so concerned.
I tried my fucking best.
But letting go was never an option.
Iâve got this hole stuck in my chest.

Let go.
Thatâs what you said.
But letting go was never an option.
I tried my fucking best.

Let go.
Thatâs what you said.
But letting go was never an option.
I tried my fucking best.

You said it was never goodbye.
Liar!

It seems the lower that I go,
The better I begin to feel.
I donât want this life,
If nothing I feel is real.

Donât act so concerned.
I tried my fucking best.
But letting go was never an option.
Iâve got this hole stuck in my chest.

I donât expect you to understand.
What I lost in you,
Iâm never getting back.
And you donât care. [x2]

Let go.
Thatâs what you said.
But letting go was never an option.
I tried my fucking best.

Let go.
Thatâs what you said.
But letting go was never an option.
I tried my fucking best.
