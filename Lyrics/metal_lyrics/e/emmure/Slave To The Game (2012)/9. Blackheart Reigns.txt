Dear Mephisto,
Tell me why have you created me?
A product of Christ crowns disgusting vile evil ways.
And now all I wish is just for you to set me free.
Black heart reigns.

Son of Satan.
Call me what you will.
Let the light shine on these horns of mine.

You think this is manipulative?
This is my wrath at its absolute weakest.

Black heart reigns.
Son of Satan.
Black heart reigns.
Call me what you will.
Black heart reigns.
Let the light shine on these horns of mine.
Black heart reigns.

Black heart reigns.
This is the realm of the accursed.

This is my heart of darkness. [x4]

Welcome to hell. [x4]
Black heart reigns.

Son of Satan.
Call me what you will.
Let the light shine on these horns of mine.

Black heart reigns.
Son of Satan.
Black heart reigns.
Call me what you will.
Black heart reigns.
Let the light shine (Black heart reigns) on these horns of mine.
