I stand alone, but I will not be broken.
I stand alone,
The truest words I've spoken.
Blood runs thin. I stand proof of this.
Where is my family when I need them?
So alone.
I will make sure I'm never forgotten.
I see clearly, you are my enemy.

I stand alone, but I will not be broken.
I stand alone,
[x2]

You are my enemy.

And now my dreams are slowly escaping me.
I don't need anyone. I don't need you.
I'm okay with dying alone. Dig my grave.
I hope you feel the same.

Bide by time,
I'm gonna die, you're gonna die.
No one cares.

Let them take me now.

I'm already dead.

All I want is power and control. My cold soul.
