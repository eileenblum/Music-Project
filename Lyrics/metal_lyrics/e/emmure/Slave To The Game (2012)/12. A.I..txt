Just remember you killed me first.
Your corpse, My Trophy.
But oh my god, this still hurts.
Just remember you killed me first.
Your blood shall lift this curse.

Go warn your brother.
Your time is up.
Iâm gonna find you.
And lift this curse.

You turned me into a murderer.
Put this knife in your neck.
Just remember you killed me first.
So watch your fucking back. [x2]

You turned me into a murderer.
Just remember you killed me first.
You turned me into a murderer.
So watch your fucking back.

And I know that your family will be missing you,
And your family will never know the truth.

Go warn your brother.
Your time is up.
Iâm gonna find you.
And lift this curse.
