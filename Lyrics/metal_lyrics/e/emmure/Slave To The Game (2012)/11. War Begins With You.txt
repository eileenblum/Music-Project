Now hereâs the truth.
I pull the knives out of my back.
And give them right back to you.
This is the way I choose to cope.
My only escape.
And you will get what you deserve.
I hope youâre listening.
Mark my words.

And weâre all laughing at you.
Behind your back and to your face.
You cannot take back what you said.
You paint a past you canât erase.
I donât feel sorry for you.
I hope you choke before you speak.
So keep my name out of your mouth.
You are the fucking disease. [x2]

Iâve got nothing to fight for.
So Iâm gonna buy a gun and start a war.
Iâm ready to even the score.

Iâve got nothing to fight for.
So Iâm gonna buy a gun and start a war.

Put a bullet in your fucking dome bitch.
My disappointments over shadowed by your lack of respect.
I fucking hate you bitch.

This is the way I choose to cope.
My only escape.
I hope youâre listening.
Mark my words.

And weâre all laughing at you.
Behind your back and to your face.
You cannot take back what you said.
You paint a past you canât erase.
I donât feel sorry for you.
I hope you choke before you speak.
So keep my name out of your mouth.
You are the fucking disease.

Iâve got nothing to fight for.
So Iâm gonna buy a gun and start a war.
Iâm ready to even the score.

Iâve got nothing to fight for.
So Iâm gonna buy a gun and start a war.
