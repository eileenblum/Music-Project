Hide behind my mask you fucking Coward,
You stand powerless,
Hide behind my mask you fucking coward,
I reject your presence.

Know my name and fear it,
Know my name and fear it.
Feel my pain and anger
My hatred knows no limit
I cannot be destroyed

I am onslaught,
I am onslaught,

Hide behind my mask you fucking Coward,
You stand powerless,
Hide behind my mask you fucking coward,
I reject your presence.

No one is safe
No one is safe
No one is safe
No one is safe

Hide behind my mask you fucking Coward,
You stand powerless,
Hide behind my mask you fucking coward,
I reject your presence.

I was born to destroy you will never escape me.
I was born to destroy you will never escape me.

I am onslaught,
I am onslaught,

Know my name and fear it
Know my name and fear it

Feel my pain and anger
My hatred knows no limit
I cannot be destroyed
