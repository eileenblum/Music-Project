Another blackened night.
I hope to walk in dreams.
But ain't scared.
Be desperate.

Blades are turning,
In my tombs deep.
Can't forget the torment,
On my soul and my brain.

Keep clashing till you die.
Till your power is fall.
Kick the chair and shut your eyes.
See a dream for real time.

I'm still awake and,
Want more and more.
Poison spreading,
In my tired vein.

Can't see and feel.
My death is near.(I know)
He pounded the hook fastly,
But never can get me.

One day i will go to,
Walls of heaven.
Turn back and run when,
Darkness still in my heart.

I can hear the drums.
The hellhounders of god.
War is never stop,
In my relentless soul.
