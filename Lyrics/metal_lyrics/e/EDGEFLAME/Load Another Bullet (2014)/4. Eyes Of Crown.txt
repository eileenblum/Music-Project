Wait for ânever comeâ till die,
At the beginning of forsaken road.
See the million of filthy shade.
Scoffing, smiling in the shadows.

You know this but never see.
When in the bed hear the cry.
Like a child but wait to die.
Never and never stop.

Do if you dare, in the sky, chosen one.
See, on the throne, eyes of crown, never sleep.

Bullets warm, flame of passion to burn.
Corpses sleep in the field with the black wind.
Back of trench, always pray but never work.
You here only for god.

Close eyes fall into gap and fly.
No one care you dead or alive.
Want peace but think only win.
And you die for someones sin.
