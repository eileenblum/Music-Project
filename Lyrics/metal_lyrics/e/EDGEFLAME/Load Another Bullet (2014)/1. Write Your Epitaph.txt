Sirens and flashes, sky painted red.
The titans clash and the bodies shred.
Ruthless and rude. No one have pride.
Borders, no one care. Missiles goin' high.

Broken bodies and wrecked lives.
Hit them in their sleep.
No chance for the fight,
Write your epitaph.

Gunpowder in air, feel in every breath.
Anyone have fair in the noise of death.
Behind the stories. Best lies ever told.
We are just pawns, born and die for crowns.

Fear of death and curious, about who wait us in next.
Nothing precious than now.
Never know, have you got second chance?

Where is your god now?
Creator of earth and sky.
Why do nothing when world fall with hunger and crimes?

How can forgive the deadly sins with only prays.
Bloody ethnic genocides, built the great wall for cry.

World is ruined darkness is rising when newborns die.
Who can believe now the god of justice, tell me the story.

A prophet shouting his name we the people get on our knees,
First rule never examine. Fist of ignorance in our minds.

How can forgive the deadly sins with only prays.
