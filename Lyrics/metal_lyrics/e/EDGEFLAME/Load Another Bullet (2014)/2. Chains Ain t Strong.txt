Time is falling down the end is near.
Destroy the anxiety, no more fear.
All of in your, your little mind.
They're never hide, all of the same kind.

Distorted figures infected us.
Demented humanity hooked minds.
We the people just watching but,
No one save, when they execute us.

Nothing changed, until today, from past.
Holocausts and violence for democracy.
On the TVs and in the councils.
But soldiers are always merciless.

The darkest days coming faster.
Humans will dethrone the masters.
Homicidal laws and deviant rules,
Lady justice born again after disaster.

Main request for anarchy of souls.
Death is everywhere, take em' all.

They will retreat and search an escape.
Doomsday is soon, give em' hell.

Worshiping freedom,explode the panzers.
Redundant rulers, threaten em' all.

When the sun rising, see the demolition.
Chains ain't strong, break em' all.

Never come the final round.
Mothers'll just cry with proud of sons.
Searching for next,
Victim for blame and rest.

Spilled blood from the veins.
Cut with blade of USA.
Someone shot when someone pray.
Someone die and someone play.
