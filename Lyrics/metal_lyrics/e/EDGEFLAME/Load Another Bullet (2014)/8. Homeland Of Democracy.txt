Built the walls and destroy the towers.
Walk in darkness. Strike merciless.
Red blue and white. Humanity turned dust.
Infected lungs. Diseased minds.

Smart weapons and nuclear menace
No one want learn. âWho is better?â
Burned bodies stuck in demolition.
No oneâll die for liars vengeance.

Soldiers here for the glory and freedom,
Learnt only terminate and destruction.
Born in the home land of the best,
Democracy money can buy.

Slay for petrol. Conquer all.
And exchange with freedom and tear.
Peace is everywhere. Crystal clear,
Beneath bullets, corpses, fire and fear.

Thousands of martyr they never die.
Sleep with pain when missiles high.
Melt all the metal for demolition
Of twenty first century.
