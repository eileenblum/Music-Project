Unspoken truths in hooked mouths.
Press is sold. Watch the lies.
Never examine your ruler.
Itâs a crime when killing not.

Dirty minds interfere us.
They only care our price.
Obey the law and the god.
Thereâs no justice, verdict a lot.

In the cold jails, the iron fists.
No one knows and no one cares.
Little men rewrite the laws.
Again and again, we're pawns.

Benefits more important than lives.
You'll have nothing when time is comes.
They think we're puppets they have the string.
Complete orders feel the sting.

Strike with all force, have no mercy.
Glorious day for us you'll fall with envy.
Flame of riot, burn all of them.
Oppressive system, break the chains.

Use the bullets for own nation.
Kill your people with the passion.
Hereâs the endgame, the final war.
You'll die with your crows.

Puppets of the U. S. of A.
No one care your fuckin' pray.
Say the last words in judgement day.
And you will pay.
