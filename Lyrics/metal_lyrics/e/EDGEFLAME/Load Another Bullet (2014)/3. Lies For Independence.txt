Now the biggest gun is faith.
For take your last breath.
Merciless and stop for anyone.
Victims, just wait for death.

Prayers never believe justice.
The biggest lie is trust.
Their god and their Sheppard.
Lives devote for the lust.

A nation sank in lies.
Nobody cares mothers cries.
Nothing seems crystal clear,
But we will, we will rise.

Lies for independence

Thickest borders in the mind.
Divided people for the fate.
Always search but never find.
Live with the holy threat.

Sins darker than the night.
Just obey like a blind.
No acception never try.
They just care your kind.

Lies for independence
