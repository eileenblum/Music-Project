The betrayal of craven,
Who try to stab my back.
Liar, smug, without any pride.
Born to die, just a wreck.

Always you oppose to me,
With your great disdain.
Pretender, your end is near.
We won't need you anymore.

Lost in many lives.
They're alive with lies.
I'll kill all of them.
Just load another bullet.

Bullets disintegrate flesh.
Lies disintegrate trust.
Forgotten even beyond death,
Every breathe feel my wrath.

Unrealized reckoning day,
I will take my revenge.
No doubt and no fear,
You will beg for death.

I will take what belongs to me.
Eye for eye.
Pay of the disrupted brotherhood.
Tooth for tooth.
Meaningless years passed, now.
Blood for blood.
No excuse or no acception.
Dead or dead.
