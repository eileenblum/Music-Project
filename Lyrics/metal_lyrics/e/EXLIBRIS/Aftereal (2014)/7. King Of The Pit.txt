Fire (fire!) over the fields of sorrow
Burning up their twisted minds
A melody they are sure to follow
Bow down and crawl when the piper calls

I've seen him rise from ashes
I've seen him turn to dust
A preacher of the darkness
The morning star that's forever lost

Thunder (thunder!) far on the dark horizon
Screaming through the darkest night
A eulogy for stars that won't be shining
A child is born under the cross of thorns

I've seen him rule the masses
I've seen him challenge gods
And as the vision flashes
I see a way to shit the dire odds

In a chalice of gold
There's the blood of the old
Keeps the flame in your soul
Burning higher

When the darkness foretold
Shall arise to take hold
Reach inside, take control
Of the fire
