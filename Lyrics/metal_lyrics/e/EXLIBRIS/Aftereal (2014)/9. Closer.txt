I wake up to the sounds of the footsteps walking out the door
Not knowing what the time is or where I've been the night before
Surrounded by darkness
Feels like I've been running for so long

If anything's not ever what it seems
Never ever what it seems
This could be a dream within a dream
Right now...

It's time to break out
From a dream that never came
Time to step back
'Cause it's not a losing game
I'm not afraid of falling
So take me closer to the edge

I turn around, see my shadow fading from the wall
Is this a road to freedom - or am I heading for a fall
Beyond the veil of silence
I am here now and feel so strong

But it never ends, it never fades and it will never pass
The final step towards the end, back through the looking glass
But now...

It's time to break out
From a dream that never came
Take a step back
'Cause it's not a losing game
I'm not afraid of falling
So take me closer to the edge
