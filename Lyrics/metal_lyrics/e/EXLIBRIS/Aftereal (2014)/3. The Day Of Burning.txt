Standing in the fire
It's just you and I at the edge of the world
In the final hour
We're the light that won't shine anymore

One last time
We're here to right all the wrong
Celestial crime
We have been waiting so long

From smoke and dust
To death and rust
Nothing could have saved you

There is no time to waste, pick up the pace
It's only getting worse

Back on the run
The end's begun
Your maker has betrayed you

The dusk of human race, the end of days, the lifting of the curse

In a time of madness
We have come to seize what's beyond your control
It's an act of kindness
You will welcome the end as foretold

One last time
We're here to right all the wrong
Celestial crime
We have been waiting so long

From smoke and dust
To death and rust
Nothing could have saved you

There is no time to waste, pick up the pace
It's only getting worse

Back on the run
The end's begun
Your maker has betrayed you

The dusk of human race, the end of days, the lifting of the curse

The final day
You are the prey
We're here to watch you burning

There is no time to waste, pick up the pace
It's only getting worse

You can't undo
It's all on you

The dusk of human race, the end of days, the lifting of the curse
