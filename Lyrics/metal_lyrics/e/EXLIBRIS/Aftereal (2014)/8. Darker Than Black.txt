There is no way to make this right
You've gone to deep into the night
Now there is nothing you can do (they're onto you)

It's time to settle all the scores
There is no coming back for more
You will be paying all your dues

No turning back
There will be no tomorrow
Your soul will burn down in the fire
Darker than black
Nothing but pain and sorrow
No angel wings to take you higher

Nowhere to run but you can't stay
You now this is the only way
What goes around will come around (they'll make you drown)

You thought you'd win without a fight
Lord for a day, king for a night
But in the end you're going down

No turning back
There will be no tomorrow
Your soul will burn down in the fire
Darker than black
Nothing but pain and sorrow
No angel wings to take you higher

There is no calm before the storm
You will be nothing when it's done
