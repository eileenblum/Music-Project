Winter days
Come and go away
I've been waiting for the sun
For the end that's now begun

Through the years
Lifeless in my dreams
Never found the reason why
All that's real had passed me by

So bring us down, make us forget
But give us an answer
Don't try to hide, don't try to lie
We know your game
We've been blinded by the promise of salvation
(The) time has come for one final revelation

With eyes open wide
I see a new morning
I'm coming alive once again
We dream and we die
We're gone without warning
And only the songs will remain

A dreamer's fate
Challenged to create
A reality with rhymes
That will matter in their time

Caught inside
Between black and white
Staring into starless skies
Drifting in a sea of lies

So bring us down, make us forget
But give us an answer
Don't try to hide, don't try to lie
We know your game
We've been blinded by the promise of salvation
(The) time has come for one final revelation

With eyes open wide
I see a new morning
I'm coming alive once again
We dream and we die
We're gone without warning
And only the songs will remain

Somewhere, waiting to be found
There's a spark of hope
For a life unbound
Somewhere, waking from a dream
To a world unseen
I'm alive
