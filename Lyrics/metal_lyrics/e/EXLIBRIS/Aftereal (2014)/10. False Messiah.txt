Welcome to our race
You cannot win and there's no second place, no!
You think you live the dream
But in the end we'll always make you scream, yeah!

Your hunger for power
Devours the core of your world
Your ivory tower
Will fall
(It's more than you can afford)

On step to have it all
Your journey to become the false messiah
One step to lose control
That's what you get for running with the liar

Welcome to your own hell
Your cries won't be enough to break the spell, no!
Please try to understand
This is what you are now - forever damned, yeah!

Your hunger for power
Devours the core of your world
Your ivory tower
Will fall
(It's more than you can afford)

On step to have it all
Your journey to become the false messiah
One step to lose control
That's what you get for running with the liar
