Don't you see the star that is glowing?
See you're trying to hide now
Don't you see the day that is dawning?
Still your eyes don't want to see the light

Don't you see the eyes that are crying?
As they see you fading
Don't you see the ones that are smiling?
They believe you're gonna find the way

But there's no one who could bring the answers
Do I need to try?
When I'm drowning in the sea of darkness
Can you hear me cry?
When I'm closed inside a shell of silence
What's the reason why?

'Cause I don't wanna be your light
And I don't wanna be the darkness
I wanna face it all just on my own
I'm not afraid of the unknown
Don't need your help or any guidance
I'm gonna find a place where I belong
Gonna bring it home because I feel
I need to be free

You know there's a man that is falling
And his pride's the burden
You know that the man will be soaring
If he lets the morning give him wings

But there's no one who could bring the answers
What's the reason why?

'Cause I don't wanna be your light
And I don't wanna be the darkness
I wanna face it all just on my own
I'm not afraid of the unknown
Don't need your help or any guidance
I'm gonna find a place where I belong
Gonna bring it home because I feel
I need to be free
