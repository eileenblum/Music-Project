Now's the highest time
Nothing to wait for
Better don't look back
Go and leave the earth
The world is turning faster every single day
Raising up the glasses, drinking yesterday
It is hard to follow, hard to find your way
Walking down a forthright alley you may go astray

Looking in the mirror you can't see your face
You are just a copy of somebody else

No!

Selling soul like everybody you are breaking through
It is not so easy now to stand and face the truth

Run away from the faceless place
We are waiting for you
Far away, somewhere out in space
We are waiting for you
