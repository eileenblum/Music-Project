Our eyes are closed, we're waiting
The time is still yet to come
The land of ours we're forsaking
Some things just need to be done

We're waking up as the twilight is near
It knocks out the window, it's calling our name
We hear the voice and everything's clear
Now we can break it away

So we came and we saw
We were searching for glory
Looking at you, with no doubts in our heads
So we came and we saw
With no time to say sorry
Hearing the screams all over again
There in the shadows where your eyes were all ablaze
So we came and we saw
We were searching for glory
They tell the tale of the riders that came in the night
Who could win every soul with no fight

We're coming back as the night fades away
The yellings and screams, they still ring in our minds
The mist's falling down, unveiling the day
Away from the light we will hide
Sleep and wait
The time's still yet to come
We're on our way
Some things just need to be done

So we came and we saw
We were searching for glory
Looking at you, with no doubts in our heads
So we came and we saw
With no time to say sorry
Hearing the screams all over again
There in the shadows where your eyes were all ablaze
So we came and we saw
We were searching for glory
They tell the tale of the riders that came in the night
Who could win every soul with no fight
