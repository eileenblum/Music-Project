It's time to let the bridges burn (no way back)
Have no regrets as we go down with the sun
We've reached the point of no return (can't turn back)
All becomes clear when the damage is done

Take me higher
Let's watch heaven burn
Before it falls down from the sky
Time will tell
If all that we knew was just lies

Take me deeper
Let's make pages turn
Bring light to the world of the blind
In the end
This will be a home to our kind

No way to bring back what is lost (it's all gone)
There's no applause at the end of this play
Of all the rivers we have crossed (we move on)
This is the one that will wash us away

Take me higher
Let's watch heaven burn
Before it falls down from the sky
Time will tell
If all that we knew was just lies

Take me deeper
Let's make pages turn
Bring light to the world of the blind
In the end
This will be a home to our kind

It's time to learn from our mistakes (no regrets)
Be our own saviours, change the rules of the game
What doesn't bend can only break (no weakness)
That is not how they'll remember our names

Take me higher
Let's watch heaven burn
Before it falls down from the sky
Time will tell
If all that we knew was just lies

Take me deeper
Let's make pages turn
Bring light to the world of the blind
In the end
This will be a home to our kind
