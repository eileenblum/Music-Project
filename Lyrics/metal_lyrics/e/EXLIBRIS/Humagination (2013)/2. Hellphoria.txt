Come on, did you not see it coming?
The worldâs spinning out of control
Go on, Youâd better start running
Thereâs nowhere to hide, nowhere to go

Hell yeah, itâs the end of a season
Weâve come to the end of this road
Wake up, itâs all for a reason
The riders are ready to roll

Itâs the end of the world as we know
Open the gates, bring it on
Itâs the end but itâs been quite a show
The death walks the Earth
The devil has left his disguise
Weâre in for one hell of a ride

All the stars are falling
Hear the devil calling
Should be worried but I ainât got the time
A new day wonât be dawning
You wonât see me crawl
Takes more than that to bring me down

Itâs the end of the world as we know
Open the gates, bring it on
Itâs the end but itâs been quite a show
The death walks the Earth
The devil has left...
Itâs the end of the world as we know
Open the gates, bring it on
Itâs the end but itâs been quite a show
The death walks the Earth
The devil has left his disguise
Weâre in for one hell of a ride
