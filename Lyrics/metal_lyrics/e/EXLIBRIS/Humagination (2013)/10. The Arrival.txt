Let me take you on a journey
To a time and space exist no more.
Don't hasitate to join me,
It's a place where dreams become so real.

The road lies before you,
It's the only way you can do no wrong.
Search deeper into your soul
And find a place where life stands still.

Can you hear me? I'll be waiting forever more,
Your nightmares won't stop you from going on.
Can you see me? I'll be wainting to take you home,
Your light finaly will burn and make me lost.

Let me take you on a journey,
I will show you things you've never seen.
Don't think about returning,
We can stay as long as you will need.

So come a little closer,
Don't you be afraid, I will be your guide,
And when the night is over
We'll burn again just close your eyes.

Can you hear me? I'll be waiting forever more,
Your nightmares won't stop you from going on.
Can you see me? I'll be wainting to take you home,
Your light finaly will burn.

Through the firestorm you walk alone,
The road, your own will take you home
Soon you'll reach the place where you can stay.
Through the firestorm you walk alone,
You've go the will to carry on.
Shine your light for all who lost and wait.
