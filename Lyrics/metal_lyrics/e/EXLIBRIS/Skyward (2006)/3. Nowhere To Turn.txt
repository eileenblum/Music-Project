Don't let me fall asleep tonight
Don't let these visions haunt my mind
It feels like falling
Drowning in a sea of light

And in my dream I see you stand
In a cold, forsaken land
There seems to be no other way
But this is not the end

Promise you'll wait for me there
Let us fly on the wings of despair
Now that there's nowhere to turn
May the fire in our hearts forever burn

In this state forever bound
I scream but I can hear no sound
Again I'm falling
Praying soon I'll hit the ground

And then the dream returns to me
A blinding light is all I see
It's time to leave this world behind
And set your spirit free
