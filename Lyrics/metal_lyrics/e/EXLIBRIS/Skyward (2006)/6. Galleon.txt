Leaving all the years
All the days bygone
Starring at the blaze
Of the setting sun

Out there in the waves
Where the night is born
There's my destiny
A tale to be told

Boundless oceans never crossed before
Endless journeys to a distant shore

Carried by the waves, my galleon of life
Sails to the unknown, leaves the land behind
One day I'll reach the edge and take a step beyond
Guided by the stars I'll face my dreams alone

Somewhere in the sky
There's a star of hope
Tonight I see it shine
Brighter than before

Let it lead your way
To the unknown lands
Let the freedom reign
Tomorrow's in your hands

Boundless oceans never crossed before
Endless journeys to a distant shore

Carried by the waves, my galleon of life
Sails to the unknown, leaves the land behind
One day I'll reach the edge and take a step beyond
Guided by the stars I'll face my dreams alone
