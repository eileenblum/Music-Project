See me down in here
Alone  and cold
Covered with fear
My soul is broken
But my heart just won't stop beating

I've tried to break through walls of life
To see what's behind
But all I found was only tears
And dust

Lost inside
I try to scream
So Gods can hear
My only wish
Held deep within
To wash the past away and go (where life begins)

And I welcome raindrops falling
Let them touch my face
Holy water to refine,
To purify me
And I dance among the fallen
Let them know my name
Whatever's written in my fate
Remember me

See them walk away
Afraid and lost
Without an aim
See them run 
And see them ending in destruction

The fire burning in their eyes
Is long since gone
Replaced by memories made of glass
That fall

Lost inside
I try to scream
So Gods can hear
My only wish
Held deep within
To wash the past away and go (where life begins)

And I welcome raindrops falling
