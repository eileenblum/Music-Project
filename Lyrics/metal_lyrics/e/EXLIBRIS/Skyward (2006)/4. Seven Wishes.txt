A whisper in the night
A wish for the day
Away from the crowds
You try to hide again
You've been here before
But something's not the same
Can you hear the voice?
It's calling out your name

Come face the light
It's never been too late
Your soul is like a wanderer
Forever led astray
Come fly with me
On the blazing wings of fate
Be the master of the sky
Armed with the light of day

Seven wishes whispered into the night
Seven ways to reach the edge of time
Flaming riders bringing hope we are
Seven starborn warriors by your side

A whisper for the day
A voice in the night saying
Never give in to
The pain that's deep inside
Let us take your soul
To where the angels dare
Just free your heart and follow
We'll show you the way

Come face the light

Seven wishes whispered into the night
Seven ways to reach the edge of time
Flaming riders bringing hope we are
Seven starborn warriors by your side
Seven wishes whispered into the night
