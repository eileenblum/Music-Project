Running away from the fire
That burns inside your darkened eyes
I want to reach out and release you
From this cage that you designed

A prophet of loss
A king of  shame
Do you believe you can resist
What stands in your way?

Taking a walk through the ashes
- a vision of the things to come
You see the broken pieces
Of lives you used and threw away

A prince of lies
A master of pain
Already past the line that
Separated the insane

Tell me now
Can you explain all that you've seen?
Tell me why
Although you're cold you burn within
I see it now
A battle rages in your head
Still breathing but inside you're almost dead

Running away from the fire
That burns inside your dying eyes
I want to reach out and release you
But the door is locked from inside

You locked yourself
From the light of day
Trapped within your running thoughts
You slowly decay

Tell me now
Can you explain all that you've seen?
Tell me why
Although you're cold you burn within
I see it now
A battle rages in your head
Inside you're almost dead

I sing the words born deep within
And let them be carried by the wind

Tell me now
Can you explain all that you've seen?
Tell me why
Although you're cold you burn within
I see it now
A battle rages in your head
Still breathing but inside you're almost dead
