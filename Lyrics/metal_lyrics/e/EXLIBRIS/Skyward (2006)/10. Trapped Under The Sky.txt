The sound of the rain
Brings visions of angels crying in shame
The raindrops play
A melody of sadness a song with no name

I sing the words born deep within
And let them be carried by the wind

Listen
The symphony of life
Is fading out
Remember
We're bound here together
Forever trapped under the sky

Another rhyme
The notes changed but words remain the same
This is the time
To ease the crying angels' pain

I sing the words born deep within
And let them be carried by the wind
