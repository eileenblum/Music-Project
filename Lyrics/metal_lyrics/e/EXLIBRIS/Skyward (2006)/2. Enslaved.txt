No, I'm not gonna break
I've come to far
To turn and walk away
The time has come for me to change
My fate

Can you hear the battle calling?
This will be a glorious day
Some will join the fallen
Many meet their death

This is the only way:
To walk ahead
The choice has been made
There is nothing left to lose
anyway

Can you see the day is dawning?
It's time to face the end
With the sword I'm holding
I'll ride into the blaze

I will fight this battle
I will not just stand and wait
Forsaken by the world
Enslaved by my own hate

My soul's a shattered mirror
And I no longer have a name
But I won't be forgotten
On my final day

No, I won't lose my faith
I never have
There's still a chance to win
The gates of destiny are open to me

Just one more step and I'll be
Free from my chains
My lord is Victory
He can't be betrayed
