Have you seen the death
Walk beside you?
Ever so near, yet you cannot hear its voice
I remember tears
Drops of cold blood
Falling like rain, creating an endless stream of pain

I never wanted them to know my anger
Never wished to see them filled with fear
Will this nightmare be there with me forever, burning together
With me forever, burning together

Why can't I forget
The sight of heaven in flames?
The ashes of memories
Are now like lines in the sand

I greet the setting sun
And welcome the night
Feeling the winter's cold in my dead wings
Darkness clouds my sight
Now without a light of hope
I'll roam the world with death as my guide

I never wanted them to know my anger
Never wished to see them filled with fear
Will this nightmare be there with me forever, burning together
With me forever, burning together

Why can't I forget
The sight of heaven in flames?
The ashes of memories
Are now like lines in the sand
