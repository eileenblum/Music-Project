Can they ever forgive us
We never thought this moment would come in our lives
Deafening silence, not a single voice in a song thatâs been fading out
Donât try looking for answers â all you need youâve always felt inside
Every moment will bring a new note from within, we will sing for our sins
Just give in nowâ¦

And I know that we can change
Before the music stops
And it all fades to black

Took me so long to realize
It was only an echo â the beat of our hearts
Songs of the timeless, the distant noise we thought we could live without
All of us are the answer â in the choir weâll find a brand new start
Step inside, it is time, find your voice, join the rhyme, at the end of our time
Let us sing nowâ¦

And I know that we can change
Before the music stops
And it all fades to black

And I know there is a way
Up there between the stars
So they donât fade to black for us

Thereâs a chance for a new day
New balance can be found
Before all fades to black for us

All fades to blackâ¦
