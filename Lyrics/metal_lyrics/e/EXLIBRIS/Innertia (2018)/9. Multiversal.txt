Shadows arising, knocking on our doors
Weâve been waiting for the longest time and now itâs done
For the ages, eating at our souls
Weâve been walking blind and waiting for a wake up call

Weâre gonna dream what we wanna dream â weâre gonna
Weâre gonna leave when we wanna leave
Nothing seems what it really is
If weâre kept in the darkness

All trapped within this illusion
Enslaved but we donât understand
The time works for the masters
The hourglass turns at the end

Breaking the silence, let the curtain fall
Is it time for us to finally see what lies beyond

Weâre gonna dream what we wanna dream â weâre gonna
Weâre gonna leave when we wanna leave
Nothing seems what it really is
If weâre kept in the darkness

All trapped within this illusion
Enslaved but we donât understand
The time works for the masters
The hourglass turns at the end
