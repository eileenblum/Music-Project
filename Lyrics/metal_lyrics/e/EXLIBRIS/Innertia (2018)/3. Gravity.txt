So long, gravity â Itâs been nice to know you for a while
Need no charity â staying down below just ainât our style
Letâs take this opportunity to rise above the haze of wasted time
Itâs time to cross the line

(Onwards)
Here comes the revolution
(Full force)
There is no turning back, just one solution
Back in the game
Becoming one with the flame

(Stand strong)
This is your final warning
(Hold on)
The stormâs not over, a new day is dawning
Right till the end
Weâre here to make a stand

Itâs the reckoning â a call to those who saw beyond the lie
An awakening â to find your wings and soar against the sky
This is our only medicine â the inner flame reflecting in your eyes
While nothingâs what it seemed before
The fire burns forevermore
And even when we sail against the tide
The spirit never dies

(Stand strong)
This is your final warning
(Hold on)
The stormâs not over, a new day is dawning
Right till the end
Weâre here to make a stand
