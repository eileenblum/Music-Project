There comes a day to forget all you relied on
There comes a time to forget all that you knew
You will learn to see things in a new way as the night falls
All that matters is the deeds Iâll make you do

Rise in anger
Time to remember â we live for danger
This world will never see the truthâ¦ oh no
Stronger, greater
Never surrender â weâre the offenders
This world will burn when we are through

You and I are the way and the future lies at our feet
No regrets, itâs all set, take the step, enjoy the view

Rise in anger
Time to remember â we live for danger
This world will never see the truthâ¦ oh no
Stronger, greater
Never surrender â weâre the offenders
This world will burn when we are through
