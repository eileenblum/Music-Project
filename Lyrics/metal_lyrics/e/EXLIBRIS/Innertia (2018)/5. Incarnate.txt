Living the dream â for a while â where daylight dies
There are worlds you canât see with open eyes
Step right in, tonight the veil is thin
You believe what you see â thereâs so much more
On a journey that begins with open doors
New galaxies but now Iâve seen it all

Iâm coming home
Nowhere else I would go
Iâve seen this world and beyond
Itâs time to move on
Iâm coming home

In the eye of the storm â no room for lies
Out of reach for all those who paid the price
Sometimes one just has to roll the dice

One day your dreams will make you walk into the fire
Burning away what is left of your days
Within those dreams you can soar even higher
With no other place left to go

Iâm coming home
Only place I belong
Iâve seen this world and beyond
Itâs time to move on
Iâm coming home
The end of my road

One day your dreams will make you walk into the fire
Burning away what is left of your days
Within those dreams you can soar even higher
With no other place left to go

Iâm coming home
Nowhere else I would go
Iâve seen this world and beyond
Itâs time to move on
Iâm coming home
Iâm coming home
The place I belong
Been gone for so long
Iâve seen this world and beyond

This is my home

Living the dream â for a while â where daylight dies
There are worlds you canât see with open eyes
Step right in, tonight the veil is thin
