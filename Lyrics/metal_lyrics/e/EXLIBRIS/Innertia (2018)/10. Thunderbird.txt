A ray of light
In an fiery dawn
Weâll celebrate the night
The coming of the storm

Turn back
Step into the night so black
Forget all youâve ever learnt
Itâs always been us against the world

Step forth
A wild wind blows from the north
Be ready to spread your wings
Rise over the noise tomorrow brings

Thunder roars inside of you
Louder every day
In this world just passing through
Into the never

Oh, riding the wings of the storm
Gone with the dust and from ashes reborn
Oh, heading into the unknown
A whirlwind of fire and thunder
The wings of the storm

Once more
Where no man has gone before
There wonât be no guiding light
So turn back and step into the night

Arise
The flame burning in your eyes
The blood flowing through your veins
A part of the force that canât be tamed

Thunder roars inside of you
Louder every day
In this world just passing through
Beyond forever

Oh, riding the wings of the storm
Gone with the dust and from ashes reborn
Oh, heading into the unknown
A whirlwind of fire and thunder
The wings of the storm

Oh, I see the light of new dawn
Gone is the night, here comes the storm
Let this be the day
The world finally listens to those who have something to say

Oh, riding the wings of the storm
Gone with the dust and from ashes reborn
Oh, heading into the unknown
A whirlwind of fire and thunder
The wings of the storm
