Iâm on my way
Been watching the world in shades of grey
And though my eyes are tired
The need still feeds the fire

Another day
Still hoping the clouds will go away
And when I see a ray of light

Iâm gonna shoot for the sun
Donât care if it blinds me
Forget what is done
I leave it behind me
I feel it â the spirit
Trapped inside the darkness of the night

Let it embrace me
Hold on to the light
Let nothing escape me
Inspired â like fire
I wonât go out without a fight

Iâm on my way
Joined by the ones who couldnât stay
But though we run together
I know itâs now or never

Another day
Spinning in this endless ballet
But now I know the time is right

Iâm gonna shoot for the sun
Donât care if it blinds me
Forget what is done
I leave it behind me
I feel it â the spirit
Trapped inside the darkness of the night

Let it embrace me
Hold on to the light
Let nothing escape me
Inspired â like fire
I wonât go out without a fight
