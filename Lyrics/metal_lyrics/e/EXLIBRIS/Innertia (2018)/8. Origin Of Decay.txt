Unleash the fire
Let it burn out of control
Feed your desires
The world is on its knees, thatâs how we roll

Unrelenting
Time to settle all the scores
Cue the ending
Letâs see it turn to dust forevermore

Burn every dream
Break every bone
Let go of your fears
And let me set you free

Hear every scream
Left on your own
I am what you need
So let me turn the key
Unleash the demon in me

Beyond the boundaries
Break outside to look within
Like astral armies
The pieces are in place, the game begins

Neverending
Another day might never come
The night descending
Letâs take another step before itâs done

Burn every dream
Break every bone
Let go of your fears
And let me set you free

Hear every scream
Left on your own
I am what you need
So let me turn the key
Unleash the demon in me

Lost in your steps, aimless you roamed â never to return
Your dreams in decay, in the eye of the storm â thereâs one who knows the way
Once you were broken but never again

Burn every dream
Break every bone
Let go of your fears
And let me set you free

Hear every scream
Left on your own
I am what you need
So let me turn the key
Unleash the demon in me
