Trapped at the bottom of my mind
Stars perfectly aligned now
But Iâm the one to draw the line
No more poison for the soul
Iâll find a way, regain control

If hope is gone, then come what may
Thereâs never gonna be another day

Iâve seen the end and what comes next
I know, I know
There is no shelter from the storm
Spoken with the architect
I know, I know
His crown wonât grow another thorn
No shelter from the storm
Nowhere to turn, weâve been left on our own

Breathe, let the poison out your lungs
Let words roll of your tongue now
No use in waiting for a sign
Countless questions never asked
Iâll live this day like itâs my last

If hope is gone, then come what may
Thereâs never gonna be another day

Iâve seen the end and what comes next
I know, I know
There is no shelter from the storm
Spoken with the architect
I know, I know
His crown wonât grow another thorn
No shelter from the storm
Nowhere to turn, weâve been left on our own
