Earth and the sky, truth and the lie
In a perfect cycle
Fires of Hell, the guardian who fell
In a downward spiral
Is this cosmic balance
What itâs meant to be
On through the days we carry the weight
So for all eternity

Run with me
Across the planes of power
Resonate throughout the tiers
(The voice becomes clear)
Set me free
In the final hour
Dance with the spheres
To the edge of your dreams

Days in the light turn into night
Itâs an endless struggle
Heavens above, the guardians of love
Powers undeniable
Joining all the planets.
In their silent glee
Carry the tune, Itâs over too soon
Now into infinity

Run with me
Across the planes of power
Resonate throughout the tiers
(The voice becomes clear)
Set me free
In the final hour
Dance with the spheres
To the edge of your dreams
