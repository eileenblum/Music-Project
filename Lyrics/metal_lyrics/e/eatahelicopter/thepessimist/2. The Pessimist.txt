This is the end!
Bury your head!
This is Hell!

After so many sleepless nights I have come to the final conclusion
If countless before me have failed by Your grace then I know I cannot survive in this desolate place

With a final glance to an empty sky
He turned to watch his love die

She cried out as if someone would save her from her ever-approaching demise
Choking on her blood she cried:
"Oh God, save this man!"

Here is your answer!
To all of your questions
There is no God here!
Only you and Death

There is no Hope!

You will die with the rest of those who have abandoned me
Abandoned me!

Traitor!
You are the only one I've ever needed!
