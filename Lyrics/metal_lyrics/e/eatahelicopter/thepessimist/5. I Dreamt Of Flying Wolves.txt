Oh little one you look so sad
More tragic than the worst murder scene with those knives in your hands
You're so full of pain it's no wonder what's under your skin

Keep your head up!
And don't look back!
Not because you're scared
Because you have Faith!
Don't worry your fragile heart!
I'll be back for you in time!

You're the darkest star in the sky with those black eyes of yours
Now I know what's in your heart it's so cold

Everyone has the chance to be saved
It's in our hearts
Just have a bit of Faith!

Oh little one you're so murderous with them dead at your feet
You're alone!
Inhale the stale silence as you collapse to the ground
I will not abandon you!

You call this Hell!
I believe, you're mistaken!

You may have forgotten me but I am still here for you
All your suffering will end with me!
