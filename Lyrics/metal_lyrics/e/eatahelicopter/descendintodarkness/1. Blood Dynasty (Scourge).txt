Are you alive?!
All you Zombies bounce!
This is your judgment day!
There is no escape, this is your judgment day!
From the brimstone born of fire, we defile every city with our soul killing plague
It's desecration from an unholy birth
When there's no more room in hell the dead will walk the earth!
We consume the flesh, never to subside
Now there's nowhere left to hide!
Only the Devil can save them now!
Only the Devil can save them now!
Bathed in the blood of the innocent
A breach of trust with fraudulent intent
Thousands are spreading their consuming disease
Tearing at your jugular we infect mankind with ease!
Now our time has come
For us to make our rise
From this Hell, I break free
This is my Destiny!
From the depths, I rise up
I make my Destiny!
From this Hell, we break free
This is our Destiny!
From the depths, we rise up
This is our Destiny!
Only the Devil can save them now!
Only the Devil can save them now!
Are you alive?!
All you Zombies bounce!
For far too long we've been held at our demise
Now's our time to rise!
