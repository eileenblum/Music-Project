She imprisoned me!
My world, a cacophony of opalescent galaxies
I swore this could be everlasting
I swore this could be everlasting!

Now i stand before the funeral pyre broken and free
Consumed by a ravenous hunger in atonement of my misery
Forsaken, rapidly I begin destroying every delicate treasure that held any meaning for me

We have unleashed upon this earth an immortal, cursed phage
An unholy son beget of eternal wrath and rage

A life devoid of love is nothing to adore
You become exactly what you abhor
A life devoid of love is nothing to adore
You become exactly what you abhor

I come to stand inside a hopelessly darkened land
Where light cannot be found in the smallest grain of sand
Dispossessed, I finally begin to see the beauty of life created from love for me

This kingdom, I shall conquer
In remembrance of a love once lost!
This kingdom, I shall build
In the hopes of its return!

Noooo...

You are still dead to me
You are still dead to me!

Dead
