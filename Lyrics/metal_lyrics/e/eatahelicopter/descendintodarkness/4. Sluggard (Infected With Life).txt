From this point on you and I are no longer friends
I can't believe you chose to give up in the end
Silhouettes of a life never lived fade in the distance
Now you are truly alone
Destruction is at hand
By this, I mean your own
Petrified of losing a life that's already been lost
Sacrificing your dreams was worth more than the cost
If you're so sure all is lost your probably right
You've renounced all hope and you haven't even tried
Try
It's sad to say I will never see you again
I wish I had known how to save you back then
Captivated by fear of what lies up ahead
Devoid of aspirations, you're already dead
You are dead like the rest of them
You are dead like the rest of them
From your death I become infected with life
Life
Petrified of losing a life that's already been lost
Sacrificing your dreams was worth more than the cost
If you're so sure all is lost your probably right
You've renounced all hope and you haven't even tried
You've already lost
You've already lost
