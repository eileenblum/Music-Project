Maggot Mouth
You will be destroyed
Maggot Mouth
You will be destroyed
I will take your will to live
I will kill everything you love
Tergiversation is the start of your damnation
Leeches are writhing underneath my skin
Worthless parasites born of human sin
Worthless parasites born of human sin
You!
You!
Tergiversation is the start of your damnation
Leeches are writhing underneath my skin
Worthless parasites born of human sin
Worthless parasites born of human sin
You are nothing but a waste of life
When you look in your eyes you know you're the reason why
Maggot Mouth
You will be destroyed
Maggot Mouth
You will be destroyed
