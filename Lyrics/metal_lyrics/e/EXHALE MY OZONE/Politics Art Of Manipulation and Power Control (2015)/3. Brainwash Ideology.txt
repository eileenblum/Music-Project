Brainwashed
Look at me and you look at yourself
Are we able to think analytically?
Did you value your own life?
Did you simply believe?

I just want to punch you in the face
Make your eyes and nose bleed into infinity
Gather all of your wealth before your eyes
And watch them burn in front of your families, your crony
Your boss, the one who create this mess
Iâll spit in their face, Iâm not going to be fooled by them anymore
Am I the only one?
Who can see their ideology?
Donât tell me everyone's mind
Has already fabricated
Fabricated

Look at me and you look at yourself
Are we able to think analytically?
Did you value your own life?
Did you simply believe?
Why?
Throughout the ages
We have confined ourselves
Within these brainwashed lies
I can hear their laughing from their face
Iâve been watching this process over and over again
Gouge my eyes and throw it to the sky
Gouge my eyes and throw it to the sky
Unlock your mind and believe in yourself
Itâs time to stop being brainwashed
- As a weapon to lie about facts,
Steer opinion, and trigger people's ignorance
We will pay
A price for our ignorance.
