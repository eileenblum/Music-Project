The ancient times, left us all with the proof
The existing needs, will never satisfy a man
For our unlimited wants, is totally infinite
The self-annihilation, shall lead by our own kind
Demon will reign
Pestilence, shall fall upon mankind
Again in the largest scale
Doomed since birth
All path shall lead to same destination
Meaning, all the choices have no meaning
Forsaken and left to die
We all left here to die, meaning?
Suffer, our life born from the suffer
Intelligent, damning us, lead to our own destruction
Deprogrammed to against what we are
This concrete reality life, is undeniable
Suffer, we are to suffer
For they patiently waiting the new world order
Ignorant will be our weaknesses
We all will slowly fall after they done with mass genocide
The rich wears the crown, while the rest are debt slaves
The rich wears the crown, while the rest are debt slaves
The dead shall rise
Shall drag them together in hell

Crown shall means nothing
Payback in hell they will
Crown shall means nothing
Payback in hell they will
Crown shall means nothing
Payback in hell, no one escapes

Swallow my planet, black holes do swallow my planet
Blackout the universe
Perish this worthless universe

Swallow my planet, black holes do swallow my planet
