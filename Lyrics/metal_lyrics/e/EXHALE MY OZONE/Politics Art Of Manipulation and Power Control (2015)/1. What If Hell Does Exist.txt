Again I'm awake from my endless tortured
And here Iâm dying for a countless time

Neck binds to the chains
Trillions needles fills in my throat
Realizing rotten flesh is now
Part of my skins
Drowning in the deep of burning flames
Oh the devils enjoy the sensation
Maggots moving aggressively
From my lungs to my nose
Endless burning minds, body and souls

I can't speak, I canât see myself here
And my eyes slowly fall from the socket
No words can ever describe this pain.

Neck binds to the chains
Trillions needles fills in my throat
Realizing rotten flesh is now
Part of my skins
Drowning in the deep of burning flames
Oh the devils enjoy the sensation
Maggots moving aggressively
From my lungs to my nose
Endless burning minds, body and souls
Once you came, you canât escape
You can pray for me, hell yeah if I care
Let me welcome you
Since Lucifer isnât here
Welcome to hell, your home forever.
