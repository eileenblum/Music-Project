Unchained
This cursed iron fate and put to their neck
Unchained our minds from being controlled them again
Millions promises will be used to bind our eyes
And they will keep confusing us by their lies
For they can't let us know the truth
A platform for their own benefits
A thirst for the money and power
A wanting for control has arise
Skillful magician they have become
I can see corruption spreads among us
Poisoning civilization minds
Through the net of mass media.
So do the process manipulation the people
Has already begin
Through our daily life
Where is our self-consciousness?
Our generations will be doomed
Our generations being manipulated
Is this our destiny?
I can see corruption spreads among us
Poisoning civilization minds
Through the net of mass media
And they will keep improve their trick
As a magician politician, must perfect

We blindfolded, deaf ourselves to government transparency
Rule by money and power
As a magician politician, must perfect
Why are we cutting our own tongue and
Torturing our own eyes to bleed by their actions
Bleed by their actions
Screw your magic!
I will break your Magic,
Your filthy trick for the sake of my generation.
