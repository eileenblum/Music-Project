Creative creation for your own death
Proud for nothing, proud for a failure
We should have stopped it, before it got this far.

And now, your precious machine turned against you
Pulling yourself down further
Into this hole
And now, your precious machine turned against you
Pulling yourself down further
Into this hole

Call you to suffering...
You made the machine, you made the end
Easy eradication of the human race
You made the machine, you made the end
Easy eradication of the human race
You made the machine, you made the end
Easy eradication of the human race
You made the machine, you made the end
Easy eradication of the human race

Now you've begin to descending your own life
You begin to take, the other down with you,
Descending
Now youâve begin to descending down to hell
You begin to take, the other down with you
Descending..... Descending...
Descending into endless Void
You fall drastically,
You went overboard
You fall drastically,

You went overboard
Victims of the machine, victims of the machine
This is not what you truly desired
Despite that your mind is tremble in delusion
Why believe in the false miracles
When you are tremble in delusion
Vicious creation for your own death
Pride is defiled, failure has been unveiled
Unveiled.
Your valued machine had betrayed you
Dragging yourself down further into this dark pit
Cauterize to agony, agony...

[Wahtsonâs solo]

Creative creation for your own death
To descending into endless void.
Descending into Endless Void.
