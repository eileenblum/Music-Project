Help, set us free.
"When the world has lost their faith
And they shall see the world with blind eyes"
Survive from this infection
Behold, this is just the beginning
So prepare for
The war that we have started
To this earth, weâll just dig our own grave.
Soon he'll sent his army,
For the cleansing of this earth
And for the last time question
Where is our saviour?
Soon he'll sent his angel,
For the cleansing of this earth
And for the last time question
Where is our saviour?
I'll be saved again? Or just lets us burn, burn...
Pray for our saviour
Survive from this infection
Be strong, this is just the beginning
The path to hell look so wide,
Time, is getting worst for lives
Path, time, lives...
âI will pray
With my spirit
And I will try, for the rest of my life
If this is, the only way to saved myself
From rot in hell and burnâ
Eradicate this disease
Eradicate this disease
Eradicate this disease
Eradicate this disease
