[Music by Aydan, Damna / lyrics by Damna]

You don't wanna see the other side of me
Don't wanna get involved in my own situation
You wouldn't believe in what you'd see
Cause you think I'm just a loser crazy bastard

I don't wanna run away - I just want you to get away
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely I will stay
I don't need your empathy, your envy or your jealousy
You'll always, always be a backward step from me

[Chorus]
I feel alive cause I'm a loser today and so I'll be tomorrow
I feel insane but that's my nature and I'll never change for the "YOUR" better

Like in a clearence sale, you see a heart display
They're all the same and they all look like they rotten
The new collection gives the best that you can get:
The heart of mine that beats to the rhythm of this sad song
I will never run away - I just want you to get away
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely I will stay
Don't you think you prick the giant without being wiped away
You'll always, always be a backward step from me

[Chorus]
I feel alive cause I'm a loser today and so I'll be tomorrow
I feel insane but that's my nature and I'll never change for the "YOUR" better
Behind the veil there is a lunatic with his out of tune emotions
Madness saved me from all of your average lies - average lies

[Spoken]:
Never. Oh Never. Nothing will die. The stream flows, the wind blows,
The cloud fleets and the heart beats. Nothing will die
[From David Lynch's "the Elephant Man"]

[Solo: Rapahel, Aydan]

[Chorus]
I feel alive cause I'm a loser today and so I'll be tomorrow
I feel insane but that's my nature and I'll never change for the "YOUR" better
Behind the veil there is a lunatic with his out of tune emotions
Madness saved me from all of your average lies - average lies
