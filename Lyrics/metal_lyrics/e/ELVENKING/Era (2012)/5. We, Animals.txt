[Music and lyrics by Aydan]

Outraged by world's injustice
As soon at home we beat our kids
Out there our sons are rioting
Our confidence is trembling

We ruin our life to reach a scope
And when we win we crash the hopes
We dance between rise and fall
No, we're not fucking animals

[Chorus]
We fight to stay alive
Trying to survive
We're hunting high and low
As our dark secrets come to light

We love the way we are
We hate the way they look
And for a single beat of heart
Yeah, we're just fucking animals

We struggle hard so find the Love
Just to regret the way we were
We love, we hate - no compromise
We cheat on as they close their eyes

We're ego thinking for ourselves
Selfish till the end
We pretend to be someone
Oh yes, you're just an animal!

We cry just for what is right
We left what we would need to fight
Against all immorality
We are ready for rioting

Whenever we're crying
Someone will keep on sighing
It pains us to see that
Our beloved sons stand surviving

[Chorus]
We fight to stay alive
Trying to survive
We're hunting high and low
As our dark secrets come to light

We love the way we are
We hate the way they look
And for a single beat of heart
Yeah, we're just fucking animals
