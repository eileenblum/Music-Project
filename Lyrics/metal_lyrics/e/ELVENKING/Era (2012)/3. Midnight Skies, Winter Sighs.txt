[Music by Aydan, lethien / lyrics by Aydan]

[Chorus]
As I walk this mad paved with angriness and pain
The Tree of Life is eating with its roots below my feet
Everytime I try to catch the tail of a shooting star above
My hands remain so empty and inside me there's a void

Midnight skies
Winter sighs
On morning dews verse of poetry

Reaching heights
Walking miles
To hear your voice reciting

Every word is a verse of pure harmony
Every single one.

[Chorus]
As I walk this mad paved with angriness and pain
The Tree of Life is eating with its roots below my feet
Everytime I try to catch the tail of a shooting star above
My hands remain so empty and inside me there's a void

Summer nights
Suffused lights
Words barely and softly spoken

Hidden frights
Secret rites
Signs of promise brokeen

As the sky is reflecting its blazing gold
Mysteries unfold

[Chorus]
As I walk this mad paved with angriness and pain
The Tree of Life is eating with its roots below my feet
Everytime I try to catch the tail of a shooting star above
My hands remain so empty and inside me there's a void
