[Music and lyrics by Damna]

I saw a star tonight -
It was beautiful, untouchable
I saw a miracle happening up in the sky
I feel I don't have the strenght to do what is right
Oh what's right
I feel everything's crumbling down
And I try to survive
I see a crack in the wall -
It is happening - still frightening
I stare as time goes by
In front of my eyes
I feel I don't have the strenght to do what is right
Oh what's right
I feel everything's crumbling down
And I try to survive

[CHORUS]

It's like reading a letter addressed to someone else
Saying that everything will be alright
It's like saying "I love you",
With nothing in return
Thinking that this is the time of your life - the time of your life
Now I feel it is hurting so bad,
All the pain is driving me mad
'Cause I've been waiting for this time to come
Instead I'm walking alone

[CHORUS]

It's like reading a letter addressed to someone else
Saying that everything will be alright
It's like saying "I love you",
With nothing in return
Thinking that this is the time of your life - the time of your life
Walking hand in hand in my dreams,
Darling...oh will it come true?
