[Music by Damna, Aydan / lyrics by Damna]

Since he was born, he'd tried to figure it out
Searching for something, just to not moon about
One day he saw a little red riding hood
He fell in love and followed her through the woods

Day after day he lurked with fear behing the trees
Sure that a bad-looking wolf would've put her ill at ease
"A wolf will never feel" - that is what they say
Teeth and claws to hunt and butcher, slaughter, kill and slay

[Chorus]
"I'd do anything to hear her sweet voice calling my name
I won't be the same, in the arms of my Love
I'll find her a little gift and I will love her all I can
The love of a wolf - not the love of a man"

And walking on, the little red riding star
Just with her beauty she was healing his scars

The only chance to let her know how he felt
Eating her grandma and sneak into her bed
But she started screaming loud "oh help me please!"
The wolf was struck with what they call "the broken heart disease"
And as a ray of light would come from up above
The wolf got killed and with a smile died in the name of love

[Chorus]
"I'd do anything to hear her sweet voice calling my name
I won't be the same, in the arms of my Love
I'll find her a little gift and I will love her all I can
The love of a wolf - not the love of a man"
