[Music and lyrics by Damna]

In this dark and lonely place
I feel like I've fallen from grace
The outsider for a lifetime hiding from their vicious eyes
The lights are out but I am in
The ice is melting on my skin
The cold winds blow deep into my dreams freezing all that's left of me
I've always felt this misery
I guess something is broken deep inside of me
And I am feeling so alone
I'm afraid I will never find my healing

[Chorus]
I've lost my way
I've lost my light
I've lost the stars inside my night
I've lost the things that I've been dreamin' - dreamin' of
Oh here they come with forks and fire
My destruction they desire
"Monster! Monster!" they are screaming like they've finally found their cure
They take me, torture and beat me
All they wanna do is bury me
And get rid of what they fear, 'cause I am the monster!
I've always felt this miisery
I guess something is broken deep insieme of me
And I am feeling all alone
I'm afraid I will never find my healing

[Chorus]
I've lost my way
I've lost my light
I've lost the stars inside my night
I've lost the things that I've been dreamin' - dreamin' of
Just a single day - one more single day
Inside this cage and I'll fade away
I've lost my way
I've lost my light
I've lost the stars inside my night
(Je vis parce que je rÃ¨ve//Je suis le monstre)

[Solo: Aydan]

[Chorus]
I've lost my way
I've lost my light
I've lost the stars inside my night
I've lost the things that I've been dreamin' - dreamin' of
Just a single day - one more single day
Inside this cage and I'll fade away
I've lost my way
I've lost my light
I've lost the stars inside my night
