[Bonus Track][Music and lyrics by Aydan]

I stare at these words
They look empty and frozen
Their meaning has faded away
With echoes of shattered dreams

Don't ask me for longing
Don't search any serenity
Here it rests all dead and still
While I try to restore my loss of faith

[Solo: Rafhael]

I look back to what's up
There is something up in the wind
What has been done, already been done
Nothing is going to change from what has become

Someone looks for delight
Someone lives with grey inside
As it would be the only way to survive
I am! The grey inside

[CHORUS]
Don't stay here any longer
It's not worth all the pain
The sufference you need to feel
All the words and all the tears
And all the glances and aim to reach for something
The craving for than one

[Solo: Aydan]

[CHORUS]
Don't stay here any longer
It's not worth all the pain
The sufference you need to feel
All the words and all the tears
And all the glances and aim to reach for something
The craving for than one
