[Music and lyrics by Aydan]

Mankind
Mother of this bad child
Father of these wayward sons
What did you do so wrong?

Angels
Fallen from divine anger
We're vultures with black spread wings
We're the wickedest weaks

Bestowed to the grand and blue open sky
My lullaby
Served and sung between these lies
For the Allies

When an oldie read my runes
Realized my life's a boom
A deadly gift form the divine skies
Open wide

And my life must have a scope
Until breathe at least I hope
It's time to plan ahead

[CHORUS]

A way to find
Words to speak to show your frozen era
As the furtuneteller reveals your secret aims
Ecstasy, fanned by Her erotic fantasies
You're a dweller in the demons' flames
And your name will be proclaimed

These lands
Raped by your own bloody hands
Used to be clad with golden cloaks
And honest folks

I'll be the storm for evil deeds
For all your breed
I'll be deluge for your mistakes
It is going to ache

And my life now has a scope
Until I see the at least I hope
The masterplan begins, begins....it is gonna begin!

[CHORUS]
A way to find
Words to speak to show your frozen era
As the furtuneteller reveals your secret aims
Ecstasy, fanned by Her erotic fantasies
You're a dweller in the demons' flames
And your name will be proclaimed

[Solo: Rahael / Classic guitar solo: Aydan]

[CHORUS]
A way to find
Words to speak to show your frozen era
As the furtuneteller reveals your secret aims
Ecstasy, fanned by Her erotic fantasies
You're a dweller in the demons' flames
And your name will be proclaimed
