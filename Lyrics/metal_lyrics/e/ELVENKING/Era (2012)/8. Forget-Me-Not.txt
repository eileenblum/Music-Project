[Music by Aydan, rafhael / lyrics by Aydan]

We are what we daydream to be
The world ends the day of our death
Forget-me-not...

I'm saying lies, false to myself
Trying to persuade and be convincing
While the frost breaks up my shell
For instance...

Silence and the deepest dark
Are going to be again sweetest company
As long as I trust them

And now I need to face another night
Memories and thoughts come back alive
And bite!

[Chorus]

I'll forget the way I feel
I'll forget the way you look deep into my eyes
Telling "Please I need you, you are mine"

I'll forget the pain inside
I'll forget the way you're asking me for something more
Telling that Love does not mean "enough"

I'm naked, clad just with my pride
Trying to be believable to myself
While you walked out of my life
And I swear

Now I will be one with all my fault
I need to run away and try to vault
...beyond!

[Chorus]

I'll forget the way I feel
I'll forget the way you look deep into my eyes
Telling "Please I need you, you are mine"

I'll forget the pain inside
I'll forget the way you're asking me for something more
Telling that Love does not mean "enough"

Was crying on the floor
Please open that door
For all of that night
These words saved my life

Was drowning in this crime
You came in just in time
I beg you, forget-me-not
And save my life

[Solo: Aydan, hymn: Rafhael]

[Chorus]

I'll forget the way I feel
I'll forget the way you look deep into my eyes
Telling "Please I need you, you are mine"

I beg you, please let me decay
I am declining with my past
I beg you, here is my serenade
A rigmarole, a spell cast

[Solo licks: Aydan, Rafhael]
