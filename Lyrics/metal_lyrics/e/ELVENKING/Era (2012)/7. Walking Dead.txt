[Music and lyrics by Damna]

There'll come a moment in life
When you will realize
You'll need a second just for breathing - breathing

Don't have to fight the instinct
And finally (you'll) say goodbye
To bars and chains and to your prison - prison

You're a man in black and white in a world of colours
You seem alive but deep inside your heart is cold
Don't surrender to indifference, to your shallow world
Or with the dead you're gonna walk

[Chorus]

You are the walking spirit
You are the dead of night
You are the fallen angel
You're here to kill the light

You got to handle the thorns
To get your own red rose
And let your passions be led by the bleeding

So get the main role in this movie that we all call life
Don't be a walker-on- don't be the walking dead

You're a man in black and white in a world of colours
You seem alive but deep inside your heart is cold
Don't surrender to indifference, to your shallow world
Or with the dead you're gonna walk

[Chorus]

You are the walking spirit
You are the dead of night
You are the fallen angel
You're here to kill the light

[Solo: Teemu Mantysaari]

[Chorus]

You are the walking spirit
You are the dead of night
You are the fallen angel
You're here to kill the light
