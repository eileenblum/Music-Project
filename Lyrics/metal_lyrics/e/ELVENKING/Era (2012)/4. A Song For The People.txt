[Music and lyrics by Aydan]

Staring at the horizon with all years that weigh
Said old Tom Walton: "Life's not here to wait"
And cheering and toasting with no so clear mind
"To pay and to die there's always time"

Marion does not look back to what's done
But let her feel before she has gone
While Mr Lancaster, as it clearly appears
Is just aiming for another blonde beer

Don't fear the horizon
Trust me, a road will lead you there
And all of your love's going to remain untouched
It's you certainty, whenever wherever you go

And while little Dolly is awaiting the train
Hoping its iron will lead her away
Mrs Jude Marple smiles to the Plough
For all of the joys life can be bestowed
