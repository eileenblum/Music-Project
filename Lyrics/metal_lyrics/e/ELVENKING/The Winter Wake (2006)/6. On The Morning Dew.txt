[Music / Lyrics: Aydan]

At the border of the plain where suddenly the forest dies
On the first day of the season
When the moon will shine full in the sky
I will wait for you there bathed by a magic light
I will wait, I will pray for this moment to become alive
For this night I will see as an elf clad in leaves
YouÂ´re going to see myself the fairy of your secret dreams
Even if all this belongs to worlds of fantasy
For this time, only this night everything is fair, belongs to me
One night fantasy...

[Chorus:]
Live my every breath, my every touch, my every single sigh
Seizing hold of every glance
As the dayÂ´s passing by begins a wonderful sight
Dancing on the moment dew, the dawn has come only for you
I look up at the sky for the stars to be my guide
At the border of the plain where suddenly the forest dies
On the first day of the season
When the moon will shine full in the sky
I waited for you there bathed by a magic light
I have waited, I have prayed and this moment has become alive
One night fantasy...

[Chorus:]
Live my every breath, my every touch, my every single sigh
Seizing hold of every glance
As the dayÂ´s passing by begins a wonderful sight
Dancing on the moment dew, the dawn has come only for you
I look up at the sky for the stars to be my guide
