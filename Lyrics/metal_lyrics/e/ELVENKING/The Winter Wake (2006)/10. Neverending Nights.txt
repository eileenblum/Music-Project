[Music / Lyrics: Damnagoras]

I can see them running towards me
All the time they steal my dreams
The ghosts of past and sorrow
All the time they steal my dreams
When I take a walk outside, whispers will surround my head
I can hear the echo of my voice, a hundred times or more
They shout, they carry on
They whisper on my sorrow
They shout all night long
But the whispers will not end
And the whispers will not end
The ghost of past is showing me all the good times that have gone
- Now just a shadow on the wall
The rose is, so fragile, but still so everlasting
The ghost of sorrow is recalling all the damage done
Now just a brick off from the wall
The rose is so strong but
It wonÂ´t be Â´till the end, NO!
I can see them running towards me
All the time they steal my dreams
The ghosts of past and sorrow
All the time they steal my dreams
When I take a walk outside, whispers will surround my head
I can hear the echo of my voice, a hundred times or more
They shout, they carry on
They whisper on my sorrow
They shout all night long
But the whispers will not end
And the whispers will not end
The ghost of past is showing me all the good times that have gone
- Now just a shadow on the wall
The rose is, so fragile, but still so everlasting
The ghost of sorrow is recalling all the damage done
Now just a brick off from the wall
The roses, so fragile, forever will fade away with the tide of life
But this night will hold them on!

[Chorus:]
Oh, I want to see when I was a child
All the emotions, the smiles and the cries
Now that I see, never it hides, the neverending nights
Remember the flash, the crowd was no more
A light that surrounds you, never before
Now that I see, never it hides, the neverending nights
At the end of this horrid night, whispers stopped to haunt my dreams
All emotions cast inside my mind, a hundred times or more... no more...
