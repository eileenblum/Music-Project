[Music / Lyrics: Aydan]

Listen yourself talking words meaningless
Listen, where are the emotions you feel?
Take a look into yourself for a while
What you see doesnÂ´t scare you at all?

[Bridge:]
Balance on the edge of whatÂ´s wrong and what is nothing but
A different way to see things as they are
Please, donÂ´t go astray
On our way through seas we go

[Chorus:]
For every single day you live
For every fragment of your broken dream
This night is so evanescing
- Rouse your rocking
All the times they told that you were wrong
ThereÂ´ve been reason to be strong
Start again and find you way to live
- Rouse your dream
DonÂ´t let anyone walk over your dreams
Listen, donÂ´t let them fall on your path
If they do I will be one meter behind
IÂ´ll pick up and dean them for you

[Bridge:]
Waiting for a life a single reason to feel
YouÂ´re not surviving, tell me how IÂ´ll recognize?
ItÂ´s in front of you
DonÂ´t look back, thereÂ´s no return

[Chorus:]
For every single day you live
For every fragment of your broken dream
This night is so evanescing
- Rouse your rocking
All the times they told that you were wrong
ThereÂ´ve been reason to be strong
Start again and find you way to live
- Rouse your dream
