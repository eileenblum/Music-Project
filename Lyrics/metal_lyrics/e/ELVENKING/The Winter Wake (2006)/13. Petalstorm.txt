[Japan / Korea bonus track]

[Music / Lyrics: Aydan, Damnagoras]

Have you seen?
There is a hidden corner on these lands
Where cold waits patiently
Where, they say, the colour of the things is real.

Canât you see?
Take a sit down here
And take a bowl of calamint tea
It will keep you warm until the night is gone.

And time after time,
Fall arises, with all his leaves whirling in the sky
The year is passing by
Winter rises, bringing along a cloak full of cries, of cries.

Leaving all your memories far behind
The night brings along four thorns of farewell
Sitting down with my nightgown â unsweetened goodbye,
Everlasting goodbye

Do you believe?
Every change of season memories
Rain like a petalsâ storm
And the horizon line dividing right from wrong.

Come with me,
If the silence is a torment
And the wait wounds up your chest
If the grandeur of these lands doesnât heal your soul

And mile after mile
Spring arrives, and with it, sweet colours for a while
Dawn is turning bright
Summer rises, and bitter tears fall from your eyes, your eyes

Leaving all your memories far behind
The night brings along four thorns of farewell
Sitting here with my nightgown â unsweetened goodbye,
Everlasting goodbye (2x)

When there is a voice recalling, when a whisper is resounding
When a featherâs grazing you again, you start traveling with your mind
When the flowers lose their blossoms, (the) colour of your face is withered
Still your mind back to where you lived, to your little garden

Leaving all your memories far behind
The night brings along four thorns of farewell
Sitting here with my nightgown â unsweetened goodbye,
Everlasting goodbye
