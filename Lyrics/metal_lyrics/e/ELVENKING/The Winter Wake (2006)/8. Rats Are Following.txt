[Music: Damnagoras, Aydan, Lyrics: Damnagoras]

Find out some poetry...
The topic must be: Love and happiness
So easy to write, so easy to spell
Find out a melody...
That your brain wonÂ´t forget
So come out and play, donÂ´t be upset

[Bridge:]
The roads in the night, plagued by desolation
Are waiting for you...
So sing us your song!
They dance!

[Chorus:]
The rats are following
Follow the melody
It must be quiet and simple or youÂ´ll overload their heads
Rats are following
Follow the melody
It must be quiet and simple or youÂ´ll overload their heads
Find out a remedy...
To their unconditioned way of bothering
So harmless for you, so deadly to them
The lowelest symphony...
A joke to your hears will fly like a vulture
And will show them their worst side

[Bridge:]
The roads in the night, plagued by desolation
Are waiting for you...
Delight us with your song!
They dance!

[Chorus:]
The rats are following
Follow the melody
It must be quiet and simple or youÂ´ll overload their heads
Rats are following
Follow the melody
It must be quiet and simple or youÂ´ll overload their heads
Like a storm from the sky is falling
We want to hear this sweet warm melody
With havoc, rapture, crawling
We will embrace its every single note
There the vulture, dying, falling
WeÂ´d like to hear (it) but this is just the end

[Chorus:]
The rats are following
Follow the melody
It must be quiet and simple or youÂ´ll overload their heads
Rats are following
Follow the melody
It must be quiet and simple or youÂ´ll overload their heads
