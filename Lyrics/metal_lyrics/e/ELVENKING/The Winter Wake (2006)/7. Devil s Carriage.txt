[Music / Lyrics: Damnagoras]

On a hill, on the devilÂ´s top
There is a man hiding in the shadows of the night
HeÂ´s trying to stop the course of time
The line dividing good from wrong
There is more than meets the eye
In this world full of lies and death
The devilÂ´s carriage is leading all the souls to a place so far away

[Bridge:]
You canÂ´t deny your innocence!
Your life wonÂ´t be forever
You should show your nicest part
You are the one who cries

[Bridge 2:]
You will see
What you have never seen
In the afterlife you know you will forever be
At the fair, in the dragonÂ´s lair
You wonÂ´t be safe Â´cause the red driverÂ´s waiting there
He will be taking you through a nightmare you have never had before

[Bridge:]
You canÂ´t deny your innocence!
Your life wonÂ´t be forever
You should show your nicest part
You are the one who cries

[Bridge 2:]
You will see
What you have never seen
In the afterlife you know you will forever be

[Chorus:]
The devilÂ´s carriage ride
ItÂ´s a trip to the other side
All itÂ´s said and done
WonÂ´t count a single word
Been taken in the devilÂ´s care
YouÂ´ve never been a step downstairs
But you have to know
ItÂ´s gonna happen here and now...
ItÂ´s your future and watch out
Â´Cause the devilÂ´s carriageÂ´s running on and on!
At the fair, in the dragonÂ´s lair
You wonÂ´t be safe Â´cause the red driverÂ´s waiting there
He will be taking you through a nightmare you have never had before
At the sight of this dark fright night
He came and took another soul
Bleeding all itÂ´s light
And from the coach the sound of laughter, of laughter
