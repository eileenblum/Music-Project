[Music / Lyrics: Damnagoras]

Every time I try to understand
The meaning hiddendep into my heart
I crumble down the taste of losing all
Is always bitter when I sip from my cold blood

[Bridge:]
Losing what when there is nothing much to gain?
Stop yourself and have a thought
Watch your life

[Chorus:]
Mother earth is there, emotionless to your eyes
You can love her sons, but at the end youÂ´re all alone
Come and dance this reel, disillusionÂ´s for real
Stop yourself for godÂ´s sake, try to take a look at yourself
How can you pretend of having my faith
Of gaining all the respect and the love that I can give
I even hardly believe in myself
Where is the tunnel white, they told me of?

[Bridge:]
Losing what when there is nothing much to gain?
Stop yourself and have a thought
Watch your life

[Chorus:]
Mother earth is there, emotionless to your eyes
You can love her sons, but at the end youÂ´re all alone
Come and dance this reel, disillusionÂ´s for real
Stop yourself for godÂ´s sake, try to take a look at yourself
