[Music / Lyrics: Aydan]

I look around myself IÂ´m feeling like a stranger to this world
Where are the friends once I got (as) I used to know
No trace of common sense, a dash of a normal sanity
I wonder: "Are they all mad? ... Or is it me?

[Chorus:]
Thousands years have passed and nothing gonna change
Marching the plains as loud as hell theyÂ´re coming
Drawn up in lines, proud their eyes, the army of the fools
Ruling the thrones, it conquered and won
IÂ´m getting older
Maybe I donÂ´t recognize, IÂ´m yet too old
For all this mind-blowing fair of insanity
When I was a kid I promised to myself IÂ´d never grow up
But now wiser a bit I can sense!

[Chorus:]
Thousands years have passed and nothing gonna change
Marching the plains as loud as hell theyÂ´re coming
Drawn up in lines, proud their eyes, the army of the fools
Ruling the thrones, it conquered and won
Follow me, donÂ´t promise to be
What you never had thought youÂ´d have wanted to be
Tell me IÂ´m wrong but I follow myself
And the dreams that IÂ´ve lived since I was born

[Chorus:]
Thousands years have passed and nothing gonna change
Marching the plains as loud as hell theyÂ´re coming
Drawn up in lines, proud their eyes, the army of the fools
Ruling the thrones, it conquered and won
