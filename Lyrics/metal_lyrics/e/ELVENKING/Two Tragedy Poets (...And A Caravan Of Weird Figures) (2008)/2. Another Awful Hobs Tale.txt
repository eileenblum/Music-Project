Into this dark horizon we need a miracle!
to keep on hoping everyday is something magical

Our thirst for (the) promise to carry on
Is slowly falling down
and now we will claim it back!

Last time we saw the Green Man,
he gave us good advice
"Good luck to all of you
if a four leaf-clover you will find"

Our thirst for fortune, will lead us on
But it's quite a while we're hoping to find it

Where is the four leaf-clover?
We'll carry on, singing and singing
We'll walk, throughout the region
We'll walk, throughout the region again!

Bless us, bless us here we go
Praying under rain and snow
The spirit and the blessed soul
Will help us getting what we want

Where is the four leaf-clover?
We'll carry on, singing and singing
We'll walk, throughout the region
We'll walk, throughout the region again!

We followed on the ray of light,
until we arrived!
True love's the only answer...

We have been fooled, another time
The story will go on,
but at the end we will find it

Where is the four leaf-clover?
We'll carry on, singing and singing
We'll walk, throughout the region
We'll walk, throughout the region again!
