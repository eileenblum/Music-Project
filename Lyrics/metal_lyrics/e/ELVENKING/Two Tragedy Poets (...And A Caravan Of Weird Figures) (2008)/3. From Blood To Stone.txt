As the lights slowly fade in an emerald whirl
I dig through my broken ideals
As the sun hides his smile from the plain down below
I stand enchanted

I need to find something to fill my whole without falling, falling apart
Something that can give me a reason to hope, falling, falling apart

I can tell from the deep of my heart,
every day I fight to conquer a place in the world
Look around, leave it all with a smile,
taste the blood of Earth and sign your mark on the stone

From the roots in the soil to the branch in the sky
From head to toe I must find
A perfect harmony to help my travel this night
Through my own Wyrd

There is nothing the can frighten me more than myself,
outliving this world
I look around and I suddenly see and realize
I finally live (in the best way it can possibly be)

I can tell from the deep of my heart,
every day I fight to conquer a place in the world
Look around, leave it all with a smile,
taste the blood of Earth and sign your mark on the stone

Turning from blood to stone, be one with the roots of Life
From flesh and from tears to soil, make a promise and choose to live

I have found something to fill my whole without falling, falling apart
Something that has given reasons to hope, I'm not falling, falling no more

I can tell from the deep of my heart,
every day I fight to conquer a place in the world
Look around, leave it all with a smile,
taste the blood of Earth and sign your mark on the stone

In the end I don't care if I'm part of a plan
As long as I'm a part of it
