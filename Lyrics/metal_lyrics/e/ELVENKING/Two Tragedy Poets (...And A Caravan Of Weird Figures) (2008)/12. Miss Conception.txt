Have you ever thought that all of the things you believe
to be right may be just rules they stuck in you mind
they took you by the hand and led you just like you were blind

You learnt we're living in a world that is built on a lie
we are the good ones and we don't care when the others die
god is the answer and the strongest will always survive

Far from our daily chaos, she lives in peace and all of these things don't affect
her passion for life and for what's true.. what's truly right in the heart

Dig in you passions and follow you heart
Miss Conception awaits your arrival tonight
Far in your dreams she'll appear and invite you
When you feel like a man even just for a while

Don't be shy or stupid, wake up and follow her trail
you have been walking the wrong one like a drunken snail
This is the time to end this parody of life and set sail

The trees are covered up with vines look they're running insane
the crows high in the sky and the air filled with smell of rain
This place seems horrible but please don't proceed with disdain

Far from our daily chaos, she lives in peace and all of these things don't affect
her passion for life and for what's true.. what's truly right in the heart

Dig in you passions and follow you heart
Miss Conception awaits your arrival tonight
Far in your dreams she'll appear and invite you
When you feel like a man even just for a while

Oh here she comes, dressed with air and sunshine
Stroking her white legs, sexed and shivering
And there they are, the riot of pure ones
Feasting on her promiscuous banquet

Oh here she comes
I can see her face now
and our tongues
our hands dancing in the moonlight
How far will she go?
I can hear her soft voice whispering
Everlasting words of lust

Dig in you passions and follow you heart
Miss Conception awaits your arrival tonight
Far in your dreams she'll appear and invite you
When you feel like a man even just for a while
