As the lights are growing dim
Freezing cold, slowly is fading in
Another Winter night will hold this wicked soul

I will wait for the new Sun to rise
Blind in darkness, witness my demise
Another Winter night is so long...

The lands are dressed in the purest white
Pure as I was and I am no more

The ones of you who are free of guilt
Wound me with your stones and then step in
Buried in the whitest snow I will suddenly awake
The winter wake

As the steps are leaving trails
Of the side of me I hate
This is the Night when I will face all my disgrace

Cover me, cover all that I see
A little light flake for your heart and the sea
A single flake for all the good ones...

The lands are dressed in the purest white
Pure as I was and I am no more

The ones of you who are free of guilt
Wound me with your stones and then step in
Buried in the whitest snow I will suddenly awake
The winter wake

I spent my time gazing at the stars
As silently it snows inside my heart
Someone said that life brings and then takes
The winter wake
