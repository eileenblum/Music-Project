You've been playing snakes and ladders all your life
You never thought that you were wasting all your time
Now I'm gonna tell you: let's play "Pass the Pigs"
So come on throw your pigs and win by reaching number six

A long time ago the gifts were given by the gods
That day you didn't show your face at all
Now I'm gonna ask you: where do you belong?
The human being's supposed to be the best of all

The missionary position's leading back to number one
You thought you had some points, but now you have none

You're just one of the bloody freaking mass
The very best of the breed in your literature class..?
My patience has been worn out by your self esteem
How can you say Lord Byron used to play in your dream team?

Ask a silly question - Get a silly answer
You comedy of contradictions is your final cancer
If this is what you are, then I say: NO!
If this is all you say then I say: NO! NO! NO!

The missionary position's leading back to number one
You thought you had some points, but now you have none

All the natural and good willing forces of the earth
Are worth being respected since your time of birth
But I know you'll betray them - for your dumb regime
Forget your ugly face 'cause you don't count more than anything

Cold is the heart of the empty
In the end you will cry for mercy

Ask a silly question - Get a silly answer
You comedy of contradictions is your final cancer
If this is what you are, then I say: NO!
If this is all you say then I say: NO! NO! NO!

The missionary position's leading back to number one
You thought you had some points, but now you have none

You've been playing snakes and ladders all your life
You never thought that you were wasting all your time
Now I'm gonna tell you: let's play "Pass the Pigs"
So come on throw your pigs and win by reaching number six
