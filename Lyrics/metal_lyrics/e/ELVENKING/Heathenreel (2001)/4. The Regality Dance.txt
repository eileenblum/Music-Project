Gentlemen and ladies all please lend me your attention
I beg your pardon for my cheek, please join this heathenreel
Strange rules has this dance; suffers from a serious allergy
Reddens and becomes so unkind, when people're

acting just like you

The regal dance's about to start and I am here to tell you
"There's many a slip twixt cup and lip" 'tis something

that could help you

On and on please join the ball, nobody will stop you
The steps they are so simple, look the moon is dancing too

Drink a toast with the wise man, no one will care for you
Let the dances have their go, follow 'till they reach the end
Mind the minstrels they will say you're just another scarecrow
Not a word a single word, not for all the

whole damn world (you say...)

[Chorus:]
Step out of this regality dance
One foot in heaven, one in your grave
Mind this last one, it willl make you fall
A regardful bow
When your every single choice is
Taken by the spin of a penny coin

I came I saw, do not want nothing at all,

do not want to moralise you
Or spitting hateful sentences, just trying to tease

your rudimental pride
"Live and let live" told the wise man, as no one cared for him
From the soil which is now part of..."leaving is so

easier than living" (he says...)

[Chorus:]
Step out of this regality dance
One foot into heaven, one in your grave
Mind this last one, it will make you fall
A regardful bow
When your every single choice is
Taken by the spin of a penny coin

Bienvenu Mesdames et Messieurs
To the Danse Paien
Please come in and hurry up or
You will miss your turn

[Solos: Jarpen, Aydan]

[Chorus (x2):]

Face the truth are you worthy of this honesty filled - celebration!
Another tune bursting forth from the passion that

glides in my veins - can you feel it?
A speaking portrait's in front of me, do you acknowledge yourself? -

who painted you?
