[Voice of Fall: Damnagoras]
[Summerplunge: Pauline Tacey]
[Spirit of Spring: Laura de Luca]
[Wintersoul: Jarpen]

[F:] We're going to tell the tale of tales
[Su:] Are you sure? Or a little story of fancy
[F:] Seamen W: Dreamen F: Listen all!
[W &amp; Sp:] The Fall begins his speech

[F:] So I bring rest upon the earth
[Sp:] With my seed, wealdcover all thy hearthstones
[W:] Soothing Su: Trimming W: Hum to sleep!
[F &amp; Su:] The ornaments of wooodnotes!

[Su:] (Night surrounds, we're roaming through the 
shades of forgotten fairytales)
[Sp:] Can you hear the rhymes of winds?
[F:] The chant of leaves that fall?
[W:] No, no don't let me fall! F: Be quiet you!
[F &amp; Sp:] The renaissance of the seals

I rest...

[Bridge:]
I rest upon the riverbank, worshipper of my thrills
The crackling of the dead leaves counts the steps 

that lead me to the sea

[Chorus:]
Listen to this rigmarole, wake up and follow
Undertone, along with me, it's just a hint murmuring sigh
Hushing the plains for miles it comes from nowhere
I'm aware of my communion, I'll dance from nightfall an' evermore

[Su:] Look, winter's cloak is numbing all
[F:] Don't be a fool, you're doing it out of spite!
[Sp:] (You're unfair!)
[W:] Whiten, now all is white
[Su:] But soon you'll pass away

Twitch and twirl, the Wintersoul whirled past us in silence 

like a passing whim so...
Woke, reborn, a seed to be swallowed by the soil caressed 

in morning's light veils

Twitch and twirl, the Wintersoul has passed dimensions so
Cruel, reborn, no more forlorn...dimensions so cruel

[Bridge:]
I rest upon the riverbank, worshipper of my thrills
The crackling of the dead leaves counts the steps

that lead me to the sea

[Chorus:]
Listen to this rigmarole, wake up and follow
Undertone, along with me, it's just a hint murmuring sigh
Hushing the plains for miles it comes from nowhere
I'm aware of my communion, I'll dance from nightfall an' evermore

[Solo: Aydan]

A piece of a dream, the feel of being part within!
Dream up your own temptation
A piece of a dream, the feel of being part of it!
Build up your own temptation for me!

[Solos: Jarpen, Aydan]

Cherished and mantled by the open sea
The waves, ebbs and flows are now singing with me
And soundless the sky frays over the land
While a million stars, watch over all men [x2]

While a million stars, watch over all men through the lands

[Chorus (x2)]

Night surrounds, we're roaming through the shades 

of forgotten fairytales
We have told the tale of tales
I will rest upon the earth
The Wintersoul will pass away
