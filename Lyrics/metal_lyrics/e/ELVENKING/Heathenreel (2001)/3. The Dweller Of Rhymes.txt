From the branch where he dwells and lies
Nature revealed in cloak of rhymes
A verse, hidden mirror
And from the treetop of an oak
He laughed at people down beneath

With his eyes travelling over the scene (so strange)
He could mind-trace the flow
None of them realise something shared beyond
It's like a lighthouse from the port
Leading the boats to their quay

[Chorus:] Lone but wealthy inside
Awaked by a sudden whisper
A rhyme that slipped through his mind
Stunned by the tunes of the nature-born harp
He knows what they ignore
The Dweller of Rhymes

All is grist that comes to his mill
And all that glitters is not gold
For him, lesson of Nature
His pockets full of nothing show
Knowledge alone could make him stand

With his eyes travelling over the scene (so strange)
He could mind-trace the flow
None of them realise something shared beyond
It's like a lighthouse from the port
Leading the boats to their quay

[Chorus:] Lone but wealthy inside
Awaked by a sudden whisper
A rhyme that slipped through his mind
Stunned by the tunes of the nature-born harp
He knows what they ignore
The Dweller of Rhymes

Warped inside a whirl of thousand words, can 

I compete with what's beyond?
Forced down by the waves made out of my mind, 

out of my life, into the mist

[Solos: Jarpen, Aydan, Jarpen, Aydan, both]

[Chorus:] Lone but wealthy inside
Awaked by a sudden whisper
A rhyme that slipped through his mind
Stunned by the tunes of the nature-born harp
He knows what they ignore
The Dweller of Rhymes
