Your bright enchanting smile
Reminds me of the day when I learnt
That nothing lasts forever
And your goodwill's just another hoax of your kind

Time and time again
That feeling had got lost and ever since
I've tried to understand the meaning of
My inner self conviction I lied (to myself)

[Bridge:]
As we all know, time consumes our daily gladness
That cannot last 'till the day after
From this I will hide myself

[Chorus:]
Skywards again, I search for my dimension
People don't know how I am alive
Experience has taught to count every single move
Now I know I'm standing alone

Stone after stone I'm moulding my shelter
I watch it grow with endless delight
Carry me, carry me all your devotion
Deep in my heart to see my haven fall once again

The lovely beeches told me to think for myself; 
to bury down the lies of other minds...and I know 
I cannot be last but first

[Bridge &amp; Chorus:]

Torturize in the night I am falling down - into the dark
Deep within it's a dream I cannot control - It's killing me

My human conscience is dragging me down - into the dark
The temptress whispers..."again"... - It's killing me

Skywards
