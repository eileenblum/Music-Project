One with the earth, pave my way through the green
From above I stare down at (the) crowds
There by the oaks, I'll honour the roots and the clouds
With trembling hands I feel my pure life deep within

[Bridge:] deep, deep colour of the leaves awakes me
Deep, deep colour of the sky:

[Pre:] Then all the fowls stay silent
And the leaves end their fall
Suddenly I realise
The earth is breathing with me and I cry...
she is now my beloved bride

I am one, sole inheritance and yield
To myself the pageantry of being lonely,
I'm fit to be called a son of the minority,
Glad to be seen as an offkey in thy foreseen tune!

[Bridge:] fathomless wailing of the wind awakes me
It takes me up into the sky:

[Pre:] Then all the fowls stay silent
And the leaves end their fall
Suddenly I realise
The earth is breathing with me and I cry :

[Chorus:] Besieged by the boundless grandeur of these 

greenclad heaths
Could I swallow deep within of Mother Nature's seed
Branches pleached and berried bushes and that lonely tree
To this oak wood I bestow my PAGAN PURITY!

One with the earth pave my way through the green
...from above I stare down at crowds
By the oaks I'll honour the roots
...from above I stare down at crowds

[Solos: Jarpen, Aydan]

[Chorus:] Besieged...
