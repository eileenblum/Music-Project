"The mother of pain, the mother of tears
The blackest of tortures, the most cruel of fears
Sweet and dreadful, white queen and witch
Death, Death, Death is a bitch
Death has the answers, your throat has the knife
Death is a savior, life is a whore
Morte, Amore, Death and Love
She's reaping down souls with  regret
Suffered I had and suffer I will
Counting my days and the blood that I spilled
The sweetest of tortures, that we call life
will hopefully cease with the slash of a knife"
