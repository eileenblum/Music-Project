[Lyrics: Aydan]

As I was stepping unwary in bloom of youth
Cast away into the shores of golden dawns
Caressing fiery beasts inside my greedy chest
I knelt before the emperor darkly dressed

Illusionist - spells are meant to fool
Psychologist - leveraging power
Divinatory - over past and future
Thirteen Odes
Illusionist - to deceive wills to dogmas
Psychologist - to influence the weak ones
Divinatory - to apprehend the Magick arts

As the golden key that fits the lock
Of the hidden wooden door leading to the secret hidden yard
I came to you with blazing wings, my dear
To lead you to the way, 3 different paths to reach the Gathering

Following tracks in the mud of integrity
I was haunted by his ghostly entity
The charming letters written with bloody ink
Were the witching guide to those missing links

Illusionist - spells are meant to fool
Psychologist - leveraging power
Divinatory - over past and future
Thirteen Odes
Illusionist - to deceive wills to dogmas
Psychologist - to influence the weak ones
Divinatory - to apprehend the Magick arts

A Manual to prove all Supremacy
A Sourcebook for evoking Spirits of the Forces of the Night
A Grimoire to forebode ascendancy
To actions and outcomes, to elevate your spirit high above

[Solo: Aydan]

Power of wilt be the only notion to obey
Essence of Magick, help me indoctrinating the breeds
Nightly and witching Horus fellows hunting the prey
Assemble the adepts to serve all My needs
3 Ways to Magick!
