[Lyrics: Aydan]

I am floating on the edge of the dawn
I am balancing at the borders of the night
Where the stars blow out

Hear my distant calling - I am searching for you - I live at dawn, again

I am dust carried by the wind
I am shadows with no rays of light
With blood to adore

Hear my distant calling - I am searching for you - I live at dawn, again

One day will I see the light of day shining on my skin?
Will I break out from this eternal dark?
One day will I undress of this cloak of dusk on my back?
Will I dissolve and turn to soil?
