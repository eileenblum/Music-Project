[Lyrics: Damna]

A line of blackthorns bordering the side of the way that horses rode for days
A flock of starlings circling above the ravine, throughout the damp and haze
A naked branch of old oaks twisted by the coils of wild vines twirling
A parchment filled with runes, and a deep-blue rose

I'll find you tonight â feel my desire
A lady dressed in white â blood and fire
The creature won't die â feel my desire
And in the dead of night â hear the infernal choir

Deep in the woods a rotten castle staring the lands from hilltop high above
A bloodshot eyed foul creature living a quarantine, duped by a spell of love
A grain of truth, it must be hidden in the legends, in the stories
A final spark of hope. To walk away.

I'll find you tonight â feel my desire
A lady dressed in white â blood and fire
The creature won't die â feel my desire
And in the dead of night â hear the infernal choir

I'm lost in a nightmare â I will free you from the curse you bear
Blood's not the answer â Blood's the reason that I still walk this earth

I'm falling to pieces â My love don't you dare to despair
The death you're unfoldingâ¦ â â¦A hex you'll endure right by my side

[Solo: Rafahel]

For the heinous maleficia of the mind and the flesh
Clad in monstrous guise, ill-fated vest never to undress
A gigantic bear like head and tongue that flickers like flame
A monster in a monster's skin, the true evidence of shame

I'll find you tonight â feel my desire
A lady dressed in white â blood and fire
The creature won't die â feel my desire
And in the dead of night â hear the infernal choir
