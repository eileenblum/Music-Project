[Lyrics: Damna]

This is an ode to the woodland spirit
The ghost of everything that was alive
Dried, deceased and turned to dust, by the curse of time
Twisted branched face and stag-like antlers
He walked this earth and he was not a lie
Passed, demised, martyred, put to deathâ¦the curse of man

Hounded, darkened and laid underneath
Wrecked and pulverized, he rots down beneath

By the light of a brighter moon
The wake of a rising boon - the woodlands awake
As we gaze up to the sky, the stars align and he lives forever
By the light of the brighter moon
The chant of a dismal tune - the woodlands awake
As the seers point at the signs, the stars align as we invoke his arrival

In a moment of the purest splendour
The father of us all now comes to life
Hush and mute the lies of Christ and the curse of man
And by the power of the woodland spirit
All creatures will find peace and live through the night
Destined to find, awakening, and peace of mind

Hounded, darkened and laid underneath
Wrecked and pulverized, he rots down beneath

By the light of a brighter moon
The wake of a rising boon - the woodlands awake
As we gaze up to the sky, the stars align and he lives forever
By the light of the brighter moon
The chant of a dismal tune - the woodlands awake
As the seers point at the signs, the stars align as we invoke his arrival

Spiritus invocamus - the phantom of the wild
Sylvestris deus noster - spirit of the woods
The day of his arrival - tenebrae factae sunt
Sylvestris deus noster - spirit of the woods

[Solos: Rafahel, Aydan]
