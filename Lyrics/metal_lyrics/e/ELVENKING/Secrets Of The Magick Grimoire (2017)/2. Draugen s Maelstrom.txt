Standing on the damp wooden helm
I still not surrender
Barely I can hear
The crew's moans, they're crying loud

Through the pouring rain
The icy spurts
And the crackling of the boards
I glimpse the headless nightclad ghost

To believe
The seas are dwelled by our fears
Creatures
Of old forgotten times
Do you believe
Draugen came to bring your life
From a whirlwind
Grandiose he appears
Draugen's storm

Rising from the deep black seas
From the deepest abyss
He sails the crimson waves
Of my lot for the final bow

Is he coming to announce
My final day on this dull night?
Embrace the last enigma knots

To believe
The seas are dwelled by our fears
Creatures
Of old forgotten times
Do you believe
Draugen came to bring your life
From a whirlwind
Grandiose he appears
Draugen's storm
