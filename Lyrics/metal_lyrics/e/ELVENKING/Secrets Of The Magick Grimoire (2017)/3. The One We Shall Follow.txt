[Lyrics: Damna]

A surge of crows, a foreshadow
A loom of the one who is grand and potent
A burst of unholy fire, harbinger of his arrival
Fiery eyes of a black wolf
Fair and righteous like no other
Far from neglect and defiance, he will lead us

We'll march onward to a far distant shore
Where our bright will grow â We will follow him!
He's right by our side â With him we will ride
The gates open wide â We will honour him!

He's the one we shall follow tonight
Walking endlessly on the path of the dreamer
He will come and we'll follow the signs in a pagan absolution time
He's the one we shall follow away
Furthermost from wrong from their narrow demeanours
He will come and we'll follow the signs in a pagan absolution night

A cloak of lustre his garment
Suited for the prince of darkness
Conjuring magickal pyre â summoning wildfire
He'll wipe out the fools and the improper
The ones who plague our dear earth
With their ignorance and self denial â He will lead us

We'll march onward to a far distant shore
Where our bright will grow â We will follow him!
He's right by our side â With him we will ride
The gates open wide â We will honour him!

He's the one we shall follow tonight
Walking endlessly on the path of the dreamer
He will come and we'll follow the signs in a pagan absolution time
He's the one we shall follow away
Furthermost from wrong from their narrow demeanours
He will come and we'll follow the signs in a pagan absolution night
