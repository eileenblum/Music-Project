[Lyrics: Aydan]

Lost in memories of innocence I find myself amazed, trembling
Directing glances to the setting sun, to the golden plain below
The sea of green branches off the plain into an endless form of grace
(mirroring the skies)
I leave the legs twirling long the grade, into the dawn and beyond

In the middle of the green sea laid my secret embrace
The little piece of heaven roofed by branches was my own place
My home, where I could dream and hide

Now I'm leaving all behind, I summon the dawn light
Inside, to become a new myself for one day
Leave my hands and let me go, I'm going with the flow
Afar, where the never-ending fairies still live on

I don't recall how I found myself in my realm on that summer night
Scents of distant oceans and storms approaching from the deep skyline
The aery figure emerged from the logs and spoke to me with bereavement
(live your final breath)
I reflect my eyes into her eyes, I cherished them one last time

The pattern of the stars above was my final witness and judge
That little piece of heaven has engraved my name on the sky
Below a dome of crimson lights

Now I'm leaving all behind, I summon the dawn light
Inside, to become a new myself for one day
Leave my hands and let me go, I'm going with the flow
Afar, where the never-ending fairies still live on and on

[Solo: Aydan, Rafahel]

Now that I left all behind, that secret kept inside
It vanishes like the scent of a dreamy last night

I have left celeste skies, like-razor cutting sighs
Between stay and riding on the tides
Blossom summer flames and fires or lost in foggy pyres
Look back, the universe is just a fleck of dust blown away
