[Lyrics: Aydan]

Devoid of life, lost and glum
Silence devours flair, swears allegiance to its maids
On the prowl of loneliness
To germinate with harsh, fake resistance to my art

Accept my soul
Offer my toll to the poet's tears
Caress my heart
It's my black art to whisper in your ears

Back to the days we embellished the rhymes
Off to the gallery of my pains
Embody the spirit, this art of mine
Every verse speaks for a thousand strains

Ornaments of agony
Cut the wrists of our bond to reality
Embrace in sighs and despair
To connect the flames to the oceans of my soul

Accept my soul
Offer my toll to the poet's tears
Caress my heart
It's my black art to whisper in your ears

Back to the days we embellished the rhymes
Off to the gallery of my pains
Embody the spirit, this art of mine
Every verse speaks for a thousand strains

All screams and groans inside, not a single sigh
A chest like a storm profound (roaring melancholy)

Bring me out in shackles to the mercy of the might
Hit me with your contempt, I'll rejoice and shine so bright
Let me introduce my gloom to the deepest of your fears
I want to cross your borders straight inside your winter, dear!

Accept my soul
Offer my toll to the poet's tears
Caress my heart
It's my black art to whisper in your ears
