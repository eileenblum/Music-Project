[Intro harmony:] "March to the tree" 

Step by step, we walked the elfdom as far as the pass of Helm 
Now waves of twilight wash our shields, shine in our swords      
We've reached the elfic mighty oak, over hills await the 
legions of the ogres      
With new sun the final battle will begin 

[BRIDGE:]
Is the bond of our companionship      
that will lead us to the victory All the blood that (will) 
spill from our 
enemies is the only grim reward 

Tunes of battle clash, ploughing all the seven  seas and 
Time is coming fast 

[CHORUS 1:]
Far to the world where the dawn is falling 
Far, through the lands, against the power of the Dark 
To the fields where you hear the calling 
Down, to the hills where the wizard of Arthanelron had ruled 

[Melody: Jarpen]

Far beyond, over the horizon a sickle of Moon floats in the night 
An handful of sparks Branches to roots, blood to the flesh 
A spell of ancient ages past, draw the swords and raise 
our hearts to glorify      
With new sun the final battle will begin 

[BRIDGE:]
Is the bond of our companionship      
That will lead us to the victory For the life of one that has fade away 
Another one will fight for all 

Tunes of battle clash, ploughing all the seven seas      
And Time is coming fast 

[CHORUS 2:]
Far to the world where the dawn is falling      
Far, through the lands, against the power of the Dark 
To the fields where the blood is flowing 
Down, to the hills where the wizard of Arthanelron had ruled 

[Hymn: Aydan]

Strong and proud we stand again In circle round the tree of Usdu'm 
The shadow in the wood are lengthening Over our fears and beliefs      
A frosty blanket's wrapping us In death or glory at dusk it will end 
The banner's high on our lances The final clash has begun 

[Solos: both, Aydan, Dag'or'dil]

Tunes of battle clash, ploughing all the seven seas 
And Time has come too fast 

[CHORUS 1 &amp; 2:]
Far to the world where the dawn is falling 
Far, through  the lands, against the power of the Dark 
To the fields where you hear the calling 
Down, to the hills where the wizard of Arthanelron had ruled 

Far to  the world where the dawn is falling 
Far, through the lands, against the power of the Dark 
To the fields where the blood is flowing 
Down, to the hills where the wizard of Arthanelron had ruled
