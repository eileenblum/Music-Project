Should I never roam anymore, 
I'm on journey, silently the moon whispers 
Words I'll be recalling 
Miles away lies the unknown fate 
Through dwarven lands, where the shadows 
Never fall in I rest and sing, 
under an oak so old 

[Bridge:]
Round and round we dance through 
The willows Even though the day's turning dark very fast now 
Rivers full of dreams flow endlessly 
May the stars will stay and will laugh at our smallness 

[Chorus:]
Into the woods, hear the silver firs' breathing 
Where the forests end, it's the banquet of bards 
So, that's the magic - whirling clouds and fair 
Journey stories to find! 

Someone's announcing the event of a new day's birth 
Bards around a table sing "All is fair in love and war!" 
Farewell, my friends, I leave 

Wisdom's all I learned so far, words of ages
Heard the jester's voice, by the ruins he spoke 
Atrocious truths under the cloak of lunacy 
Learning from into the brushwood of K'horen 
I lie and wait, chasing my dreams so far 

[Bridge:] Round and round? 

[Chorus:] Into the woods?      

[Solos: Aydan, Jarpen]

In a forgotten place of earth, a noble quest it has begun      
Another banquet, another song, grace to you o forest deep 
Gathering of dwarves, elves and men 
Satchels and pouches they bring forth 
The banquet of Bards 

Now that we leave all the crickets stay silent 
Along our quest, we'll see the world spin 
Mystic places and yellowing leaves that won't fall 
It's my own fate 

Into the woods, hear the banquet of bards 
The treasure I found now I share with you
