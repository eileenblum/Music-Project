[Music: Aydan, Damna Lyrics: Aydan]

"Lost in the sea, shipwrecked in a Dark Ocean of which you cannot see the bottom... you finally find
distant shores on the horizon. And you are a castaway of unknown sands, fearful and alone. Gaze on the
light in her eyes and follow her steps in the new lands; she will guide you throughout your new shores."

I'm following a sputtering spark
Through a curtain of fog
The gale is biting crackling boards
Splashing my self-esteem

I'm trying to read the course on the map
Compass leading astray
I feel I need to find a way
Before being shipwrecked

Come all aboard,
Sighs, thoughts and worries all
On frantic course
I am following the track to windy shores

A song to the wind, an ode to the sea
Chanting snowdrops of soul
Allow me please to be nearer to thee
I'm heading towards the shores

The little flame you're holding up
Is tracking a new path
Little step by little wrath
I am pointing my new way

I'm leaving spoors in the moist sands
Little motives of hope
You can see me as in Dark I grope
Please give me your hand

Entwined and torn
Is the heart of Man who lives
The circle of Life
Is a journey long and unforeseen to new shores

A song to the wind, an ode to the sea
Chanting snowdrops of soul
Allow me please to be nearer to thee
I'm heading towards the shores

A poem to the dawn, a verse to the dusk
A lighthouse drawing the line
Your eyes and your smile have left me unmasked
I'm strolling on new shores
