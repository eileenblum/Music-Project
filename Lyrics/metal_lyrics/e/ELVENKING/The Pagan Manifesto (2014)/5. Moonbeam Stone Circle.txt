[Music: Damna, Aydan Lyrics: Damna]

"Summon the ravens, light the fires, embrace Mother Nature's spirit and sign in the name of Horned One.
This is a journey trough paganism and mysticism, in the deep of ancient forests of England where the
pagan deities live and breathe. In the middle of a circle of stones near the sacred dolmens, we chant
this prayer... an ode to Cernunnos"

The leaves are dancing the autumn waltz
The smell of the coming rain
Delivered by the wind that breathes through the trees

The forest is alive, and slowly comes the night
The branches are following me
In frightening twirls they take me as we fall in the dark

Oh in the name of the burning fire
Oh in the name of the stag and the wolf
here I invoke thee, Guardian of the grove
listen my prayer

Oh in the name of the burning fire

Oh in the name of the yew and oak

here I invoke thee, Goddess of the Moon
listen my prayer

As I call your name the woods are leaving me be
And I find myself right under a moonbeam

By the flames that burneth bright
I commence my rite
I offer thee my sacrifice
The broad white moon slowly climbs and then silently cries

Horn and hoof are the goat-foot god
Come where the dances trod
Moonlit sky, on dusky hill
When the haunted wood is bushed, forgotten and still

CERNUNNOS - FAUNUS - KARNAYNA - KHNUM

In fiery flame by starlight pale
In shadowy host that rides the gale
Thee we invoke, by the moon-led sea
