[Music &amp; Lyrics: Damna, Aydan]

"The ultimate dedication to all these years of passion and music. The ultimate dedication to our fans. This is our gift to you, dear Elvenlegions."

Born under red skies
Dungeons and darkness
Six bards - one of a kind
Oh - oh
We dance on the witches' night

Music and spirit
For the outcast brotherhood
Six bards - one for all
Oh - oh
The Elven family

Fire, round the flames we dance to our reels
Pronouncing our rites
Legions scream out words of heathenry and magik

We are the Monsters, the Tragedy Poets
Wanderers and we fight back
We're as one with the sky
We are the Pagan Legions, sons of Mother Earth
Back to pagan roots
We light the fires of purity, minority
We are the Elvenlegions on the rise!
Legions on the rise!

Heathenreel and witchcraft
Poems and legends
Six torches warm in the night
We are - we are casting a spell on you

From blood we come
And as stone we cease
The tree of our eternal life
We are - we are the Elven dynasty

Fire, we've been cast in the mouth of fire
Dead fallen heroes
Legions, like a modern Prometheus we rise from the ashes

We are the Monsters, the Tragedy Poets
Wanderers and we fight back
We're as one with the sky
We are the Pagan Legions, sons of Mother Earth
Back to pagan roots
We light the fires of purity, minority
We are the Elvenlegions on the rise!

We are the off-keys, we gather in secret
Dormant apparently, ready to fight.
We're as one with the earth
We are the Pagan Legions, sons of Mother Earth
We have embraced the ways of purity
Summoned the One and mastered the runes.
We are ready to strike!

We are the Monsters, the Tragedy Poets
Wanderers and we fight back
We're as one with the sky
We are the Pagan Legions, sons of Mother Earth
Back to pagan roots
We light the fires of purity, minority
We are the Elvenlegions on the rise!
