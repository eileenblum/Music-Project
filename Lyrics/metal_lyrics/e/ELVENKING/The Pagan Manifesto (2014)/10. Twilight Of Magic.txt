[Music: Aydan, Damna Lyrics: Aydan]

"Do not allow anyone to repress your fantasy or kill your dreams. Keep on dreaming with your eyes and
wint your heart. If you can dream it, you can do it (Walt Disney)."

I remember a time when elves and fairies were alive
I remember a time when magic played a role in life
Concealed from our view, the Trows kind live amidst old trees
But Mankind lost all capacities and will to see

Mari-Morgans, pagan sons and readers of the Runes
Don't forget the way, the left hand path
The roots we are all born

Korrigans and creatures black
The seed of fantasy
We're all travelers and vagabonds
On tracks that can't be seen

Follow me
(For all the times you have stargazed to leave it all)
Come to me
(Against everyone who tried to teach you wrong)

All the times you feel like you have been left abandoned
Beached and stranded
Castaway in this sea
Gaze at the sky
Don't let this feeling die (Keep this thrill alive)
It's not the magic twilight

I remember a time between the stanzas of our rhymes
I remember the youngest hunger with the end in sight
Poured in my arms the will to leave a mark on life
I sought refuge in reigns unreal distand and wide
I'm leaving it all.....!

Mari-Morgans, pagan sons and readers of the Runes
Don't forget the way, the left hand path
The roots we are all born

All the times you feel like you have been left abandoned
Beached and stranded
Castaway in this sea
Gaze at the sky
Don't let this feeling die (Keep this thrill alive)
It's not the magic twilight

[Guitar solos: Aydan, Raphael]

For a single beat of heart
For one tear of joy
I would seduce the Night

For the perfume of the skin
For your company
I would plunge in bitter fires

All the times you feel like you have been left abandoned
Beached and stranded
Castaway in this sea
Gaze at the sky
Don't let this feeling die (Keep this thrill alive)
It's not the magic twilight
