[Music: Damna, Aydan. Lyrics: Damna]

"A hymn to all our Pagan brothers and sisters and to everyone who's afraid of showing his/her true self to the world. This song is about letting yourself go, no matter what other people say. It is dedicated to the outcast, the ones like us, who are proud of being different and special, for those who stand against ignorance and moral hypocrisy. This is the Pagan Revolution!"

Unleash, unleash the power that you have inside
Unleash and join the pagan revolution

Open your heart to the spirit of the night
Nature's purity your feelings will ignite
The primitive arousal of a better time to come
So let your heart beat to the rhythm of the drums

Sing and dance to the sound of revolution
Come and join this heathendom
Not a rioting song, a public moral execution
Enemies of liberty here we come

Open up your heart to the spirit of the wild
Live your days in wonder as if you were a child
The crackling of the fire, the silence of the night
The wind will whisper words of freedom and delight

Sing and dance to the sound of revolution
Come and join this heathendom
Not a rioting song, a public moral execution
Enemies of liberty here we come

Unleash, unleash the power that you have inside
Let your mind and spirit free
Unleash and join the pagan revolution
We are Mother Nature's army, we are proud of who we are

[Guitar solos: Aydan, Raphael]

We endorse your spirituality
We support your self-dedication
Unleash, unleash the power that you have inside
Let your mind and spirit free
Unleash and join the pagan revolution
We are Mother Nature's army, we are proud of who we are

Unleash, unleash the power that you have inside
Let your mind and spirit free
Unleash and join the pagan revolution
We are Mother Nature's army, we are proud of who we are
Proud of who we are
Of who we are
