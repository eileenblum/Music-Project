I don't know who you are
in the mirror I see you still wear a mask
A disguise, a cure for all the madness.

Why don't you get rid
of the junk you used to wear
in front of me, are you sure that
you were feeling better.

All the laughter, the good time
covered up all of your crimes
now tell me who you are
now tell me who you are
All the darkness, all the pain
was it really all in vain?
now tell me who you are
now tell me who you are.

[Chorus:]
Far away you just wanna run away
your heroes - all gone astray
When you say that you're gonna end your play
your confidence all gone away.
I just saw it happening,
I saw the ones who love you all run away
your heroes are all dead.

The truth behind the lies
is a blink well hidden deep inside your eyes
It's a way to make them all feel stupid.

Oh if you just knew
that the only one who was
being fooled was you
are you sure that you were
feeling better.

All the laughter, the good time
covered up all of your crimes
now tell me who you are
now tell me who you are.
All the darkness, all the pain
was it really all in vain?
now tell me who you are
now tell me who you are.

[Chorus:]
Far away you just wanna run away
your heroes - all gone astray
When you say that you're gonna end your play
your confidence all gone away.
I just saw it happening,
I saw the ones who love you all run away
your heroes are all dead.

[Solo: Rafahel]

[Chorus:]
Far away you just wanna run away
your heroes - all gone astray
When you say that you're gonna end your play
your confidence all gone away.
I just saw it happening,
I saw the ones who love you all run away
your heroes are all dead.
