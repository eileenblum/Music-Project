I walk in silence
Silence de mort

Every night the same old dream
La fleur du cÅur being slaughtered from within
And I know how - I know now - I know how

Every time I can feel, I can hear
The taste of my blood the beat of my heart
And I feel pain - I feel great - I feel pain

...And this is no Wonderland
No Alice, no Cat, no Mad Hatter my dear
Here the silence is real

All the dreams that I hold, all my fantasies unfold
And the things I wanna live
Are just fake happy endings with figures pretending
They've washed all the illusions far away

The marionettes are drinking still
While celebrating their own pile of shit
Like it is great - like it is the main attraction

The stains which remain on my best suit
Are always of the colours I hate the most
While the ones I cherish, they just fade away

...And this is no Wonderland
No Alice, no Cat, no Mad Hatter my dear
Here the silence is real

All the dreams that I hold, all my fantasies unfold
And the things I wanna live
Are just fake happy endings with figures pretending
They've washed all the illusions far away

[Solo: Rafahel, Aydan]

I walk in silence
Silence de mort
