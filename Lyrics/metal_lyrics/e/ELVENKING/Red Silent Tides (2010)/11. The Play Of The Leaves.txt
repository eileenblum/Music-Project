[Music and Lyrics by Aydan]

It's time to make a choice
No matter where it leads
Decisions need to be taken
Doesn't matter when
No matter where

The final curtain falls
All the audience's gone
The play has come to the end
Change your acting clothes
Clean up your face

The treasures of your inside
Do they really have a light?
The jewels in your heart
Are they rusting inside?

There are voices there always that are calling for you
Every time you're in need of finding something to cling to
There are choices there waiting for you
Everywhere, you'd better be prepared

Are your leaves covering
The highest top of the trees
with their green and sparkling gold
Or the soil below,
Crackling dead and gone?

Inside what do you feel?
The play of the leaves
performing next to your room
get the final claps
or leave covered in shame

[Chorus:]

[Solo: Aydan]

Do you feel this emotion that hides
Are you strong enough to survive
This little whirlwind in motion?

Can you feel the pain that I feel
Do you see all things that I see?
It's all turning and causing commotion

[Chorus:]

[Solo: Rafahel]
