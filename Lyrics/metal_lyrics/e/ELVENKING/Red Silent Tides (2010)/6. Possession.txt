Carry on, everything's over
stare at the dawn, as sky is covering
clouds are darkening the horizon and our lives
carry on, we can't stand this silence.

Holding on to a wicked sensation
pounding strong, it's pure emotion
How long does it last inside our living hearts?
every beat, really loses away a part.

You carry my heart, you carry my dreams
in your pain and it's part of me
where the poet lives, no poetry can exist
if there is no dream, you carry my heart.

[Chorus:]
You carry my heart, you carry my dreams
hand in hand so far from here
through the dark of night and through the leaves of fall
I am leaving you, as you carry my heart.

Carry on, I can't let you burn me up
but you know that I can't resist
no mere human can stand a fire not
being consumed, I ask myself,
you and me will be us?

You carry my heart, you carry my dreams
in your pain and it's part of me
where the poet lives, no poetry can exist
if there is no dream, you carry my heart.

[Chorus:]
You carry my heart, you carry my dreams
hand in hand so far from here
through the dark of night and through the leaves of fall
I am leaving you, as you carry my heart

Please allow me to deeply live this dream
while the others all around still sleep
she wrote fairytales of disobedience
while the fire burned, possession of their souls

[Chorus:]
You carry my heart, you carry my dreams
hand in hand so far from here
through the dark of night and through the leaves of fall
I am leaving you, as you carry my heart

Carry on.... everything's over
