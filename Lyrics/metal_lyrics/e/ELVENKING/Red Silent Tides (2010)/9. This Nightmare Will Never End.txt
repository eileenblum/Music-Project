Sometimes I feel like I don't wanna face myself and run away ... in silence
All the memories, sentences that I just didn't wanna say ...oh yesterday
Walking in silence, I could face my fears and try not to forget where I belong - where do I come from?

I was flying like a raven, bringing sadness to you all then my heart broke into pieces, that's when I started to fall.

I have walked on the path of solitary victim ...in silence
I spoke the tongue of the dumb and no one listened to me.
Walking in silence, I just didn't listen, I didn't want to know where I belonged - What the hell I did to myself?

I was flying like a raven, bringing sadness to you all then my heart broke into pieces, that's when I started to fall.

[Chorus:]
Now I close my eyes, for all the shame I feel inside
I know I hate myself, for all the things I've said
And all the things I've done, and every time I think about it now
I would kill myself ...but now I wanna face this.

You come to reach the darkest level
And you don't know what it means
Then realize you lived a nightmare when you thought it was a dream
You can say that you're so sorry
For all the mess that you have been trough
But only when you'll free yourself you'll get to have the best for you.

I was flying like a raven, bringing sadness to you all then my heart broke into pieces, that's when I started to fall.

[Chorus:]
Now I close my eyes, for all the shame I feel inside
I know I hate myself, for all the things I've said
And all the things I've done, and every time I think about it now
I would kill myself ...but I just wanna face this.

This nightmare will never end... This nightmare will never end
This nightmare will never end... This nightmare will never end
