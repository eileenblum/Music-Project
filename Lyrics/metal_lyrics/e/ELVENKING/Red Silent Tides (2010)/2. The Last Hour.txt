[Music and Lyrics by Aydan]

Save me, seize me, I'm falling again

The brightness in your eyes
the silence of your cry is speaking louder
Than the words you said to me, the notes created for you

There's something in between
There's halfway you and me where nothing was supposed to be
Dark sides rise, wound me with your knife!

Paint the shadows of the past
Canvas of desolation
As the last hour has passed
Has stroke, has fallen on the floor
Has lengthened through this night

[Chorus:]
Save me, seize me, I'm falling again
As the final hour-hands are stretching my skin and flesh
A circle is forming, you need to rejoin with your love
One last time before the fall

[Lead: Aydan]

I was ready for the call
For the final curtain falling on the stage one last time
Sacrifice myself for your life
Taking a bow meaning good bye

[Bridge and Chorus]

[Chorus:]
Save me, seize me, I'm falling again
As the final hour-hands are stretching my skin and flesh
A circle is forming, I need to rejoin with my love
One last time before the last hour

[Lead Lick: Rafahel]
