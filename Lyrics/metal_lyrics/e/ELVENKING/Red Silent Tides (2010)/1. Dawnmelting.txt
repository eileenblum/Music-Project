Their souls were lost
their dreams are drowning
in red silent tides.

White skin, cold shiver
Why are you so distant from me?
Dream on, this never
This no more it is a dream again.

Every time I look deeper into your eyes
I want you so bad that it hurts inside
Rising comet racing star-lit sky
I wanna feel my skin on hers.

Your whispers' erotic
I feel like you're inside of me, yeah!
I'm running, too far and
Don't want to partition once again.

What did I do to deserve you so
I am totally devoted to your eyes
Have you turn your glass up to the moon
Deny the dawn will come and light up.

I'm wishing for another memory
Only to save your words
I wish for another fantasy
Only for your dreams, well I
I wish for another myself.
To be wholly yours again.

I'm hoping for another touch
This will of yours, it hurts so much
I won't give up for a night to do what should be done
This constant feeling drives me mad
I can not rest, I can not stand
I won't give up for a night to do what should be done.

I'm wishing for another memory
Only to save your words
I wish for another fantasy
Only for your dreams and I
I wish for another myself.
To be wholly yours again, yeah yeah!
