[Music and Lyrics by Aydan]

Along the winding road, into the storm
Far away from home
Rain washes away the tokens gathered through life
Where the snow's covering all around
in a silence painted white
Where nobody can recall your face at first sight

[Chorus:]
Read the lines that no one reads
They are written everywhere
See the things that no one can see
things that God forbids

There were runes can still be called
Under thirteen Moons of Fall
Magic, Spirits and a Sunset
Reader of the Runes

Through an archway of branches I ride
Like a ghost haunted by Love
Dragging all my sins into another eve of strife
All the loved ones I have then belonged to
fade in this dark lake
Like the Night dies and at Dawn returns to life

[Chorus:]
Read the lines...
