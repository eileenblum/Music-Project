For years disguised smiles were the only friends for me for years I thought they were for real
I closed my heart and with my hands I fooled myself Leaving me a pearl without a shell

Then I woke up, then I woke up and found all that I left behind Iâm packing it all, and leaving with you

[Chorus:]
So close your eyes and take my hand now Iâll take you to my dark wonderland a place youâll never want to leave â a place youâll never want to leave tonight
I will caress you all the night and day whisper sweet words every day captive in your arms, your prey â in your arms a prey tonight

Iâll dig a place so far from here
A hole to hide my love, to save whatâs left of me

They put me on trial after the sentence had been sealed with dismal glances ill-concealed a crow was flying in the rainy sky that night bringing good news, not a fright

The underdog, the last in line, oh please stop all this wicked whine Iâm packing my things, and leaving with you

[Chorus:]
So close your eyesâ¦

After all we went through Can you feel me deep.. I dedicate this night to you

âLong all the miles Iâve been walking
The tears have counted my progress
Please touch my heart â¦ together we will fix this silence
In this dark sweet fairytale
They ran out of happy endings
Please touch my soul â¦ we can re-arrange all this nightmare

[Solo: Rafahel, Aydan]

[Chorus:]
So close your eyesâ¦
