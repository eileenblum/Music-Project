[Music &amp; Lyrics: Aydan]

[Solo: Jarpen]

Gone from this world
to find knowledge or pain
I follow myself from a distant
and fading dream

Loving her brightness so dear to me
it makes me to look further in
To enter a world hidden far (from home)
Hushing the fears, I can see with blinded
eyes

Nearby the circus this time I won't pass!
Where all the fears and indifference lie
A warm place to drown
your own need to find
The questions that bury your mind
You won't find the answers to Life
(this way)
Now turn your head, step back from the
jesters, run!

A quest that only some would take
It grabs our soul if there is one
Could (it) be that we're left alone
Or guided by the moonlight

Runaway runaway runaway
From this midnight circus
On this ride on this tide
I am crawling deep inside
And fair wind's awaiting me

[Lead: Jarpen]

Fallen away from the chains of my mind
It's my own choice to attain the truth
Free from all wavering I hear a song
Go far ahead, you will hear
A harmony carved into Life
Few final steps
Dream on...

[Solos: Aydan, Jarpen]

Runaway runaway runaway
From this midnight circus
On this ride on this tide
I am crawling deep inside
And fair wind's awaiting me

Runaway runaway runaway
And all the fear is gone now
On this path we take, this lifewe share
An answer might appear
And fair wind's awaiting me

A quest that only some would take
It grabs our soul if there is one
Could (it) be that we're left alone
Or guided by the moonlight

Burning constellation
On this trail to the unknown
I just keep on questoning
For an answer never told
Darker than the night
Is the way we're passing through

Courage and faith it takes
To make it last that far
It may ends for tomorrow
Or it may take a lifetime

(Dream on...)
