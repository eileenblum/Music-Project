[Music:Aydan, Damnagoras / Lyrics: Aydan]

I built a cradle for the Moon
And from her chariot (she) grants my
boon - I'll keep my promises, I'm sure
She won't betray me

I'm bathed in her pale lightfall
Perceiving like a distant call
She whispers in my ears
riddles I don't understand

Enchanted by thy serene glow
Oh, silent Lady let me know
Of arcane doctrines and secrets
to be not revealed

You doodle Night with stains of stars
Shining arabesques so far

Recite your rhymes, and tell me how to

Find my way - 
through the endless starways
Far away - as man could understand
I will show my respect
Prey upon - to release your anger
Lay upon - my mind

Painted in the sky,
as magic as a silver chariot
Take me on and on [2x]

You and I asleep in my haven 
Shettered by an archway of trees
And when you wake up, I'd rather be
there - Standing by your side

A comet rends this summer sky
Like a tear falls from Her eye
I feel my heart brakes,
the Nightroof is my own refuge

Follow the steps of a pagan
Against who won't understand at all
And what I've learned is how to

Find my way - 
through the endless starways
Far away - as man could understand
I will show my respect
Prey upon - to release your anger
Lay upon - my mind

Painted in the sky,
as magic as a silver chariot
Take me on and on [2x]

You and I asleep in my haven 
Shettered by an archway of trees
And when you wake up, I'd rather be
there - Standing by your side

They're mocking me, they're fighting me,
I'm falling on my knees
They're celebrating victory
let'em do it as they please
They can mock me, they can fight me,
I will pick up off the ground
Again I stand before my enemies
can't let me down

[Solos: Aydan, Jarpen]

Painted in the sky,
as magic, as a silver chariot
Take me on and on...

[Solo licks: Aydan]
