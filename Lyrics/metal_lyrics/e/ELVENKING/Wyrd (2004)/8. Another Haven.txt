[Music &amp; Lyrics: Jarpen]

[Solos: Jarpen / Aydan]

Serenity
Broken and twisted
Displaying sharp claws
in the name of liberty

Primordial greed
Disguised as good purpose
Always stood as a trademark
of our breed
History shows how to avoid all the sorrow
And its teachings we all should borrow
All the fears of the past still lay close

Far away the horizon twinkles
with fragments of hope
Far away some clay is left to mould
another haven

Watching powerless a flow of deeds
that is always the same
A freakshow from heaven sent
Witnessing the rise and fall
of the lessons we learned
They all seem forgotten
All wrongs and mischiefs,
still are carried within
Blinded in front of our tears

I just feel free
Merged into this rhyme
Inoffensive like a fallen stingless bee
Everyday I discover the fire
Burning deep like an undead pyre
Still it feeds all the tragedies of time

Far away the horizon twinkles
with fragments of hope
Far away some clay is left to mould
another haven

Watching powerless a flow of deeds
that is always the same
A freakshow from heaven sent
Witnessing the rise and fall
of the lessons we learned
They all seem forgotten
All wrongs and mischiefs,
still are carried within
Blinded in front of our tears

[Acoustic solo: Jarpen]

Everyday I discover the fire
Burning deep like an undead pyre
Still it feeds all the tragedies of time

Far away the horizon twinkles
with fragments of hope
Far away some clay is left to mould
another haven

Watching powerless a flow of deeds
that is always the same
A freakshow from heaven sent
Witnessing the rise and fall
of the lessons we learned
They all seem forgotten
All wrongs and mischiefs,
still are carried within
Blinded in front of our tears
Blinded in front of our tears
Blinded in front of our tears
