[Music: Jarpen, Aydan / Lyrics: Jarpen]

At dawn the ships arrived, they sailed
through seas and foreign skies
To bring another age in lands
that needed no constraints
By the sign of the fire,
all pagan gods were bleeding
To dispossess thousands years
of wisdom and beliefs, oh

Think for a moment, fall astray
First step on sand, meant the last
of their old life
("now it's done, all is gone"), so pure,
With dignity all was carried on 
"What's this fighting for?"

"Disappearing sands, familiar voices
Everytime I stare at the night inside us
All the places I cherish darken
Past memories are the only
true consolation
For what my eyes are forced to see"

The tears in her eyes were like rain
come from the gloomiest cloud
Pushed back from their own homes,
the germ of hate seized the heart
In a clear warm spring day,
his spirit left the body
Alone she stood while the ravens
flew away from ruins, oh

"Far till sky unites with earth I'll hide you
They cannot dig what's inside of us
Far till sky unites with earth I'll hide you
They cannot dig what's inside of us"

"My life for you, despair on us,
despair on us"

[Solos: Jarpen / Aydan]

Think for a moment, fall astray
First step on sand, meant the last
of their old life
("now it's done, all is gone"), so pure,
With dignity all was carried on 
"What's this fighting for?"

"Disappearing sands, familiar voices
Everytime I stare at the night inside us
All the places I cherish darken
Past memories are the only
true consolation
For what my eyes are forced to see"
