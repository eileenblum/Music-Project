[Music &amp; Lyrics: Aydan]

I was told by my Grandma'
Many years ago, I was just a child
"Boy, go and grow as an honest man
Look on what you've done with pride!"

The years have passed I'm a normal lad
I won't be named in school treatises
But looking back on what I've done
Yes, there's a glimpse of pride!

The losers' ball - Dance with me
to the sound of the fiddle
For the ones who fall - Like a cloudless
sky reflected in a billow
Learn a new step for each new Babylon
(build the city of lies and despair)

If you have time send a message
To every form of human life
"Hey out there if someone listens
This way we won't survive!"

We'll be drawn in arrogance
Hanged by the noose of greed
A new religion of violence
A bible of bad deeds

The losers' ball - Dance with me
to the sound of the fiddle
For the ones who fall - Like a cloudless
sky reflected in a billow
Learn a new step for each new Babylon
(build the city of lies-lust-despair)
