[Music &amp; Lyrics: Aydan]

Stand before the new born kind

There is a song, taken far by the winds

A rhyme of poets, a melody
Wrapped in a dream
The elvensong has gone, to another realm

Stand before the new born kind

As young and fresh as the Spring in bloom
The song is telling stories
Every little is a gain
Tells of joy, it tells of pain

Pathfinders...searching for new scents
We are pathfinders!

Rulers of a reign without throne and 
crown "Thou will shall be done!"
beyond our bounds
Wondering, seeking and roaming
the unbeaten paths
Face future learning from the past

Lay down no bounds
to the things you can do
Everything's in your hand,
look up to the Moon
All we are gathering, shall we not fall
We'll hold (we'll hold on)
we will meet again
This time my dear old friend

Singing our song, we went abreast
We plunged into a deeply cloven track
May the stars shine
Upon the end of road, now you can't tide

Stand before the new born kind

As young and fresh as the Spring in bloom
The song is telling stories
Every little is a gain
Tells of joy, it tells of pain

Pathfinders...searching for emotions
We are pathfinders!

Rulers of a reign without throne and 
crown "Thou will shall be done!"
beyond our bounds
Wondering, seeking and roaming
the unbeaten paths
Face future learning from the past

Lay down no bounds
to the things you can do
Everything's in your hand,
look up to the Moon
All we are gathering, shall we not fall
We'll hold (we'll hold on)
we will meet again
This time my dear old friend

If you can't express what you feel within
Remember not only words can speak
If a pen killed more than sword
Let this tune be your own word!

A new journey begins each time
(hear my call)
You draw lotsfor new things to find
We are willing to endure the chance

Lay down no bounds...
[Solos: Aydan, Jarpen]
