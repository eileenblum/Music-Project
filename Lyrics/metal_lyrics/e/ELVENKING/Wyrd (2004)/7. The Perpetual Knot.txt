[Music &amp; Lyrics Aydan]

And this journey begins --
with the beat of wings of lark
Her wake ravishing - skyforged spark
Gold-leaves are falling, all beasts are
howling, the signs are clear!

The forces are near -
the crows say that someone will die
Embraces and fear - they tell no lies
Searching for new roads, sacrifice your
blood, the signs are clear!

Eyes in the darkness
They watch, they follow you
The Spirits guide your soul
all through the clues
Eyes in the darkness
Now hear the Sisters' voice,
you are free to choose your fate
now make your choice

Through the seven seas our quest goes,
pale moon our guide
Walking the trails of the perpetual knot
Roughly carved tree-trunks are shining in
fading lights
May you read the meanings, it's your lot

The journey comes to an end -
the lark plunged with sun into sea
All you love and defend - 
belongs to you and me
Pagan traditions of forgotten missions,
the signs are clear!

Eyes in the darkness
They watch, they follow you
The Spirits guide your soul
all through the clues
Eyes in the darkness
Now hear the Sisters' voice,
you are free to choose your fate
now make your choice

Through the seven seas our quest goes,
pale moon our guide
Walking the trails of the perpetual knot
Roughly carved tree-trunks are shining 
in fading lights
May you read the meanings

Through the seven seas our quest goes,
pale moon our guide
Walking the trails of the perpetual knot
Search for the fibres,
the dwelling light net of Wyrd
Roaming souls on branch of Mother Earth
