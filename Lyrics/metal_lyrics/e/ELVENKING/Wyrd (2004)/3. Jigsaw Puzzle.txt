[Music &amp; Lyrics: Jarpen]

Take a look at the new rules of this game
Wicked laughters are feeding their fame
Hearing the cries from the empty shells
Unmoved they seem

Hungry for turmoil and wedges
Ivy-clad so that we can't see
One peace at a time they steal
Collecting memories

Notch up another victory
Upon our shoulders and true beliefs
With wheedling words they reign
So sweet is our decay

Raise your voice
Aim as high as they can't see
Now you can say:
"Speak your last word,
speak your last word!"

Born in the garden of overgrown madness
We still search what remains of our lives
Scattered pieces for their jigsaw puzzle
Swapping destinies

Whencesoever they derive their powers
Where all hopes are misled and repressed
Vowing to break from the hardest chains
Tearless they seem

Prophets of doom
Playing god, how does it feel?
The fate of Sky and Earth
Awaits their sentence too

Shattered we are
Sold and bought in the Merchants' fair
Beneath hard flesh it burns
Beware of our hate!

[repeat Bridge and Chorus]
