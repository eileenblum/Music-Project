[Music &amp; Lyrics: Aydan]

Long the shores of a silent stream
I'm picking up pieces of my life
Finding out I was living my own dream
Beginning once again

I searched for themes
that I never knew before
It's like roaming a forest in winter
searching buds buried in snow
I learnt new languages,
new forms to proclaim
All the will to be so sincere,
not lying to myself again

Roaming through forest's trees
Creating a white snow trail on fallen
leaves

Oh Mother Moon
Illuminate my return
'cause the road I took is so obscure

Sinking and drowning in a sea of fears
Showing compassion to the moan
Already happened in day long gone
The silk dilemma is the key, it's still for me

One by one the lights fade out
The fright-night covers all with her cloak
You cannot name the colour of the dark
I fall into a dream

From the lands lying at the end of World
I am bringing this dress as a gift, it is
made with the purest silk
She smiled at me,
she never wore the dress
Touching the fabric was like holding 
nothing in your hand

Roaming through forest's trees
Creating a white snow trail on fallen
leaves

Oh Mother Moon
Illuminate my return
'cause the road I took is so obscure

Sinking and drowning in a sea of fears
Showing compassion to the moan
Already happened in day long gone
The silk dilemma is the key

Hold my hand - 'till the sun set off
I'm proud of what I've done
At least the days I've spent are so totally
unique
