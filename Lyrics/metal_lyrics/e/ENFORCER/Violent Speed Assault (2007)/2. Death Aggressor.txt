Death is near
time has comed
rage you wont support
blood is flowing
in the weak soul
the attacker is somebody you know
death aggressor
will destroy
any believers of kindness force
possessed by destroyer force
the lethal attack has no remorse

the end is complete
your god does not exist
the slaughter starts now
with the final dawn
it's the prelude of death
in this world of pain
creator of the storm
death aggressor

ready your end
its your last breath
he summons your death
walking without way
over your fears
never come back the peace
without salvation
terror you feel
search the last hope
sacrifice to the final killer done
merciless aggression
his main weapon.
