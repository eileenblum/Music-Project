In my mind the killer instinct
to kill all my enemies without mercy
dont think in creeds, only in bad
absolute cruelty i feel in my hearth
now i see their blood flow
fear and terror can you see in their eyes
show no mercy annihilate all bastards
total death i need in my life

Prepare your weapons, ready to fight
total annihilation in this night
attack without mercy, kill'em all
malevolent force in my soul

Hate, death, destruction
terminal slaughter is the way
there is no remorse in my soul
only hate in my blood
