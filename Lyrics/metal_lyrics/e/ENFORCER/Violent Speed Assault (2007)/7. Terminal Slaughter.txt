the metal descends and metalbangers
reign
this is the massacre of their final day
in the air the smell the death
they dont have place to escape

Leather and chains arms of this war
we have arrived, the evil attack
hate in my eyes death in my hands
destruction of the fools, annihilation of
christians

Slaughter of christians all night
your attack on them is wild
the fear of the man can be sensed
rage and violence, endless vengeance
