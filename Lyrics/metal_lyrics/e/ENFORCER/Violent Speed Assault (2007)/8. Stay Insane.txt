Black jacket and long hair
I can remember when you said
what the look of a true
so should be

Follow living with hate
stay in madness insane
if you're a false bastard
you will not survive
dont interpose in my way
because i'm thrashing with evil
its better that you stay insane
or it will be your death

you forgot the chains
you forgot the leather
now you live like a fucking gay
acuses you, your pretty smell

you speak that the love does not exist
but you enjoy parties with your girlfriend
i prefer the alcohol, drugs
and to pay for sex

with the time i understood
insanity is my way and venom infected my life
forever we will feel proud
and will never stop the madness
that we feel only us the pure maniacs
