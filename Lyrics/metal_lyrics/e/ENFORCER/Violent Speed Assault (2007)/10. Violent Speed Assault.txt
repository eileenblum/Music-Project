maximun distortion, the metal fucking
rules
ever more violent and speed is this sound
drums of war sounding without stopping
feel the power of our violent noise

Under the edge of our guitars
pain your soul will feel
your life is lot
under the violent speed assault
the raise of the hate attack
i don't hear your screams
the cruelty force
violent speed assault

Onslaught of noise destroy your senses
alcohol and drugs inspire our notes
we live for metal that burn in our
souls
violence and speed is our law.
