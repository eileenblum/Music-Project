the hate grows in my mind and the evil
envolves me
only i want to see death and destruction
violent force runs through my veins
desiring to destroy and to kill

you may not control
when you listen metal
the force of evil feels in your soul
power in my soul bursting
the metal storm destroys all

you feel my rage
you can scream but never escape
to feel your pain is my desire
to destroy and to kill is my pleasure
wrath to my enemies
death to posers now
the megadecibels impact
destroying your brain
