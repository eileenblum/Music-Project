Guided by the evil force
the flame of metal burning our lives
making our noise fast and loud
crushing the blunt sound
product of our merciless speed
we start the madness
this is the tone of war
the storm to come
is our rush of power

Feel the noise of savage rage
the battlefield is my stage
you can see the sea of flames
my lethal sound destroys your faith
the metal forces are with me
noise and rage, can you feel?
stand up and fight destroy all night
savage noise you will die

feel the wikcked sound destroying the
holy laws
in the sign of evil we live with the
fucking metal fist
to create destruction and death is the
mission for this night
violent speed, evil force, take the
revenge now
