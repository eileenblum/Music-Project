Rambling throught the city
on this restless night
Love like a beast
can fill me with delight
Looking for something
to set my need aside
Oh baby, take me with you
all the way inside

Take me with you and teach me
oh let me feel you
get on your knees
and feel the power flowing through
Expose your inner rage
and push me into you deep
Ignore the world a while
then fall into an endless sleep

Mistress from hell - show me life
Mistress from hell - show me love
Mistress from hell - hold me tight
Mistress from hell - love me
TONIGHT

In her eyes a passion glows
a passion that can kill
She'll have my soul
as long as I got the thrill
Loving until the dawn
Then she runs for the light
Please let me rock again
And live for the night!

Mistress from hell - show me life
Mistress from hell - show me love
Mistress from hell - hold me tight
Mistress from hell - love me
TONIGHT

Rambled throught the city
on a restless night
Love with the beast
has filled me with delight
Looking for something
to set my need aside
Oh baby, take me with you
all the way inside
