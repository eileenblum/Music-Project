Onward she comes with the look in her eyes
Onward she's coming for me
Moving like shadows in pale candle light
Faster than you'll ever see
On through the night she will carry my sins
Deep in the heart of the midnight
Escaping the burning light of the day
Evil upon us tonight

Speed Queen
Shoot out the lights
Speed Queen
Get ready tonight

Takes me to places where I've never been
Shows me what life's all about
Taking my chances, a life on the run
Loving hard, death, scream and shout
Lady of midnight, come take me away
No messing around, not a chance
Under a spell she will burn up the night
Speed Queen, a hellish romance

Speed Queen
Shoot out the lights
Speed Queen
Get ready tonight

Speed Queen
Come take me away
