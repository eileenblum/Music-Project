Into the night we rise
From the gates of hell we're marching on
To take on the world with force
Destruction and death upon the earth

To take another life
To deal another death
No one can save your soul tonight

INTO THE NIGHT
INTO THE NIGHT
INTO THE NIGHT
INTO THE NIGHT

Your soul you must sacrifice
Pray to your god for the end
Fallen from the skies
Show your pride and meet your death

To take another life
To deal another death
No one can save your soul tonight

INTO THE NIGHT
INTO THE NIGHT
INTO THE NIGHT
INTO THE NIGHT

The world's at an end, no return
The flames of the chosen will burn
The sons of your grace led astray
Into the night far away

INTO THE NIGHT
INTO THE NIGHT
INTO THE NIGHT
INTO THE NIGHT

The world's at an end, no return
The flames of the chosen will burn
The sons of your grace led astray
Into the night far away
