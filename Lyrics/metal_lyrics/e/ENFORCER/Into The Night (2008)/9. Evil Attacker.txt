Evil attackers march out in the night
looking for you, yes, to start a fight
metal and spikes they are armed to their heart
Leather and chains, they will tear you apart

Evil attacker
Metal Fight
Evil attacker
In the night

Alone in the dark you are shaking with fear
Where noone can find you ,canÂ´t you hear
The sound of an army unleashed from hell
Crying for death to avoid their evil spell

Evil attacker
Metal Fight
Evil attacker
In the night

Midnight has come and the leathers we've strapped on
Soldiers from hell we will fight 'til the dawn
Guided by the cold stars, your nightmare is back
We will bring you down yeah it's time to attack!

Evil attacker
Metal Fight
Evil attacker
In the night
