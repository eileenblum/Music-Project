I'm on the hunt tonight
To play this evil game
Yearning eyes that seek their prey
Something wild to tame
Living tough to the end
Living wild and I never stop
Hunting senseless love
Quest for passion I'm on the top

Empty streets surround us here
And I am in a daze!
Strangers now but in your way
The way you move sets me ablaze
No affection at hand
Strong desire to get this through
For the moment you're mine
No turning back I have chosen you

On the loose tonight
I'm on the loose tonight

Finished duty I'm prepared
Prepared to get on the run
Hit the burning streets of night
Dumped the last on to the next one
On the hunt once again
On the hunt for another piece
No one will get to me
My quest for passion will never cease

On the loose tonight
I'm on the loose tonight

Out in the streets again and again
Dawn, come embrace me in early morning light
Out in the streets through night after night I'll be

On the loose tonight
I'm on the loose tonight
