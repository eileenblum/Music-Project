Innocence lost and you're trying to run from your fate
Run for your life but you're destined to die it is too late
Bred by street where you live and you thrive
Like a query in the dark you must fight to survive

CURSE
Curse the light
DEATH
Will walk along
FIGHT
Just break the spell
CURSE
Curse the light of day

Black evil forces just waiting to get you tonight
Merciless warriors of hell with death in their sight
Can you hear voices surrounding you, are you insane?
Metal sound rising it's piercing you right through your brain

CURSE
Curse the light
DEATH
Will walk along
FIGHT
Just break the spell
