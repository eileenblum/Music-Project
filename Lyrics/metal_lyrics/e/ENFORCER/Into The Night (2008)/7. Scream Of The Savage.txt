You are walking
Through the darkness
In the misty morning lights

Clear the smoke
Rise from the ground
Standing tall with your fist in the air

Kissed by the tongue of death
A bite of the snake
You see a storm coming your way

No shackles can bind you
No chains can hold you down
You were born to live in hell

Out in the streets again, night after night
Living in violence, ready to fight
Searching and craving, looking for prey
Restless when night turns to day

No need for safety, no need for love
No need for nothing no matter what it's made of
Live life intense, at speed, fast and for the day
Can you tell me honestly you've never felt this way?

Scream of the savage
Break out to be free
Scream of the savage
