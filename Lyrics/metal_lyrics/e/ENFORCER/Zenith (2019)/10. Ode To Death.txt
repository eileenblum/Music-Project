Night the days are waxing bleak
December ice forms on the boughs
A branch that severs a sole last leaf
Light dwindles into a fall

The brines abiding ebb and flow
Pulsating rhythm of the sea
Alternating tides move seamlessly
As ocean storms draw near

Clutches of winter
Ushering death and awakening again
The grasp of time
Overthrowing inequity and harmony

Crude are the gods of man
Civilizations raised in their name
For whom has blood been shed
Just to be awashed in eternity

Generations lost in toil
The futility of conquests and triumph
Implanted monoliths
Bearing new laws from superior life

Gone be the memories
Progress demands sacrifice
On through a whirl of stars
Where gravity swallows all signs of life

To Jupiter and beyond, beyond infinity
On and on through space and time
To unknown stellar domains

To Jupiter and beyond, beyond infinity
On and on through space and time
To unknown stellar domains

To Jupiter and beyond, beyond infinity
On and on through space and time
To unknown stellar domains
