Living high and living free
Advancing up quite easily
Taking no times, but to be in a rut
Believe thereâs no tomorrow

It will be treacherous
holding down
it will be venturous
and Iâll come around

Kill me
Thrill me
Move me through the night
Leave me when Iâm all dressed up for action

Kill me
Thrill me
Move me through the night
You cannot play me
Save me

Death rides this night!

Flashing lights Iâm moving fast
Reaching even higher
Holding on while it lasts
Gonna set you all afire

It will be treacherous
holding down
it will be venturous
and Iâll come around

Kill me
Thrill me
Move me through the night
Leave me when Iâm all dressed up for action

Kill me
Thrill me
Move me through the night
You cannot play me
Save me

Death rides this night!

Leave me when Iâm all dressed up for action

Kill me
Thrill me
Move me through the night
You cannot play me
Save me

Death rides this night!
