You donât know what is out there
Soothing dreams of dying
In superstition and darkness
You know itâs dead and itâs old

I see that the daylight is gone
As Iâm fading away with the sun
With you

And now the hours are bending
Nothing lasts forever
Pieces that donât fit together
Constant time is falling apart

I see that the daylight is gone
As Iâm fading away with the sun

Take me out-Take me out of this nightmare
Take me out-Take me out of this nightmare
Wonât you take me out
Take me out of this nightmare
Come on and take me out
Take me out of this nightmare
Forever gone

I know that I never will wake up
And forever follow
You changed my sight to this shadow
And Iâm feeling my fears gonna swell
oh, no

I see that the daylight is gone
As Iâm fading away with the sun

Take me out-Take me out of this nightmare
Take me out-Take me out of this nightmare
Wonât you take me out
Take me out of this nightmare
Come on and take me out
Take me out of this nightmare

[SOLO O/J-J-O/J]

Take me out-Take me out of this nightmare
Take me out-Take me out of this nightmare
Wonât you take me out
Take me out of this nightmare
Come on and take me out
Take me out of this nightmare
