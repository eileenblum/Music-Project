Born from the nightmares the darkness calls upon
Bred by a banshee, a hellish demon spawn
All life forsaken I chant the black crowned one
Calling a prayer to the midnight sun

A blaze that sets the sky alight
Shadow forces, evil rites!
Ancient quests yet to ignite
Set the world afire!

Sacrificed-Into the darkness I am
Sacrificed-To live on forever
Sacrificed-Leaving the world now I am
Sacrificed-To live on forever

Whispering the words of spell I greet the punic skies
Warm blood runs from the altar soon to be received
Demons embracing tying an eternal bond
Life is now sacrificed, to all there is beyond

A blaze that sets the sky alight
Shadow forces, evil rites!
Ancient quests yet to ignite
Set the world afire!

Sacrificed-Into the darkness I am
Sacrificed-To live on forever
Sacrificed-Leaving the world now I am
Sacrificed-To live on forever

[SOLO O-O-O]

Born from the nightmares the darkness calls upon
Bred by a banshee, a hellish demon spawn
All life forsaken I chant the black crowned one
Calling a prayer to the midnight sun

A blaze that sets the sky alight
Shadow forces, evil rites!
Ancient quests yet to ignite
Set the world afire!

Sacrificed-Into the darkness I am
Sacrificed-To live on forever
Sacrificed-Leaving the world now I am
Sacrificed-To live on forever
