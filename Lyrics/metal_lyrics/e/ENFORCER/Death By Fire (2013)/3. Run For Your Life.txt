Phantoms of the night, spread your wings
and gather the damned souls of yours
Can you hear a distant voice whoâs
chanting your name
They are coming to take your life

The fall of night across the city leaves you blind
The shadows of rising terror

Nothing now can change your fate
You try to run but itâs too late
The devil now, he has got you in his grip
Youâd just try

Run for your life

[SOLO O]

Time has come for you to meet the gleaming blade
Under a cold moon you will die tonight
Taking pleasure in licking your blood
An inalterable and final revenge

The fall of night across the city leaves you blind
The shadows of rising terror

Nothing now can change your fate
You try to run but itâs too late
The devil now, he has got you in his grip
Youâd just try
Run for your life

[SOLO J-O/J-O]

The fall of night across the city leaves you blind
The shadows of rising terror

Nothing now can change your fate
You try to run but itâs too late
The devil now, he has got you in his grip
Youâd just try

Run for your life
Run for your life
Run for your life
Run for your life
