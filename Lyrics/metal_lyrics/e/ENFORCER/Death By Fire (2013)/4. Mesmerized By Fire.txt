Mesmerized by fire!!

Pounding on through the night
The gates of hell soon reveals
You canât escape your fate is sealed
Sadistic powers for real

Violent your death unfolds
Close to touch the jaws
Living on evil
Death has you in itâs claws

Burning alive, pray for death to take your hand
Hear yourself crying out to blackened skies

Behold-You will die-Tonight
Mesmerized by fire
Your death-Unfolds-Tonight
Mesmerized by fire

Frozen with fear with burning mind
Your time is running out
A look into eager eyes
Reveals the devilâs wrath

Feeling the flames licking your cheeks
Fulfilling the dark evil spell
Choking on the burning air
Sets you off through the casts of hell

Burning alive, pray for death to take your hand
Hear yourself crying out to blackened skies

Behold-You will die-Tonight
Mesmerized by fire
Your death-Unfolds-Tonight
Mesmerized by fire

Pagan sacrifice, fumes of burning flesh will rise
No one to help you, not to save you
Death has taken you!!!!!

Set the devilâs sign in flames, and raise it to the sky
Death by fire
You are burning
You are burning in hell

[SOLO J-O]
