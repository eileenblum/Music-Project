Armageddon now is here
No tomorrow, final stand
Die in fear and writhe in pain
Hot winds of death across the land

Satan
Satan
Satan
Satan
Let me be one with your force

The final hour is getting near
Extinction of the human race
Destroyer of the universe
Come on now feel deathâs embrace

Satan
Satan
Satan
Satan
Take me and carry me away

[SOLO J-O]

Satan
Satan
Satan
Satan
Let me be one with your force

Take us all you son of evil
The hunger is of our insistence
Adversary of the world of order
Desecrator of the world existence

Satan
take me and carry me away!
