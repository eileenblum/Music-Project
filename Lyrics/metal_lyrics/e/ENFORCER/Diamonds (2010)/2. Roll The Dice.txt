I'm going down the road just living for the day
Since I rolled the dice there ain't no other way
Thrills and excitement it fills me with delight
Look out for me, I strike tonight!

Awake the lust to love, awake the lust to kill
I make another throw and you law becomes my will
There must be ways to roll to take me even higher
There must be ways to reach the burning fire

Out in the night on my own
Found myself playing a game
Living to win, living to lose
Come on and let go
Roll the dice!

Trapped by the power, the power of its will
My only exit is for my own blood to spill
I have no chance to run, I have no chance to hide
Got a pact with evil and the devil by my side

Out in the night on my own
Found myself playing a game
Living to win, living to lose
Come on and let go
Roll the dice!
