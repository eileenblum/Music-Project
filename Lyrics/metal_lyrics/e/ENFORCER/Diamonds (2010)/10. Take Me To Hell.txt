Night falls and the full moon is glimmering bright
The sky is growing black stating nothing is sacred tonight

Cry it out, living life in the fast lane
Break the chains, break the chains to what's holding you down

Love of heavens won't make me heavenly
You try to embrace but your love is not made for me

Take me to Hell
Get me out of here

Heed the call, heed the call from Mephisto's bell
Consecrate your soul to the message of hell

Take me to hell - Living life in the fast lane
Take me to hell - Break the chains to what's holding you down
Take me to hell - Chew And spit it out
Take me to hell - Lit it and burned it out
