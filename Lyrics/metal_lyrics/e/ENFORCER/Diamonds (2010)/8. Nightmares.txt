Unconsciousness writing the scene of an end
Your distance sows nightmares of red to release
In a state of the tragic decay
They need what's to die here
I try to hold back but the fire is free
The pages are glowing in red
As I transfer through flames, I'm dividing the sea
The end of the story is now to be unfold

I need this fire to burn out
No sun can guide me through this night
They bleed, I weep
Your time til death gets short as I fall asleep
The night is over now
It's over now
It's over now

Awared I am weak, I take actions in sleep
In the hollow I'm altered, I'm draped
I try to awake but the dream is too deep
So close to the final flame that will free as the angels decease
They need what's to die, they need what's to be
So I kiss you goodnight, then they breed
Awake in this nightmare
Oh no!

The empty page reveals no truth no longer
These tired eyes won't read this through
The letters from the sunny side of this coma
Can't reach the darkness you are in

The heat of the sun surrounds me longer
The freezing deceit prevents me to see
The hole of your soul is weak as a dying whisper
The breath of my dreams is choking your screams
