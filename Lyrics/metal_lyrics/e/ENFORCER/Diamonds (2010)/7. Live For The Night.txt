Up from the dark depths of hell you come to play with my life
I feel your venomous glance cutting like a knife

Take me away
With your sinister list
Seduce me and I can't resist
We live for the night!

Bewitching my soul, lust for the flesh keeps me awake
Night after night in a daze with my life at stake

Take me away
With your sinister list
Seduce me and I can't resist
We live for the night!
