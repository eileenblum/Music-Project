A trembling ride down under
On a cloudy lane
All logical directions
Will swerve away
A foggy haze
In a mental maze
Escape the cold intrusion
Of the upper world

I stand alone beneath the hollow
The senses will follow
Euphoric states are taking turns
The surface will burn
A sense of disturbance
Between the walls of consciousness
I am trapped alone beneath the thunder
The gates will close
Below the slumber

[Solo]

I stand below the earthly
In the blackened ground
The astral world's mechanics
Now make no sound
The beating clocks from reality
Recalls the subsistence
All the way down here

I stand alone beneath the hollow
The senses will follow
Euphoric states are taking turns
The surface will burn
A sense of disturbance
Between the walls of consciousness
I am trapped alone beneath the thunder
The gates will close
Below the slumber

There's too much to unveil
In constructions of the sleep
A sentiment of fright
The dream has gone too deep

Whatever it may take
It might not be too late
To capture the control
And return to be awake

[Solo]

A trembling ride down under
On a cloudy lane
I stand below the slumber
For all time to come
