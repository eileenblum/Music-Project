The dead no longer
Envy the living
You're born for burning
And burn is what you do
There will be no life
There will be no light
There will be blood
And death will come for you

The world is burning
Crying of the angels choir
He's one with fire
The world is burning
Behold the one with fire

One with fire

No sun is shining
No moon is rising
In deepest darkness
The ending has begun
The final hour
Is getting closer
On wings of horror
He sweeps across the land

The world is burning
Crying of the angels choir
He's one with fire
The world is burning
Behold the one with fire

One with fire

The ground is churning from down below
Eternal fire upon the earth
I hear him calling
Now he is near
Spread your wings, Death
Now please won't you take me away

[Solo]

One with fire
