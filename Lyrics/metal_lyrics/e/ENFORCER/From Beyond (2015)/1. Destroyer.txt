Wrapped around your neck
Chains of death now are tense
Swords of darkness
To arms commence
Under the sign
An unholy strife
Devil's hot breath
Breeding new life

Evil arise

Destroyer

Killers are ready
Attacking severe
Gather around
The war's drawing near
Bells of destruction
Can you hear the chime?
Destroyer of worlds
Annihilation of time

Riding the earth

Destroyer

[Solo]

Destroyer - evil arise
Destroyer - existence demise
Destroyer - life's last stand
Destroyer - Satan's command
