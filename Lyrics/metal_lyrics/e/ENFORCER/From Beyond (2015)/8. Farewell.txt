[Solo]

Now you can feel it fall apart
Death is just another start
If you're wandering astray
Death is just a dream away
Read the omens in the sky
There is more than meets the eye
See reflections out of sight
Just beware what's in the night

You fade away...

Farewell!

You must embrace what you have lost
There's a line that you must cross
To reveal what's still unfolded
Memories won't let you go

When you feel the last caress
Sleep of death will be a bless
In the darkness, in the deep
Now it's time for you to sleep

[Solo]

Now you can feel it fall apart
Death is just another start
If you're wandering astray
Death is just a dream away
Read the omens in the sky
There is more than meets the eye
See reflections out of sight
Just beware what's in the night

Farewell!
So set me free
Farewell!
Death is just another start
You fade away
So set me free
