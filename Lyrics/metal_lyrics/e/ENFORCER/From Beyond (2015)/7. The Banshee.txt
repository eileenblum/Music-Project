[Solo]

The night has come
Descending now
Day fades away
Ungodly shadows embrace the light

Your presence now
Destroys me
But I can't let you go
A cry from the abyss another has to die

Banshee's call!
She is the devil's child
Your hypnotizing fall
Evil rise above us all

A deadly strike
Darkened charm
A warning of doom
Now I know the time has come to meet my fate

Your magic
Enchants me
Reaper of the dark
Quench my desires come and swing your scythe

Banshee's call!
She is the devil's child
Your hypnotizing fall
Evil rise above us all

[Solo]

Your burning fire
Is growing on
Upon me tonight
I'm on my knees now come and cast your spell

A demon
A hellspawn
Satan's cold eyes
Messenger of evil, executioner of the night

Banshee's call!
She is the devil's child
Your hypnotizing fall
Evil rise above us all
