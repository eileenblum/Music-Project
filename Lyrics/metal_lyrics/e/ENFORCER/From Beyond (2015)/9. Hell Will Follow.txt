Come queen of harvest
Come reap the storm
Burn earthly matter
No light in this dawn

Circle the weak
Spread the disease
Hail to the few who are one with the beast

And hell will follow

Nemesis of light
Swallow the earth
Drown them in blood
Show them the thirst of the gods

Circle the weak
Spread the disease
Hail to the few who are one
One with the beast

And hell will follow
And hell will follow

Come queen of harvest
Come reap the storm
Burn earthly matter
No light in this dawn

Circle the weak
Spread the disease
Hail to the few who are one,

One with the beast
