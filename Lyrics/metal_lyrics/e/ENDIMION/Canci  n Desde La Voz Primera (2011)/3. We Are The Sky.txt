We cannot fly
We are the sky
We need the earth
And solitude

We are the sky
And the last trash
Come to you, sky!
We are nothing, nothing.
Bloody illusion
Extreme passion, next pain
We are the mother earth
And we said good â bye!

Someone in pain
In solitude
Someone needs help
Nobodyâs help
Because an angel
An angel needs life.

Break your chains
Come to sleep
Or to dream
Alone in your fears
Step in solitude
You love the sky.

Silence for the pain
Silence for the death
Sadness for silence
Silence for your death.

For yourself
My cry stop
I see the sun
See the sun fall.

To be or no to be?
To be a falling god
To be an enemy
To be the lost stars
