Life, my life
This is the time to dream
And live
For eternity.

I change this dream
For my lifeâs dream
A perfect dream is my perfect life
Life without mercy
Slave of my hope
Slave of my dreams
Slave of my soul.

My Lady

Lady of this world and its invisible
Lady of my world in the visibles
And in my world I am the only visible.

Lord of lords
Slave of my dreams 

To live is to sleep
And dream
And see inside of the dreaming minds
Without know who I am
Or what I am
Iâll be and I donât gonna exist in your dream
I will see inside
Inside my mind
And I will  feel all your hits
I wonât scream.

And you undress In front of me
In this end of world
That is my end and I die
Is my end and I fall
Into the abyss and without tears

Not of sorrow
End of world and dream
Without awake
