Come with me, after me
After my caress
Alone in this dark
Every time further/beyond

Our daydream die
And we fall in a morbid hell
Like the gods of sorrow
In a kingdom of eternal pain

Depressing life
Doomed to cry
Slowly kill you
Forever beyond
Deep wound in my soul
I need to die now.

Come with me, after me
After my dreams of love
After my tears of blood
In a kingdom of sorrow

Come with me, after me
Come with me, after me
Come with me, after me
Come with me, with me
