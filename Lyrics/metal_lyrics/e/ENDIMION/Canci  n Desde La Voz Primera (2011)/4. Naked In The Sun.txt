I remember myself
My eyes lost in the night
When I die, 
When I suicide my illusion 
Now mi dead for me
My lost memories
In the absolute

Visit my darkness
I am not coming to talk
I am coming to cry 
To die in my arms

Lost caress in tears 
Fly in the infinite
Naked in the sun 
And kiss my impure heart

Love me for them that I die for them
Open your eyes, walk under my fear
For them I love you, for all is my pain

Visit my darkness
I am not coming to talk
I am coming to cry
To die in your arms

Naked in the sun
Kiss my impure heart
I remember you
Lost in the absolute
Come to fly with me
To fly in the universe

My lost daydream
I need an eternal rain 
For sleep in your arms forever
An illusions rain
Because i cannot live with me anymore.
