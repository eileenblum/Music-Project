Fire 
In my land depths
I cannot stop those flames
My soul is dominated
By the four winds of death

Pestilence and darkness
In the depth of my eyes
Emanates blood and tears
Tears and ice in the depth night

Black winds in my land
A land that falls before me
I cannot find my peace
In my soul this darkness
Is sadness, an abyss and tears

I live in the fire of my life
I fall alive, light meets its end 

The past becomes my present life
Of sad memories
Of fire, i cannot stop those flames

Dead winds in my only day
Mi in fire, my heart dies in the land

My lost wishes in the fire
Every sunset are poisened
For a bloody lights sky
That comes from inside my closed eyes

My sky is dead
I am outside of it
My bones becomes dust
In the land of fears

I think in a star
But i don't remember
The light of the lights
The voice of my blood

My wishes are
A story to forget
I cannot save my land
Crying my lost power.
