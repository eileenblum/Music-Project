Rain of bloody tears in this night
Tears of the sky 
My eyes emanate blood in this night
Let's talk about the hell tonight
Talk about the sky
When mighty angels ruled our world

I want to agonize far from you
Die behind the time
Bathed in blood
And roaring dying
Hidden and dry
Donât occult your tears to sky
That maybe someday I'll forgive your death

Without tears I imagine you bathing
In a cascade of spring dry leaves 
And hopefully you die drowned by your weight
And remember my agony forever.

Endless, my life follows its course
While yours vanishes in tears of blood
And thousand of daggers cross your head
And your eyes jumps jumping to shit
