When you look into my eyes
You will not see a thing alive
For what rests inside this head
Is what once lived, yet now is dead.

A man who always dreamt of life
Tried to live but died inside
A man who lives, yet chose to die
Is dead inside, yet still alive.

That man was killed by a thousand lies
Not a mortal death, but a death inside.

Those few who bear me no disguise
Show me truth behind the lies
Tell me of your wild desires
Your truth shall reignite my eyes.
