I have found myself lost
Walking down these familiar streets,
Those strange faces stare blindly
I withdraw into my mind
In this solitude, it is sadness I find

In lament, I live a lie
I long to live, yet hope to dieâ¦

Eyes window the pain
Contained in me
Face masks the torment
You will never, ever see

Enclosed within these walls
They've muted all my cries
Trapped alone in darkness
I never felt alive
Then I briefly saw the light
A fools paradise
I felt the sun's warm rays
When you gave me back my life

But now that dusk i near
Lost again, I find
I'm back in those dark woods,
Although now I've seen the light
Although it shone so brief
It cleansed through my mind
But as a fire soon burns out
All the hope I had has died

I walked through the shady graves
Buried beneath the mire
Not a single soul can be saved
In weariness, I tire
Oh, how I long to live!
Yet I hopeâ¦ to die.
