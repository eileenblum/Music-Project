Drunk with the scent of Daphne
Dizzied by the flight of the bee
Mesmerised in the surge of the ocean
Creation, it encompasses me

I feel there's a place for a soul,
But where would it go?
I know when there's fire within (peace from within)
Is it me, or could it be him?

Far beyond this moment in time
I sense a presence near
From beyond what entered my mind
Sweet voices of the night sky I hear
