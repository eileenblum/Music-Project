It makes me sigh
Watching life go by
I see the darkest night
Under the pale blue sky

To know what's real
I cannot see
Hidden beneath the mask,
Even when reality be
I have been blinded
Afraid to see
The darkness in the light
Elude the truth, the way it be.

On a Winter's morn
I see the Grey Dawn
The cold chills my spine
Like the hatred in my mind

I went to the forest
I went to the lake
Saw my own reflection
I saw two eyes, so full of hate
(Please help meâ¦)

As I gaze into the sea
I wish there was no one here, but me
To be at one with this earth
Let all rest in peace, allow a rebirth
(Let your life goâ¦)
