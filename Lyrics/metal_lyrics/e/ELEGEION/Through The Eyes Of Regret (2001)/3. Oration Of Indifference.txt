If peace exists,
We fight within minds
times that are placid
Compliment times when we cry
Such is the path
That you follow, but deny
Benevolence, the evil
Where what's natural is defied
Beware the malefactor
Who appears before your eyes
One who portrays an image
Is the one whose truths are lies
If peace exists
We will fight within our minds
Placid times we cherish
For we know one day we'll cry
For we know one day we'll dieâ¦

The undertow of misery
It grabbed my heels and pulled me under
I could not swim, I could not see,
The heavens wept with rain and thunder

All the pain I keep inside
You know it doesn't mean a thing
All the years of Silent Cries
If this is life, I'd rather die
Getting near to shed my tears
For my life, those wasted years
But if a chance to start again
I'd change it all, everything

This earthâ¦
That I cried forâ¦
I care no moreâ¦
Wasted time I've spentâ¦
Now I'm indifferent

I see the white path before my eyes
I follow it and hear no lies
The objective essence is all I see
For there's no pain in apathy

Oh, I feel
The secrets in life have been revealed
Oh, now I see
To know the truth is to be free.
