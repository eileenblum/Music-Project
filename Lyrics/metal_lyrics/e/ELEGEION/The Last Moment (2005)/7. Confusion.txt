How could I ever let you go? - Come back to me
How was I ever meant to know? - In my arms
Since then my life has gone so slow - I need more
I need and end to all this woe - Want you back

I think you're all that you cared for me - Go far from here
When things were good, you closed your doors - Don't come back
Now that I'm gone, you need me more - Stay away
And now it's you I will ignore - I've lost you

Speech
Light only makes shadow
Is only for hearing
Do you understand?
Words
Night is all I know
I do not know
I don't understand
Blood
Hope is born out of struggle
Is only for bleeding
Can you read my mind?
Endure
Endure and then you go
And then you go
Tell me what I know
