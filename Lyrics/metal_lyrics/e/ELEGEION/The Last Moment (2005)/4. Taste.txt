Tempted by your taste
I knew that from the first time I met you
I can't be the force you need
When you're broken down
How come I always reach
And yet I fall behind you?
I guess I'm
Falling again

Silently dreams, lord knows the sacrifice
Silently screams lord, I know the sacrifice

Waking after sleep
In peace I find no interest in knowing
Where I am inside your heart
So just hold me down
How come I always reach
And yet I fall behind you?

I guess I'm
Falling again

Silently dreams, lord knows the sacrifice
Silently screams lord, I know the sacrifice
I made, I've made

Innocence is lost
To tear apart is to be inside you
Wasted by the course you lead
Why not break it down?
How come I always reach
And yet fall behind you?
I guess I'm
Falling again
