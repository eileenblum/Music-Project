When I found you, you were innocent
Hiding in the wounds
Heaven though you were an angel
Desperately concerned
How did you know you weren't the one for me?
It's my choice to be alone now
Sick inside

How can I turn away
With every tear that you offer?
How can I let you go?
When I need you to
Lie with me
Cry with me
Die with me
Stay with me
Dream with me
Confide in me
Bleed with me

Confused in silence, innocent
Holding onto the inside
Of the wound
Heaven left me to my torment
Sent to die
When you're waiting, I'm nothing
But an empty prayer

How can I turn away
With every tear that you offer?
How can I let you go?
When I need you to
Lie with me
Cry with me
Die with me
Stay with me
Dream with me
Confide in me
Bleed with me
