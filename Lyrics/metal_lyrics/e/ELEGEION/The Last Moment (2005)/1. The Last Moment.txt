I know that
I fucked up
I'm sorry
You should know the truth

I used all
My life up
Thinking how
To end all this pain

If I had one more chance
I would do it again
But I'd be here to stay
I wouldn't give it away
I would've put down the knife
I wouldn't drain out my life
In this death I can see
Just how much you mean to me.

The last moment of life
I know I don't want to die
But now it's too late for me
In death I finally see
goodbye...

Things went well that night
I said something right
You saw the best in me
A view I could not see

Then that fateful night
The pain I could not hide
I had to be set free
From this life's misery
