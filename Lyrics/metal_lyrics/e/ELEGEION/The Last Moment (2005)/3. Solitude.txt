How many deaths must I endure
Before I see the light?
Always awakening in darkness
Where hope's a diminishing light
...where's the light?

In my heart no time exists
Yet to my skin, age still persists
Even when cold and still I lie,
My love for you shall never die

The days I weather
The nights I cry
I'd rather hope forever
Than live a lie...
I'd rather hope forever
Than live a... lie!

I'd never feel a flame
Nor see a light
That burned as warm
Or shone as bright, as you
I've all I never wanted
And nothing of what I do
All I want is happiness
All I want is you.
