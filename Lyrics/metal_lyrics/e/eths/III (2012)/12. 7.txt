Flames eats my soul, iâm captured by the book, remind me all of this as i slip the hook
It generates me, nothings given back, this sheer reality embraces all i got ( all i got)
It floats thru me as electricity, as i keep my head above, still breathing free. Still breathing free

Breaking the seal, there is nothing to feel.
Soul taken beyond, soul is taken beneath

Donât bother, just pretend, iâm not even there.
Iâm wrapped in all this filth, living underneath(underneath)
No fist is given, so just read my palm.
It says : This darkness got my soul tight in its grip. (in its grip)

Breaking the seal, there is nothing to feel.
Soul taken beyond, soul is taken beneath !
