[feat. BjÃ¶rn Strid]By the seventh day,
Ruler, killer, eraser, master, fire, punisher, undertaker.
Will, starter, believer, raper.
Infected water, sealer, seeker, slaver.
My last son grew up and then, killed his father.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears,
Looms but the horror of the shade.
And yet the menace of the years,
Finds and shall find me unafraid.
It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments of the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.

Survivor, conqueror, creator, orator, predator, dictator with terror.
Cursed mirror sound minor.
Taste the fruit of Sodom and Gomorrah.
Mutant, weakest as an ant.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears,
Looms but the horror of the shade.
And yet the menace of the years,
Finds and shall find me unafraid.
It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments of the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.
HAR1

Is it the blood on my hands or my guts in the sand.
Is it the blood on my hands or your guts in the sand.
Is it the blood on my hands or my guts in the sand.
The shadows of the vultures weakens the eye.
Is it the blood on my hands or your guts in the sand.
The shadows of the vultures weakens the eye.

Widens by eye.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears,
Looms but the horror of the shade.
And yet the menace of the years,
Finds and shall find me unafraid.
It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments of the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.
HAR1

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.
Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.
