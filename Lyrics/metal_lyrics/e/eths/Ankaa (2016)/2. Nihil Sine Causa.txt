[feat. Jon Howard]Bones are too thin...
You're the cross.
Face failed, this silent day, an angel says:

Your pain is sharped by your own muddled mind,
try to trap the Devil inside.
ten thousand dead black kidneys leave my hands,
It's raining flesh.

Silence...
Fights, on Canaan's plain;
Iced coffins,
Psychotic plague,
Drowned virgins.
Gods died here yesterday.

Origin of signs,
Falling Gravity purloins the time,
Last tries.
My angel, I promise, you will fly someway.

Resurrection, God Particle,
Masse's missing, awake!
Billions of years, lost matter.
Dawn of Celerity,
Chaos theory,
Light's aggression,
Our catharsis in dust.

Violence...
Night, on Canaan's plain;
Eyes on the skins,
Hypnotic place
Ruled by sin.
Gods died here yesterday.
Gods died...

Origin of signs,
Falling Gravity cracks holy Phi,
Late cries.
My angel, I promise, you fly but sadly miss the sky.
Don't swallow, the last shadow,
I promise, we'll supply for last days.

Iced virgins now are fallin',
Eyes on skin made them too thin,
Night's virgins, throat filled by sin,
Eyes on skin made them too thin,
Iced virgins, flee my skin.

Fights, on Canaan's plain;
Iced coffins,
Psychotic plague,
Drowned virgins.
Gods died here yesterday.
Gods died...

Origin of signs,
Falling Gravity, purloins the time,
Last try.
