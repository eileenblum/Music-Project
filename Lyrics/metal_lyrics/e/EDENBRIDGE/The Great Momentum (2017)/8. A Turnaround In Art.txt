A stage for dreamers, so lost in reverie
To leave routine and lead the boundary
A life as guide or disagreeing
The power of the art to spell all being

A stage for change and contrast
Retain the treasures of the old past
The answer lies inside you
The nature we once knew

Weave yourself into the flow of life
What's moving you inside
Will take you on a ride
Inspiration and imagination, golden way
Leave all doors open wide
The art can be aside

Learning, turning
Where are you now?

Who is free in mind
Never one-eyed blind
So open up and feel
And get out of the wheel
The rhythm and the timing
A neverending climbing
The whole and minor part
A change of heart
A turnaround in art

A stage for soul and pure grace
The passion takes you deep into space
Free of hardened lines
Right into new designs

You raise the spirit of a major voice
The artist inside you
From an early age it grew 
Inspiration and improvisation, open mind
How much we dare to live
Is how much we can give

Learning, turning
Where are you now?

Who is free in mind
Never one-eyed blind
So open up and feel
And get out of the wheel
The rhythm and the timing
A neverending climbing
The whole and minor part
A change of heart
A turnaround in art

The one follows his inner voice
He doesn't come to the fore
He simply has no other choice
He's close to the core

He is an artist at first
To his creations he's bound
The mind full of thoughts gonna burst
It's his way he found

The other one just entertains
Addicted by trends and the crowd
The calls only let him unchain
It's making him proud

At first sight both ruling out
The balance, the bridge what it makes
Cannot reach the world without
That's what it takes
