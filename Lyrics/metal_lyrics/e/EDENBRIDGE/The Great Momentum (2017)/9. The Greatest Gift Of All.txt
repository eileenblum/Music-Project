My, my lotus land
A fool's paradise within me
A lode star on the heavy road ahead
Time and again I feel
With eyes agleam, the everturning 
Wheel

My, my strand of pearls
A mountain steam of ardour
Down the road it's unconfined in me
Wherever I roam and go
Whatever I may do
All I can ever dream of is you

When words will fade into the night
The sound of hope, the key of light
Will fill your heart eternally
Will always be a mystery
And the greatest gift of all

My dome in the sky
Larger than life inside me
A whirlwind romance feelings
Running high
The one of a thousand dreams
Off the beaten track I roam
The adoration always leads me home

When words will fade into the night
The sound of hope, the key of light
Will fill your heart eternally
Will always be a mystery
And the greatest gift of all

A note in midstream
A melody from a dream
A chord that will shatter the sky
The sound when they all ally
A Stygian change
An almost eternal range
The unison of a score divine
The sonic design

It came out of the blue
As a sun ray a dawn
On a picture I drew
Just before it was gone
The book and its pages
The saints and the wine
Heave crumbled in ages
Left out in their shrine

A note in midstream
A melody from a dream
A chord that will shatter the sky
The sound when they all ally

It's the dreamline to find
It's the valor within me
It's the unconscious mind
It is reality
It's the eye of the storm
Working by alchemy
When a brainchild is born
It is mystery

A Stygian change
An almost eternal range
The unison of a score a divine
The sonic design

[2x]
When words will fade into the night
The sound of hope, the key of light
Will fill your heart eternally
Will always be a mystery
And the greatest gift of all
