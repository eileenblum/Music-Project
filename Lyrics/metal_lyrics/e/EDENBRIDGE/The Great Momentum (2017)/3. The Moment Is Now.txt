From side to side
In the twists and turns
And uneven road,
The fear returns
Ran out of stream,
It's hard to come by

Holding your ends up,
To make ends meet
Do not get the needle,
Do not repeat
Shoot the works,
Let your feelings run high

By and by
It will clarify
yo you

It's never too late
So why do you wait
The moment is now for igniting the fire
Get into your stride
With eyes open wide
So win the day and hold on
The name of the game
Just drive it home, come hell or high water
No beast of a day
Won't lead you astray
The moment is now or never

To hitch your wagon to a star
Against the grain, go on this far
Though it might cost the earth to you

To bite the dust or come off streets ahead
A sigh of relief or a one so sad
Ways and means will open and renew

By and by
It will clarify
yo you

It's never too late
So why do you wait
The moment is now for igniting the fire
Get into your stride
With eyes open wide
So win the day and hold on
The name of the game
Just drive it home, come hell or high water
No beast of a day
Won't lead you astray
The moment is now or never

It's never too late
So why do you wait
The moment is now for igniting the fire
Get into your stride
With eyes open wide

It's never too late
So why do you wait
The moment is now for igniting the fire
Get into your stride
With eyes open wide
So win the day and hold on
The name of the game
Just drive it home, come hell or high water
No beast of a day
Won't lead you astray
The moment is now or never
