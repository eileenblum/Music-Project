What moves you inside?
Be wary with eyes open wide
The dark side is blurred
Your mind comes to word

What may your lips say?
When you want to rid the dismay
Clarity is a fact
Your word comes to act

Take the new day
Move doubt away
Chances are vast
The die is not cast

Are you all aware?
Whatever you do and you share
As peril appears in a coat
Your acts come to rote

Take the new day
Move doubt away
Chances are vast
The die is not cast

On your lifeline, mind all the rotes
It comes to character trait
Believe me it's all in your hands
Your nature's dictating your fate
