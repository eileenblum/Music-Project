Live, go by
Who defines the moment?
Where we go, whom we choose
How many souls
Fade before they came in?
Is life tragic to lose?

A sea of your kind
We can only feel your short time
As your being was so deep

Live, go by
Love is your consistence
We need to break a taboo
Speak it out clearly
(We) won't draw the curtain over
Release is all we can do

You're speaking in my dreams
Love is what it seems
Cause you prepared the salutary way
In my heart
You're only a whiff of life
The mourning is tying
Our souls are allying
I carry your name within

You're speaking in my dreams
Love is what it seems
Cause you prepared the salutary way
In my heart
You're only a whiff of life
The mourning is tying
Our souls are allying
I carry your name within

Live, go by
Who defines the moment?
When we come and we go
