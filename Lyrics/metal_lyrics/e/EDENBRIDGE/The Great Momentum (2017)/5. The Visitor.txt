Where are you?
Frozen in time
It makes my blood run cold
Long ago
And far away
It all got uncontrolled
Again I see you fading
Right into mortal clay
I'm eagerly awaiting
Your return one day

An angry sky
All came up dry
So tired and drawn
All lost and gone

Waiting for a lifetime in the tides
When the visitor arrives
Let me just hold on one moment
The time of life's too short to hide
Your light
Said the visitor at night

Just move on with your life let go
And come out from below

I seek for alchemy
To cross the boundary
I won't cast adrift

A heavy burden set in
When all got out of phase
It took away my passion
It took away the days

So ease my pain
Is all in vain
A second chance
Just one last glance

Waiting for a lifetime in the tides
When the visitor arrives
Let me just hold on one moment
The time of life's too short to hide
Your light
Said the visitor at night

Said the visitor in pale light

Take the early hour
Leave your ivory tower
Live your life for your own sake
A drop in the ocean
Restlessly in motion
Reality is what you make
I only need to know
You're fine before I go
You're never riding for a fall
Don't fight this losing battle
Take this life and saddle
I'm not the be and end of all
