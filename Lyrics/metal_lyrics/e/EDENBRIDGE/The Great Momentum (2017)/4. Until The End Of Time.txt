Long ago,
When I looked for a home
You came to me
And left me with a smile
Cause in my dreams,
I saw you before
You changed the way I feel
Within a while

Waiting for you,
Endless days go by
A life without you
Is just another lie
When you are here,
Forever you'll be mine
Music and me,
Until the end of time

You bring me on
A journey far away
The cosmic sound
And wave is taking me
Down the ages,
But maybe long before
It's leading me into infinity

Waiting for you,
Endless days go by
A life without you
Is just another lie
When you are here,
Forever you'll be mine
Music and me,
Until the end of time

You take me down
Right on the ground
Reality is fading
And I'll be aware of,
This vision is mine
Cause we're uniting
With the sound
The sadness and joy
Of the whole world
The spirit in my heart,
The music whill shine

Waiting for you,
Endless days go by
A life without you
Is just another lie
When you are here,
Forever you'll be mine
Music and me,
Until the end of time
