Have you lost all faith and dreams?

Did you give power
To someone forcing pride?
And are you hiding shadows
In yourself so deep inside?
Is someone tramping
Demoralizing you?
When you are feeling helpless
At the mercy out of blue
The disregard in you

Glory's a story
Life is too short to give void space 
A tree to the sky
So join in to tie
It is a return to grace

Do you know and feel your needs?

Honor is outside
Grace interior
It's up to you to recall
Rising up for evermore
Time to awaken
Humanity align
And it will take the boundaries
Only if esteem is mine
The dignity can shine

[2x]
Glory's a story
Life is too short to give void space 
A tree to the sky
So join in to tie
It is a return to grace
