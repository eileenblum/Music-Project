[intro-chorus]
see visionary eye
the deadend fire coming from the sky
flamboyant signs of imminent times

on mazarine seas the ship sails near to the wind
by sagging spirits the hopes were pinned
to rock in the ropes of sand

denying the peril, pride goes before a fall
picking its way to the port of call
apparent horizons to strand

[chorus]
see visionary eye
the deadend fire coming from the sky
flamboyant signs of imminent times
skyward i stare
in the streak of the lightning
into st. elmo`s fire
the deadend fire
into st. elmo`s fire

with mounting suspense, waiting for augury
visions are blending upon the sea
dimming and fading away

into the wind`s eye to terra incognita
the clouds are releasing a shining star
until the kiss-off the way

[chorus]

in the afterglow here in the peacock blue
the signs will all be inside you

[chorus]
