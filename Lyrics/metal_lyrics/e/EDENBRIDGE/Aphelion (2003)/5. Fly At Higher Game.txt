look out for the squalls right in here
and escape from the vanity fair
don`t dally away
and relieve your feelings there

whenever you see rocks ahead
appearing just under your eyes
find them all out
you`ll be staring in surprise

[pre-chorus]
so carry the world before one
(when the sky)
when the sky is the limit
(there`s no limit, no end)
and shape the course to new frontiers

[chorus]
i set my spirits free
the world is not enough for me
not for the glory of one day
extolling to the skies
so follow the fame
i wanna fly at higher game

sometimes your life is a galanty show
and sometimes a halo of light
when tilting at windmills
has robbed you of your sight

and without a shadow of doubt
it`s a balance, a high-wire act
a leap in the dark
what the artist may attract

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

[bridge]
fairway to infinity
this lucent inmost voice will call
you away, you away

[chorus]
