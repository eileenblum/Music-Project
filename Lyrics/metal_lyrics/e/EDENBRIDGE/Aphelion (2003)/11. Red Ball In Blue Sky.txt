[Feat. D.C. Cooper]

silence all over
the island lies asleep
the balance of your life
the beauty of the deep

this sapphire blue
this entrancing rendezvous
the art of seduction will take you away
what has happened before
was it all that you longing for more
an illusive devious path led astray

sleepwalker don`t fear the moon
daydreamer don`t wait till noon
the essence of life takes you further
than you might have known

[chorus]
rise high
a red ball in a blue sky
a blazing scent will come by
the fortune smiles on you
sun beams
the vantage point of your dreams
the salient spirits of youth
through the kissing gate of your soul
let all those blue skies in

the hyaline sea
is waking a bale-fire in me
as plain as a pike-staff becoming aware
by the tag-end of doubt
knowing no one can live without
we`re wielding the sceptre of life so prepare

rockbound your heart cannot feel
pounding the stones and reveal
the canyons and deserts
the indented coastlines at heart

[chorus]

silence all over
the island lies asleep
the balance of your life
the beauty of the deep

there your inward journey goes
the spellbound of the sunrise dawn
moves you from your faint-hearted sky
so come to ally
in key with lucent ocean waves
here by the wishes of our dreams
turn the blueprint to a quaint reality
and the jewel nature waits
in amenity of boundless cunning skies
believe your aphelions are near
the sunrise within
