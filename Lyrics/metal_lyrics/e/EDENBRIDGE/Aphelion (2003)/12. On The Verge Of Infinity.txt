[Bonus track, Japan]

time what is time, a remnant of hope
a line to oblivion where we`re on the rope
and your sun is set, a pale silhouette on the sly

the pride of the season`s turning
the providence is concerning
all of us then, the question of when in our minds

[pre-chorus]
lightly come and lighty go
from source to sea we flow
we can never pitch our hopes too high (and be)

[chorus]
on the verge of infinity
on the edge of this heavenborn starlight
feel the boundless serenity
in a pencil of light
farewell to the past and the future
into the galactic rainbow i ride
now and forever i`ll be in infinity

time what is time, a terrestrial lore
a rock in the surf we`ve been living for
a line in the sand, the future in hand by a dream

and when the whole world`s glided
through our hands misguided
an ordeal by fire, a dance on a wire without end

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

by far you will see, this immensity
make leeway endeavor for more
follow me there, this journey we share
we ride on a lavender dream

(infinity)
the rainbow of starlight will wait
(infinity)
ride on the passage where time has no meaning at all
(on the verge of infinity)
now and forever we`re leaving the future behind
for infinity
