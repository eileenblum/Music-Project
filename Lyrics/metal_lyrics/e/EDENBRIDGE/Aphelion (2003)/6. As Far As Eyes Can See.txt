boundless the traces
they stand out in relief
the sands running out by the eve
a trough of the sea in emotions
lies on the shores of your dreams

a poignant look of deep blue eyes
can tell a thousand tales
a silverscreen of broken words
you threw into the scales

[chorus]
i am the storm and lash the sea
that`s wrapping up in mystery
within living memory
in rain or shine
in playgrounds so divine
i am the pylon in the dark
the guardian of the arc
within a velvety reverie
as far as eyes can see

the vesper bell`s tolling
from the belfry up near
the ring of truth i try to hear
shooting a glance at the wild sea
land will be rising at view

to take the line of least resist
will slow and sure deceive
the deadlock of this waiting game
the feelings you relieve

[chorus]

losing all the narrow bounds in me
as far as eyes can see
