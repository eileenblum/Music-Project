from the valleys to the coastlines
from the riverheads to sea
to the fields of four-leaf clover
like a haggard falcon free

[chorus]
by a dovelike dream
riding on wings of ever
from the top supreme
where no one has gone before
on the glaring stream
into the haven of time
to the land of peace
where silence has lease

on the high-flown cliffs ascending
in the priming of the day
feel the ocean`s salient power
from the vantage point survey

[chorus]
by a dovelike dream
riding on wings of ever
from the top supreme
where no one has gone before
on the glaring stream
into the haven of time
to the land of peace
where silence has lease

dream, so dream, dream this dovelike dream
and be, where none has gone before
free, so free, free like a haggard falcon
release, where silence has lease
forever, now or never
right on the edge of forever i am
(forever), and ever
forever into the haven of time
(forever), forever
riding into the land of peace
where silence has lease
