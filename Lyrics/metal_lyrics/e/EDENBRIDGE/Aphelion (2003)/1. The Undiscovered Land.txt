by a long way we came there
and we kept our eyes peeled
we believed in our blueprint
drawn by the slipstream of time without end

not once we saw the falcon rising
not once we saw horizons clear
and again we hear the ocean rushing
with all the questions at hand without end

[chorus]
heavenward we keep on flying
in the lap of the gods where we are
the legend, the key
the solar sea
binds you forever
once in a blue moon this moment
on these boundless traces we move
the cosmic array
won`t lead us astray
and we still demand
the undiscovered land

we felt the narrow bounds within us
the lurking unknown in the dark
still we`re searching for the purple passage
pink of perfection in hearts still so pure

[chorus]

here and now
by our sacred vow
we will prevail

[chorus]
