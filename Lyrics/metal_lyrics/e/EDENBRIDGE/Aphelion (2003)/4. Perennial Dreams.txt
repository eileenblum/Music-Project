how could i ever see
this blueprint of reality
spoiling for a fight i left no stone unturned

for ever and one day
the gale force in my heart will stay
and i don`t care a straw about the lessons learned

[pre-chorus]
free i can hear this haunting melody
ever since the spirits rose in me

[chorus]
the shadows of darkness
or the light of the world
leaving those energetic streams
a soldier of fortune
or a fancier at all
keeping on for perennial dreams

will this tide ever turn
before my restless heart will burn
the elfstruck time elapses to the eventide

it is a game of skill
and it is playing with your will
the floatlight marks the harbour there it is my guide

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

[bridge]
the spangled heaven`s gleam
a neverending stream
will arise in my perennial dream

[chorus]
