the challenge to raise
made our hearts all ablaze
cleared our daring ideas moved our will

the prime mover in us all
will force us that we recall
believing in powers of dreams

[pre-chorus]
astral skies
follow your ardent eyes
and leave your earthborn presence
to your paradise

[chorus]
skyward i stare
and i am aware
your dreams will lead you to aphelion
loud as a whisper leaving infinity behind
the journey will start in your mind

the ghost of a chance
this alluring romance
the refulgance of light near at hand

weigh your memories in gold
and hidden powers will unfold
igniting the fire inside

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

[bridge]
skyward rising
so revel in brightest remembrance and see
skyward we go i can see
a fragrant surprise
a sight for sore eyes
hold on to your dreams and rise

skyward i stare...

[chorus]
