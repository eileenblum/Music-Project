an outcast of victorian society
a crying jag since long-gone childhood days
the dream to be an albatross
with alabaster wings
to be flying
before the last bell rings

the crushing arms of loneliness embracing still
the sear and yellow leaf is drawing near
this jaded heart escaping from the shadowplay
what is the measure of a man ?
and the price that we all pay

[chorus]
the final curtain falls
none of the orchestra will play
the stageplay life will hold
the freakshow at the fair
is there a straw in bursting dalles
will someone care ?

the looking glass, deceiver of reality
the try of make-believe in who we are
and the hiding in the mists of night will never end
but a graceful heart prevails
and the meaning of a friend

[chorus]

[bridge]
mesmerized, hypnotized
the audience touched to tears
pay a visit, take a look
so that the conscience clears

[chorus]
the final curtain falls
none of the orchestra will play
the stageplay life will hold
the freakshow at the fair
there is a straw in bursting dalles
someone will care
