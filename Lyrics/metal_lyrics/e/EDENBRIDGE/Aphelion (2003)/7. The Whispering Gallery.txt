[Bonus track, Europe]

and here i came last night
was it a waking dream in me ?
the spiral staircase led to places so unknown

and out of a clear sky falling
i`m searching high and low for hold
right on the brink of ruin

[chorus]
if i could hear your calls
reflected to the nines
revealing precious memories
the whispering gallery
the place of mystery
in echoes from a silent sea

and there the shadows danced
before i heard the clarion call
in their centennial desperation i won`t fall

shaken to their foundations
a mereghost of their former selves
well nigh they`ve gone to glory

[chorus]

there`s a sign in constant glory
will it be my guiding star
on the floatbridge to forever
i can go on so far
this alluring jack o` lantern
and the relics of the past
leading on to your decay
the pendulum swings so fast

[bridge]
on the gateway to your mind
on the flare path of your magnificient
prettifying dreams
it`s the touchstone of mankind
it`s the only truth to find

[chorus]
