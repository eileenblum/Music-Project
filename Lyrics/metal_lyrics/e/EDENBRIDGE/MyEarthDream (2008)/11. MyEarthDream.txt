[I. The Road Ahead]

We, to tell dead straight
We harbour an illusion
Estranged, all got out of hand
There's method in our madness
We crave for greenfield land

[Pre-Chorus:]
Plaintive cries
Our demise
Evil hour

No dim glow just pain
We're leaving behind a stain
We're casting stones in the glass house of our promised land
Neverland
(Never, Neverland)

[Chorus 1:]
Haunting beauty, second to none
Creator of life, under the sun

[Chorus 2:]
Myearthdream, oasis of light
(The) road ahead, powers unite
Myearthdream, oasis of prime
Karma cleansed, turn on a dime

What if, the twain shall meet again
As in days of old
Blind alley, an aimless walk
We bite the hands that feed us
But who cares when money talks

[Pre-Chorus]

When time is of the essence here
We learnt to live in abject fear
We take it for granted and claim the moral high ground
And compound

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

[II. Pristine]

[III. Agent of Change]

Our world restored to former glory
Writing a new story
Before the sands of time running out for us

[IV. The Uninvited Guest]

The green lung bleeds, this path misleads
We came and smiled, grinded the faces of the wild

What goes around will come around
We reap the bitter harvest here

And we threw all caution to the winds
(We're) covering a multitude of sins

Further afield, is our fate sealed?
Agent of change
Where are you, come to rearrange
Return to grace, a newborn place
It is never to late to mend

Fools rush in where angels dare to tread
Truth will out, see to where our hopeless way has lead

[V. The Last Card]

Can you tell me why?
We didn't hear the call
The bigger we are, the harder we fall

Smoke and mirrors rule
An irony of fate
We fight at every turn, destroy what we create

[Pre-Chorus:]
Plaintive cries
Our demise
Evil hour

Human, hopelessly
A long way to learn
Some little crumbs of sense, full steam astern

An enlightened age
Should create a force
To put the world to rights, let nature take its course

[Chorus:]
Myearthdream, oasis of light
The road ahead, powers unite
Myearthdream, oasis of prime
Karma cleansed, turn on a dime

The last card to play
Myearthdream, a world in shine
Back to the grand design

[VI. Slumbers]

It is five to noon, and I still wish for the moon
Our restless pace has slowed
We have come to the end of the road
At the crossroads where we are
Hello, this is our last card
Let the slumbers never end
Believe for a moment in time
No more grey and dreary deeds
Just a sliver of light
My earth dream
