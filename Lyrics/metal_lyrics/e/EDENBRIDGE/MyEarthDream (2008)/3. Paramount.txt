When voices trail away
Into silence gone
Impassioned I may stray

Boundless and pristine
The miracle unseen
The windows of the soul caught in between

[Pre-Chorus:]
Wonder
Home free I am
Come closer to my heartbeat
And kiss my tears away
Not once in a blue moon

[Chorus:]
Don't turn away
Beyond my dream
You're paramount to anything
You have the midas touch to save infinity
Come rain or shine
Forever mine
You're paramount in your design
A hope of stardust left in time

My passions running high
Going round the bend
Mirages mystify

One time we gave our vow
The time to keep is now
So say goodbye to "holier-than-thou"

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

One hope
One fate
One life
Await

[Chorus]

I live and I breathe you
So come to allure me by and by
I feel and I follow you
Cause you don't leave me highland dry
