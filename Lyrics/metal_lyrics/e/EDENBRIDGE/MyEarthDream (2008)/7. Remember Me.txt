Hey you
You were second to none
But time has stolen your crown

Can you
Remember panning for gold
(but) your star has waned into sundown

The writing's on the wall
You're by the way to fall
So take your final curtain call

[chorus:]
Until kingdom come remember me
Take me back into the sheen
A bag of dreams one final reverie
The seamy side of life unseen

See the meteor rise
Every step all of the way
You got a fire alight cause you're came to stay

You've got oceans of time
A meeting of minds at all
You wished for the moon, could not hear the call

You wither on the vine
All along the line
Elation from a far off time

Seek and you'll find
The answers behind
Will you remember me?

[chorus x2]
