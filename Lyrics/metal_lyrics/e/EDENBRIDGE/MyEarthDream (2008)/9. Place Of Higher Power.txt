The rain abates
A new dawn waits
Will I be back on dryland?
Unconfined
Our restless mind
It's a jungle out there

Those barren years
And vast frontiers
We are drifting worlds apart
The apron stage
A golden cage
But beauty's only skin deep

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
It's just a world of make believe
But what a tangled web we weave
We dream on consecrated ground
(We're spellbound)

[Chorus 1:]
Framed into this world
All along the line
Take me outside space and time
Working like a charm
Burning down the harm
In a place of higher power

I hear the bell
Tolls the knell
Can we cross a boundary
Shining streams
Recurring dreams
Take me out of this world

I'm tired and drawn
Goes on and on
Inquire into mine own heart
The inner twist
Can I resist
In a lucid moment

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
I'm chasing horses in midstream
I follow my recurring dream
And leave the nadir, meet my fate
(Can you await)

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
Ardour and despair
On a wing and prayer
A panacea in my veins
Lode star on my sky
Shine and purify
In a place of higher power

[Pre-Chorus 1]
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
