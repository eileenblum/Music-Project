What if I was born to love
Is hate another part of
Like a sin in flesh and blood I feel

When Adam's built to love his god
Then why can't I be with you
Blood and electricity what's real, oh what's real

Where are you now?
Caught in a memory that lives on and on
We set the world on fire

[Chorus:]
Fallen from grace
Where am I, forlorn in this cold place
Come away o human child
Hope springs eternal inside

The best laid schemes of mice and men
A closely guarded secret
Dreams to find are lost beyond recall
(Lost beyond recall)

But I won't bid my hopes farewell
Am I just a lotus eater?
(To cross) the great divide to find it all, find it all

Kiss me goodnight
Give me a new lease on life
Lay my fears to rest
A new dawn is here

[Chorus]

Ah ah uh uh uh uh
By the light of the moon
Time is fading away
Your life's mortal clay
Oh where am I now?

[Chorus]
