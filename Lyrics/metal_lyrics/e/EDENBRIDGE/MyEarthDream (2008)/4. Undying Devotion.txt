The darkest hour's just before the dawn
The bottom dropped out of my world
My mind's reeling caught in no man's land
Break this deadlock for the life of me right to the end

[Pre-Chorus:]
Wake me, take me
Come ease my pain
Take a stroll down memory lane
Hope for those who remain

[Chorus:]
Undying where we dare
A diamond solitaire
Be and end of all
It is the clarion call
Devoting all
So carry the day

Consumed by passion, words cannot convey
And I'll be waiting in the wings
There is more to this than meets the eye
I live and breathe to brave the storm and kiss the night goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[2nd Chorus:]
Jewel in the crown
Can't keep a good man down
The force chasing the game
Us restless that we became
A winding lane
For those who break new ground

[Chorus:]
Undying where we dare
A diamond solitaire (solitaire)
Be and end of all (end of all)
It is the clarion call
Devoting all
So carry the day
Jewel in the crown
Can't keep a good man down (good man down)
The force chasing the game (chase the game)
Us restless that we became
A winding lane
For those who break new ground
Undying where we dare (undying where we dare)
A diamond solitaire (a diamond solitaire)
Be and end of all (be and end of all)
It is the clarion call (clarion call)
Undying devotion
