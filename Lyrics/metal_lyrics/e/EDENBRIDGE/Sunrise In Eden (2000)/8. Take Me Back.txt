Seems I was sleeping for one thousand years
The wheel of time has turned into the age of tears
How long I am in there I cannot tell for sure
But the flower starts to fade she has to endure

[Chorus]
Take me back from beyond the horizon
For a little while
Let me feel the idea of a sun dance
I will hold my head up high
Just before leaving
Like a raindrop in the sun
Could I believe that I am one

Was it a wonder or a present from above
How should know if I will ever laugh
But time is unyielding it's never standing still
To control the forces that are breaking down my will

[Chorus]

[End Chorus]
Take me back from beyond the horizon
For a little while
Let me feel the idea of a sun dance
I will hold my head up high
Just before leaving
Like a raindrop in the sun
Could I believe that I am
Could I believe that I am gone
