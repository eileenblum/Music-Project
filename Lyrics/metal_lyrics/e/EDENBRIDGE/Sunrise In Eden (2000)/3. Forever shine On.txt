In my darkest hour I pray
For a life seemed gone astray
See a flower grow

In a never ending night
Far away a colored light
I can see a rainbow rise

[Chorus]
I could believe
In the love I found so long
You're the air that I breathe
Let us dream a dream
Forever shine on
In the heaven of delight
Where love will shine a light
Let your beauty flow
Forever shine on

In the distance I behold
Existing seems so cold
I hear an angel sing

In the evening glow I seek
For a glimmering mountain's peak
Imagining I was free

[Chorus]

Like a candle in the wind
We are fragile and we suffer
From within our deepest hearts
Let the wind breeze through your hair
And let your spirit fly
Forever shine on

[Chorus]
