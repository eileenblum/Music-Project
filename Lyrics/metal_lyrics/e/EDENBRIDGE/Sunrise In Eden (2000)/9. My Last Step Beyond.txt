The edge of the abyss where the journeys end
Visible crossroads where mortal lives will bend
The moment of truth, the calm before the storm
The camouflage of liars abruptly will be torn

At the end of the tunnel I'm awaiting the truth
Through the misty twilight perhaps eternal youth
Do I feel the pale void, do I feel the seventh sky?
When life runs like a movie as the time goes by

[Chorus]
Do I fly, do I cry, do I see the light?
In blinding colors does it shine so bright
Can I flee, can I see, can I be something new?
When the clock strikes the hour I'm transcending into

Heading for a new land beyond the fading sun
Thoughts dwell in my mind the journey has begun
The vision it seems so clear but does it pretend?
Travelling souls in riot, the beginning or the end?

The howling of the sirens I don't hear 'em no more
Walls of fears been torn if we knew why thunders roar
Dancing the dance at the carnival of dreams
The aim of restless travellers is where the beacon beams

[Chorus]

And here I am walking in silence, making my steps beyond
Beyond the afterglow in a constant flow of light
The rainbow seems so near, finally I am here

The guardian angels they're calling my name
An astral dream in the sky?
They're dancing at the carnival of souls
They dance into the light into eternal light
I'm singing the tune in unison with angels
In the key of lordian harmony
The journey has an end
I'm waiting in command
Never to contend ... in the end
