Clouds passing by
On top of the mountains one touch in the sky
One touch in the sky

One reason to linger
Holding the stars right in my hand
Lifting shadows of the past

Crystal silhouettes
Longing for me
Their eyes full of regrets

I am waiting for an answer
I am waiting for a sign
Conquering the corridors to free
Myself from space and time

[Chorus]
Ride on ride on
Ride on the wings of the wind
Ride into the sunset
Ride on the wings of the wind
On the wings to carry on
Ride on the wings of the wind

The future is worth to believe in
The key that may unlock the chain
Silhouettes dissolve in the twilight
Embracing the ones who remain
The image of an endless horizon
Enchanting it's before my eyes
The glorious ride shall have no end
Hold on forever more

[Chorus]
