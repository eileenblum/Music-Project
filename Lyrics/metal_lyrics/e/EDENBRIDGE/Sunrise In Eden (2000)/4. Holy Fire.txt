I remember a past life, a life long ago
Memories are reveries
And visions fading into grey

I behold the paleness with the glimpse of an eye
There's no friend in no man's land
Streets leading to wild frontiers

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the torchlight shine above you
Scan a flashlight of a dream
Take the spell and hold the spirit of the flame
And rise up with the light

[Chorus]
Holy fire glimmering eve
Follow traces until you believe
Light a candle for the magical ring
And wait until the night's breaking in

Am I walking the false path the one of no return
Counting strides the mind divides
The ever-turning wheel of time

Then I'm crossing the border beyond the no man's land
Lizard eyes and painted skies
The turning point right on my way

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
