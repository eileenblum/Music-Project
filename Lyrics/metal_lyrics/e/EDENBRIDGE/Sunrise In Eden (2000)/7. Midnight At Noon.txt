The sun has set beyond the western sky
And with the coming night I hear 'em cry

From the fear they were overrun
From the hurricane they were spun
The candle has lost its flame
'cause they play the final game

Out from the dust they danced apart from all
All warnings overheard until they call

The storm has turned the tides
All is changing from left to right
The gloom it came over them
Again and again

[Chorus]
As we stand here in vain we're awaiting soon
The falling twilight of midnight at noon
There's no sun to see there's only one moon
'cause it's midnight at noon

The sun has set beyond the western sky
And with the coming night I hear 'em cry

From the fear they were overrun
From the hurricane they were spun
The candle has lost its flame
'cause they play the final game

[Chorus]
