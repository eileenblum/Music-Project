Fraying, straying
decaying, the worldÂ´s at sea
are we resigned to our fate ?
Lying, denying
weÂ´re walking aimlessly
trying, slying
saving face no longer

[Chorus]
the world is waiting for
a change within our hearts
the last card for us all, a new era starts
so hit the road out there
alight a new tomorrow
recall a far off time
step out here and follow

why, wherefore
hell-bent we should leave
we think weÂ´ve got oceans of time
(Bridges burn)
a decisive turn
it will be waiting to happen
a heavy load, this dusty road
canÂ´t lead us too much longer

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
the world canÂ´t wait
a change within our hearts
itÂ´s for us all
alight a new tomorrow
