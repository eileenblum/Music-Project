I cry in anger
i cry in pain
i lose my bearings
canÂ´t break the chain

once i heard that wonders never cease
let me get my second wind please
do i have to burn my boats behind ?
Do i have to break the ice in mind ?

[Pre-chorus]
just let me see the daylight now
and find the ways and means to carry on somehow

[Chorus]
no smoke without fire
no love without pain
only the memories remain
it tears at my heartstrings
a past reverie
the shadows of my memory

i eat my heart out
day out, day in
go rack to ruin
cause iÂ´m all in

did i burn the candles at both ends ?
Cannot tell when all got out of hand
all i feel is trapped in daily round
how can i get out here safe and sound

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

now, i see daylight now
in this evil hour
iÂ´m weathering the storm
when my ship comes home

for a fleeting moment in a dream
i am changing horses in midstream
heaven only knows
where the journey...goes
