[The one]
here, here you stand
all seems to be in the air
for no reason at all ?
Facing the world in despair
if you could only come to know
this hope, the infinite now
the dream to arrive
floating in seas of doubt

iÂ´m beyond belief
the one, you will recall
iÂ´m the timeless now
the reason of it all

itÂ´s how the waves can change their form
but the ocean stays the same
a different wave born in a storm
the same water to tame

[the disbeliefer]
[Pre-chorus]
how can i feel you ?
When itÂ´s all all beyond belief
why canÂ´t i see you ?
Is your being to deceive ?
How can i touch you ?
As itÂ´s my philosophy
when i canÂ´t hear you
itÂ´s beyond theology

[both]
[Chorus]
i am unborn and immortal
i am the light in the dark
eternal formless power
the guardian of the arc

[the one]
i am the boundless now
the well that canÂ´t run dry
infinity in deep
thereÂ´s no beginning no goodbye

itÂ´s the void of shaping anything
existence has begun
ringÂ´s not gold and goldÂ´s not ring
but the golden ring is one

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[both]
humans and flowers
stones, water, trees
feelings, intensions and our dreams
mountains and planets and even the sun
i stay untouched, i am one

[the one]
the world we know may drown
in death it wonÂ´t go down
the outer form will die
the journey to ally
itÂ´s timeless what we are
the children of the brightest star
an if you arrive, you know
it was forever there
the last step to be aware
the secret we all share

ainÂ´t arising when weÂ´re born
doesnÂ´t vanish when we mourn
itÂ´s not venus, itÂ´s not mars
and itÂ´s not a thousand stars
beyond the realms of time
it ainÂ´t evil , it ainÂ´t fine
itÂ´s the void thatÂ´s taking form
an endless journey back
the witness beyond every act
the light that tears the black

you will know it was the same
long before birth gave you name
before your elders could engage
before an endless age
decline is not decline
itÂ´s progress to a new design
a new beginning, another shine
this world may drown in tears
without hope, within our fears
then we are aware
the bonding is there
the timeless now
