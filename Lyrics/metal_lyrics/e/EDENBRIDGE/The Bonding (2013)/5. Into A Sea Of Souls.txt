Cold, dark
silence at night
feel, seclusion
in the absence of light

bygone, so hopeless
in this solitary shell
seamless, painless
too late to bid you farewell

[Chorus]
there comes a light
a cone of rays
and when the last bell tolls
homeward bound am i
leave an angry sky
into a sea of souls

out of the mortal remains
so strange, so bizarre
all just illusion ?
Watching me from afar

my perception
crossing the great divide
life hereafter
to the other side

[Chorus]
i see a light
a cone of rays
and when the last bell tolls
homeward bound am i
leave an angry sky
into a sea of souls
they wait for me
as i arrive
and when the last bell tolls
i leave the world terrine
on to fields divine
into the sea of souls

now itÂ´s done, i am there
time is out of joint now, i am here
to understand all is to forgive all
this eternal sea of light
