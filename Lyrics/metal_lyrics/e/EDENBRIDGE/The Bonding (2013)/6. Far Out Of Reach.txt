ItÂ´s the waterfall falling
itÂ´s the cross on the hill
itÂ´s the fork on the crossroads
itÂ´s the freedom i feel
and itÂ´s tearing my heart
if i must leave again
itÂ´s the beauty of nature unseen
it is endlessly green
i feel a little bit closer

itÂ´s the air that iÂ´m breathing
itÂ´s the spirit of life
and the snowfields iÂ´m crossing
itÂ´s the power alive
itÂ´s the tinge of the forest
the moss under feet
itÂ´s the rocks that iÂ´m climbing
the pounding heartbeat
and if the sky is the limit
i would walk on and on
the power within me
the miles i have gone

[Chorus]
feel me
you are so far out of reach
where my heart flies free and i feel
the power, the spirit to heal
from that day forth
i am entranced by you
you are so far, far away i feel you

i have seen their faces
i have seen in their eyes
all celestial places
where dream and day allies
the sky clear as if itÂ´s drawn
bespangled in the rain
the mystic haze of next dawn
the sound of birds refrain
the present of contentment
out of plainness here
the knowledge time is just lent
a minute, hour and year
the fragile being of mankind
immensity high-flown
humility should fill our mind
donÂ´t let our hearts turn to stone

come and
[Chorus]
