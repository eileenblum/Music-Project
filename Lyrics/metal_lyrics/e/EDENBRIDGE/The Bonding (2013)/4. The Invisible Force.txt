A lurid silence
inside me
reliantly iÂ´m waiting
the affinity
the sweetest destiny
the worlds i am creating

a straw in times disheartening
an insolation clear and pure
the legacy within me
a light to fall on hard times
my ministering angel leads
me all out of the mystery

[Chorus]
stay within
youÂ´re the energy, an unfailing source
guided by worlds unseen
(welcome)
the invisible force

bound to give a new lease
on life, the great endeavor, my
road starts deep within me
a field of vision open
an everlasting sunset glow
is tearing down the boundary

the flows shall have no ending
a perfect remedy
every cell electrified in me
the reason of existence
essential key of mine
a neverending road within the shine
so shine

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
