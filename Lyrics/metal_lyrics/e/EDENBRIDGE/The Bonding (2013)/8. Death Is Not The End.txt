Going round in circles
another dreary day
any crumb of hope could save
an animal at bay

the prime of life has gone by
caught in no manÂ´s land
no rosy dawn can light my day
neither family, nor friend

and in a lucid moment
it was all so very clear
the time is right
to overcome the fear

[Chorus]
taking a stroll down on memory lane
one moment, one lifetime, weÂ´ll meet again
cause i still believe, death is not the end
(itÂ´s) all mortal clay, but my soul transcends

the gloomy thoughts have come back
i couldnÂ´t find my way
what could have been, could i have seen
why led it astray ?

One day i was hoping
to set the world on fire
and looking back now in the end
left is the desire

but please enshrine the memory
and build a place for me
iÂ´ll be there
always lean on me

[Chorus]

for the life of me, iÂ´ve gone my merry way
not lost beyond recall
time will pass and ease your pain
and all the good things will remain
donÂ´t cry, i have come to rest
iÂ´m safe back home

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
