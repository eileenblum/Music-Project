IN THIS ILLUSIVE GAME
LATENT WORLDS ARE WAITING JUST FOR YOU
SO WON`T YOU JOIN ?
DON`T PONDER OVER THINGS THAT MIGHT BE NEW

IT`S STRONGER THAN A VIVID DREAM
IT IS THE VENTURE YOU ESTEEM
THE ART OF MAKE-BELIEVE
WHEN HOLDING LIFE IN YOUR OWN HAND
AND THERE IS NO WAY TO WITHSTAND
UNRAVEL WHAT DECEIVES

[CHORUS]
SO WHERE ARE YOU NOW ?
WHEN THERE AIN`T NO KEY
TO DOORS SO UNKNOWN IN THIS REALITY
YOUR AIM OUT OF SIGHT
WHAT`S WRONG AND WHAT`S RIGHT
IS THIS NEVER-ENDING ?
(WAY OUT)
WAY OUT OF, WE MOVE ALONG HOME
(WAY OUT)
WAY OUT OF, WE MOVE ALONG HOME

IT`S DO OR DIE
DOES SOMEONE PLAY WITH LOADED DICE IN HERE ?
ONE WITHERING GLANCE
CAN LURE INTO THE TRAP THAT`S LURKING NEAR

BEWARE OF GETTING TRIPPED UP BLIND
AND STRANGE ENCOUNTERS OF THIRD KIND
A GALANTY SHOW
IT WAS A CLOSE SHAVE OVERALL
SO MAKE A GRACEFUL EXIT`S FALL
BACK TO REALITY

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]
