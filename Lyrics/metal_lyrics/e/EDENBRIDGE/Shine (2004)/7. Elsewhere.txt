A GLASSY HEART IS CRYING
AND FOR ALL THE DREAMS DENYING
NEVER SMILES
ALWAYS ON THE MOVE

BY THE YEARS IT`S RAKED WITH FIRE
AND THE HEYDAY OF DESIRE`S
FAR TO REACH
DOWN AND OUT IT LIES

THE INNER FALLOW LAND
IN A TIGHT SPOT I DEMAND
THE YOUNG BLISS OF ETERNAL DAWN

AND WHEN ALL THE SKIES WOULD FALL
AND A SINGLE CHANCE IS SMALL
I`LL STILL TOE THE LINE

MY HEART IS LIKE AN OCEAN
WHEN THE RAIN IS LASHING DOWN
AND IF ALL FAILS AND THE WAVES ARE RISING FROWN

MY SOUL CAUGHT IN A WHIRLWIND
LIKE THE EMBERS IN THE FIRE
IF NOT ELSEWHERE, THEN WHERE IS THE DESIRE

IF NOT ELSEWHERE, WHERE IS THE DESIRE
