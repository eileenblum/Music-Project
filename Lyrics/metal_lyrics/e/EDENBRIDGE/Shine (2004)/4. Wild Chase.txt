THE DEW-DROP OF DAWN
ARE GLARING IN MORNINGLY LIGHT
THE SILVER CLOUDS GONE
THE INDIAN SUMMER SO BRIGHT

I HEAR THE PIPER SO NIGH
THE WESTERLY WIND BRINGS HIS TONE
THE TREE-TOPS SO FAR IN THE SKY
I FOLLOW THOSE TRACES UNKNOWN

[CHORUS]
AND OVER THE VALLEYS I RIDE
THE WILD CHASE A-GLOW
CAUSE MY RESTLESS HEART`S IN A CONSTANT FLOW
THE BLISS OF THE MOMENT IN ME
IT IS LIKE AMBROSIA
A DOVE-LIKE TEMPTATION FOR ME
THE WILD CHASE IS MY ENDLESS SYMPHONY

I`M GATHERING FORCE EVERYTIME
WHEN SYLVAN DEITIES SMILE
TIME SEEMS TO BE OUT OF JOINT SUDDENLY
AND I WANT TO ROAM FOR A WHILE

WILD CHASE, THIS TRACE
IT`S CALLING ME
YOUR GRACE, EMBRACE
A RAVING BEAUTY
[REPEAT]

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]
