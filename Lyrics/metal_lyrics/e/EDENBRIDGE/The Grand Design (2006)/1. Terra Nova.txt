Welcome home, welcome life
So unknown, when you arrive
The fire, so cut the wire
Your eyes, your small eyes
Your eyes, your hopeful eyes
Welcome life, welcome home
Welcome to a world that's so unknown
Dust and dreams, fall or shine
Welcome to the world
The grand design

And here you are, and here you stay
Into the light to your entree
Innocent child, so pure to the core
It is a long way to explore

[Pre-chorus]
Go on, never believe it's done
It is a journey unknown
It is life that only has begun

[Chorus]
Terra nova, nova era rise - blazing a trail
Terra nova, nova era rise - one in a mankind's dream
Terra nova, nova era rise - rising to fame
Terra nova, nova era rise
Why not blazing a trail and change
A new world is waiting a new world is here

The spirits of youth, when you're in your prime
Nothing can tire out, you never mark time
The shifting of scenes, the cushy life's gone
Reversing the roles, the game is on

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Cosmogony, a world to rise

Cosmogony, a world to rise
It's the legacy of the wise
Just one providence marks the line
Cosmogony, a world divine

One, one small hope
Is lucently lurking in all
A leap in the dark
The final incarnation's call
The hard lot of earth
Will have turned to rebirth
When a love of a man
Takes on the venture, you can

Welcome home, welcome life
So unknown, when you arrive
[Repeat]
