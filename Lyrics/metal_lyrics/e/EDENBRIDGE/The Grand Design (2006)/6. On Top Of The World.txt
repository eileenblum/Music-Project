I was prowling in the dark
It was a game of chance I played
Thought I had the vital spark
Tired out I was in this cascade

When truth began to dawn on me
Backing the wrong horse one decade
On floating ice so endlessly
A tug-of-war in this grand charade

See how the land lies
Welcome the sunrise
Farewell to the disguise
Mark my words and never say die

[Chorus]
On top of the world
On the edge of sheer heaven
Believe in this red-letter-day
Life comes to light
By no means it ain't over
The flowering time has begun
(You'll be there)
You'll be on top of the world

Nothing venture, nothing have
Clearing the figments of the mind
Never walking this way half
Beating the air and one eyed blind

Redress the balance
Come take this mere chance
Fall into this romance
The scale will fall from your eyes

[Chorus]

Wild horses won't drag me back on the track
Cause I've got the hang of it now
A flash in the pain
As sound as a bell
The odds are in my favour now

[Chorus]

[B-chorus]
Top of the world uh-uh-uh-uh
Heaven is here sheer heaven is here
Why not believe so will you believe
This glory day we're on top
Top of the world so we are on top
Heaven is here so heaven is here
Why not believe and when life comes to light
You'll be there you'll be on top of the world
Top of the world
