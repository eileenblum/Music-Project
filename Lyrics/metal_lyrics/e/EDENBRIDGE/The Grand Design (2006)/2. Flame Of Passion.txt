How could it happen, that I was wrong?
Speaking those words, a malicious tongue
It chokes me, I'm scared and I can't breathe

Another day's passed, to crown it all
A trial of patience before the fall
It never rains but it pours

[Pre-chorus]
Waiting for this one dawn
The grand entrance of light
It's paving the way to catch your sight

[Chorus]
Flame of passion burn in me
Thrill me heart so endlessly
When all your fondest dreams won't do at all
Play your court card all so well
Fly a kite and seek the one spell
One flame of passion, hear the call

Faith is bliss and bliss not rare
A fleeting smile is what we all can share
So put a spoke in the wheels of fate

The hub of the world is where you can be
The one missing page in your diary
Why don't you read between the lines?

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Flame, it's the flame of a passion
Tame, endeavour for more
Years gone by
Skies will dye
Seamless the colours ally

Flame of passion

[Chorus]
