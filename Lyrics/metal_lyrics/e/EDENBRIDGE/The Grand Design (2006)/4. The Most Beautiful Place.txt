There the journey will end
The place where my soul can strand
You are what I call Cockaign
And you take away all my pain
The place where all dreams ally
Gimme wings and I fly

[Chorus]
You're always inside
Wherever I roam
In my heart
This place I call home
You're the shine, you're the brace
You are a beautiful place
You're with me wherever I go

A world where all's in decay
The dream when I'm miles away
Entrancing you're under my eyes
The floatlight that lightens my skies
Homeward bound I will return
I can feel my heart burn

[Chorus]
