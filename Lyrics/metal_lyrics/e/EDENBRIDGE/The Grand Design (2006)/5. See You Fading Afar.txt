A touch of hope
A tinge of green
I could take an oath on

A whiff of the unknown
A bloom to bear
I'm on the verge so slow and sure

Daydream full of memories
No blessing in disguise
A thundery front appears to my surprise
The halcyon days are near to make their rise

[Chorus]
A-light with a dream
Is where we begin
So boundless and flowing
It's lustrous as a star
The force of what we are
See you fading afar

The mystery-monger
Shall be unhorsed
Won't get out from under

Need a knight's move
The score is drawn
But I will keep an eye on

Time is out of joint now
Devouring each and all
The lonely wind has turned into a squall
A solitary force to cover all

[Chorus]

Free me
Let me gain ground
Lull me to sleep safe and sound
Won't you hold on
Just make a start
Even when we're worlds apart

[Chorus x2]
