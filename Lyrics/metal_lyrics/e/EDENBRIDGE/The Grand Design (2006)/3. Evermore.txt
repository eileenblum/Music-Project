Earthborn child
Take me to places beguiled
You feast my eye on
So high-flown
And heavenly styled

[Pre-chorus]
In all your splendour
You're the force
My vein of gold

[Chorus]
Stay
Make my heart sway
And light my way
Flow on the drain of life
Try
And you'll espy
The one thereby
A kiss of eternity
Evermore

Stream my mind
Leaving the daydreams behind
Those pearly waters
A halo
A light for the blind

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

[Spoken]
"The one that stays, one that sways
I espy, a moonlit sky"

[Chorus' 1st part]

[Chorus]
