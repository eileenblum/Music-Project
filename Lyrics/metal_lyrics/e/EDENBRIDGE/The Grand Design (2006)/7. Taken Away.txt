The eye ranged the room
When I met my doom
And the sands have run out

The sky is overcast
And my thoughts have ranged the past
The sunset glow so crimson

And when all is on the slope
The parting hour of hope
And a cone of rays awaits

[Chorus]
Whenever we mourn at the bed
And pray for the soul of the dead
Was there all said and done
Under this pale sun
The end of the matter's a tear
A crushing blow so full of fear
The darkest hour of day
When you are gone and taken away

Ivy-clad the bed
Some dark clouds overhead
I am at a loss of words

The river draws to a close
From source to sea it goes
The eleventh hour's near

[Chorus]
Whenever we mourn at the bed
And pray for the soul of the dead
Was there all said and done
Under this pale sun
The end of the matter's a tear
A crushing blow so full of fear
The darkest hour of day
When you are finally gone and taken away
