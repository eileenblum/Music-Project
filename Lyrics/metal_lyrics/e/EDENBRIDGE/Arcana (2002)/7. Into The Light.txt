when the lake of despair is so serene
when the tempest in your heart's breaking in
still there is no horizon here
through troubled waters I swim
the saving sheet-anchor will appear
before I'm drowning in rapids near

[chorus]
so what if the darkness rules your mind
just follow into the light
and what if your whole world stays behind
it's robbing you of your sight
I'll find my way back to the light
in the mirror the shades of the pictures fade
look behind the charading games they played
take those chains here away from me
don't pour some oil into the fire
shake off the past and you will agree
will-o'-the wisps they will be never leading me

[chorus]
don't dream of life just live your dream
and use the power of believing
I am eternal, into the light I ride
into the cosmic force beyond the other side
I am a traveler in time
And I will find my way back into
my way back into the light
right into the light I ride
way back into the light
