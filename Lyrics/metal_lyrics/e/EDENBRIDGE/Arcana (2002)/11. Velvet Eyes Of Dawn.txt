[bonus track]

deep within my heart
I've been searching my way through
as the river is spreading the hue
from green to blue

carry on the flame
try to rule the lion's den
storm the fortress of standstill again
and again

the powers that be
shall try to break free
don't ever try them to deny
they all could have wings
and then become kings
holding the one the emerald eye

[chorus:]
velvet eyes of dawn I see
the miracle within
velvet eyes of dawn in me
outside looking in
the times are gone
while the clock ticks on and on
by the years we're holding on
for the velvet eyes of dawn

color the pale sky
try to find the holy grail
and the guardians of time will stand by
and praise your tale

the time to begin
the battle to win
before the night obscures the sky
the shadows of eve
will come to deceive
before the well of life runs dry

one growing blossoms' smile
in moonlight for a while
announcing one new spring
dreaming to be king
come joining the parade
turn down your masquerade
free as a bird of prey
sail your ships off the bay

[chorus]
