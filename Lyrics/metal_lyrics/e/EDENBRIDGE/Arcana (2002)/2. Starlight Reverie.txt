facing the constellations high above the sky
if I could fly along and sway the milky way
when Venus has its row, great bear and polar star
I see them dimming from afar, it's so bizarre

[pre-chorus]
starry sky
so come by
forgotten traces so nigh
your beauty repeals the laws of time

[chorus]
my starlight reverie
in my sparkling eyes
just take me through the grand bright moonlight night
your eyes can only see
what your heart truly feels
then it is time to turn and flee
into my starlight reverie
see tails of comets glowing in the outer sphere
red giants in their spectral light, tonight
the solar system of Orion there appears
lightyears away from mother earth, a star's birth

[pre-chorus]
[chorus]
[bridge]
