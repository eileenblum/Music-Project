here where the dream of Eden waits
the rivers running easy
in their valleys they are slumbering
there the mysteries reveal
by the clearness I can feel
and an island in the stream appears before my eyes
I am hunting lonesome traces in the sand
and someone speaks my name from far away
the ruins of yesterday will disappear
I will reach for the sources of light
as we are all finding our new hemisphere
I am turning just yearning to feel
feel your dreams, don't toss them away

[chorus]
ancient myth arcana, Elysian seas of time
the stones of wisdom shine again, the moonlight hides the rhyme
in long gone days of yore, one thousand years before
the odyssey was in our dreams, arcana we explore
here I can feel the inner flame
could forget what we became
and the false mirages can't deceive, deceive me no more
I am facing countless shadows in despair
but I won't follow them into the gloomy calm aside of light

[chorus]
thorns of roses that I feel, secrecy under the seal
hear the tolling of the bell, bring me under your spell
see the mysteries in twilight they're turning away
from darkness to light (into infinity)
here where the dreams of Eden's near
leaving to a distant sphere
to Elysian seas of time we ride
I am longing for infinity
arcana, arcana
tonight this journey seals my fate
far beyond the open gate
to the secret places never seen before
for this final odyssey into
arcana, arcana
