I believe in the secret path that's hiding from
our eyes, the night-time skies
are weaving a web of haze
golden shores are so far away from silver dreams
arcades cast platinum shades
way back to the early days

[pre-chorus]
here
the stardust angel spreads his wings
and rides the winds of time
touched by the moonlight's sonant symphony
[chorus]
color my sky
forsaken am I
from out of the shadows
there's a light to rely
unbroken wings
the rising of kings
to a new age we're waiting
for the dawning of springs
I believe in calling spirits of the trees
per chance, we're staying in trance
we summon the coming age
listening to the tunes of whales and dolphins here
our seas, mistreated and squeezed
will turn into furious rage

[pre-chorus]
[chorus]
color my sky
forsaken am I
from out of the shadows
there's a light to rely

[chorus]
