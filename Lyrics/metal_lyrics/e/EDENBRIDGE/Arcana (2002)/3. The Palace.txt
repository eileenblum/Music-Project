a place of power's rising
a place so deep within
in that stormy night when I came in
the fence that penned me in
in times when my heart tried to flee
from the serpent camouflage's melody

[pre-chorus]
the corridors I'm walkingthe walls point waits at me
the pictures in their ancient frames
have eyes but will not see

[chorus]
one silent scream
came straight into my dream I still here in these
unwritten pages of stories
the spoken word
is often quite unheard
in this old gallery
of splendid unbroken memory
I can hear
the palace in your heart will grow
uncovered the rivers will flow
plastic balls of forlorn memories
rolling on and on
for one more wish you're yearning and they're gone
the valleys of your soul
they still can let the light shine in
the symmetry of your heart grows within

[pre-chorus]
the mourning hours are history
in my enchanted land
the belfry dies away down here
the road shall have no end

[chorus]
for years I've tried to feel
for years I've turned the wheel
for all that's said and done it is so clear
the crystal moments shine above eternal nights of fearing here

[chorus]
