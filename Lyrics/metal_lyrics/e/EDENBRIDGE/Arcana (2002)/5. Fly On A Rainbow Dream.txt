[intro-chorus]
fly, forever fly along
let your wings just breathe the air tonight
to foreign skies fly on a rainbow dream
she's straying from reality
her imagination leaves her mind
like a falcon she is passing her old home
she's calling the spirits up there
she's freeing herself from clandestine eyes
awaiting brightened skies

[pre-chorus]
I will bring this dream to you believe
I will lead you everywhere

[chorus]
fly, fly on a rainbow dream
just glide into the gleaming sky
eternally away from staring eyes
fly, forever fly along
let your wings just breathe the air tonight
to foreign skies fly on a rainbow dream
she enters horizons unseen
away from the whispers of the night
in a reverie she's heading on and on
she's passing Elysian fields
ascending on wings of a glorious ride
she feels the falcon's pride

[pre-chorus]
[chorus]

is it stardust of time
in these pictures of infinity?
all the memories appearing one by one
are reflections in me

[b-chorus]
fly, fly, flyspread your wings and touch the sky(high), high, high
one more time I face the falcon eye to eye
before the rainbow's fading
then gold is at the end
right on your dream through time
forevermore, fly on a rainbow dream
