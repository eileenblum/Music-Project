farewell
yesterday when we were young
like a flower in the desert sand
so transient the cycle of life

[chorus]
within a moment of time
within a while of a years' decline
the brightest of stars above
in night-time skies divine
here
it is an everflowing stream
when they are coming to redeem
us from the night
that never sees the day

[chorus]
within a moment of time
within a while of a years' decline
the brightest of stars above
in night-time skies divine
and when the years passing by
no one will answer no one will cry
the solace in sea of tears
into a new sunshine

[bridge]
glory ascending
from days neverending
unfold your dreams right now

[chorus]
