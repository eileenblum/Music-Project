The heart of a discoverer
A poet in your soul
The moving force inside you
A vision and a goal
The advent of an era
At a cracking pace
Scouting out the unknown
With a heart of grace

Go with might and man
Over the odds
As far as you can
It's ever since
You've been a wayward child
A heart so free
To leave a legacy

[Chorus:]
(Bon Voyage)
Vagabond hold on
The challenge inside you
The dream within
Is just the launch of stories
(Bon Voyage)
Vagabond go on
Endeavor to reach a new state
(Bon Voyage)
Fly on and open the gate

The valor to explore
The other side of darkness
To open up the door
All you can ever dream of
All is unconfined
A vision deep within you
In your unconscious mind

You can see beyond
The terrine edge
This eternal bond
A-light with pride
You're still a wayward child
What makes you see
To solve the mystery

[Chorus]

Go deep inside
Don't hide your light
All over the place you'll shine bright

[Chorus]
