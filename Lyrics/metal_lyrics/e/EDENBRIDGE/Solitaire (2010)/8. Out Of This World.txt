The sleeping giant
Entangled
Am I
Ended in deadlock
Mistreated
By and by
So mine a rich seam
Do as you would be done by

[Chorus:]
Caught in this here
The sadness sincere all alone
I was shaped into form
Caught in this pain
In a world inhumane
You fight what you don t understand
Jaded am I
My well ran dry
On the slope
Is there no ray of hope
In the end, torn and swirled
I feel I'm out of this world

And looking down the ages
This treasure
We call liberty
Boundless dreams have no end
They just depend
On your will to be free

[Chorus]
