I came from miles around
To holy ground
The riddance of my soul
To take control
So where are you?
With all my heart i try
To wish away the big goodbye

[Chorus:]
Whenever you are mine
Above the timberline
I'm bound for you aflame with my desire
Whenever I am here
Abundantly it's clear
I won't turn tail and run
I come undone

You're closer to the bone
A heavy stone
(you're) Kicking up a storm
A pain so warm
Shall I give in?
As straight as die my friend
The road has come to an end

[Chorus]

Where I turn and I steer
It's all hope and fear
The current of time
The only port of call
Can save me from the fall
Can set it all alight

[Chorus]
