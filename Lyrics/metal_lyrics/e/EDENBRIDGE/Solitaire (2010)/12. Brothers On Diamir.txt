The Kashmir sky
The biggest face in snow
Sixteen thousand feet
Reaching from top to toe
A sight of blinding splendor
When destiny calls

Straight on the path to fame
The king has broken a bond
The summit calls their names
Before the voice trailed away in silence
Before he was swept away
(brother, death and loneliness)

[Chorus:]
He's crawling
He's falling
He is desperately unclear
He's tracing, effacing
The memory of Diamir
The western wall
A fateful call
No answer, no warning
Just fear for a brother on Diamir

A gleam of hope, racked with pain
The way to cope, when brothers remain
Woebegone, the pangs of remorse
On and on, to follow the force
The summit alone, the ghost of a chance
The venture so unknown, a fading romance
In the presence of danger, the tag-end of will
The claws of a stranger, can stroke or can kill
Enshrine the memory, surmounting the fear
It's an icebound tragedy, the fate of Diamir

The veil of oblivion of blood, tears and sweat
Out of a clear sky as his sun is set
Pay the last honors, thoughts range the past
Hold on in remembrance, memories that last
Goodbye
