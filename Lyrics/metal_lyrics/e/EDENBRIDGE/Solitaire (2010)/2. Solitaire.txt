The nothingness of life
Plunged into eternal darkness
An animal at bay
Words cannot convey
All is bathed in gray

A cold wind's blow
It's touch and go
If wishes were horses then beggars would ride
A torrid time
A strange design
Come hell or high water, come be the guide

[Chorus:]
I am here, down the ages
The road in deep despair
I'm solitaire
The diamond in your chain
The beacon fire in endless strain
The diamond in your chain

Is there a ghost of chance?
Here on this road to Damascus
The sun of eventide
Temptations misguide
The agony inside

Crash and burn
At every turn
Helplessly losing perception of time
A friendly card
A strange regard
Searching for reason and seeking for rhyme

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Pylon in the rain
Beacon in the strain
Pylon in the rain
Diamond in the chain

Pylon in the rain
Beacon in the strain
Pylon in the rain
Diamond in the chain

I'm solitaire, I'm solitaire
Solitaire, I'm solitaire, woo-oo-oh

Diamond in your chain
