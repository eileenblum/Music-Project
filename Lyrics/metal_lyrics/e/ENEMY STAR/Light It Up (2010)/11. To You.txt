Secrets
Everyone has secrets
Waiting to be revealed
Heartache
Everyone knows heartache
Longing to be healed

You're running circles inside of my head
A goddamned race I'll be in 'til I'm dead
Is this love or am I only fooling myself again?

Crazy
We're all a little crazy
Praying we'll never fall
Music 
You are in my music
One gift from me to you

You're running circles inside of my heart
I miss you, cherishing every part
Is this love, what can I do?
You own me, too
