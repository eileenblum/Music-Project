You take fear and bury me
Scaring me
Little games to silence me
Like I can't see
Lonely words from lonely lips
Laid on thick
Your disease is spreading quick
Makes me sick

I will come to find you
And take back my mind
You will fade away 
and I will stand
I will come to find you
And take back my mind
You will fade away 
and I will stand

Desperate needs from growing old
You're going cold
Break my wings, my dreams are sold
For your fool's gold

I will come to find you
And take back my mind
You will fade away 
and I will stand
I will come to find you
And take back my mind
You will fade away 
and I will stand

Boil my blood
(You ain't got nothin' on me)
Break my hands
(I am free)
Despite you
(no you got nothin' on me)
I will stand
(I am me)
Boil my blood
(You ain't got nothin' on me)
Break my hands
Despite you
(No you got nothin' on me)
I will stand

I will come to find you
And take back my mind
You will fade away 
and I will stand
I will come to find you
And take back my mind
You will fade away 
and I will stand
