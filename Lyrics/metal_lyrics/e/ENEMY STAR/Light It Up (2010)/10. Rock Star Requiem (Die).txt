Recognize you're full of lies
Your ego's bloated, truth unnoted
Play the victim, literatim
Burn that bridge 
And claim a righteous innocence

Don't cave in until you win
When gods are falling you'll be calling
You're the fool a mindless tool
Our demise
Is all we'll see when shadows rise

Die
Just do us a favor and just die
I shiver, I quiver, I tremble with rage
Die
Just do us a favor and just die
I shiver, I quiver, I tremble with rage

Die
Just do us a favor and just die
I shiver, I quiver, I tremble with rage
Die
Just do us a favor and just die
I shiver, I quiver, I tremble with rage
