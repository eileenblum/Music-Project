Walking through the shadows hear my footsteps shuffling
Will it be a robber or a fall that does the thing?
Just one moment and I'm pushing up daisies
Will it be a car crash or a terminal disease?

Hey Yeah!

In a flash it's over 
No faith in four leaf clovers
No matter where you run to
Everything you've done will undo
It's not a thing you escape
And feeling regret too late
The clock is ticking and I'm
finding I have lost my mind

Careful when it's cold outside, don't want to catch your death
Everyone has heard by now that cats can steal your breath
Airplanes and trains are moving iron maidens
Terrified but obsessed with just how my life will end

Hey Yeah!

In a flash it's over 
No faith in four leaf clovers
No matter where you run to
Everything you've done will undo
It's not a thing you escape
And feeling regret too late
The clock is ticking and I'm
finding I have lost my mind

It's coming for you
Oh Oh Oh
No where to run to
Oh Oh Oh
And it's watching you 
Oh Oh Oh
It's coming for you
Oh Oh Oh

In a flash it's over 
No faith in four leaf clovers
No matter where you run to
Everything you've done will undo
It's not a thing you escape
And feeling regret too late
The clock is ticking and I'm
finding I have lost my mind
