My dreams are your fears
My love is your tears

Who's gonna save you when we're alone?
Those glossy eyes and your quiet moan
Quiet moan

Your breath is passion
My satisfaction

Who's gonna save you when we're alone?
Those glossy eyes and your quiet moan
Quiet moan

I wanna bury your soul
(inside me)
My heart is selfish and cold
(and can't see)
For just a touch of my lips
(I'll thrill you)
The deepest you've ever kissed
(will kill you)

My dreams are your fears
My love is your tears

Who's gonna save you when we're alone?
Those glossy eyes and your quiet moan
Quiet moan

I wanna bury your soul
(inside me)
My heart is selfish and cold
(and can't see)
For just a touch of my lips
(I'll thrill you)
The deepest you've ever kissed
(will kill you)

You bury your soul from me
My heart is alone and hungry
A touch of my lips would kill you
I've waited so long without you

I wanna bury your soul
(inside me)
My heart is selfish and cold
(and can't see)
For just a touch of my lips
(I'll thrill you)
The deepest you've ever kissed
(will kill you)
