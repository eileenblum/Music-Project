Daddy dearest, looking for reasons to abuse
So afraid of losing your authority
Think you're justified, in bitterness you accuse
Suffocate the flame before it can even breathe

We are the ones who suffer silently
We are the ones you refuse to believe
We are the change you're afraid to face
We are the ones who will claim your place

Mommy dear, you are the vision of selfishness
Let him push and shove your very flesh and blood
Step aside and sleep beside him every night
Love him more than you care to be a mother

We are the ones who suffer silently
We are the ones you refuse to believe
We are the change you're afraid to face
We are the ones who will claim your place

We are the ones who suffer silently
We are the ones you refuse to believe
We are the change you're afraid to face
We are the ones who will claim your place
