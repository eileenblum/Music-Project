Maybe I'm the one who holds a grudge
Maybe you think I refuse to budge
Perhaps I should let it go
But how to I do not know
Nothing changes how I feel that I was sold out and denied

And it's not fair that I miss you
So what am I supposed to do
And when you smile it's not for me
It breaks my heart, but you won't see

All looks better from this point of view
Somehow time erased the worst of you
When I think of why I left
When I start to feel regret
I remember how you stole so many years of happiness

And it's not fair that I miss you
So what am I supposed to do
And when you smile it's not for me
It breaks my heart, but you won't see

And it's not fair that I miss you
So what am I supposed to do
And when you smile it's not for me
It breaks my heart, but you won't see

All those times I said I'd leave

And it's not fair that I miss you
So what am I supposed to do
And when you smile it's not for me
It breaks my heart, but you won't see

A thousand ways I tried to show
how much I loved, but you said "no"
It's not the song, it's not the verse
It's loving you that's been the worst
