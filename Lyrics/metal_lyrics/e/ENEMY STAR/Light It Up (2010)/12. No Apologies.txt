The knot is coming apart and it is
A relief to finally unhitch
Feeling alive now that you're
Going your way, I'm going mine

No apologies
I've got not regrets
If you're missing me
Don't hold your breath

Goodbye and good riddance
So long, aufwiedersehen my friend
Don't let the door hit your back
Goodbye and good riddance

Pretend that I'm the bad girl
If it helps you feel special
I could care less if you hate me
And burned an effigy

No apologies
I've got not regrets
If you're missing me
Don't hold your breath

Goodbye and good riddance
So long, aufwiedersehen my friend
Don't let the door hit your back
Goodbye and good riddance

Goodbye and good riddance
So long, aufwiedersehen my friend
Don't let the door hit your back
Goodbye and good riddance
