I've waited for heroes 
To come and fly me off my feet
I've hated their bravo
Just needed someone to be sweet
The whiplash from falling
has nearly got me seeing stars
Then one crash--I'm stalling
I'd wait a hundred years for you

Your mother, I'm sure we
will get along and do just fine
My brother, well maybe
you two will work it out in time
I'm flying like heroes
I'll leap a thousand buildings, too
You've got me completely
And there ain't nothing I can't do

My whole life, my whole life

And they can try their worst to burn us to the ground
They'll never bring us down
The venom on their lips is nothing next to this
They'll never bring us down

And they can try their worst to burn us to the ground
They'll never bring us down
They'll never bring us down
The venom on their lips is nothing next to this
They'll never bring us down
They'll never bring us down

Maybe we'll get married
A power duo--me and you
And no one can stop us
No villain that we can't fight through
No limits to glory
No battle that we can not win
And that is our story
...well perhaps with a little spin

My whole life, my whole life

And they can try their worst to burn us to the ground
They'll never bring us down
They'll never bring us down
The venom on their lips is nothing next to this
They'll never bring us down
They'll never bring us down
