I've lost my dreaming, have you seen her?
The last time we spoke I was young
She was so lovely I could taste her from across the street
Look at the monster I've become

Burn my beauty
Purge your memory
Waste your living
On your dying

I'll sell out to get out
I'll settle for less
I live to impress

Will this town tear me down and kill me
Should I pretend that I'm somebody?
Or is it better to accept the truth that no one cares
Their only interest is your money

Come and love me
I'm what you need
I'm fantasy
Your mystery

I'll sell out to get out
I'll settle for less
You're buying, we're smiling
We live to impress
The brand name and big fame
Have nothing but the best
You live to impress

I'll sell out to get out
I'll settle for less
You're buying, we're smiling
We live to impress
The brand name and big fame
Have nothing but the best
You live to impress

Your worth is what is in your wallet
It's sad no matter what you call it
