You watching me feels like 
the floor has dropped and I've lost all control
Bury my face
Hide it away from your prying eyes
Can't let you see
how much I want you, how I
desperately lie

Oh, Light it up
Oh Oh, Fire me up
You're so cold
So, so turn it up
What I crave
Uh huh, Burn within
You're a thief
Oh Oh

You're playing dangerous
You're pushing farther than what I should go
You're tempting fate
Making no promise for what I do
One little taste
stirs up the hunger I feel
I feel for you

Oh, Light it up
Oh Oh, Fire me up
You're so cold
So, so turn it up
What I crave
Uh huh, Burn within
You're a thief
Oh Oh, I'm your sin

Oh, Light it up
Oh Oh, Fire me up
You're so cold
So, so turn it up
What I crave
Uh huh, Burn within
You're a thief
Oh Oh
