Your sweet caress is burning through my skin
I must confess, it's tearing me apart
Am I a fool 'cuz nothing else makes any sense?

Please be there when I wake
Ease the bitter heartache

Could you know how I am so terrified of you-oo-oo
Or would you understand how you can kill me with a kiss?
There's not a moment that goes by
Afraid you're gonna say "goodbye" 
If she says "I love you"

The dark shadows that hide your hazel eyes
Eyes so hollow, I know you're hurting, too
I hate how we bury honesty, hidden love

Please be there when I wake
Ease the bitter heartache

Could you know how I am so terrified of you-oo-oo
Or would you understand how you can kill me with a kiss?
There's not a moment that goes by
Afraid you're gonna say "goodbye" 
If she says "I love you"

Please be there when I wake
Ease the bitter heartache
Please be there when I wake
Ease the bitter heartache

Could you know how I am so terrified of you-oo-oo
Or would you understand how you can kill me with a kiss?
There's not a moment that goes by
Afraid you're gonna say "goodbye" 
If she says "I love you"
