Give me a place
A hole in the wall
Somewhere to crawl and hide away
Can't shake the rain
Or silence the dark
The sun is not rising today

I'm dying inside
I'm dying inside

Hoping to heal
And rectify wrongs
I know my words hurt you all along
Ashes to dust
I've broken your trust
And far too proud to let you in

I'm dying inside
I'm dying inside

Everything I am
All that I will be
Was the best of us
Not me
All that I've proven
All that I've given
Has been the worst part
Of me

Alice does not live here anymore
There's no one here, close the door

Everything I am
All that I will be
Was the best of us
Not me
All that I've proven
All that I've given
Has been the worst part
Of me

Everything I am
All that I will be
Was the best of us
Not me
All that I've proven
All that I've given
Has been the worst part
Of me
