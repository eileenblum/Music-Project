Keep your secrets because you
Don't want to lose your face
I'm waiting for nothing
And now I'm losing grace

Help, I'd rather give it up for you
But I don't know what to do
It's so much easier for you

Crash to pieces when no one
Will do the deed for you
And bitter your vision
When dreams don't carry through

Help, I'd rather give it up for you
But I don't know what to do
It's so much easier for you

Help, I'd rather give it up for you
But I don't know what to do
It's so much easier for you
