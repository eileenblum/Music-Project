I spent a night above the Earth listening for your voice.
I couldn't hear your voice.
I chase a signal through the shadows, but it disappears.
It always disappears.
How I wish that we would collide.

You will find your way to the light.
Oh, little child just leave it all behind.
How I wish that we would collide.

It's cold when all you have is gone.
It's cold when your begging with no response.
It's cold.

Take everything from my body.
Filter my blood through your sacred hands.
How long before I hit the ground?

I have called your name from the shadows.
If you call who will answer you?
I have called your name from the shadows.
It is cold.
How I wish we would collide.

I spent a night above the Earth.
Watch me hit the ground.

You will find your way to the light.
