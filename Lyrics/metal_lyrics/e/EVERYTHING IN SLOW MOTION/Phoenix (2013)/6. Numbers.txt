I'm lost, and I'm out.
I walked away from you and never turned around.
This life, and this place.
The numbers don't add up I think I'll go my own way.
But you're still here.

My heart and my soul.
They used to be so strong until I let my faith go.
My song, silenced.
The numbers can't be right, they never make sense.
But you're still here.

Carry us home.

The numbers don't add up, I think I'll go now.

Carry us home.
