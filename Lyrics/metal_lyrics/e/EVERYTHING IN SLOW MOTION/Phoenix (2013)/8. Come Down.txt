I may never come down from this state of mind.
Like I'm standing in an ocean, bailing the water out with my bare hands.
I know, I wasn't made for this.
To be able to understand you, and where it all began.
I'll never.

After all that's been said, I should know by now.
That life's a whisper. The answers may not be found.

I am the one who doubts.
Like a wave of the sea, that is driven and tossed by the wind.
Is this all just in my head?
Am I growing closer, when it feels like failing?
I have never heard your voice.
But have I really listened? Have I really tried?
I may never come down.

After all that's been said, I should know by now.
That life's a whisper.
The answers may not be found.
