Falling deep into the sound.
One more hit should numb the pain, when I hit the ground.
I'd give anything to rest in your arms tonight.

Tear the needle from my skin.
Hide me somewhere safe before the drugs kick in.
I'd give anything to rest in your arms tonight.

How long will I live like I'm already dead.
I can feel my heartbeat slowing.
How much will it take before I'm seeing red.
This isn't who I am.
This isn't what I had planned.

Free me from myself.

How long will I live like I'm already dead.
I can feel my heartbeat slowing.
How much will it take before I'm seeing red.
I can't feel anything.
I'm begging you for a chance to start over.

There's a light within all of this darkness.
As the poison runs through my veins, Oh God.
I would give anything, just to rest in your arms
