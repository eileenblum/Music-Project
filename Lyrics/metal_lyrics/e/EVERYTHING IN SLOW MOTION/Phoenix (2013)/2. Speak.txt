There is something deep inside.
A seed of faith that keeps me questioning.
If I could see like you do, where would I be? Who would I be?
Sometimes it isn't enough.
But if I linger here for a while, you will only hear me speak.
If I could hear you.

Speak into our hearts, a song to shake the earth.
Love will light the way that leads us home.

There is something buried underneath this concrete floor.
From a seed, fragile sprouts are pushing upwards.
If I could see like you do, but I can't so I won't pretend.
But I feel it.
One day those sprouts are going to break through the surface.

There's a question that connects us all.
Is there more than life and death?
And even though we all take different roads, it burns within our chests.
I don't need the signs and wonders, no scientific proof.
Speak to me. Speak into my heart, a song to shake the earth.

Will I live forever? Or will I disappear?
My mind is searching for answers.
My heart saying it's never been so clear.

Speak into our hearts, a song to shake my perfect world.
Love will light the way that leads us home.
