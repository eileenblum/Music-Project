Be still and close your eyes.
They'll come for you when you're weak.
Be still and close your eyes.
Don't listen when they speak.
I will not be a slave to this body.
Get out.

The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
Get out.
I don't want it.
Light it up and let it burn to the ground.
Get out.
I can feel it. I'll rise above the ashes.
Get out.
I don't want it.
Light it up and let it burn to the ground.
Get out.
I don't need it.
I'm sick of giving in.
So let the walls come down.

Flesh and bones will return to dust.
But your love holds me, forever.

I am sick, sad, weak, tired and broken.
I say "I'm fine". But nothing's fine.
All the lies, the lust, the tongue like a razor.
I say "I'm fine". But nothing's fine, so let the walls come crashing down.
Get out.
I don't want it.
Light it up and let it burn to the ground.
Get out.
I can feel it.
I'll rise above the ashes
