I made a promise I would never do this again.
But here I am.
Getting caught was not enough to bring this to an end.
I guess I'll never learn.

Feeding this addiction, keeps me well.
At least most days.
Stacking lies to keep everyone from finding out.
Because if they only knew who I'd become.
A fake, a hypocrite, I'm on the run.
I can't do this on my own.

Let the hell that follows me, be gone.
Bury everything that I've become.
I just keep running, but there's nowhere left to hide.
So here I am.
Here I am I'm letting go of this tonight.

I can't do this on my own.
Only you can save me.
