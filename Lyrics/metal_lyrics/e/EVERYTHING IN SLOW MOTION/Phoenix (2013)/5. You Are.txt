I'm a song that only you can sing.
Nobody knows me better.
I'm a light, that only you alone can see.
Through this stormy weather.
And in the darkest times I've ever known.
You waited, patient beside me.
You are.

I'm a spark in burning fire.
Still you can see a purpose.
And after all the times I've walked away.
You have kept your promise.
You are.

You are. Beautiful you are.

I'm a song that only you could sing.
Let my words be more than nothing.
Beautiful, you are.
