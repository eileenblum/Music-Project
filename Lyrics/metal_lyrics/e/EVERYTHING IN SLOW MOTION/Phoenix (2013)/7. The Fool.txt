Take a look into my eyes and tell me what you see.
Nothing hurts anymore, I'm just bitter and empty.
Don't try to save me, I'll be just fine.
You don't know where I have been.
This is more than a cold, cheap conversation.
So don't be surprised, if I say

"You can keep your words.
You can keep your kingdom.
Keep your hands to yourself, I'll bet you've never met a sinner like me."

I sit alone, with a demon hanging on my back.
Finger resting on the trigger, I was weak and hopeless.
Everyone talks, but nobody listens.
You don't know where I have been.
This is more than a cold, cheap conversation.
So don't be surprised, if I say

"You can keep your words.
You can keep your kingdom. Keep your hands to yourself,
I'll bet you've never met a sinner like me.
And even though you claim his name, it's not enough to kill the pain.
So keep your hands to yourself, I'll bet you've never met a sinner like me."

I'll be just fine. There's no rest in the bed that I have made.
A fool I am, I'll hold my pride above the things that keep me suffering.

"Can you feel these words? I will never leave you.
Lay your burdens to the ground, walk away and I will set you free.
And I have always known your name.
It kills me son to hear you say 'keep your hands to yourself I'll bet you've never met a sinner like me.'
I've always know your name."
