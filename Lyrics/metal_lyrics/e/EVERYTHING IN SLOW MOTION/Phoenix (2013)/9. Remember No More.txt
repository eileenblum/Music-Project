I got caught up in the moment, I fell hard and cursed your name.
But the door was always open, and you loved me still the same.

Remember no more.
I will remember no more.

I've been hiding in the shadows, so no one else could see my face.
I've been drowning my convictions, in a sea of selfish waves.
I've tried so many times to let this go, but it flows within my veins.
How can it be? That you could keep me so close, when I'm so far away.

Come closer and break the silence.
I am reaching out for you. I will remember no more.
How can it be? When you say I will remember no more.
The door was always open.
The door was open and you loved me still the same.

What does this mean to me?
How long will I stay lying down?
It's like I'm stuck in a dream, free falling to the burning ground.
