Oh, hold my soul.
If I should come undone, hold my soul.

Hold my soul. When everything I know, goes away.
If I should come undone, hold my soul.

Rushing waves. Streaming creek
Will your love hold in my defeat?
Take me now. Pull my pride apart.
Put in me a cleaner heart.

Hold my soul. Hold my soul in the wake of the storm, if I should come undone.
Oh, hold my soul. If I should come undone, hold my soul.
Hold my soul. When everything I know, goes away.
If I should come undone, hold my soul.
