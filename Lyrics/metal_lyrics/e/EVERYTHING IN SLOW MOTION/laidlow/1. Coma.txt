Away I go. This season's taking control.
Away I go. I give up, you grow cold.
Maybe I'm too blind, to see the other side.

Take your time. I'll be here when you arrive.
Lose your pride, and leave it all behind.

Away I go. Through a door you've never closed.
Maybe I'm convinced, it was you that asked for this.

I hope you find what you're looking for.
