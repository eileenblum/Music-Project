Maybe I'm not the one, the story you would tell.
Maybe I'm not the one, you didn't need my help.
It's not something we talk about, it's nothing that you said.
It's a sickness in my stomach, it's a pounding in my head.
So I'll leave this one here for you.

Maybe I'm not the one, I know I should be strong.
But maybe it was you, that taught me right from wrong.
And I'm sorry for the time we'll never get back.
I'm sorry I'm afraid to admit that I loved you so much,
I can't stand the thought of failing you.
It's not something we talk about, it's nothing that you said.
It's a slowing in my heartbeat. It's a snake around my neck.
So I'll leave this one here for you.

I'm not much of a singer, but I'm giving you this song.
To help you remember me, remember when I'm gone.
