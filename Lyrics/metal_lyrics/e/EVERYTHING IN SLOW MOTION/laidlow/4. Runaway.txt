If I could pull this all apart.
Where would I end, where would you start?
Sometimes it's hard to see through.
What if I give you all my pain.
Every broken piece my heart contains.
Sometimes it's hard to see through.

There's things I'll never confess, I'll never speak. So I run away.
Afraid the pieces will fit, I resist and run away.

I'll give you one, you give me two.
I'll tell you lies, you speak the truth.
Sometimes it's hard to look you in the eyes.
The fear is sinking further in. If you're the end, how will I win?
They say that struggles is where the beauty lies.
Where in this world do we collide?

I feel the weight of the way I resist, and run away.
I will never win.
