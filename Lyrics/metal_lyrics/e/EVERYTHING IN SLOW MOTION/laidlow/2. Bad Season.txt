Burned out, on the floor.
I can't pretend I care anymore.
Because I don't.
I'm done with making sense.
Of all my selfishness, I'm way out.
There's no way out.

It's like I can't find a way, will there ever be something more?
And if I can't find a way will you stay with me through the storm?
If it tries to take you, don't let go.
If I can't find a way will you stay with me through the storm?

Burning in this season. Will you wait for me?
Believe. Will you wait for me?
