I kept thinking to myself that I would be alright,
but they turned the light on.
It's not a problem if I keep it buried deep inside.
So I turned the light off.

Everything that's haunting me right now
will lower me into the ground.

I kept thinking to myself that I would make it right,
if I turned the light on.
It's not a problem if it's all part of your design.

But I hat the fact that everything
that's haunting me and how,
it will lower me into the ground.

And when we pass the plate,
are you going to give or take it?
When we pass the blame,
we're never going to make it.
So let us call a spade, a spade, in spades.
Was it worth it to know?
