(A song to Sekhmet)

Sticking to this hopeless moment
I feel nothing but the rain
Taking me, deeper and deeper
The river knows only its way

Touch me no more, push me back
My time is slowly dripping away:
The pale glow of distant stars
This dying gloom of a fading sun

Your nectar's faith, your nectar's life
Your nectar's faith, my sweet demise

Arisen from the realms of lust
I give way to Sekhmet's touch
Adoring her stunning beauty
I'm praying to a nameless god

I was their power, I helped the lords
I Seized the weak and watched them fall

A long-forgotten god smiles on me,
As you fill my days with meaning
Her absence makes my skin crawl
As a hermit, I live on prayers

Your nectar's faith, your nectar's life
Your nectar's faith, my sweet demise

I was their power, I helped the lords
I Seized the weak and watched them fall
I inhaled the surrounding world
I was her sword when she smiled at me
