I never preached against your law
Never wronged any of the Gods
Suffering I've never been
In my name no crimson blood was shed
No!

Our true gods, you've betrayed
May you be one of Anubis' slaves
May your soul wander in vain
After death you won't live again

I never stole, I never lied
'cause of me nobody cried
I never caused disorder or plague
No holy flames I ever quenched
I never denied our true faith
Forgive me

Our true gods, you have betrayed
May you be one of Anubis' slaves
May your soul wander in vain
After death you won't live again

I'm so Innocent! - You have to fall!
I'm so Pure! - You are Guilty!
I'm so Clean! - You're a Sinner!
You're so guilty, Pharao!
