Holding out for a rightous hand
Help me through my vandering
For Great chasm opened up
(In search for clear vision)

As even great seas smash
On sacred cliffs
However hard my trying vainly
(Do I see throught conceited) delusions

(As rays of light)
Blinding eyes, but giving life
Opening up a new thought
Blasphemy had me caught

Sacrifice your own life
Deify me for a moment
And absolve us of our Rights
With lies we feed and aid
your phoney Masquerade

Suffering in vain
Yet with all the strain
We do the bidding
And I am the obedient
(Who is willing)

Sacrifice your own life
Deify me for a moment
And absolve us of our Rights
With lies we feed and aid
your phoney Masquerade

As bees servants to a flower
(Rationality is just waiting to devour)
As servants we are of the Higher
(The greed for knowledge will kill me in an hour)

Copying fair natures face
Flames bursted in my vains
Putting hands together
Everyone can become another with their own masquerade

Hiding like cowards
Show me yourselves
Creeping in shadows like thugs
Why?
You dare call yourselves Gods?
