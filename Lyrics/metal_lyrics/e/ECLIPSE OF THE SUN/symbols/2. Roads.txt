Through the forest of symbols
(It's everlasting
It's ever changing)
In our vein it's getting darker and darker
just like the universe - brighter and brighter

We rise in fall

Deep inside the time is cracking between the walls of birth
Like the trees before the end we celebrate these moments (of light)

We rise in fall
Hopes and tears
this is who we are
Road and trees
this is who we are

Old leaves of agony
Give us light and destiny
Good bye to you, old friends
Fareweel wo you, sad innocence
Just play our song gold elders
Just play our song black elders

In the forest of symbols we are
searching for significance
In the end we understand
Our greatest enemy can turn images to words
