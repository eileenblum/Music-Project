We forge our sun and sand,
The tales, the lies and the noise
Flowing without pause
Ripping us of our souls

As fear blinds our daylight,
Suffocating from the unreal night
Our darkness builds up the walls;
The gathering of souls
Crossing the doors of mortality
(Sought to bring sovereign rationality)

Crawling in our minds
To see life through our eyes

Deafened by their shrieks of truth
The self silently lies snug
Waiting for the orders
Puppets of a deity

Breaking down the borders
Of the great humanity

Without words they whisper,
With control over the sightless.
They march us ever deeper
With ambition to deliver

Their own facade,
Leaving no regards
Just bitter taste.

As fear blinds our...
Daylight,
(Sight),
(No will to fight)

Our unreal...
Night,
(Blight)
(City of light)

This eclipse will be our burial site.
