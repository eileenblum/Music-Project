We could only trust the top and die for the eye
We could only bring the rocks and never reach the sky
The ocean of knowledge embraces the pyramids now

Fragments of systems
Bricks in the wall
In the holy union of dead empires fall
The ocean of knowledge has been made in poor mens tears and blood

In the nameless darkness the beasts will eat the sun
In the hopeless darkness the antimatter covers the sun

Somewhere, someone will rise from ashes and dust
In every song, whisper and scream
Shadows bring inner crusts
Behold, how lambs become lions and wolves

Only hate creates conjunction
Only piece creates corruption

We can only feel the top and die against the eye
Forever we'll be rocks and never reach the sky
The ocean of knowledge turns into sand again and again
