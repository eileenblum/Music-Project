Beyond the walls of sweet oblivion 
You always knew I'm there and whispering 
Through every decision, every crossroad at midnight 
I took your hand and guided you here 
(Predestination? Determination? The will?) 

I still hear your voice 
"You are the angel of peace..." 
I still feel your love 
"...you are the angel of mine" 

We gave you the power to rule this hollow world 
They are just bleeding lambs, thirsty to serve 
Fulfill your destiny and walk with gods 
Judgement is yours without sins 
punishment does not exist... 

Walking shadows in the cave 
Who holds the fire? who holds the things? 
Who brings the light? 

When the tales are over 
Alone in the dark 
Daimonion 
When I left my God 
I seek your guidance 
Daimonion
