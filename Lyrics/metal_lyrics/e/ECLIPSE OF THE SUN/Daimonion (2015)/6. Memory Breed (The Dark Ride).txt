Enter the realm of hypocrisy 
Enter the realm of self-deceit 
Enter the realm of dead kings 
Enter the realm of self-torture 
Enter 

Shining thrones and dead kings rule your dying brain 
From fragments of memories you build your system again 

This is my dark ride 
I hate you Memory Breed 
Is this my real world? 
I hear your anthem 

It hides you, protects you from your maddening nothingness 
It's a spiral in the dark, it's horror and endless 

This is my dark ride 
I hate you Memory Breed 
Is this my world? 
I hear your anthem 

In fear of nothing 
Our life's deceit 
We are the measure 
The memory Breed 
In fear of void 
our life is greed 
We are the measure 
The memory breed 

Within the realm of hypocrisy 
Within the realm of self-deceit 
Within the realm of dead kings 
Within the realm of self-torture 

"He thus consumed unthinkingly, apace, 
As maggots in a cheese, and warm and fed, 
Had time to seek adventure, poesy, 
In wondrous visions of his idle thought." 

After thousands of years, the philosophy ends 
You're still hungry, still thirsty, your seed's unsatisfied 

Your mind is a black diamond 
It elevates you in death 

Our life's deceit...
