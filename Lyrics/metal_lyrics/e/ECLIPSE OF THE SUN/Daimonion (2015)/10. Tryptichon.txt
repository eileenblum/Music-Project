Now 

In the mist of lost innocence 
Visions are fading 
The parallels of my road 
meet in me 
Now 
I can only 
whisper in the silence 
Please, forgive me father 
I whisper in the silence 
Please, forgive me my mother 
Like a teardrop in space 
I float weightless 
If I ever had a choice 
it was only the end 
now 
I cry in the silence 
Please, forgive me world 
I cry in the silence 
Why have you forsaken me, my mother 

Never 

This voice in my head, this beast in my mind 
shows me my darkest, cruelest dreams 
It horrifies me but attracts me 
how could I rule this forsaken world 
Now it's time to change 
I'll hold your hand 
Finally through me you can be what you are 
Now it's time to revenge 
I will raise you 
You are the greatest creature of the history 

Behind the walls 
Maybe I find 
Behind the walls 
I find myself 
Behind the walls 
It frightens me 
Behind the walls 
Who waits for me 

Within the darkness 
Within the light 
Within the darkness 
Within the light 

Images in my head, and a beast in my soul 
Are they my deepest, truest desires 
They horrify me but attract me 
Now I see what I will choose 
Now it's time to change 
I'll hold your hand 
Finally with me you can be what is you doom 
Now it's time to rule 
To rule in blood 
You'll be the greatest creator of history 

Ever 

A god in a godless creation 
Stars in a dying universe 
A fate that's never been written 
this is who we are 
Forevermore
