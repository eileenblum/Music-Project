Where will I find flowers in winter? 
And where the sunshine and shade of the earth? 

Walls stand cold and speechless in your mind 
You're under the pressure of morality, 
but I can give you right to fly 

Constructive destruction, how can it be? 
A faithless generation, the end of history... 

Good or evil? It's only made by you, moral mortals 
Be one of us, immoral Immortals! 

Who am I to decide (There is no choice) 
Who am I to be the future 
Who am I to deny (You'll be my voice) 
Who am I to say: it's evil or good 

I'm still here between cold walls 
I'm still hear this voice, but it's not yours...
