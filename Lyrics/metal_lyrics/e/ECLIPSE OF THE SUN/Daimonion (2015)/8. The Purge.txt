You saw the mankind on the edge of the chasm 
If you cry only a word, they will fall in (their) abyss 

To purify the world you'll start a church 
Open your mind and take in the revelation 
"Follow your icons, oh human race 
The gods and the nature, the real slayers" 

Create chaos, create order with the sentence: 
"There is no evil, there is no good in the real world 

You followed blindly your silent god 
You get only life, they get your blood" 

I call you lambs who suffer 
Without hell there's no heaven 
I call you trees who desire 
Without slaves there's no lord 
I call you lions who rage 
Without fear there's no limit 
I call you bleeding hearts 
Let the purge begin 

Ancient scripts and holy laws 
guide our life from the past 
It's time to tear down the walls 
of this outworn morality 
Like the gods, let us be evil! 
High principles are flames around us 
(They raise us and just burn) 
We are animals in a mirrorcage 
As a part of the nature we denied ourself 
Like the gods, let us be evil! 

In the gate of a new era let the horror begin 
From the ashes it will rise: the true spirit of man 

We gave you the power to rule the world 
You are the prophet of a brave new world 
Knowledge and solitude embrace me 
Knowledge and solitude suffocate me 

I call you lambs who suffer 
Without hell there's no heaven 
I call you trees who desire 
Without slaves there's no lord 
I call you lions who rage 
Without fear there's no limit 
I call you bleeding hearts 
Let the purge begin 

Gloria! Gloria!
