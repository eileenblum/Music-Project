It comes from the deep 
Abyss of ego 
Like a thief in the night 
Every night 
Until my brain consumes my innocent soul 
I carry her dark legacy 
(my glorious destiny) 
it is called humanity 

I'm seeking the life between the ruins 
Questions I find between the ruins 
About the gods, about the mortals 
the consequences of genesis 
Only questions I find between the ruins 

Suddenly a newer threat's rising 
against this tortured land 
Native peoples are crying and whispering 
about a dragon who eats the sun 

The clairvoyant infants are trembling 
like the nature, that's scared to death 
An old legend resurrects in me 
when the dragon's eating the sun 

As the sun redeems 
his bright and calm realm 
Spells of elders fill the air 
So many eyes on me, strange feelings in me 
hunt me 
And my dark ride begins... 

I'm seeking the life between the ruins 
Questions I find between the ruins 
About the gods, about the mortals 
the consequences of genesis 
Only questions I find between the ruins
