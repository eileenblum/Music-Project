Through the mist of remembrance 
Images foreshadow 
Without meaning or significance 
Adorn you in dirt 
Living in past, living in future, 
but doomed for defection 
You think therefore you are 
You feel therefore you die 

Seeking of purpose blinded you to reasons 
Dream and dread without any deed 
you want to belong but you can not be faithful 
you can't believe in God who you hate 

Trapped in a body you wish for freedom (and rebellion) 
Seeking fate while it lurks behind your mind 
you cry for virtues without strength to fight for 
you deny the God who you hate, who you fear 

What can we do when they kill our loved ones? 
How can we live together with demons? 
What is the sin? To forgive or not to forgive? 
Is there any sin in this world? 

In agony, eternally 
From the substance of unknown stars 
alone and doomed in this strange world 
In agony, eternally 
From the cross of the human existence 
We sing for ourself this angry requiem 

Between the ruins, among the living dead 
I save their soul, elevate the mankind 
They took you from me, my beloved Mother 
Now I want my life...but I live your life
