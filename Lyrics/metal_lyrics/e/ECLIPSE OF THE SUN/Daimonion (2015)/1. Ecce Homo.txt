Behold the man 
how he creates his own lords 
Listen the words 
the verb of faith is eternal 

A slave from unreal desires 
A will of menstruous flesh 
A fate that has never been written 
this is who you are, who we are... 

To be in context is the only way to live 
To be alone is the only way to give 

A god who's ever been denied 
A part of a cracking complex 
A fate that's never been written 
this is who we are, who you are...
