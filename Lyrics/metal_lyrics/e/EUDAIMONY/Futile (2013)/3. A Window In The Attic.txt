[Lyrics: Matthias Jell]

From a window in the attic
I see grey birds passing by
lost on their way
onto forgiving nothingness

What would I find here, if I stayed?
A life without hope
What would you find of me, if I decayed?
A wasted life ended by the rope

From a window in the attic
I see life passing by
wipe the daylight off my eyes,
death alone knows my way

And when I'm gone,
another one will take my place
behind the window in the attic
you will see his weary face

And all, that will remain of me
is just a vague memory
