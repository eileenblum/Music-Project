Again I walk along this road
blurred headlights cross my way
there's no tomorrow
with every step another yesterday

Burnt all the bridges behind me
withdrawn from every human presence
darkened every door before me
driven by forgiving indifference

It doesn't matter where I've been
doesn't matter where I go to
I remember someone telling me
nothing is as bad as it seems

Again I walk along this road
blurred headlights cross my way
there's no tomorrow
with every step another yesterday

Do you really wonder
why I prefer to walk this road alone
than being alone with you?
