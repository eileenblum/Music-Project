Some nights I awake
still feeling the pain
nebulous memories remain
that donât belong to me

Everythingâs so cold
losing ground day by day
everything feels so cold
can you tell me, why I should stay?

Needless to say, life gets better one day
itâs only darkness fading into grey
âtill thereâs no place left to stay
but a grave in the arms of slow decay

Everythingâs so cold
losing time day by day
everything feels so cold
yet I am on my way

Built my own cell of isolation
with no way out
but a road of desolation

Everythingâs so cold
losing life day by day
everything feels so cold
I got a weary smile and take farewell
