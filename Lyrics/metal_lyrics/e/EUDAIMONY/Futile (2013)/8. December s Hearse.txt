[Lyrics: Matthias Jell/ December 2008]

Waiting for another day to end,
another day to comprehend,
what I lost within one single night,
the peace of mind, a guiding light

If I could just follow you
to close the gap behind,
but failure is a haunting virtue
on this road through no man's land

Things will never be the same again
though I tried to turn back time
for my own life to regain,
a life marked by those traces of thine

All those aching memories
brought me to my knees
Playing this every-day role,
hiding the wreckage of my soul

Wherever you are,
no matter, if near or far,
your loss remains as a scar...

They will never understand,
even though they do pretend
They want me to exhale
with another desperate smile

Uncried tears can never dry,
and each day I silently die,
I keep on following your trace
right into the sun's dying haze

[Dedicated to Josef Jell (01.02.1952 â 20.12.1994)]
