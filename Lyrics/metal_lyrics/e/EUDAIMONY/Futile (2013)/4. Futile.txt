Empty facades all around
eyes like open books
telling lies with every look
nauseatic images on burial ground

Let myself drown in this daily deluge
may death be my last refuge
let me fall and set me free
and grant my soul eudaimony

Iâve been searching for so long
but every way I chose felt wrong
expelled from the joys of men I tried to be free
getting used to this void inside of me

Regardless of what they say
I know I was never meant to stay
I will bleed until theyâll see
life is the most futile state to be

A dead spot in my mind
from the ones I had to leave behind
I tried so hard to forget
but every new day meant regret

On the crossroads to loneliness
open eyes breed nothingness
a lifeline completed, time to let loose
may death be my last excuse

Iâve been dying for too long
in your most lonesome hour hear my song
regardless of what they said
we are all just meant to fade
