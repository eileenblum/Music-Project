[Lyrics: Matthias Jell]

Another lifeline fading,
Empty portraits remaining
Left here with spring alone
Under the weight of the stone

Further astray with each new day
So clear that you could never have stayed
I bid farewell to the sun
Ever aware that you're gone

No place left to stay,
Those colours of your soul have drawn my way,
No one there as I fall,
Those memories engulf my soul

I don't dare give in to sleep
For night by night you seem so real
But I don't dare to awake
For every new day tells me that I break

And on the day I pass away
All those portraits will turn grey
Deep inside my soul three words and your name,
And what remains is but an empty frame
