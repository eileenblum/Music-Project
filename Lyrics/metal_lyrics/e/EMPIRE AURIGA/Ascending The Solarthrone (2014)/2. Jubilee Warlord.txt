"Ignite them, for they are weak.
a funeral cast in stars,
send them flaming to the blackness"

within the end of time
exiled to await their blasphemies
aware only of their deaths
their consciousness eclipses into shadow
as the universe halts its existence

here, the worms will take you
here, the concept of life evades you

in blackness, there is truth
in blackness, your dimension awaits for the day of its jubilee...
