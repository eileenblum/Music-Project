He and his old gnarled hands,
Nobody knows what he actually thinks
Sitting on his throne of stars and contempt
Wondering about the quintessence between worlds

Staring at the hammer in his fist...
Here now is the culmination of all life and worlds
All voids meet at the old man's call
Drawn to be consumed in the eternal galactic fire

The divine ones shift in their waiting
Planets destroy planets as the ether extinguishes all
But the old one knows the fate of all
And smiles to himself as he raises the hammer
