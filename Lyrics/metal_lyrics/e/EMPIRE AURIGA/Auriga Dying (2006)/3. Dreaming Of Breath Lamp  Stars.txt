Dreaming of breath and stars
In the eclipsed halo of eyelids
Beyond etherial boundaries of mankind's daylight
The subconscious aura coalesces inverse of my life

Flight becomes reality
As stars become brothers
And fatal failing moons
Become images of my own heart's wrenching

Pondering heavens in the loss of slumberous drift
Yet destroying truths in undetermined ill-will
Grey matter no longer submits
It only lives for itself

Thoughtless of its own harbinging
Raging toward self destruction

It yearns for nothing in our own meager atmosphere
But dreams of breath and stars
