The space king dreams
Only in shades of blue

And the sapphire slaughter
Denounces the righteous
When all else fails
In deep nebulae
The heart must wander
Where the soul cannot
For only demons
Enjoy this realm

Deepest time expand and take me

Take me to where these beasts are mine
And there is nothing left but time...

Torment the stars
Rend the space from me

For at my down
My essence consumes
All foretold light

Universe of unknown
None shall hail my death
For it shall not be
As I expand
All of space and time...
