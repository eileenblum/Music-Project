For the days
Ends of time in thoughtless light

Satan take me
Fulfill the hollow
Paint the blighted land

Hear a call of birds
A sorrowsong at the ends of time

The apocalypse shadows of winged friends
Forest glory, a fire too long
Shine with a parched heat
Blaspheme upon the rocks
Vomit to the skies

A neck that cranes and swoops of raven's meals
Rise on the heat
Insane of the hellfire

Earth in flames
Sludge, god of spit and sperm enslave us all
Here is the dark, captured in light
Never foretold, always to be seen

Life of love and death
Sweetest fire, crush stones with your agony...
