They call me Gladiator
A slave to Rome, Hero to the mob
I must entertain to rise
Kill to live or die
The strength I bleed, I take for my freedom
Criminal they say, persecuted
A puppet for the people's amusement
This is my kingdom, the coliseum
Where I will meet the after life
Pain is the level of all of your fears
Survival of my soul to light
I surrender the sun for your life
I challenge the gods to die
He who is about to die we salute you
Fight honorably until the moment you meet your afterlife
Terror bestows my body and mind
Rejoice in dignity, a chance to live in glory and adoration for eternity
My sword and shield are the only things real to me
I feel the wrath calling me... to take this life from me
Thrust the gladius, into the flesh it rips
Screams of anguish lost into the dust
Take your last breath vision the sky dark touch the light see the iron mask save your soul
The crows wait to feed
I live for another day, another moment under the sun
Break the silence of the crowd as they cheer for the final blow
Pain is the level of all of your fears
Survival of my soul to light
I surrender the sun for your life
I challenge the Gods to die
