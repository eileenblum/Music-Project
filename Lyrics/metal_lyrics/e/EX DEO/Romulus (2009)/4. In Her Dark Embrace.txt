Beautiful she sleeps in my arms
She caresses the storm inside of me
The thunder wakes the tyrant
Unleash the beast inside of me
She rules with a deadly grip
Colossal and unmerciful
Her majesty is vast and wide
Hear the sounds of her enemy's cries
Temptations of war...
Temptations of lust...
Her majesty awakens
Among the killing fields, sinners betrayed
And left to rot
In her dark embrace
In time no sun aligned me
Ego sum victum
Centurion to command her men
Praetorian to guard her kings
Her reach is across the sea
Her triumph is victorious
Her might is glorious
She wolf she sent to guide
Kings born to bring her high
Lifetime to the pulse of the universe
Jupiter and Mars her life
UNDEFEATED SHE WILL RISE
Temptations of war
Temptations of lust
In her dark embrace
In time no sun aligned me
Her majesty awakens
Among the killing fields, sinners betrayed
And left to rot
In her dark embrace
In time no sun aligned me
Ego sum victum
