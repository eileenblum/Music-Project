Legion of the 13th
The dye is cast
As we cross the Rubicon, the dye is cast...
The blood will flow
They call it the point of no return
But for us it just begun
Rome's most lethal weapon
The twin legion has arrived
Revolution is at hand
The fire in the sky is damned
The brave will rise
The shadows of light
This strength and honour
Determined to conquer
Fate to dominate
Architects of war
We are the 13th
Brothers in arms
Our enemies will fear
The power that we cheer
We live to fight this dream
To unify our world
In dominance we rise
Together we shall die
Bleeding for our sun
Our legacy never undone
We massacred the opposition
We walk in glory, in all our envy
Loyal to the god of Mars
They crossed out path and they were lost
Hand to hand we killed them all
Blood drenched and ripped apart
Feed them to the rabid dogs
The 13th is law
The brave will rise
The shadows of light
This strength and honor
Determined to conquer
Fate to dominate
Architects of war
We are the 13th
Brothers in arms
