Oh...how the gods have spoken
Oh...how they whisper guidance
Oh...how the poison bleeds...bleeds, the father horizon
Oh...how her enemy lurks
Oh...how the snake slithers
Oh...how the eagle shines ... it shines for eternity

As we storm through the gates of Alesia
We bring forth fire and might
Spill blood across the fields
Penetrate the Gallic Nation
Starve them through circumvallation
Break the enemies' determination
Hope will shatter those who believe
Believe in the will to oppose the greatness of Rome
As we fight we fight for honor
To keep the glory of our founding Fathers
Bring me the strength to carry on
And stand with you until the end of time
Can you hear all the trumpets of war?
The sound of courage and all that is real
We stand together in this test of time
Rise, rise from the blood of the weak
No retreat, no surrender
By orders of the senate
I command to fight until death
In the name of Jupiter and the people of the Republic
Fight for your children, your wives, your land
Betrayal will be met by death
As we storm through the gates of Alesia
We bring forth fire and might
Spill blood across the field
Penetrate the Gallic Nation
Starve them through circumvallation
Break the enemies' determination
Hope will shatter those who believe
Believe in the will to oppose the greatness of Rome
As we fight, we fight for honor
To keep the glory of our founding Fathers
Bring me the strength to carry on and stand with you until the end of time
Can you hear all the trumpets of war?
The sound of courage and all that is real
We stand together in this test of time
Rise, rise from the blood of the weak
I declare Gaul province of Rome
VENI, VIDI, VINCI
