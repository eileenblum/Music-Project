Enslaved to build the kingdom of Gods
Blood and sweat mixed in the sun
Those who fall are tossed aside
Mangled hands that bleed to the light
Bleed to the light
How the whip rips through the flesh
Thirst and hunger with no time to rest
Better to die, than live through this life
The hope inside keeps me alive
Slaves that die fed to the lions
There is one law in this dominion
We are the Gods that walk the earth
Serve the masters and see the light
Betray the contract and be crucified
The empire shines...shines so bright
Dreams of rebellion rise inside
Talks of how the Gods could die
No man shall kneel to another's appeal
Crushed and oppressed our faith is sealed
Slaves that die fed to the lions
There is one law in this dominion
We are the Gods that walk the earth Serve the masters and see the light
Betray the contract and be crucified
The empire shines... shines so bright
Bring them to the lions...
Memories fade to darkness
Bloodlines faced with death
Survival is all that's left
Ancestors will cry for those who bled
