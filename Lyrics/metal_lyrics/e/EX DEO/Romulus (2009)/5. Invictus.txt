Elegance, we salute you
King and liberator of the world
Sun of the republic and father of our freedom
Meus Imperator, protector of Rome
Quod Rector, son of the republic
Meus Mucro, the eagle's eyes
Meus Loricatus, the hands of war
HAIL!
HAIL!
HAIL!
JULIUS CAESAR
HAIL!
HAIL!
HAIL!
INVICTUS
Traitors invade the dominion
Predators from the barbarian hordes
Enemies of Rome to betray the civil
Pray of the higher power, to crumble
Instigate the wicked and feel the wrath
To vanish into sacred skies
Meus Imperator, protector of Rome
Quod Rector, son of the republic
Meus Murco, the eagle's eyes
Meus Loricatus, the hands of war
HAIL!
HAIL!
HAIL!
JULIUS CAESAR
HAIL!
HAIL!
HAIL!
INVICTUS
