Plague... the Christian plague
Invades the empire and threatens the sun
Insults to the pagan gods
Means punishment by death
A disease that eats away, the core of existence
Persecution is the only way
To rule without decay

The gardens of Nero,
Illuminated with the flesh
Burn... Burn... Burn... Burn...
Rome burns... with the flesh...
With the blood

Gather the men, look through the streets
Under the bridges and inside their homes
Flay the resistance, impale the leaders
Bring me the fire, burn them alive!

Burn... Burn... Burn... Burn...
Rome burns... with the flesh...
With the blood
