26 A.D. exile to Capri, paranoia infects the mighty Tiberius
Assassins lurk throughout the glorious land, like Germanicus, dead by a poisoned tongue!

What is a king without a leash on his kingdom?
What is all power... without fear to feed it?

On to Capri to rule, bring forth desire of a god
Servants to please, my wilds dream....

I am Tiberius and you shall bring me your children,
You shall bring me your wives, you shall bring me everything...

My reign as a Julio Claudian, will be remembered as the greatest of them all
Statues will be erected in all corners of Rome!

"Watch closely little boots, as I bathe in their blood and crush their dignity to nothing, one day you will be the same, boy... oh what a sight it will be"

(dear Caligvla) Your father was a hero of Rome, I could not let him rise
One day you will understand and worship me as a god
My enemies will tremble, my wrath unmerciful
Aut vincere Aut mori

Caligvla!!... Rise with me... Rise, and all shall fall from the Tiberius cliff...
