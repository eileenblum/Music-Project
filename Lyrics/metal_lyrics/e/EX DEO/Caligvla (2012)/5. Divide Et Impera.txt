Of your Emperor's beloved trust
None shall defy this era of Greatness
Centuries of courage, led to world conquest

Feel the winds of domination
A spectacle like you never seen before
You could only whisper this scream
You could only imagine this dream

I shall not yield (Trust)
I am a soldier of Rome (Loyalty)
You must bleed for what you believe in (Allegiance)
You must die if honor calls (In glory)

Surrender time, Surrender life
I walk the land free of all the misery you seek
My darkness will hold no prisoner
My blood is Roman and so shall I die

Feed from the wounds of time
Let the gladius strike you down
Let the fire march inside
Descend upon thee
Mars, oh god of war
