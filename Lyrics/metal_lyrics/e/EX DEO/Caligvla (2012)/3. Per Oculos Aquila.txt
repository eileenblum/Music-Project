Oh!
As the eagle watches the vision of worlds collide
The monuments of a thousand deaths
The snakes are slithering
Feel the warm embrace
Feel the thunder slay
Feel the power of the sun
Conquering the lands of the undone

To fly into the sky
To seek the wisdom of light
In honor of the fallen, fallen
To protect her beloved fire
To the ancestors who watch, watch
The spear pierce the enemy

For your glory
Take this blood I sacrifice
For your glory
Per oculus aquila

Oh!
As the eagle watches the vision of worlds collide
The monuments of a thousand deaths
The snakes are slithering
Feel the warm embrace
Feel the thunder slay
Feel the power of the sun
Conquering the lands of the undone

Goddess of fertility
Master of war
King of all seas
Beholder of all time
Messenger of light

Jove!
My king
My sun

For your glory
Take this blood I sacrifice
For your glory
Per oculus aquila
