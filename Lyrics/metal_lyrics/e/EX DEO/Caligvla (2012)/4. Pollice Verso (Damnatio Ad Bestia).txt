As I stand here, waiting for the gods to kill
There's no turning back
There's no hope for a dying man
Killing is the only way, the only way to see another day
Fear's only for the weak, as I pledge my life for freedom

The blade rips through the flesh
The thirst of blood uncontrollable
Lions, roar into the light
The pressure from the shield is tight
Blood spills into the night
Gladiators fight to stay alive
Man vs. beast, Man vs. Man, God vs. Gods
Merciless to none, to die into the sun
Blood stains the sands of eternity

Pollice Verso
Today is a good day to die
Pollice verso
Bring me to the after life

As I stand here waiting for the gods to kill
Unmerciful to the death of me...

Wild beasts tear the limbs apart
Decapitated bodies, torn into pieces
So far away from home

Blood stains the sands of eternity

Pollice Verso
Today is a good day to die
Pollice verso
Bring me to the after life
