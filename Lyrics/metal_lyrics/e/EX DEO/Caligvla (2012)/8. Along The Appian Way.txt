Forced to enslavement, traces of Thracian blood
Sentenced to the land of Capua... named Gladiator

Bounded by chains, a hero of slaves to rise and army bigger than dismay
The thirst of freedom, greater than the will of death, greater than the oath of mankind
Spartacus to defy the Roman way of life
Thousands of men ready to die, soldiers of Rome ready to strike... Spartacus!

"Pompey Magnus, Crassus... gather the men, I need you to crush this rebellion, one by one &amp;
When you do, you shall crucify them along the Appian way and show the world none shall defy Rome!"

Legions Engage...

Broken &amp; defeated (the Spartacus army)... retreat to southern Italy
Gather reinforcements, Crassus in pursuit

He will not stop to lead his rebellion
Until the day he dies for his freedom

The thirst of freedom, greater than the will of death, greater than the oath of mankind
Spartacus to defy the Roman way of life
Thousands of men ready to die, soldiers of Rome ready to strike... Spartacus!

"Come on Men, I don't have all night, there's still 4,000 to be crucified" - Crassus
