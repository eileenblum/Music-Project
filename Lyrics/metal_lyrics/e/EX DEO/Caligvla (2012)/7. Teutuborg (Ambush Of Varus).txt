Unrest Amongst the Germanic tribes, Alliances... Cherusci and Chatti
Armenius, barbarian at heart, under Roman control
Trusted to Centurions, Trusted by Varus
Pressure from the North, Imperial Retaliation
Bring the sirens of war... of war!

Onward to Teutoburg
To liberate the northern frontier... Teutoburg

Ambush!.... Ambush!
Testudo Formate
Hold the line... Hold it!
Alas, this is what we do in life...
Centurion... Battle at will!

Defeat Armenius, the traitor of all traitors
Led legions to slaughter
Ambush into the night, deep into the forest light
Where men seek the lawless
Rome to taste revenge... 35,000 men infrantry
Burning down the Chatti
As Mattium burns, the Rhine in roman possession

Onward to Teutoburg
To liberate the northern frontier... Teutoburg

"Quintilius Varus Where are my Legions?... Give me back my Legions" - Augustus
