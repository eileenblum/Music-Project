I can smell the bodies, burning the earth
Hispania has fallen, Rome at my grasp
My patience is vast, resolve absolute
Lex Talionis

My order arrives, I'll bring your fate
No one will stop this dominance rise
Unleash my wrath, thunder from Carthage
Roma will perish

One will save the world from demise
One will walk this earth triumphant
One will roam with the beasts of the world
One will decimate all

Can you see my rage bleed through my veins?
Can you see the future engulfed in Carthage?

I'll break through your gates, thousands of men
Forty beasts at hand, Celtics by my side
Blood in the Roman rivers
Resistance will fall 
One by one, sword by sword
I will be king
King of the world

Father, give me your strength
The impossible shall be possible
We will find a way or make one
By the grace of my ancestors
I am Hannibal

Give me your strength, pillar of gods
My hands are frozen but my soul is on fire
The cold is my shelter, my faith is alive 
But my body is dying, lift me again

To the sounds of wisdom
To the sounds of destruction
To the sounds of the angels
That will make me reborn

I will rise from the depths of demise
To lead this army into the bowels of Rome
To the bowels of Rome

I'm here at your footsteps
Let the sirens sing
The sounds of conquest

Can you hear my marching soldiers?
Can you hear my voice fade into the night?
I am here
I am here
