The time has come
Havoc will rise
Death from my cold hands

To strike the eagle
At its nest we lay
The torch of fire

Women, children, enslaved forever
Every man put to death
Conquer Hispania

Spaniard, ally of Rome
I shall plunder and destroy
In the name Carthage
Blood shall reap the earth

"This is my oath, I uphold it to you, father,
I have started my duty in honour and in blood"

And no one else could ever see you coming
Commander

I will bring this war to you
I will see the lions eat the heart of the living
I will see the world turn to dust

"Obscurum per Obscurius...
Imperium per Imperio...
Cathago Nova"

Resistance dismantled
No chance to surrender
I lay siege to Saguntum
To install my supremacy

Arrogant Roman
Seek my crucifixion 
I seek your destruction

I place my hands in the depths of eternity
I sacrifice my soul for the goods of apathy

"Rome offers you peace or war, General. 
Choose: It matters not to Rome!
This is War!"
