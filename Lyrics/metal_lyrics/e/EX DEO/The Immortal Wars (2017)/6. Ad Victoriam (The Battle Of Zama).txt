Push, pull
Divide and conquer
Everyone is everything

Zama Regia
Summer of legends
Summer of blood
Wage war back to Carthage
This time we end it all

Hannibal
Face your nemesis
I am the general you cannot kill

"I am your blood turned to death
I am Roma Invicta"

On this day
Let forty thousand souls 
Crush the hands of Carthage

Bring me the head of the lion
For victory, I lay my sword for you

"Formation!
Three line single column, left flank cavalry!
Massinissa, move forward!"

Push, pull
Divide and conquer
Everyone is everything

Zama Regia
Summer of legends
Summer of blood
Wage war back to Carthage
This time we end it all

Hannibal
Face your nemesis
I am the general you cannot kill

Bring me the head of the lion
For victory, I lay my sword for you

I hear the screams of the earth shake before me
I hear the moans of men dying
With spears entrenched in their bowels
Severed heads and bodies wrapped in fire

There is no place for war
There is no place for the living
Plunge the gladius of Rome
Into the heart of Africa
