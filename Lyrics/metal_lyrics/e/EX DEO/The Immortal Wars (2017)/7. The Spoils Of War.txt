In the shade lie the spoils of war
In this land lies the key to victory

Door to door
Man to man
Kill them all

Crucify
Magnify
The power to dominate
The seeds of the poisoned
Rewrite the pages of history

I've walked from the vineyards of heaven
To the battlefields of hell

Hannibal Barca
Rome demands your ultimate surrender
Lay down your arms
Or face complete annihilation

Legends will fall today
Thunder will reign the skies
The gods rejoice in triumph
The spoils of war

Retreat
Burn it down
Seek your sanctuary
Emblem of power
Heart of courage
Destroyed forever

I solitude you died
Master tactician
We salute you

Your king is dead
Long live the Republic

Bellum Parate
Quoniam Pacem
Pati Non Potestis
