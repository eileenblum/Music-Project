Stand up in what you believe in
There is no remorse
Beware of the consequences
To take force

Striving for the fear
It's the only sense
The end people suffer
In the abuse in silence

Your mind obviously has to be the stronger one
Only use the force to your last resort
Take all you've learned and put it all upon
Release the bitterness, but Never Look Away

Never Look Away
Stand up and look proud
Keep your head up high
Never Look Away
