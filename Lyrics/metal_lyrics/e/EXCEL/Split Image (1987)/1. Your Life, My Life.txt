Your Life, My Life
Your Life, My Life
Your Life. My Life
Your Life, My Life

What is this, what you say?
Your road to life has been paved
You think you're someone I should adore
Because you say you got your foot in the door

Success to life, isn't a suit or tie
But to you it is the bottom line
Stand back and take a good look at yourself
The friend I once knew is now on the shelf

[Repeat Verse 1]

[Repeat Verse 2]

Don't you think it's only fair
To share the feelings we have?
Finding out what's been done
Can't you see your life is no fun

[Repeat Verse 2]

This is my life, not your life

[Repeat]
