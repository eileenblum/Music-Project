You just think you make sense
Just wake up, you're in a dream
Split Image of someone else
Why can't you just be yourself?

[Chorus:]
Split Image - Wake up
Split Image - Wake up
Split Image - Wake up
Split Image - Wake up

[Repeat Verse 1]

[Chorus]

Never mind my feelings, you never really cared
So much hatred I can't bear!
Get out of my life, that's all I want!
Now you'll receive personal onslaught

You've got the mind of someone else
Why do you exist? You seem to blame
Never in my mind seem to help
You're not the same, you're back to your own self
