There is something I'd like to say
"Shut up kid, you're in the way"
Check in 9:00 AM, it's time to work
I am the new sales clerk
[Repeat]

Good morning sir, here is your change.
Have a good day (this is a pain!)
What's the use of working this store
When people are such a bore?

I'm treated like a number
What a waste of my summer!
Good morning sir, here is your change
Have a good day (this is a pain!)

[Repeat Verse 2]

I'm on time - is there something wrong?
I'm working hard and for SO long
Can't you see I'm doing something right?
Yeah, I know, it's inventory time
