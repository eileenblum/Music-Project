The Joke's On You!
The Joke's On You!
The Joke's On You!
The Joke's On You!

It all started when I went to school
You were playing me as the fool

I laugh
We laugh
I laugh... at you!

Screaming at me, you're wasting my time
Your opinion is not worth a dime
I've been waiting for this day so long
That's why I'm writing this song

I laugh
We laugh
I laugh... at you!

Because The Joke's On You!
