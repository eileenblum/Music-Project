I don't know what it is
Inside me it takes the grip
Never letting go, it plays its game
Scrambling your mind, you're now trained

I try to stop it but!
It won't go away, I'm in its rut
God! Please try to spare me!
Take my soul and set it free

It won't leave me be
How can you set it free?
Please help me Lord
Spare my life, pull up on the cord

Give me the chance to live
The chance that I dreamt
The chance to give
If I knew for sure
I'd Spare The Pain, that I endured

I pray to God
For His help
What is wrong?
Only He can tell
[Repeat]

Why can't this just go away?
Is this the reason I have to pay?
What's there to hold me back?
Is this the way to keep intact?

I don't know what's going on
The life of God, please, don't be gone
[Repeat]
