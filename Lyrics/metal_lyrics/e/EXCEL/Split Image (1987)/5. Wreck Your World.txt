[Verse 1:]
Visions of your love...
Drew me closer, I couldn't get enough
The presence of your hate...
Gave me the dreams, in which I relate

[Chorus:]
You got the right to make up your mind
You're livin' your own free will
But if you start to mess with my head
I'll go in after to kill

[Verse 2:]
Said that you loved me!
Obviously lying - it's easy
That's all I can take
For you now, your life is at stake

[Chorus 2:]
You got the right to make up your mind
You're livin' your own free will
But if you start to mess with my head
I'll go in for the kill

I don't care what I'm in your eyes
Wreck Your World
I don't care what I'm in your eyes
Wreck Your World
