All I wanted was the best
All of this was a test
Gave all I had, gave my love
Now you just push and shove

[Chorus:]
You pretend things do work
In the end one is hurt
Put you through the blasting hell
We are EXCEL

I tried so hard to make things last
Now we know we went too fast
Can you see this must halt?
All I know - it's your fault

[Chorus:]
I'm insecure
I'm insecure
I'm insecure
I'm insecure
[Repeat twice]

[Repeat Verse 1]

[Chorus]
