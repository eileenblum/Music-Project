First pretend that you care
Then you turn and declare
That you're not with me
Where does that lead thee?

You became my enemy
How can I stand free
Your clone is so cruel
Now I'm Looking For You

[Chorus]
Looking For You!
Looking For You!
Looking For You!
Looking For You!

[Repeat Verse 1]

Why must you have to change?
You are what they say
My heart is no fool
Now I'm Looking For You
