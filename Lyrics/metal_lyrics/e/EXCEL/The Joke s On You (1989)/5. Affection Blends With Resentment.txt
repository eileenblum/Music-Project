[Verse 1:]
What I see is hypnotize
The things I see are paralyzed
You never tend to emphasize
My views of love have no disguise
[Repeat]

[Verse 2:]
Give and take seems to rule
Never again will I be fooled
Give and take seems to rule
Never again will I be fooled

Affection blends with resentment
Affection blends with resentment

[Verse 3:]
I won't let you fool me
Can't you see I control my own life
Can't you see I control my own life

[Chorus:]
Affection always blends
Affection always blends
Affection always blends
Affection always blends

Pain never ends
Pain never ends
Pain never ends
Pain never ends

You lied
You lie to me now
