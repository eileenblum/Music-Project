[Verse 1:]
He's walking in the dark
The dogs begin to bark
Through the window he looked at you
Now there's nothing you can do

[Chorus:]
He is on a state of depression
We compound to his alienation

[Verse 2:]
The Stranger lives far away
No one wants him here to stay
Disappointment, fear and hate
Is what he relates

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
No one - knows who he is
No one - knows where he lives
No one - knows the danger
No one - knows the stranger

[Repeat Chorus]

[Repeat Verse 3]

[Verse 4:]
He can be your dad
He can be your neighbor
Even you can end up
Like The Stranger...

You that I am living in a trapped buried life
I need some help, you turn away, you deny
I feel so lonely, I know I need to move on
I've lost my house and home through the system
So if the system works, has it banned me?
Living on the street with nothing to eat
I had a family who now shames me
No second chances, no way to be free
With some of us, our stories may vary
The bottom line is, love is necessary
I drill to you, I ask for no pity
Just don't ignore, the homeless in your city
