[Verse 1:]
At one time, we tried to run away
It was a time, of love and hate
After a while, things begin to change
Now our minds, do not relate

[Verse 2:]
Look high, look low
That's what you've been doing
To figure out
What has happened

[Chorus:]
Given questions, there no answers
Given questions, there no answers

[Verse 3:]
I said lack, don't you mess with this
The question was there and we answered it
I said lack, don't you mess with this
The question was there and we answered it

Repeat Verse 2

[Repeat Chorus]

Just look around
There is nothing
Just look around
For what it is worth
Just look around
There is nothing

[Repeat Verse 1]

[Repeat Chorus]
