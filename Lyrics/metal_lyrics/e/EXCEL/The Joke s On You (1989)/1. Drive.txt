[Intro:]
You need drive
(you need drive, you need drive)
To survive
(to survive, to survive)
That's no jive
(that's no jive, that's no jive)
You need drive

[Verse 1:]
You're kicking back no one's home
Feeling sorry, grab the phone
You have no friends you realize
You gotta start with some drive

[Chorus:]
You need drive to survive
That's no jive, you need drive

[Verse 2:]
Tomorrow is another day
Well tomorrow was yesterday
What it take to get you movie'
I got my cables, now your groovin'

[Repeat Chorus]

[Repeat Intro]

Drive!
