[Intro:]
I base my life like a raging flame of events that seem all to much the same
And I'm aware of my behavior
Have I realized that I'm my own savior

[Verse 1:]
I'm losing much of my mind
I'm wasting all of my time
I'm almost over the edge
Please push me off this hell edge
And I'm aware of the things
I knew that exist in my head
Meditate, revelate
I say a prayer by my bed

[Chorus 1:]
Tapping, Tapping, Tapping

[Verse 2:]
I sailed across the seas
For soul identity
The only soul I found
Protect my feet from the ground
And I'm aware of the things
I know exist in my head
Meditate, revelate
I say a prayer by my bed

[Repeat Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
Look in your mind - Tapping
See what I find - Tapping
When it is true - Tapping
When I see you - Tapping

[Verse 3:]
I ran away from my fears
I will not cry any tears
You might see that I'm right
That dream might be in sight
Now we all need something
To help us through thick and thin
Now get up, now get out
That's what I've been doin'

[Repeat Chorus 1]
