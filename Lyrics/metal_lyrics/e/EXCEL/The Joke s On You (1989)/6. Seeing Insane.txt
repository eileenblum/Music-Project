[Verse 1:]
Seaing insane
What is there to see?
Does it make sense?
What does it mean?

[Chorus:]
You can hear it
You can feel it
You can see it

[Verse 2:]
Beautiful sky crying to die
Beautiful seas cry tearfully
Strollin' the beach
All the waste comes in
That's all you see
Marine life dies
God's creations die chemically

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Look at our dying world
I'd rather die before
Life takes it toll
I'd rather die before
Look at our dying world
I'd rather die before
Life takes it toll
I'd rather die before
I'd rather die before

I just don't know why...
