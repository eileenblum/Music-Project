[Verse 1:]
So beautiful, so bright
Once upon a time, I was right
You knew everything, Yes, you did
You know nothing, so place your bid

[Chorus:]
You're Fired
You're Fired
That's right you're fired

[Verse 2:]
You have weak friends
That's right
Maybe it's time you learn
How to fight

[Chorus:]
You're Fired
You're Fired
You're Fired

[Verse 3:]
What do you want from me?
I'm sorry for my honesty
Self-Infliction is your game
For your ago that's pretty lame
You must accept who you are
If you do, you'll go far
Knowledge is your key to life
No one's there with a knife
You're no young, why you trip?
When you're old you will flip
Feeling bad, feeling good
Can you stop, I wish you would
You say to me, save your breath
Keep it up, welcome death
You say to me, save your breath
Keep it up, welcome death

[Chorus:]
You're Fired
That's right, You're Fired
You're Fired

[Verse 4:]
Feeling lonely
Dying slowly
You have got nowhere to turn
Speaking to you
Can't get through you
You have blocked the outside world...
