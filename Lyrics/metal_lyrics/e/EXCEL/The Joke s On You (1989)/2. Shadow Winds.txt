[Verse 1:]
They say that a shadow is a reflection of your soul
Searching for the starting line where the winds have blown

They say - that you can't even
They say - learn to know
They say - if you want believe
They say - let your feelings go

Shadow Winds
Shadow Winds, start to blow
Shadow Winds
Shadow Winds, the place to go

[Chorus 1:]
Can't conceive - what I believe
Shadow Winds - you won't receive
Can't conceive - what I believe
Shadow Winds - You won't receive

[Verse 2:]
Shadow Winds go on and on
Your at war with your own con
Soul searching is what you do
Keep your hope and keep your crew

[Chorus 2:]
Shadow Winds blow on and on
Blazing force with a blazing cause
Shadow Winds blow far beyond
Your identity

[Verse 3:]
When it comes to the bottom line
Go beyond where the sun does shine
Shining bright so you can see
The sun's warmth will set you free

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 4:]
Living in a world of confusion
To be yourself is my law
Just because socially you rule
It becomes your biggest flaw
I never thought you would listen
Surprises are all welcomed
I'm glad to see that you have found yourself
And that happens pretty seldom

[Repeat Verse 3]

[Repeat Chorus] 2
