[Originally released by The Police]

Just a cast-away, an island lost at sea, oh
Another lonely day, with no one here but me, oh
More loneliness than any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair, oh

[Chorus:]
I'll send an S.O.S. to the world
I'll send an S.O.S. to the world
I hope that someone gets my...
I hope that someone gets my...
I hope that someone gets my...
...Message in a bottle, oh-oh
...Message in a bottle

A year has passed since I wrote my note
But I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep me together
Love can mend your life but love only break your heart

[Repeat Chorus]

Sending out at an S.O.S.
Sending out at an S.O.S.
Sending out at an S.O.S.
Sending out at an S.O.S.
Sending out at an S.O.S.
Sending out at an S.O.S.
