Intro:
Blaze Some Hate
Blaze Some Hate
Blaze Some Hate
Blaze Some Hate

[Verse 1:]
You - are a fiend
Have - no self-esteem
Lost - your only hope
Faith - begin to cope

[Verse 2:]
Shoot up in your arm
Big rush forgotten harm
No love fills your heart
Our hate

[Chorus 1:]
Drain your mind, by the dime
Losing hope, cannot cope
Your body hurts, your brain is burnt
Drain your mind, by the dime

[Chorus 2:]
I know what it's like
I know what it's like
Put your faith in me
Put your faith in me

[Chorus 1:]
Drain your mind, by the dime
Losing hope, cannot cope

[Repeat Chorus 2]

[Verse 3:]
I want to help you
Why are you screaming?
I want to help you
Why are you screaming?
Sit back and watch you fry
So sad, I won't cry
Sit back and watch you fry
So sad, I won't cry

[Repeat 1st Verse]
