Riding the sky through the thunderstorm
Cross the hills in a sleepless night
Can you see the sky turning to black
Ruling the lands with the crown of hell
Seal the fate of the faithless one
Evil is your nay to rule their lives

Can you see your blackened heart
Dance with fire, under the sign of the blade

It's your destiny, to defend the walls of your mind
It's your destiny, to avenge the death of your heart
It's your destiny, evil take command of your eyes
It's your destiny, Ruler of the night

Victims are falling under your blade
Feel no fear, never shed no tears
It's your right to reign, born of the night
No one can stops you, nobody can
Endless ride for a restless king
Will you hear the tales of the unborn

Can you see your blackened heart
Dance with fire, under the sign of the blade

It's your destiny, to defend the walls of your mind
It's your destiny, to avenge the death of your heart
It's your destiny, evil take command of your eyes
It's your destiny, ruler of the night

Once there was a fallen angel, legend of the underworld
Rider of the thunderstorm, the lord of the night
Bring eternal death through tire, blood red eyes and shining steel
Rider of the thunderstorm, the lord of fate

It's your destiny, to defend the walls of your mind
It's your destiny, to avenge the death of your heart
It's your destiny, evil take command of your eyes
It's your destiny, Ruler of the night
