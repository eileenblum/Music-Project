Politic power, the end of mankind
Death at the touch of a button
Nuclear weapons, bound to explode
All fear holocaust of fire

Fire, Death, War, Merciless genocide
Terror, Plague, Blood, Nuclear war

Can you see the skyfall, heading to chaos
Sirens of death are calling, doomsday has come

Terror is rising, the sky's turning black
Mass destruction and holy wars
No mercy, no remorse, just pain and fear
Facing the fall of humanity

Fire, Death, War, Merciless genocide
Terror, Plague, Blood, Nuclear war

Can you see the skyfall, heading to chaos
Sirens of death are calling, doomsday has come
Screaming gods of war, weapons on fire
It's time to end your lives

Toxic pollution, warnings from hell
Fire is coming up from the sky
All fear the sound of the sirens of death
All fear the rape of humanity

Fire, Death, War, Merciless genocide
Terror, Plague, Blood, Nuclear war

Can you see the skyfall, heading to chaos
Sirens of death are calling, doomsday has come
Screaming gods of war, weapons on fire
It's time to end your lives
