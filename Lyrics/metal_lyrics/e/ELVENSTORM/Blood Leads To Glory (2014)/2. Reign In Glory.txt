Age of reign has now been born
Sow the wind, harvest the storm
You crossed my way when I was down
Now you crawl before my throne
Reach for powers that you can't crush
My will is done, and the crowd joined us
We're growing fierce
And all haters cannot break us

I found my way
Glorious and proud I will remain

Walking straight into the light
No more tears and no more rage
My soul leaves this place of fight
And I can see, my dead enemies
The victory is mine, the last in line
As a king I walk in the hall of the brave
This is my fate

I know I put the scars on you
You're branded by the seal of shame
Our clan expect your revenge
Even if you're never be height
Now the time has come for us
Unite to fight, we are immortal
We'll kill you all
We've make oath to be victorious

I found my way
Glorious and proud I will remain

Walking straight into the light
No more tears and no more rage
My soul leaves this place of fight
And I can see, my dead enemies
The victory is mine, the last in line
As a king I walk in the hall of the brave
This is my fate
