By the mark of the beast
Blessed by the spell of the black
All hell's breaking loose
We'll take out your life
Hunting and hide in the night
Through unholy rites
The omen of death is on you
We'll curse you all until you fall
We worship the realm of the dark
Mistress from hell, unholy spell

As we steal your soul
And we take control
Possess your mind with the devil inside
As we steal your soul
And we take control
Queens of the night we are born in the dark

Lost souls of the dead
Calling the spirits of hell, cursed by our spell
Call of the unlight
Poison your blood and your soul, bring sins to the world
Your wounds will burn into the night
Torment and pain that still remains
They call us the specters of doom
Mistresses from hell, an unholy spell

As we steal your soul
And we take control
Possess your mind with the devil inside
As we steal your soul
And we take control
Queens of the night we are born in the dark
