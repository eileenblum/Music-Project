I believed in you, I hoped so hard to save your hateful souls
I wanted to heal your broken hearts
But my struggle was doomed
I let your words invade my mind, to forget who I really was
But when I was at the lowest, I resurrect and I resist

Remember who I am
Glory crown my head
I'm proud of what I am
I'll not let my voice be tamed
I stand in front of you
Your blank stares doesn't scare me
I'll not change to please you
I will fight until my death

I was just a stranger when have chosen me to be a king
Proud and brave I'm devoted to you
Fighting like a lion
But it wasn't enough and you have been ruthless and vicious
Since that day, I'm made of stone
And nobody will make me fall

Remember who I am
Glory crown my head
I'm proud of what I am
I'll not let my voice be tamed
I stand in front of you
Your blank stares doesn't scare me
I'll not change to please you
I will fight until my death

Remember who I am
Glory crown my head
I'm proud of what I am
I'll not let my voice be tamed
I stand in front of you
Your blank stares doesn't scare me
I'll not change to please you
I will fight until my death
