We have this will to kill
True metal army, unchained the beast
Suffer to return harder
To kill on sight the ones who deceived
The time has come for us
To break our chains and scream our hate
Charging on into the fray
Soldiers of hate, well find our way

Feel the might - Black Hordes
Raise your blades - Black Hordes
It's time to fight

The smell of blood is in the air
Torment and rage, consume their souls
The enemies fall to the blood
I heard the sword's song, the steel in their chest
I impale your heart of viper
You understand that this is the end
I have your life in my hands
Rocked to sleep through the sounds of hate

Feel the might - Black Hordes
Raise your blades - Black Hordes
It's time to fight

Believe in your destiny
The flame inside you'll never fade
We march into the light
In hope and faith, my mind is clear
Feel the power of your soul
Emancipate from betrayal
We walk among the just
I have no fear, I shed no tears

Feel the might - Black Hordes
Raise your blades - Black Hordes
It' time to fight
