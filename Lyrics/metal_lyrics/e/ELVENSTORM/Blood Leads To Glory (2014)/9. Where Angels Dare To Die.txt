Stand at the gates, in a cold winter hell
No God on their side but brothers in arms
They remember their lands
On the march of the damned
Ready to fight in the hall of the brave

Death in their eyes, as their blood turns to ice
Marching to hell on the tunes of the damned
There will be no retreat
But they call it defeat
Phantom battalions descend to the grave

Blood in the snow, when their dreams fade away
Bombshell attack in the wall of despair
Bullets will fly
Straight to the sky
Lifeless their bodies lies frozen to death

Cold is the end, when you're far from your land
Falling as one on the tunes of the damned
Without glory they fell
In this cold winter hell
Phantom battalions descend to the grave

They fell as brothers
Where even angels dare to die
They stood together
Where even angels dare to die
All damned forever
Where even angels dare to die
Remains forever
Where even angels dare to die
