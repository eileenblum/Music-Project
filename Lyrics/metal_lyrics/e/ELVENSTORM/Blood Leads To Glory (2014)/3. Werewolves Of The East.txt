Pale moon, fading starlight
Shadows fall in endless sorrow
She-wolf, Mother Russia
Has your greatness left behind
Cold steel, gates of tire
Werewolf legion march to the dawn
Tsar falls, throne dismembered
Death and terror, reign in blood

Here comes the wind of revolution
Wolves of the East
Winter tears for the freedom crown
Hell awaits the fallen one
Here comes the riders of destruction
Wolves of the East
Bringing a vengeance to the streets
Poetry of a wounded beast

Deals death, age of terror
Howling wolves, proud in the cold
Bloodstained, clashing chains
Volga's cry for bleeding hearts

Here comes the wind of revolution
Wolves of the East
Winter tears for the freedom crown
Hell awaits the fallen one
Here comes the riders of destruction
Wolves of the East
Bringing a vengeance to the streets
Poetry of a wounded beast
