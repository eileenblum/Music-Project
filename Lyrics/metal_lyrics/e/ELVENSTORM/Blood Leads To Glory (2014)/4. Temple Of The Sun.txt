Look to the sky, and you fall to your knees
I'm the voice of your saviour
Don't be afraid, the end of time is near
I'll guide your souls in the storm

You lose control, the devil prowls around you
So close your eyes and come on
To temple of the sun

Brothers and sisters, I'm your light on the dark road
Follow me and you will see
I hold the truth, your questions will be answered
Your soul will find eternal peace

You lose control, the devil prowls around you
So close your eyes and come on
To temple of the sun

The time has come
You kneel in the circle
The last ritual can begin
Listen my voice
And drink this divine poison
The answer is at your lips

Victims of fate, you sacrificed your blood
Cause you are the chosen ones
I've saved your souls, thanks to me you rest in peace
Now God's will is accomplished

You lose control, the devil prowls around you
So close your eyes and come on
To temple of the sun
