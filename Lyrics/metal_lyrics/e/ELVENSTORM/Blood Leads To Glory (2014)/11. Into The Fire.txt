[originally by Savage Grace]Too many battles I've seen, my hell never ending
So many dreams of good men they never shall dream
Life after life has gone by, without ever taking
The road to the meaning of what, of what it all means

So don't stand in our way. Die for our sins.
Cry for our souls
We choose our own fate. Answer to none.

Defy Them all
We'll dare to go
Into The Fire. Into The Fire.

We show no remorse for the deeds of death and destruction
The call that we heed, let us fight without fear
The glorious victories we won can not satisfy me
For I know the next day's attack just might be my last

Too many battles I've seen, my hell never ending
So many dreams of good men they never shall dream
The glorious victories we won can not satisfy me
For I know the next day's attack just might be my last
