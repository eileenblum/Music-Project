Time standing still in these cold ancient halls
Hide in the shadows of skulls on the wall
They are crying, spirits of the dead
Crypts of despair on the circle of hell
Dark well of souls are now growing the spell
They are standing here, witches of the night

Drown by infinity, Cursed by eternity

Midnight they lead, unholy breed
Brides of hell they're calling
Blood is their wine, travel the time
Through the ruins of sorrow
Crossing the shadows, deep in the hole
Possessed by torment of madness
Drink to the devil, pray for my soul
Greeting the powers of evil lives

Darkness descend with the black whores of death
Unchain at last in our world as they fell
They are crying, spirits of the dead
Is it the price of this old sacrifice
Bloodlust and witchery break down the ice
We are riding out, to reach for the light

Hell to fight, screaming right
The stake is now enlightening
Hell to fight, burn them right
The witches end in sorrow
The stake is where they follow
To hell and underworld we leave
