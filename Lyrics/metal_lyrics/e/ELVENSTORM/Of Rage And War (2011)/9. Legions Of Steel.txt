Out in the streets, weâre marching to Hell
Spreading the call, weâre ringing the bell
True raging steel, faster than Light
Crossing the shadows, Immortal we are

Over the seas, weâve come to your lands
Hearts made of steel, we will fight to the end
Bounded by blood, iron and chains
Heavy metal is the only command

This is our way to live into the underground
Forever hail the metal Gods

We are back, we are back
We are the holy guardians
We are back, we are back
We are the Heavy Metal light

Ride, with our fists high in the air
We are charging everywhere
From heaven to hell we dare to fight
Rise, to the stages in the light
We are warriors of the night
To unleashed the flame who burns inside

This is our way to live into the underground
Forever hail the metal Gods

We are back, we are back
We are the holy guardians
We are back, we are back
We are the Heavy Metal light

We are the ones, who stand for the wild
Stronger than ever we never decay
Immortal we are, the Legions of Steel
For Heavy Metal weâve gave our life
