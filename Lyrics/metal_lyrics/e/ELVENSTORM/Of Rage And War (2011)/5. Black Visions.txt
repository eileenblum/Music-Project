Fear and confusion, evil illusions
Infinite eons of dream
Candles are burning, witches are dancing
Wake up or not, will I scream
Demon desire, trail of disaster
Delay the death for a while
Trapped in this hell, sleep in a spell
Break out, the choice now is mine

Fear running wild into my head, itâs right
Dream in black
Escape or try to fight the endless night
The nightmare tries to steal the holy light
Dream in fright
Awaken visions of eternal night

Cold walls behind you, shadows defy you
Deep down weâre marching to die
Awake from eternal, claws of the devil
A torment of hell feeds my cries
Travel the nine plains, dream in a black rain
Born in the flames of the night
True evil lies, burning the skies
Through dreams and unholy light

Fear running wild into my head, itâs right
Dream in black
Escape or try to fight the endless night
The nightmare tries to steal the holy light
Dream in fright
Awaken visions of eternal night
