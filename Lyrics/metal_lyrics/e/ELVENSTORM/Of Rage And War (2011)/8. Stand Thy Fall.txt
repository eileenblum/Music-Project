Steel
Crawls in my Veins
Breaking the Chains
Outbreak of Madness is coming to blowing the walls
through the night,
Scream to the light
Burning the Bridges behind me to leave no retreat to be Free

No One can tell if Heaven is Hell
No One can sell my life for a day
Time to be free, to fly for a kingdom to come
Stand Thy Fall

Call
Thunder to roar,
Of Rage and War
Pounding the hammer of doom in the hall of the Brave
for the Gods
Lead us to fight
Burning the Bridges behind me to leave no retreat to be Free

No One can tell if Heaven is Hell
No One can sell my life for a day
Time to be free, to fly for a kingdom to come
Stand Thy Fall
