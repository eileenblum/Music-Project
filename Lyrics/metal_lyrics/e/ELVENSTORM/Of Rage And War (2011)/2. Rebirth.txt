Riding on the wings of time, waiting for Salvation
Innocence and clarity, Chained in a devotion
Endless dreams in endless nights, nothing but Illusion
Another world another time, just a new damnation

Waiting for my rebirth, far beyond the void

Here comes the rain again,
A chance to start again
A new tomorrow for a better life
Iâm gonna break these chains,
Into the sea of pain
The time has come to fly forevermore

I lost control of my own soul, the light I will follow
Trapped inside insanity, the rain wash all my sorrow
Nights of fear finish here, greet a new tomorrow
Another reason to exist, to live the dream I saw

Fly to the gates of Dawn, to the leading light

Here comes the rain again,
A chance to start again
A new tomorrow for a better life
Iâm gonna break these chains,
Into the sea of pain
The time has come to fly forevermore

Forget the past, forget the pain, Living for Tomorrow
I am the one, a heart of pain, which you bring salvation
Youâre the light, through endless night,
The one I have to follow
I take your hand, âtil the end, a new destination

Flying on wings of love
A Heart who once has cried
