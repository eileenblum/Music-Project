Rise from hell, back from the dead
Heart full of fear, distress and pain
Here comes the time when you fear my return
Itâs your turn to die

Raise the sword, wielding the axe
Spilling the blood and the bastards will fall
Breaking their bones as I spit at their face
And hear them cry

Iâll build a fire where burns the betrayers
Donât take me down, never even try

Iâve seen my life in the ashes of time
Donât break me down
Iâll burn the sky to avenge all their lies
Fear my revenge, when death is my name
Iâve seen my life in the ashes of time
Donât break me down
Iâll burn and destroy, deliver my hate
Iâll kill the deceivers in pain

Hang them high, pay for your lies
Facing the truth with no more disguise
Blood in my hand you will soon feel my pain
And cry to the sky

Iâll build a fire where burns the betrayers
Donât take me down, never even try

Iâve seen my life in the ashes of time
Donât break me down
Iâll burn the sky to avenge all their lies
Fear my revenge, when death is my name
Iâve seen my life in the ashes of time
Donât break me down
Iâll burn and destroy, deliver my hate
Iâll kill the deceivers in pain
