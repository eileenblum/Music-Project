March through the storm, on cold winds of war.
Ride through the mist, to battle them all.
Steel on our side, weâre horsemen of thunder.
And I feel in me, the increase of power.
Into the rage of the slaughter weâre fighting.
Weâre humble and strong, the glory is here.
Armies of evil are dancing and killing.
Sword in my hand, I fight the fear.

Die, by my steel, I want kill
Adders who would like taking my life
And I fight, through the light
My noble destiny isnât to die
Oh I cry, all my friends
My brothers in arms who are falling
I want bring, my great might
Into this dark and bloody fight

Under my blade, they fall one by one.
Ashes and death carry me down.
To âBlack Deathâ I ride to reach my reward.
Storming the gates and praise the warlord.
Blood leads to glory, the call of destruction.
Evil I fight, with anger and pride.
Heroic madness, a tale of devotion.
The end is near, all plays tonight.

Die, by my steel, I want kill
Adders who would like taking my life
And I fight, through the light
My noble destiny isnât to die
Oh I cry, all my friends
My brothers in arms who are falling
I want bring, my great might
Into this dark and bloody fight
