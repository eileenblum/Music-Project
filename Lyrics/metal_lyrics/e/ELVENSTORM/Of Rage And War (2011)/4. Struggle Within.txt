I donât want your hand this time, I will save myself
You play with my nerves so, would it be the end?
I really try to fight, I wonât surrender
You want to test my might by the dark whispers

My struggle within has begun
I try not hear their voices
I donât want to lose control

Let me fight again
Let me expel my pain
I want to break my chains
So watch my eyes and see the flames
I donât be afraid
Itâs not time for the endgame
My revenge is a razor
Ready to bleed all betrayers

Are you ready to suffer, these nightmares over me?
Itâs you my prisoner, I like these empathy
Fate is cruel or ironic but everything is paid
Carved in your memory these words in your head:

Let me fight again
Let me expel my pain
I want to break my chains
So watch my eyes and see the flames
I donât be afraid
Itâs not time for the endgame
My revenge is a razor
Ready to bleed all betrayers
