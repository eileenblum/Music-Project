Paint the sky with blood tonight, I feel my end is near
My will to live has fallen, drowned into my Tears
The Chains of torment enslaved my soul,
Death is just my throne
I will break the spell of my life, I know Iâll die alone

Behind the gates of Hell, Iâll find my Paradise

I left the path of heaven
Deep from withinâ I reach the end
My life is a lake of Ice
Trapped behind so many lies
I left path of heaven
Deep from withinâ I reach the end
Now I know I have to fly, like a raven in the sky

I was the master of myself, but now itâs too late
I crawl towards redemption, blinded like a snake
The lies saved what it remains of me, that my soul rest in peace
Carved in stone my end is sealed as I fell on my knees

The hands of God has failed and led me to my grave

I left the path of heaven
Deep from withinâ I reach the end
My life is a lake of Ice
Trapped behind so many lies
I left path of heaven
Deep from withinâ I reach the end
Now I know I have to fly, like a raven in the sky

Behind the gates of Hell, Iâll find my Paradise

I left the path of heaven
Deep from withinâ I reach the end
My life is a lake of Ice
Trapped behind so many lies
I left path of heaven
Deep from withinâ I reach the end
Now I know I have to fly, like a raven in the sky
