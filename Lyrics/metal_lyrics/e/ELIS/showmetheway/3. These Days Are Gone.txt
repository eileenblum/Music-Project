I know I'm wrong
My house is not a home
I'm not so strong
I will be lost alone

You know you're wrong
You'll never be alone
You will be strong
Your heart will find a home

I always remember the days in the sun
These days are gone

On that day
On that day I saw your face
Lightened up from deep inside
My heart longs
My heart longs for your embrace

My deepest fear
Is to lose my maid
I can't stay here
I am so afraid
I know you fear
You'll never lose your maid
If you stay here
You don't have to be afraid

I always remember the days in the sun
These moments are treasures
But now they are gone
I always remember the days in the sun
These days are gone

On that day
On that day I saw your face
Lightened up from deep inside
My heart longs
My heart longs for your embrace
My soul revealed, no need to hide
