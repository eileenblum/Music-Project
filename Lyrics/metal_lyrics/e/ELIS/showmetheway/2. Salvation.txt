Salvation
Please free our body, mind and soul
Salvation
Is what we are longing for

I hear them screaming for salvation
Our sinful bodies have to be destroyed
We will create a divine new nation
The old world order has to be destroyed

I will be your leader will you follow me
Yes we will
To the land where everyone will be free
We'll be free

Salvation
Please free our body, mind and soul
Salvation
Is what we are longing for

Through me they'll come to revelation
We have to free our captured souls
I'm the one who'll guide them to liberation
The eternal truth shall be our highest goal

In the moment of pain will you hold my hand
Yes we will
I will lead you to the promised land
The promised land

Salvation
Please free our body, mind and soul
Salvation
Is what we are longing for
