[Vocals by Sandra Schleret]

It was a hard way to get here
But now it seems so clear

I'll find everything inside of me

Mind body and soul
Life love and healing
Connect be connected
Nine words to change your whole life

O mother, keeper of eternal truth

You show me the way
You show me that everything I ever need in my whole life
Lies there inside of me

Feeling useless and ashamed
I was the one to blame
Thought there's nothing good inside of me

Mind body and soul
Life love and healing
Connect be connected
Nine words to change your whole life

Oh mother, seekers find truth in you

You show me the way,
You show me that everything lies there inside of me

You show me the way
You show me that everything I ever need in my whole life
Lies there inside of me
