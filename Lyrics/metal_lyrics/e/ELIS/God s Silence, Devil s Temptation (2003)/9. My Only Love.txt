I'm a lonely stranger 
In this world of pain

In my darkest hour 
I'm alone
Why did you leave me 

But one day
I will find you 
My heart and soul 
My only love 

Wandering through the fields 
Of disease 
Can you hear me calling 

Searching for a heart 
Which heals my wounds 

I'm not going to lose
My faith in love 
Just because you left me 

But one day
I will find you 
My heart and soul 
My only love
