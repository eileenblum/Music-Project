Don't weep
Just see
Come here
Call me 
Just follow
No sorrow
You're there
Where you belong

It's where you belong
Don't you see
When memories are gone
Sent to be free 

Always be aware 
Of your memories 
They do appear when you can't bear 

It's where you belong
Don't you see
When memories are gone
Sent to be free 

Mean and cruel 
They drive you in 
Forget them all 
And you will win

It's where you belong
Don't you see
When memories are gone
Sent to be free
