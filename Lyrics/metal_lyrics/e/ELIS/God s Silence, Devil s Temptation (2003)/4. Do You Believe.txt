Each night I lie in my bed 
And I think about it 
Oh my dark friend 
Can you give me an answer 

The people that we love
We cannot understand 
Every day the people that we love are hurt 
The people who we love 
And cannot understand
We cannot understand 

Do you believe we're the children of a God
Do you believe 
Or do you believe we're left here all alone
Do you believe 

I have this question
What is it for 
This poor life 
We live down here

Is there a power all above 
A person so called God 
So called God 
Who plans our life 
Or is it our free will 
The creator of our life 
Are we responsible 

The people that we love
We cannot understand 
Every day the people that we love are hurt 
The people who we love 
And cannot understand
We cannot understand 

Do you believe we're the children of a God
Do you believe 
Or do you believe we're left here all alone
Do you believe
