What did you do
You're guilty
You have to die
We'll find you
Everywhere
Vengeance

Why do you torture me
My mind is in despair
Why do you punish me
For a crime I never committed

Why am I all alone
No one who hears my crying
Why do you want to kill me
For a crime l never committed

Blood, Murder, Vengeance
Now we have you
Now you have to die

[REF]
Lords of the darkness
Phantoms and demons
The devil's temptation
The child will stay innocent
Struggling for life
It's the end of the dark times

Why do you call for me
I'm not the one you look for
Why do you think I'm guilty
Of this crime I never committed

Why is no one at my side
In the hour of my downfall
Why do l have to die
For a crime l never committed

Blood, Murder, Vengeance
Now we have you
Now you have to die

[REF]
Lords of the darkness
Phantoms and demons
The devil's temptation
The child will stay innocent
Struggling for life
It's the and of the dark times
