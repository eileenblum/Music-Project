A child is born
Out of the womb of a mother 
Who didn't want it 
It happened in a night
Of drunken passion and no thought 
About the consequence

Two bodies cling together 
Drunken loneliness 
Two bodies cling together 
Blind passion
Two bodies cling together 

And then it starts to grow
This little baby child 
This unwanted life 
Don't you know it has to prove 
During its whole life 
That it has a right to exist 

Two bodies cling together 
Mindless heat
Two bodies cling together 
Cruel lust
Two bodies cling together 

And then it starts to grow
This little baby child 
This unwanted life 
Don't you know it has to prove 
During its whole life 
That it has a right to exist 

A child is born
Out of the womb of a mother 
Who didn't want it 
It happened in a night
Of drunken passion and no thought 
About the consequence
