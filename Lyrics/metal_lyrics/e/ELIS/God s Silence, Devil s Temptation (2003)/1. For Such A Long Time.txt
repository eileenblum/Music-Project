My heart's filled with loneliness and pain
Lying in my lover's arms, 
I hear him breathe and I can feel
The beating of his heart 

His hand caresses my skin 
And he whispers words of love 
He's sleeping in my arms and I can feel
Loneliness in my heart 

He only reminds me of you
So I do all the things with him
For such a long time 

For such a long time

He tells me it's a dream coming true 
And I wish it would be your voice 
For such a long time 

I take what I can get, can't be alone 
I need someone beside me now 
His strong arms hold me close and I can feel 
His love from deep inside

I'm looking in his eyes deep as the sea 
I know I'll hurt him bad 
He's giving all he has and I can feel
No love for him right now 

He only reminds me of you
So I do all the things with him
For such a long time 

For such a long time

He tells me it's a dream coming true 
And I wish it would be your voice 
For such a long time
