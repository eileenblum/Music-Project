Past the hamlet
The soft orphan gleans some scanty ears
Her eyes graze roundly
And golden in the dusk
And her lap
Waits for the heavenly groom

How sad this evening is

I'm a shadow
Far away of sinister villages
I drank God's silence 
Of the grove's well

As they returned
The shepherds found her sweet body
Decayed in the thorn bush 
Cold metal gets at my brow
Spiders search for my heart
It's a light switched off in my mouth

How sad this evening is

I'm a shadow
Far away of sinister villages
I drank God's silence 
Of the grove's well

I found myself on the heath at night
Full of garbage and stardust
Again clinked crystal angels

I'm a shadow
Far away of sinister villages
I drank God's silence 
Of the grove's well
