[bonus track]

Betrayal, you betrayed me
You betrayed me with a kiss
I thought you were my friend
Now I hate you
So much
You betrayed me with a kiss
You never really cared
It turned out to be wrong
So wrong
Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes
Betrayal, you betrayed me
Discussing all the things with you
I told you all my secrets
You told it to the world
And laughed about it
I would have given anything
If you just asked me for
I was too good for you
Too good for you
Now I ask you
Why did it have to be like this
'Cause I miss you
Sometimes
Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes
Betrayal, you betrayed me
You betrayed me with a kiss
I thought you were my friend
Now I hate you
So much
Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes
