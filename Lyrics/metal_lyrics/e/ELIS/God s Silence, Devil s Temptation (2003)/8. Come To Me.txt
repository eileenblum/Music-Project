Out of the darkness you came 
You looked so tired and sad 
I asked where you've been
You answered your voice was quiet
Out in the cold searching for love 
I said you don't have to search for love

Come to me, come to me
Rest your head on my shoulder
Come to me, come to me
Sleep in peace 

Your traveled through the world 
Tasted its food and its love
But never got satisfied
You were always looking for more 
Out in the cold searching for love
I say you don't have to search for love 

Come to me, come to me
Rest your head on my shoulder
Come to me, come to me
Sleep in peace 

I always loved you 
Just come to me
And you'll be at home

Come to me, come to me
Rest your head on my shoulder
Come to me, come to me
Sleep in peace
