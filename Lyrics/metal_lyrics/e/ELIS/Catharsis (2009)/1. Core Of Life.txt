May my tears come falling down at night
Somehow I'll stand up and wipe them aside!

Silence in me -- only my pain beats loud
Shivering -- inner peace broken down
Fear is crawling to the core
But there is a light glowing

Keeping me alive
Inspiring every cell to fight

May my tears come falling down at night
Somehow I'll stand up and wipe them aside
The more the body suffers
The more the soul comes to life
I feel it comes alive, ending endless night

Body tightened -- trying to be strong
Not a hero -- just trying to hold on
Outside worlds fade but inside
A new found core gives me strength

Keeping me alive
(The body's fading -- healing me)
Inspiring every cell to fight

My heart is beating loud...

May my tears come falling down at night
Somehow I'll stand up and wipe them aside
The more the body suffers
The more the soul comes to life
I feel it comes alive, ending endless night

Please end this endless night!
