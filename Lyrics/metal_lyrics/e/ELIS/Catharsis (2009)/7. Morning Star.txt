Temptation:
My mass grows endlessly
Beauty there is to see
But I'm abused, there is no clarity
Defaced what I might be
Defined the grace in me
The sleeping beast throws shadows towards me

Aeon:
The untaught world in silence sleeps
While night and day embrace so deep
Between the line of dawn and dark
Embedded -- a threat waiting for a spark

Fate:
The tears I cry are endlessly
The sorrow I saw burns so eternally
They call on me, no mercy though
For there's no remorse for the fallen ones

Temptation:
There's no light in me
The chance to be
If you reach out and want to see

Morning star:
I rise and shine, whatever comes
Guiding the way through the light of dawn
The darkness I dispel,
Who's willing to awake and see
Will be led to infinity

Aeon:
Years melt away, the mother creeps
Though they seem to be in untroubled sleep
The darkness' sheet drowns a tender weep
Doom crawls up drawn by the storm gathering

Fate:
The sleeping beast fastens it's beat
And destiny loosens the iron leash
Just one more surge and he'll break free
But I take my course to eternity

Morning star:
I rise and shine, whatever comes
Guiding the way through the light of dawn
The morning star outshines the pain
Gleaming in eternal holy flames
The darkness I dispel, who's willing
To awake and see
Will be lead to infinity
