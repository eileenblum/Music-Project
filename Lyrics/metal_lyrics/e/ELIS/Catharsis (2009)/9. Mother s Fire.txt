Time holds breath tonight
Full's the moon -- loud are the howls
She comes to life
Drawn by our longing souls

She lied in wait
For the day to remember her name
Now she awakes
Calling her children back to the flame
We are the children of the fire
We are -- we are the ones born by
The fountain of the light

Fire!
Can you feel the fever!
Our mothers voice bitter sweet
Fire!
The night falls -- her flesh calls
And we start melting within
Fire!
The life quakes -- she's calling
Follow the magic within
Fire!
Embracing the wellspring
Feel the fever of the earth

Wisdom old and true
Breaking through the surfaces' shield
Knowledge evermore
Ties the know that was released

We feel the fire
That was forgotten ages ago
Inspires out minds
Calling her beloved scions back home

Listen... and hear her call
Calling us back home

When the night whispers
I feel her strength rise
All the silent magic
Keeps me alive
So right...

Fire!
Can you feel the fever!
Our mothers voice bitter sweet
Fire!
The night falls -- her flesh calls
And we start melting within
Fire!
The life quakes -- she's calling
Follow the magic within
Fire!
Embracing the wellspring
Feel the fever of the earth
