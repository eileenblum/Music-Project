Your desire is religion
And I lead your mind towards my aim

Lust lies his lips will tell
Seems to be your wishing well
See his smile and in his hands you will give your soul

I abuse your innocent nescience
Your believe pumps power through my veins

But just keep in mind
The twinkling shadow in his mind
(Twinkling shadow)
There -- a scar remained from the truth
He tries to turn inside
(Twinkling shadow)
I know, I know, it's so easy to be blind
(Twinkling shadow)
But please never forget about
The twinkling shadow in his mind
(Twinkling shadow)

Doom!
What he tells to your minds is what you want to hear
He knows what you're wishing, and tightens all your fears
Your weakness gives power to his seducing lies
He takes you and turns you until you fit his plans

I'm the answer to all your craving
Autonomy erased for the masses' "welfare"

But just keep in mind
The twinkling shadow in his mind
(Twinkling shadow)
There -- a scar remained from the truth
He tries to turn inside
(Twinkling shadow)
I know, I know, it's so easy to be blind
(Twinkling shadow)
But please never forget about
The twinkling shadow in his mind
(Twinkling shadow)

But just keep in mind
The twinkling shadow in his mind
(Twinkling shadow)
There -- a scar remained from the truth
He tries to turn inside
(Twinkling shadow)
I know, I know, it's so easy to be blind
(Twinkling shadow)
But please never forget about
The twinkling shadow in his mind
(Twinkling shadow)

...shadow in his eye
...shadow in his eye
...shadow in his eye
