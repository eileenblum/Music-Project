Night falls and dark dreams start rising
They crawl upon me and oppress me silent
Chasing my soul to drink the fear blooming in me -- save me!

And then a flash awakens me
"Alive! Alive!" I scream
Whatever I have seen it crawls after me
(It crawls, it crawls)
The essence of my dream drips into reality -- let me be!
(In the end we're all alone...)

Caught in a dream, there is no escape
(The dark bridge)
When my mind is what's imprisoning me
(You're mine and I am you)
Caught in a dream, they're coming closer
(Wake up, and see)
Set me free!
(You're mine! You're mine!)

Fears become flesh, reality is melting
I drown within the seas of endless horror
Sane no more cold claws solidify and grab at me
And then a flash awakens me
"Alive! Alive" I scream (Alive!)
Whatever I have seen it crawls after me
(It crawls, it crawls)
The essence of my dream drips into reality -- set me free!
(Drips into life -- in the end we're all alone)

Drown in... drown in... me!
Drown in... drown in... me!

Caught in a dream, there is no escape
(The dark bridge)
When my mind is what's imprisoning me
(You're mine and I am you)
Caught in a dream, they're coming closer
(Wake up, and see)
Set me free!
(You're mine! You're mine!)

Caught in a dream, I move in darkness
(The dark Bridge)
There's no escape when
Your mind's the prison
(You're mine, I am you)
Caught in a dream, he's coming closer
(Wake up and see)
Set me free!

Move on...

Caught in a dream, there is no escape
(The dark bridge)
When my mind is what's imprisoning me
(You're mine and I am you)
Caught in a dream, they're coming closer
(Wake up, and see)
Set me free!
(You're mine! You're mine!)

Caught in a dream, I move in darkness
(The dark bridge)
There's no escape when
Your mind's the prison
(You're mine, I am you)
Caught in a dream, he's coming closer
(Wake up and see)
Set me free!

Move on...
