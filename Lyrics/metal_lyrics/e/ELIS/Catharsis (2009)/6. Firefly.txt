I'm a dreamer
I long for holy lands
Wings of dragons
And unicorns that guide my way

I've always believed that magic lies within our minds
(Fairies whisper in the trees, waiting for the night!)
I just close my eyes
Embracing the power of life
(My soul dances with the swarm of the fireflies)

I'm alive, breath in the light
(The fire flies!)
Let life's lightning hit my sleep
(The fire flies!)
Gimme hope, gimme dreams
Tears, love and fears
All my life I longed to see the fireflies

I've always believed that what we are
Is more than we can see
(Unseen bounds are weaved between all the living wights!)
The mystery worlds surround us
There's so much more to be
(My soul dances with the swarm of the fireflies!)

I'm alive, breath in the light
(The fire flies!)
Let life's lightning hit my sleep
(The fire flies!)
Gimme hope, gimme dreams
Tears, love and fears
All my life I longed to see the fireflies

I'm alive, breath in the light
(The fire flies!)
Let life's lightning hit my sleep
(The fire flies!)
Gimme hope, gimme dreams
Tears, love and fears
All my life I longed to see the fireflies
