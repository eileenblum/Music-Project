Fate touched my life
Led you my way --
Within a heartbeat
I was caught by your light

The surface shivered
Unveiled so unexpected beauty
True and fateful bright

You are the thought that covers me tonight
Beautiful soul -- sacred ways of life
Unfold my wings -- reach out for your light
To shelter you from pain tonight

A flare in time
Gathered our souls
As they touched gently
Sacred ways of fate

Love entered my life
So unexpected though so welcome
Living in your eyes

And though I know my fight begins
My soul's melting within

You are the thought that covers me tonight
Beautiful soul -- sacred ways of life
Unfold my wings -- reach out for your light
My heart it breaks for you tonight

My heart steady beats for you (eternal on, eternal on)
No despairing darkness can blind my sight
Show me your colours -- my ray of light...
I'm burning bright -- alive!

You are the thought that covers me tonight
Beautiful soul -- sacred ways of life
Unfold my wings -- reach out for your light
Never forsake -- it's once in a life...
