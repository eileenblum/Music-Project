Come with me...
Through time...
Through a whisper...

This is the land of all magic
This is the warrior's tale
Lost in eternal madness

The lives that I have ended
With a flash of the blade I lead
Have cursed the star that guides me
And darkness fell on me

Dark ones I swore to
Exhausted were my dreams
Now life is unravelling
The last battle inside me!

Weak is my hand
Tired is my mind
The death is my mind
The death knew sings for me
Oh please hold my hand
For no more life I can see
The was that was so clear
Now is hidden in the sea
Of the sorrow I spilled
May death now guard on me...

The eyes of all the slaughtered
They're hunting me by night
A fallen mother's sadness
Hurts deeper than sword strikes

And though my body's armour
Resisted fire and hate
My soul is dying slowly -- fading away...

The last battle inside me!

Weak is my hand
Tired is my mind
The death is my mind
The death knew sings for me
Oh please hold my hand
For no more life I can see
The was that was so clear
Now is hidden in the sea
Of the sorrow I spilled
May death now guard on me...

Fire breeze...

Weak is my hand
Tired is my mind
The death is my mind
The death knew sings for me
Oh please hold my hand
For no more life I can see
The was that was so clear
Now is hidden in the sea
Of the sorrow I spilled
May death now guard on me...
Return with me...
Through time...
Through a whisper...
