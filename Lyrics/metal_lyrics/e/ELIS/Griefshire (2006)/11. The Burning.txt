Burn!
Destroy!
Die!

Now the time has come
To destroy everything we had before
Are you ready for the run
Through a painful river to the other shore

Come with me 'cause I love you
Salvation
O Brother don't you see you crossed the line
I'm waiting with arms wide open
Salvation
Into your arms we run, you shall be our redeemer lead us to salvation

I swear tonight
I'll be the guardian of your fate
For the rest of my life
My dearest maid
Of the ones I loved the most
But I lost them forever now

Oh Mother he killed them all but still
I hear someone crying

StÃ¶hnen und Schreien

You are the only one who's left
My dearest maid

Now the time has come
We destroyed everything we had before
We are already on the run
Through the painful river to the other shore

In my arms you all are dying
Salvation
Oh brother don't leave me forever now
I'm dying 'cause I love you
Salvation
In your arms we burn you are not a redeemer there is no salvation

swear tonight
I'll be the guardian of your fate
For the rest of my life
My dearest maid
Of the ones I loved the most
But I lost them forever now
