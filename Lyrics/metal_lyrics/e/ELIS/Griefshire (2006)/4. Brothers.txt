In a night so long ago
We made this eternal vow

We are brothers
Raised by our mother's loving hand
We are brothers
Forever together we will stand

Since the day that you were born
I felt your special energy
In your body painfully torn
They are too blind they cannot see

We are brothers
Raised by our mother's loving hand
We are brothers
Forever together we will stand

Wherever you go, they listen to you
A perfect body hides a perfect soul
One day to come they'll follow
Eternal truth will be our highest goal

Be aware of your fate
Your future looks black
Fire in the air
Burn!

We make this eternal vow
Through us your love will grow
Oh mother you will see
Your knowledge sets us free

We are brothers
Raised by our mother's loving hand
We are brothers
Forever together we will stand
