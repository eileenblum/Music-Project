We will rise
from the ashes
Many days and many years
I tried to live how she told me
But I was yearning for something more
To fill the emptiness inside
And it never was enough
To fill me up
And it never was enough

For my restless mind
Phoenix from the ashes
Our wounds will be healed
Phoenix from the ashes

We'll be born again and rise
Now that I have found a way
To salvation I know I will be
So much stronger than before

Nothing will ever break me
And it's gonna be enough
To fill me up
And it's gonna be enough
For my restless mind

Phoenix from the ashes
Our wounds will be healed
Phoenix from the ashes
We'll be born again and rise

We will rise
from the ashes
