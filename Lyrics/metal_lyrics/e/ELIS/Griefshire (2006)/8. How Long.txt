How long, how long

How long will I go on like this
Hurting myself and denying my love
How long will I go on like this
Ignoring the pain inside

How long will it take until
Everything's ruined and everything's gone
How long will it take until
His demons devour him and his visions burn us all

How long can I go on like this
Until all the strength is lost and destroyed
How long can I go on like this
There's a new life on its way

How long will I excuse myself
For every mistake and every fault
And how will I excuse myself
If he hurts our dearest maid and I always had it come

How long
It's time to make another step in the right direction
Too long
It's time to move forward for our own protection

How long will it take until
Everything's ruined and everything's gone
How long will it take until
His demons devour him and his visions burn us all

How long
It's time to make another step in the right direction
Too long
It's time to move forward for our own protection

How long, how long
