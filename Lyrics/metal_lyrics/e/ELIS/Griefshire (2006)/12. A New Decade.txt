Is this really the end of the story?
Finally, this is the end of the old decade of illusions

What he started is lost now
What he started was the beginning of the old decade of illusions.

You'll never never never let him down
You'll never let him down

Loving souls meet again in silent winds
Ashes to ashes, once divided, now united again
Loving souls meet again in silent winds
Ashes to ashes, a promise made in the past
Forever this promise will last

This is not the end of the story,
This is just the beginning of a new decade of solutions

What you started is not lost now
What you started is the beginning of a new decade of solutions

I'll never never never let you down
I'll never let you down

Loving souls meet again in silent winds,
Ashes to ashes, once divided, now united again
Loving souls meet again in silent winds,
Ashes to ashes, a promise made in the past

Loving souls meet again in silent winds,
Ashes to ashes, once divided, now united again
Loving souls meet again in silent winds,
Ashes to ashes, a promise made in the past
Forever this promise will last
