Don't dare to leave
You can't make a single step without me
Don't dare to go
Or you will be lost forever
Oh, do you remember
Your heart and soul are in my hand

Innocent hearts are made of glass
Fragile and pure
Innocent hearts break easily
Innocent hearts are open books
Lovely to read
Innocent hearts burn easily

Stay here with me
One last step our souls will be redeemed
Stay her with me
You will lose her forever
Oh, do you remember
Your heart and soul are in my hand

nnocent hearts are made of glass
Fragile and pure
Innocent hearts break easily
Innocent hearts are open books
Lovely to read
Innocent hearts burn easily

You belong to us
You can't leave now
You belong to us
You are a part of us
You can't go now
You are a part of us

nnocent hearts are made of glass
Fragile and pure
Innocent hearts break easily
Innocent hearts are open books
Lovely to read
Innocent hearts burn easily
