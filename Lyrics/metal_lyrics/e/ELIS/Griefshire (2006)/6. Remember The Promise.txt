Like young birds in the sky they have to use
Their own wings and fly
But if you take them too high
They will fall and die

Leave me alone

Oh brother
Wake up, stand up, you are still living in a world of dreams
My brother
Wake up, stand up and join the keepers of the truth
Oh brother
Wake up, stand up, they are too weak alone it seems
My brother
Wake up, stand up, remember the promise of our youth

We will follow him to the sky so high
We will never fall, we will never die
You're an eagle in the sky
You know how to use your wings to fly
But if you rise to high
You will fall and die

Leave me alone

Oh brother
Wake up, stand up, you are still living in a world of dreams
My brother
Wake up, stand up and join the keepers of the truth
Oh brother
Wake up, stand up, they are too weak alone it seems
My brother
Wake up, stand up, remember the promise of our youth
Oh brother
Wake up, stand up, you are still living in a world of dreams
My brother
Wake up, stand up, remember the promise of our youth

Leave me alone

Remember the Promise
