Past is haunting me
Fragments of memory
disturb my peace of mind
Hours of delight
now seem a thousand years away
I was a fool to let you go

My heart and soul
are filled with sadness
Deep as grey oceans in your eyes
My heart and soul
are filled with sadness
Despair spreads its fingers around my mind

Days of love and hope
were followed by aeons of loneliness
as darkness sunk into our hearts
The other one's shadow
stood between us, a silent wall of doom
darkening the sky

My heart and soul
are filled with sadness
Deep as grey oceans in your eyes
My heart and soul
are filled with sadness
Despair spreads its fingers around my mind

Only memories remain
in a world now cold and dark
Where flowers grew now dust has covered everything

Crying doesn't help anymore
so what can I do?
Torn in pieces is my heart
I don't know where to go

My heart and soul
are filled with sadness
Deep as grey oceans in your eyes
My heart and soul
are filled with sadness
Despair spreads its fingers around my mind

God how I wish you back
but my mistakes can never be undone
and I fear you forgot our love....
