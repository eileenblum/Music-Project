Though we lived together
We always were alone
Our love it didn't matter
And now you're gone

Dark lies the sea
And you on it's ground
You went to be free
Far far beyond

Oceans of tears
Are floating of my eyes
The mights are full of fears
And the sun does never rise

Though we lived together
We always were alone
Our love it, didn't matter
And now you're gone

Though we lived together
We always were alone
Our love it, didn't matter
And now you're gone

The world has lost it's colours
They have faded away
Every day is full of sorrows
and I cannot stay

I want to end my sorrow
My way into the sea
And I have to follow
My lover to be free

Could the ocean grabs me
And fills my lungs with pain
Darkness is around me
My crying is in vain

Lover see I'm coming
Through this wall of blue
I hope that you are knowing
It's all for you

Though we lived together
We always werea lone
Our love it, didn't matter
And now you're gone

Though we lived together
We always were alone
Our love it, didn't matter
And now you're gone
