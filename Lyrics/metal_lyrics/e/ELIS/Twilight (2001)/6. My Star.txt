For years I searched a star
Which guides me through the universe.
I started to believe
That I had to go my way all alone.

The one day I found my star
It made speechless as you saw.

Each night I looked at my star
But I didn't dare to talk with him.

Then one day I tried to touch him
But I had to see, my star it was too far.

My Star is out of reach.
No chance to be close to him.
Although I know I'll never find another
No chance to live with him.

My Star is out of reach.
No chance to be close to him.
Although I know I'll never find another
No chance to live with him.

On and on I try to reach him
But I have to see
My Star is too far.
