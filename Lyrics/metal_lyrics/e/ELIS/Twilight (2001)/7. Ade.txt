Yesterday you told me
It's all over
You don't love me
Anymore

Please shoot the bullet which stops my pain
Give me the knife which takes my life
Please give me the rope which murders my breath
Push me in the water which swallows me

Living without you
Seems so hopeless
So I beg you
Stop my pain

Please shoot the bullet which stops my pain
Give me the knife which takes my life
Please give me the rope which murders my breath
Push me in hte water which swallows me

Sorrow and pain eat away
My lonely heart
No sleep calms my mind
My broken heart

You took my heart
Now take my life
I don't want to
Live with out you
Your thoughts are dark
My mind torn apart

Please shoot the bullet which stops my pain
Give me the knife which takes my life
Please give me the rope which murders my breath
Push me in the water which swallows me

Please shoot the bullet
