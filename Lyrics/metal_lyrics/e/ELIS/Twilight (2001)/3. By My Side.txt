I'm getting old
my hair turns grey
I'm loosing my strength
I'm fading away.

My bones are weak
My skin is wrinkled
My mind escapes
I'm fading away.

Year after year
More pain every year
Year after year
More pain eveyr year
Death I'm waiting for you
Won't you come?
Death I'm waiting for you
Won't you come?

Will thy words stay?
Will thy words ease my pain?
Will thy words heal?
My broken heart?

Will thy words stay?
Will thy words ease my pain?
Will thy words heal?
My broken heart?

What comes after this
What comes after this
What comes after this
Tell me,
What comes after death?

Will thy words stay?
Will thy words ease my pain?
Will thy words heal?
My broken heart?

Will thy words stay?
Will thy words ease my pain?
Will thy words heal?
My broken heart?

Will you my only friend
Be by my side?
Will you my only friend
Be by my side?
