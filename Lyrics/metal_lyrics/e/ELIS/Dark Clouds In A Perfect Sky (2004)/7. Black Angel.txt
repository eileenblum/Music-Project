I was walking through the night
Suddenly I remarked a sound in the winds
An angel like voice singing a tale

Through the cold and stormy night
Flies an angel
The black angel
White skin, red lips and long black hair,
Her wing is broken
The guardian angel

Listening breathless to her voice
Which has touched me right there in my heart
I felt the tears run down my face

Through the cold and stormy night
Flies an angel
The black angel
White skin, red lips and long black hair,
Her wing is broken
The guardian angel

The storm drags on her clothes
Like an invisible warrior
Her wing broke with a sound
So disgusting that it froze my heart
Her voice became weaker
Losing this fight of blackness
