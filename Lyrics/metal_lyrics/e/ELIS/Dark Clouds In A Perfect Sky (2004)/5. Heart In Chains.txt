Your cold cold heart has drowned my life in pain
Your cold cold heart has tortured my mind and soul

You have never learnt
To leave your prison
Your heart lies in chains
And who will break them
Your heart lies in chains

Maybe you will find a way to forgive yourself
Your cold cold heart has drowned my life in pain
Maybe one day you will find the peace for your mind
Your cold cold heart has tortured my mind and soul

It tears you all apart 
Restrained emotions
You're denying all your feelings
And it will break you
You're denying all your feelings

Maybe you will find a way to forgive yourself
Your cold cold heart has drowned my life in pain
Maybe one day you will find the peace for your mind
Your cold cold heart has tortured my mind and soul

Your cold cold heart has drowned my life in pain
Your cold cold heart has tortured my mind and soul
Your cold cold heart made wounds so deep, they will never heal
