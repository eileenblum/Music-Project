The long summer 
Has gone
The autumn leaves
Start to fall

Yesterday I was touched by the breath of winter
His cold fingers searched for my heart
But in my heart I felt the warmth of this summer
So the first snowflakes melted away

The long summer 
Has gone
The autumn leaves
Start to fall

I felt the world hold its breath
And everything turned slower
All was silent, softened by the snow
The world is going to sleep now
In a freezing white coat
But I know what I will see its rebirth

Silently
The world's breath is slow
Silently
The first snowflakes fall
