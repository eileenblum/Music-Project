Peel off my skin, make me helpless
Taste my body
Let me die in your sweet embrace

I never thought that I could find
Someone like you and still
I feel the union of souls
I never thought that I could find
A love so perfect and still
I'm here in your arms

Peel off my skin, make me helpless
Taste my body
Let me die in your sweet embrace

I never thought that I could find
Peace of mind and still
I'm staying here with you
I never thought that I could find
A lust so devouring and still
I'm caught in this passion
I never thought that I could find
All I was searching and still
I found you
