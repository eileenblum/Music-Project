Come calm my anger

Our love is like a perfect sky
Deep blue and the sun is shining
But it seems that sometimes 
There have to be some clouds

And suddenly I feel this destructive anger
Deep inside
And suddenly I feel this destructive anger
Is about to rise

Please come and calm this anger
You're the one to calm this anger
And if you can't calm this anger
It'll surely devour me this anger

Dark clouds is a perfect sky
And the air is getting colder
The rain starts to fall
We feel stormy wind in our faces

And suddenly I feel this destructive anger
Deep inside
And suddenly I feel this destructive anger
Is about to rise

Please come and calm this anger
You're the one to calm this anger
And if you can't calm this anger
It'll surely devour me this anger

Glaring lightning breaks the clouds
And thunder is rumbling loudly
The elements have turned mad
It seems that it all will break down

Please come and calm this anger
You're the one to calm this anger
And if you can't calm this anger
It'll surely devour me this anger
