Are you missing me?
Not knowing where I am
Out there somewhere
Do you remember me?

Do you think of me?
When you are on your own
Do you wish that we
Had the chance to meet?

Never met you
Searching my roots
Lack of identity
Searching a proof
Are you the one
Searching my roots
Give me a sign
Searching a proof

I hope that you'll agree
Sometimes we will meet
And you'll tell me your reasons
For giving me away

A day so long ago
Did you ever see my face?
Or hold me in your arms
Do you feel sorry now?

What were our reasons for
Giving me away
And still I'm thanking you
Maybe it was the best to do

Never met you
Searching my roots
Lack of identity
Searching a proof
Are you the one
Searching my roots
Give me a sign
Searching a proof

I hope that you'll agree
Sometimes we will meet
And you'll tell me your reasons
For leaving me alone
I hope that you'll agree
Sometimes we will meet
And you'll tell me your reasons
For giving me away

Never met you
Searching my roots
Lack of identity
Searching a proof
Are you the one
Searching my roots
Give me a sign
Searching a proof

I hope that you'll agree
Sometimes we will meet
And you'll tell me your reasons
For leaving me alone
I hope that you'll agree
Sometimes we will meet
And you'll tell me your reasons
For giving me away

Do you think of me
When you are on your own?
Do you wish that we
Had the chance to meet...?
