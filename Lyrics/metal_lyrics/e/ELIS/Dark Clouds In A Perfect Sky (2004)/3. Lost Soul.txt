He took my soul
Took my soul
In his hands
My mind got dark
Mind got dark
In his hands

When did I begin
To follow the shadows
They fill my dreams with pain and sadness
When did I begin
To feel the sorrows
Then I laid my soul into your hands

He said sweet words
Said sweet words
With his voice
He seduced me softly
Seduced you
With his voice

When did I begin
To follow the shadows
They fill my dreams with pain and sadness
When did I begin
To feel the sorrows
Then I laid my soul into your hands

Once times were not so dark
But then the shadows took hold
Of my soul
Since then I feel
My mind's lost in madness

Lost my soul
In the dark
Lost my mind 
In the dark
