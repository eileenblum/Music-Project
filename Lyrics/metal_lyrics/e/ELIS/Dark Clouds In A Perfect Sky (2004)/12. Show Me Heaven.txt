[Bonus On Digi Pack]

There you go
flashing fever from your eyes.
Hey babe, come over here
and shut them tight.
I'm not denyin'
we're flying above it all.
Hold my hand, don't let me fall.
You've such amazing grace.
I've never felt this way.

Oh, show me heaven, cover me
leave me breathless.
Oh, show me heaven, babe.

Here I go
I'm shakin' just like the breeze.
Hey babe, I need your hand to steady me.
I'm not denyin'
I'm frightened as much as you.
Though I'm barely touching you,
I've shivers down my spine;
and it feels divine.

Oh, show me heaven...

If you know what it's like
to dream a dream
baby hold me tight
and let this be.

Oh, show me heaven...
