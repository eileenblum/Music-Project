Why can't I hear you breath
Why can't I hold you now

You just told me on the phone
Bad news I can't believe they're true
Fate is so cruel to you it seems
It caught you at your weakest point 
Nothing left of your whole world
Besides chaos and smoking ruins
You thought there's nothing more to lose
You're wrong and he presents the proof

Please fight the devil inside you
Not enough time for us to spend

Why can't I hear you breath
Why can't I hold you now

You will need all of your strength
I hope that you can carry on
You fought the shadows of the ghosts
Now he's the one you will fight next
Knocking at your door as if
He is a guest you like to see
Don't let him in, just push him back
He is not welcome in your house

Please fight the devil inside you
Not enough time for us to spend
