Winds blowing strong bring an echo of sorrow
As one lonely figure wanders the land

Lost in himself, hatred became his only friend
Fog was their shelter on their road to nowhere

Years of roaming beneath grey skies
Have made him forgotten his name, all his life

Far in the distance a mountain draws his gaze
âMy steps will lead me there, but itâs so farâ¦â

âSoâ¦this landscape will be my tombâ¦â-âNeverâ
âHow long time will I have to feed this devil in me?â
âIt seems Iâve betrayed myself
Bowed down to fear and hateâ

[Solo: Jaime Torres]

Blinded by obsessions, consumed by a spiral
Erasing the beauty he once left behind

There in the horizon the mountain calls his name
âIt might be the time to awake, I should tryâ¦â

âSoâ¦this landscape will be my tombâ¦â-âNeverâ
âHow long time will I have to feed this devil in me?â
âIt seems Iâve betrayed myself
Bowed down to fear and hateâ

Now, as the snow starts to fall he is closing his eyes
Calmed down, that soft caress brings him memories
Of who he once was
Buried in the white lays his old clothes which tied
Down his soul

Run! Break away!
Your tempest is agonizing
Climb! One more breath and climb!
The summit is waiting
(The summit now waits for you)

When the sun is down he looks up to the sky
The stars that shine bring him the peace of mind

The silence sings; his soul now is unchained
The wind now tells: âIn harmony is the nightâ
