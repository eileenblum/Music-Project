Awake and see!
All around you they crawl to infest
Mind and spirit

Dishonesty!
Is hidden where no one would expect

Ignorance!
Considered as a sacred gift to take pride in

(by) Rotten souls!
Who hide behind a polished mask faking
Goodness and smiles.

Now Iâm pushed to the boundariesâ¦
Of my serenity

Light!
Is waiting for those
Who can think for themselves

Illuminate!
The world is your mind
And your mind is yours

A million voices are torturing your brain
Distorting senses, casting a slumber upon your eyes

Promising heaven, promising truth,
Taking control of an innocent soul

Stand on your own,
And find a way to enlightenment
Do not let the vultures fly circling âround you
Is it really that fucking hard to just remain serene?

You wonât shape my grave
