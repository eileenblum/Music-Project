Focus your wisdom, be one with everything
Learn to see beyond the outside world
Nobody can take away what lies in you
Your world is in, outside is all illusion
The silver key is yours, navigate your world
Seek reality be deaf to lies

Once again I'm here
In an inner world without knowing nothing
Stars seem to mock me
As I walk the dark path of my dreams

Hints are not out there, you have to look inside
The Elders expect one more sheep
Try to close your eyes, trust what you feel
The world seems stranger, but it's your mind"

Once again I'm here
In an inner world without knowing nothing
Stars seem to mock me
As I walk the dark path of my dreams

Once again I'm here
In an inner world without knowing nothing
Stars seem to mock me
As I walk the dark path of my dreams
I must find the path to the light
Or my soul will not awakeâ¦ never

Wings growing from my feet
And as a God I rise again
Chains will not stop me
I will strike the stars tonight
As a sun I rise in the dark of the night
No dream shall cloud my will
