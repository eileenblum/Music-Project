Rise! 

Under a cloudy dark sky we march towards the dawn 
The flame is almost extinguished, but our will is still untouched 

Defy! The winds of despair 
Deceive! The face of death and pain 

Now is the time to fight, this moment must be ours 
Challenge the darkest night, seek for the strength inside you 
Behind the veil of fear there is a world to conquer 
Clenching our fists we scream, from the ashes we shall rise! 

Covered in mist is the path we walk, 
Surrounded by fire is our heart 

At the threshold of desolation everything is seen so clear 
We were the ones who buried every hope and every dream 

We faceâ¦ The cold winds of despair 
With strengthâ¦the fire runs again 

Now is the time to fight, this moment must be ours 
Challenge the darkest night, seek for the strength inside you 
Behind the veil of fear there is a world to conquer 
Clenching our fists we scream, from the ashes we shall rise! 

[Solo: Jaime]

We are not scared of the endless rainâ¦
