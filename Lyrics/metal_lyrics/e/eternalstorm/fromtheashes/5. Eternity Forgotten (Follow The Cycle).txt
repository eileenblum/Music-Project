We're the ones who invented this
The ones who hold every second
The ones who breathe the dust of the past
No future, no past, the present

No light behind, and no light onwards,
But the clock is still ticking

You canât stop the present, you canât change the past
You canât change the past!

[Solo: Jaime]

Run? You canât face the dust
Lay down to your acts
Led by the god of time
Forever ticking!

I can see the through the veil of time
The timeless wounds of what we do
I walk ancient stairs to the unknown
I abandon the real life

Run? You canât face the dust
Lay down to your acts
Led by the god of time
Forever ticking!

[Solo: D.Maganto]

No life behind, and no light onwards,
But the clock is still ticking

You canât stop the present, you canât changeâ¦
You canât stop the present, you canât changeâ¦
Canât change the past!
