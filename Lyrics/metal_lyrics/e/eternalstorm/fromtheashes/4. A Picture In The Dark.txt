[Lead: Jaime, Jaime / D.Maganto]

Drenched in anxiety, dressed in uncertainty

Lights are gone, clouds are gathering,
A blurred scenery for such a weary mind

The burden of my thoughts
Slowly places a veil before my eyes

The still waters of yesterday
Have turned into a raging ocean inside my mind

How many times have you painted a picture in the dark?
Alone, isolated, just haunted by the ghosts of your fears

Reason starts to fade giving way to hate
Free from its cage it hunts down my sanity

Altered visions of a bleak future
They show dark reflections, they laugh at your mind

The poison is flowing
Itâs quickly filling up every single vein

Madness grabbing you by the neck,
Sheâll lead you to dark woodsâ¦ where nothing breathes.

How many times have you painted a picture in the dark?
Alone, isolated, just haunted by the ghosts of your fears

Should I step out into the rain to find myself?
Should I risk what I value most? Should I play?

Itâs cold in here
I need to remember

[Solo: Jaime]

Silence, embrace me now
Mazes itâs all I see
Silence, become my guide
Show me the way back to life.
