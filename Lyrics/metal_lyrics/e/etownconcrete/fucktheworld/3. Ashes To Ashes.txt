Leaving behind a world on the brink of destruction.
Dreamlike, seeking another way out. Another empty
promise that I could do without. Afraid or unafraid,
leaving behind a world on the brink of destruction. In
our lives, you don't get a second chance. So don't
talk the talk, if you can't dance the dance. Cause
I've got family livin' around every corner. Now you
know. Don't say I didn't warn ya. It's not how you
lost. It's how you won. And where I'm from, it's
either do or get done. The fight isn't over till the
war is won, and where I'm from, it's either do or get
done. My cries were left unheard. Feel this pain from
the inside. Instinct is all I have. Close the door on
my life. Feel this pain from the inside out, out, out.
