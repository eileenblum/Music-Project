I don't want to be the one that can see
Through the mist of the future
I want to be able to see colours of the rainbow
After the rain goes away and the sun shows
Cause I can only see

Different shades of black
I dream in different shades of black

No more to say, don't want to stay
It's been like this forever
Not out of my mind, but will be in time
If I don't find a way to change what is grey and black
A shadow attack, a shadow attack

Different shades of black
I dream in different shades of black

In my dreams there's no colour anymore
Nothing's quite the way it used to be before

Different shades of black
I dream in different shades of black
