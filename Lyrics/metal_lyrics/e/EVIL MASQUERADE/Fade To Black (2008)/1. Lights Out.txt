Someone has finally done it again
Greed killed the sunshine and blackened all light that remained
There is no where to turn
Time has passed but no one learned
Did the dark ages never go away
Has the world become grey
Gods are obeyed
Remember to scream and shout
As lights are out

The Saints and the Holy won't give up the fight
Their freedom of conscience is pure like the sword of the knight
There is no where to turn
Time has passed but no one learned
Did the dark ages never go away
Has the world become grey
Gods are still obeyed
Remember to scream and shout
As lights go out

Someone has finally done it again
Greed killed the sunshine and blackened all light that remained
In the end they will burn
But someone new will always return
The dark ages might be here to stay
In a world that's turned grey
The gods are obeyed
Remember to scream and shout
As lights are out
All lights out

Deus vobiscum, A cruce salus, A Deo et Rege
Memento mori, A cruce salus, A Deo et Rege

Is it no god except god
Can it really be true

As lights go out
Scream and shout
It can't be right
No more sun
Forever gone
I saw it fade to black
It faded to black

Lights out
