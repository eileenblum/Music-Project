Come darkness, come darkness
Let's go it again
Let's show them our demons
Dessire and Pain

Once upon a time
I thought good of mankind
But I'm not a fool anymore

As Lucifer awaits us
Beware of the upside down cross

Disease spreading egos
Of people insane
Let's show what you're made of
Desire and Pain
You're Satan's whores

It seems so long ago
I was caught by the flow
But now that fool is dead

As Lucifer awaits us
Beware of the upside down cross

Sometimes I wish I was blind
Or could wake up from a dream
Cause as the world kept on spinning
Around and around and around
It all fell apart before my eyes

I'm hypnotized
I'm paralyzed
I'm far from home
It's crowded here
They are all too near
But still I'm alone

Now Lucifer awaits us
Beware of the upside down cross

Come Lucifer
Desire and Pain
