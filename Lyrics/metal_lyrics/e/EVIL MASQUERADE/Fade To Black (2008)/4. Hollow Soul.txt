Must I be cruel to be kind towards me
Is what is true what is real
Different opinions are sold by the pound
While facts are revealed without sound

I knew it, I saw it, I heard it, I felt it
I'll never be the same again and I don't care
The overcrowded emptiness
Did make my hollow soul complete
What's been created
No one will believe
It is out on parole
My hollow soul
My hollow soul
A useless and cold hollow soul

We have to choose between evil and good
Thus far I have understood
But who can decide about where one should turn
When you're damned either way and must burn

No point to, keep trying, I sell out, they're buying
'll never be the same again and I don't care
The overcrowded emptiness
Did make my hollow soul complete
What's been created
No one will believe
It is out on parole
My hollow soul
My hollow soul
A useless and cold hollow soul

The overcrowded emptiness
Has made my hollow soul
What's been created
No one will believe

My hollow soul
My hollow soul
A useless and cold hollow soul
My hollow soul
