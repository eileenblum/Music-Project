I don't know what's happening to me
I'm not the man I used to be
Not shine that everyone can see

One too many perfect lies
One too many reptiles
Will take us to the end
Someone has to pay the price
People are dying
And the children cry

It feels like I'm caught in the middle of evil
In a dungeon close to hell
It feels like I'm caught in the middle of evil
Or maybe I'm under a spell

What was pure has rotten long ago
And now it's burning far below
Some distant screams of truth still echoes

One too many perfect lies
One too many reptiles
Will take us to the end
Someone has to pay the price
People are dying
And the children cry

It feels like I'm caught in the middle of evil
In a dungeon close to hell
It feels like I'm caught in the middle of evil
Or maybe I'm under a spell

One too many perfect lies
Someone has to pay the price
Far too many perfect lies
The children are dying

This must be evil in a dungeon close to hell
It feels like I'm caught in the middle of evil
