Losing my dreams in the darkness within

Have you ever had a vision
That evoked the spirits of despair
They will sever me form it all
I might be blind but I know what I feel
Hear no evil, see no evil
Or be forever doomed

Losing my dreams in the darkness within
And now my soul is fading fast
I never thought the pain would last
Nothing can gleam in my darkness within
Forever black, a state of mind, a way of life
Just a different kind

Are you clever or just pretending
How can you stand to feign what is not
I could never fake who I am
My mental picture of the future is dusk

Hear no evil, see no evil
Or be forever doomed

Losing my dreams in the darkness within
I'm losing all my dreams, my soul is fading fast
I never thought the pain would last
Nothing can gleam in my darkness within
Forever black, a state of mind, a way of life
Just a different kind

Caught in between where nothing can gleam
And a place that holds a ray of light
Surrounded by a solid night
Oh stay away, the solid night
Oh, stay away
Losing my dreams in the darkness within
Nothing can gleam in my darkness within
Forever black, a state of mind, a way of life
Just a different kind
