Do you believe in heaven
Do you think they'll let me in
Could not avoid the deadly seven
Could not avoid temptation of heavenly sin
But when darkness calls for the last time
I am sure there's a place for all
Follow the angels
Though some angels fall
Some angels fall

I don't believe there's a heaven
I don't believe there's a hell
I believe in sin
I believe in sin
Condemned by the people it flourish within

Do you believe in hell
Do you believe that I belong there
I aimed for the sky buy then I feel
A shadow always follow you so beware
Now when darkness forever hides the sun
And you can hear the angels call
Remember, some angels fly but far from all
I've seen them fall

I don't believe there's a heaven
I don't believe there's a hell
I believe in sin
I believe in sin
Condemned by the people it flourish within
I believe in sin

It's hard to believe
But I know what I saw
I can't explain
And I can't let it go
Now the memory lives on deep with-in-side of me
It seems to be clear
What goes up must come down
Does not seem matter
With angels around
Once so proud they touched the sun
But with flaming wings they fall down

The angels are falling...
