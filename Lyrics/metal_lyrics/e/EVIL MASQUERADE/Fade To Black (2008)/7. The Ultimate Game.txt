If only someone had told me before
Not to be trustful or sure
It would have spared me from sorrow and pain
I had to learn the hard way but now I know the rules

It's the ultimate game

A play about life and death
Disguised as a game of chess
But no one can win at the end
A one-too-many sacrifice
No remorse, just endless lies
The un-human race must survive

The kings and the queens of the uh-human
Will be here till the end of days
But I will see to that they ruled in vain
They must learn the hard way'
Those crowned and gilded fools

It's the ultimate game

A play about life and death
Disguised as a game of chess
But no one can win at the end
A one-too-many sacrifice
No remorse, just endless lies
The un-human race must survive

Die, in the name of god
Die, in the name of anything

It's the ultimate game

A play about life and death
Disguised as a game of chess
But no one can win at the end
A one-too-many sacrifice
No remorse, just endless lies
The un-human race must survive

The kings and the queens of the uh-human
Will be here till the end of days
Come the end, the end, the end, the end
It's the end
