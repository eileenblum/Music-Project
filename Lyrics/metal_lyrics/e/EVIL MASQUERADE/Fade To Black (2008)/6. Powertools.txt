I see warfare, I see hate crimes
Someone's laughing, oh it is time
I was lonely, and felt afraid
I trusted someone, then I was betrayed

Never again, I won't be no fool
No more will powertools
Make a slave out of me, out of you
That was all in the past
Sacred icons, holy men
That dreams of holy land
You won't rule with powertools

We all have scarred pasts
I have my cross to bear
The cost was dear, and interest was high
But now it's clearer, I' out the other end
And for the rest of you, you mustn't give up the ghost

Never again, I won't be no fool
No more will powertools
Make a slave out of me, out of you
That was all in the past
Sacred icons, holy men
That dreams of holy land
You won't rule with powertools

End of an era
As the false idol gets clearer
When search of power becomes a morbid lust
Life turns to ashes and dust remains dust

Never again, I won't be no fool
No more will powertools
Make a slave out of me, out of you
You won't fool me with your
Sacred icons, holy men
That dreams of holy land
End of an era
You won't rule with powertools

Powertools make a slave out of me, out of you
Make a slave out of me, out of you
No more
