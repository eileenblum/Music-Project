I can see my breath in front of me
Ice crystals floating in the air
Creating non-symmetric frozen dreams
Winter land all around me
Freezing me old
Riming my glee
Winter land all that I see
Oh no

Too long since I brought the angels down
Now I suffer far below
No more pleasing the undeserving kind, no
Winter land all around me
Making me breath Diamond Dust
Winter land all that I see
Oh no

I'm breathing Diamond Dust
I'm breathing Diamond Dust
Diamond Dust

Winter land all around me
I'm breathing Diamond Dust
Winter land all around me
Set me free, leave me be
No, no, no, no, no
All I see is Diamond Dust
