You are a stinking liar
I don't know how you sleep at night
Your falsehood is entire
You are rotten and cold
You believe in nothing
I trusted things you said were real
Now I know better
But it's too late for me

My heart can't feel no more it's gone
You took it away
Inside my soul there's just dust
I'm a shadow of something great
Some deeds can't be undone
Now I'm a silhouette that blinds the sun

Don't want to waste my spirit
Must stay one thousand miles from you
Tried first to break then kill it
You are human disgrace
Logically unconscious
Must stay away from empathy
You're still aware of nothing
It is too late for you

Just shadows
Forevermore
