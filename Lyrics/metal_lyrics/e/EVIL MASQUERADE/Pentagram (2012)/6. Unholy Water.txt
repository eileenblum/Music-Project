Now where will I begin
A confession of a sin
So hard to motivate
And probably too late

I have no fear of fire
Could never feel the blame
No shame
Now look what I became

I'm gazing up at surface sky
Already wet, no need to cry
I'm going down
I always knew it wouldn't last
And now I'm sinking fast
I'm going down â about to drown
In unholy water

A blind but sacred choir
Warned me about a fire
I never told them wrong
But I heard false notes in their song

I didn't fear the flame
No, no, it never came
Wrong aim
Now look what I became
