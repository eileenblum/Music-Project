Is it black magic or the key to life
This star is the edge of a knife
Play it safe, play it cool, don't be a fool
Or you might sink to the bottom of the pool

'Cause when the star turns
It's when heaven burns
Don't make your star turn
Don't turn

From your spirit head
To your fire feet
Water, earth and air
It's all there

The number five is prime
Since the dawn of time
It makes your heart beat

Pentagram
The lion and the lamb
We're parts of a pentagram

If the great rite spins around
Another savior falls to the ground
Be prepared â cover your back
It strikes from behind â beware of the attack!
