Cold as ice
Soiled and wrong
Deranged community of souls

First disrobed
And then defiled
No more hopes, no more goals

I can't sleep on a bed of thorns
I am hurt, I'm scorned
I can see a figure with horns
I can't sleep on a bed of thorns

A bleeding truth
A damaged lie
The choir sings without a song

What goes up
It must come down
And this has floated far too long
