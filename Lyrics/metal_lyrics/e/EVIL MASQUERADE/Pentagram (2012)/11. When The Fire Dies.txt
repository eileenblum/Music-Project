Year after year I've been losing my religion
All I could see was misery
Fear after fear makes the passionate one grow silent
It's cold down in hell when the fire dies

When the fire dies
Under blood red skies
And the beasts arise
I don't care
When the fire dies

Another day has passed and the night seems even darker
Is this the end or is it more
Nowhere to turn, it's just different shades of nothing
How could I take another day
