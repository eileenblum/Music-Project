You know how it feels
It only sweetens the deal
Soul taker
Your star is upside down
Soul taker
You want to make them feel what you feel
Soul taker

Another morning is here
Can't face the world
But you know that it's there

You really taught them last night
About respect
When you put out their lights

You know how it feels
It only sweetens the deal
Soul taker
Your star is upside down
Soul taker
You want to make them feel what you feel
Soul taker

But still you're lonely and small
Something's lost
Instead of heart you've got a hole

It's so hard to see clear
Demanding love
With the weapons of fear
