I have been hungry
I have been cold
Been living on the street
I have been fighting
I've been struck down
But I got back on my feet

I don't mind your strange believes
You see me as a star
I'm just one with the universe
We all are...

Stars
Living in a moonlight fantasy
Stars
Imaginary moonlight fantasy

I saw the fire
I saw the pain
Just around the comer every day
Alone at sunset
I fled the dawn
But I decided to stay

I don't mind your fantasies
You tell me I'm a star
And you're right, I'm one with the universe
We all are...

Stars
