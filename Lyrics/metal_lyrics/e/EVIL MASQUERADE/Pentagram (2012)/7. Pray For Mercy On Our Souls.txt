They never saw the signs
A thousand stars fell from the sky
Then it was too late 'cause they were blind
Now they can't erase the mark of time

Dream on, escape
But it's no use no more
Move on, stay strong
And pray for mercy on our souls

Now looking back at times before
A planet treated as a whore
So abused and used but no one cared
Though a thousand warning signs were there

Dream on, escape
But it's no use no more
Move on, stay strong
And pray for mercy on our souls
Dream on, escape
Move on, stay strong

Darkness blinds the world I knew
Led by greed without a clue
Now we're slowly dying here
Nothing left to do but pray
Waiting for the judgement day
