Sailing on the seven seas
Waiting for hell to freeze
But there is no release to be found

Another distant sea
Another sunset
Another night alone

I'm never coming home
Far away â here to stay

The spirits of the dead are calling me

Silent screams that no one hears
Dark mist that never clears
My wildest fears, they are real

Another endless night
Another breakdown
Another hopeless prayer

I'll never see the light
Far away â here to stay
The sky is dark and cold
Down beneath I'm growing old

The spirits of the dead
They are here

Far away â here to stay
The sky is dark and cold
Down beneath I'm growing old
Oh the pain
Why was I born
Now they're calling me
Not so hard to see
What they want from me
The spirits of the dead
They put a price on my head
Dead
