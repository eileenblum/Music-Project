Alien minds in control
Trapped in the bodies of men with no souls

They are killing themselves
They are killing the world
Without reason at all

Chasing gold
Digging graves

And when they have finally conquered some more to be had
There's human waste in colored blaze
A perfect disgrace

They've always been here
They run the show
They made you think that you wanted them to do so
