I do remember
When you opened that door
The time has stopped
But the memory is still burning
Don't hurt me, please I said
But in your eyes there was no mercy
The night was so cold
My tears still have blood
'Cause what you did
Has killed me inside
Listen to me, my friend
If you don't care, nobody will
Don't you feel, the disappointment
When someone put you an end?
All the human kind is going to do the same
Kill your friend, or do it because
He'll stick the knife in you
Cheat on your lover
'Cause he's gonna cheat on you
Listen to me, my friend
Life is so long and hurtful
