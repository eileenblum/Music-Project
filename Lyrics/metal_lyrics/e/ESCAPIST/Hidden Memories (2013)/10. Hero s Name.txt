This world has a lot of injustice
And unfair moments...
We need someone to trust
And those are your friends
We need a hero who can save the day
Against the evil of this cruel Hell
In this nest of whores and vipers
Ambitious of this world
We have to deal each day
Struggling a way out of this nest
We are losing our faith in love
You have the strength underneath it all
Open your heart, let me see
The courage inside your soul
My friend, don't you go away
Don't you forget the hero trapped in your heart
There's no time to go back
We have to fight
They're hungry of our innocent souls
We have to strike before the hope is gone!
