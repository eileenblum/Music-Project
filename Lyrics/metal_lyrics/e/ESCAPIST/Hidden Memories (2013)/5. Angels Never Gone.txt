I remember when we used to talk every single day
Rays of light in cloudy days
When you say the words
This will never end
Now the wings have sent me so far away
Moon is rising, I'm the loneliest soul
Who only thinks of...
Fly with me, until the end of time
Will you follow me home?
Memories, forever will remain
Because the angels are never gone
Never gone...
In the night I've seen an image of you
Hoping it was not a dream
I would like to look again
Deep into your eyes
That is all I need
I count the days to seeing you
Wish I could speed up time
Moon is rising
I'm the loneliest soul
Who only thinks of...
I'm looking to the biggest star
Lost in the sky
Wishing you'll be there when I go home
Say my name, say it once again
I need to hear your voice, call me
Smile for me, it's my ecstasy...
Tonight, I only think of you
