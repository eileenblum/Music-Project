Maybe you love me like before
Maybe it's not the same
I want to see your dark and red eyes
I need to feel your lips again
Maybe now it is over
Unfinished thoughts around my mind
Your words haunted my cold heart
Let me touch you one more time
Love is just the biggest suffering
As deep as the ocean
As far as the stars
And it's black like our heart
I'll never know how they found me
But like a knight I'm waiting
Ready to fight for you
Memories are killing me
How I've missed you
Cause you are blazing through the sky
But in my heart
You will live forever
Give me some sight, from far away
Help me believe
Wait for me a while
I promise, in time
We will be together
Don't let me fall and make me love again
On my eternal life
