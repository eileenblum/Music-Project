In high mountain fortress
Crusaders of Sodom laughing at chastity
They hide from the eyes of condemnation
They hide from the breeze of sense

They captured fairness in dungeon of extinction
They captured beauty in dungeon of pain
Celebrating the day when compassion has died
Cherishing four months of satisfaction and liberty

Libertineâs eyes have settled upon
A charm of virtuous children
Unstoppable flow of perversion
Falls down on the noble chest
The thin line between excitement and pain
Fading between the endless fulfillment

Vilest creatures
City of depravity has ever seen
Gathered for the last supper of morality
Savor of youth
Citrus scent of ladâs pale flash
Appeals to the four horsemen of sodomy
Murder has no further delight than
To hear their victims begging for liberation through death
No horror can stand against Bishopâs kingdom of torment
