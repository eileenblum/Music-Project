In dank, misty hall and echoing veils
Ascends throne from thorns and twisted serpents
Slime covers embossed surface
Of this palace of dethroned apparition

Despair crawls from mouths as deadened sound
Mark of the Great anguish
Carves itself into distorted images
Once humane, once complete and absolute

Cripple and musty dregs of the human race
Slides between shadows in desire of respect
Last remains of a self-proclaimed supremacy
Ripped off from crushed and haggard shades

Brought into being by impious tongue
Absent of thought or vigorous word
Shape unworthy of it self
Shifts through unconscious mind of oneâs self

Separate from the body of Eternal
Corporeal self from everything that is
Roaming through obscure will of Man
It sows malice in fertile ground

Existence on the surface of blooming decay
Seems like preeminent bestowal
Too humble is the mind of the human kind
To perceive the nature of vanity
