Divider of time enthroned by itself
Succession it swallows through slimy substances
Descendants glide down ones throat
Ripped out of their mothers wound

The gluttonous formation ingesting the All
While suppressing the genius it consumes the core

Rare mind is alert
Heart falls by the hand of delusion
Trust is built upon quicksand
And illusion of crossing
Dull conceive the Seed
Thought falls by the hand of delusion
SpiritâWord entraps,
Fay, it pierces wit

From the Bright inconstancy emerges
Dejection, impatience covers all paths

Devourer of time enthroned by itself
Essence it swallows through slimy substances
A man goes far to find out what he is
Divider of time, divider of time

To centuries of centuries
It shall renew the face of earth
