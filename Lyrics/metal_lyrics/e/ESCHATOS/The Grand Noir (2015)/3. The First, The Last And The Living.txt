The Conqueror Worm
The Circle of No End
Lead me blindly
Under Your mourning pall

Three times She passed
The Doubtful Black 
Cloaked in razors
And thick, red sludge

But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false prophets among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them - bringing destruction on themselves. Many will follow their depraved conduct. In their greed these teachers will exploit you. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them. For if God did not spare his angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment; if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly people from trials on the Day of Judgment.
2 Peter 2:1

Life wonders in 
Its latest song 
Loud ringing voice
Between birth and the Tomb

Iâm floating up
Sleeping forever
In Living God
In Living Satan

I see both ends,
I see both faces;
The morning will come,
The morning like others
I see both ends,
I see both faces;
Iâll never know;
Iâll never know who I am

I see both ends 
I see no end
The morning will come
The morning with faces
Iâll never know
Iâll never know who I am
