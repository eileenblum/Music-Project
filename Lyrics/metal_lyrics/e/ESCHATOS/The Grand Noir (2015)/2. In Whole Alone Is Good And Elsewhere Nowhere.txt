Beset by the web of ignorance 
Floating being 
Above coherent void
With this Two-faced Silence 
Mournful the Dead

Heavy it lies on the spirit of Man
The tomb he carries with him
And shapes he seeks in shadows

Eternal nature 
All the purpose to the Whole

Nothing else to name
With winter in the bodies 
Form of Fire, the new Sphere of Clarity 
Form of Fire

Half-maddened sense 
I see before me
Gazeâ¦
I can know nothing

Speak the word of Four
