Earth, steam and specter
I follow you
Darkness and deathÂ 
Stench of bloodÂ 
Nothingness, despairÂ 
Cold black soilÂ 
Embrace meÂ 
Put me back to sleepÂ 

Shape and Time
I follow you
Fire of Mind
I follow you

Earth, steam and specter
I follow you, I become you Earth

The Slow DeathÂ 
The Old DeathÂ 
The Endless Sea of gray
Serpent of Anger
Devour me, embrace me
Crush me between your jawsÂ 

Grasp of Hate
I follow you
Serpent of Anger
I become you
