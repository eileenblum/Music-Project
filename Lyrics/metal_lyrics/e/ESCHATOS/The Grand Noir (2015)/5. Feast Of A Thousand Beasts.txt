Shades rise up to the eyes
Sorrow is renewed; and then the pain, and then the pain  
Shaping wavering forms and by godly hour
Approach they who have slipped from me and lost. 
I spend my time among The Dead
With brightest longings plagued by doubt and wondering

Darkened hole in the center of Thought
I embrace the shining sound

Shape and Time, you instruct me
I fall, I rise,
I blur into the body of Earth 
I sow my flesh 
All through the wilderness  
I am still becoming
I am still becoming

Whatâs gone becomes reality
Whatâs gone becomes me
