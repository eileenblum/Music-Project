Love is my fate
The monster I create
Born to torture me
Heart burns eternally

I am your star
I lift you up - I bring you luck
(But) soon I'll be hate
I'll be pain, see how it waits

(I'll) kill your heart
(It) won't be long
Throw it heartless to the ground

Look up to the heaven's gate
And see my tortured soul ablaze
Suffering because of me?
Then watch me die eternally

Promises made by night
Vanishing in day's light
I will break your chains

Save your tears
Let me go!
Nothing touches my burning soul

Look up to the heaven's gate
And see my tortured soul ablaze
Suffering because of me?
Then watch me die eternally

(I'll) kill your heart
(It) won't be long
Throw it heartless to the ground

Look up to the heaven's gate
And see my tortured soul ablaze
Suffering because of me?
Then watch me die eternally

Look up to the heaven's gate
And see my tortured soul ablaze
Suffering because of me?
Then watch me die eternally
