Can you hear me
Calling your name out loud?
And can you feel
My painful longing?

Come heal this fever
That burns away my freedom
(Let you fall!)
Come close your eyes
And let you fall into my arms!

I'm close to your flame
Dear, let me burn within
And see me, see me fade
I am not afraid
To leave what always seemed to be
If I can rise in you again...

So close your eyes
And let me dance for you
Let me awake
Your sleeping powers

I want to free you
I want to hear you breathing
(Let me breathe again!)
Put out my fire
And let me be born in your heat again!
