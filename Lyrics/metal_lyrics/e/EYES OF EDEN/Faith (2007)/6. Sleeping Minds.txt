Watch the sky tonight
See how it's alive
Feel all the dreams that rise
From sleeping minds

Their hearts create a world that's free
Of borders and of sins
Fly through the air, dance in the sea
Let you (own) fairytale begin

No one can tell you there what's wrong
No one knows where your heart belongs
Just let it go free all your thoughts
Dive deeper in your sleep forever on!

Go and follow them!
Your spirit's free
To fly away
From what kept you through the years

Dance with a demon in the fire
Fly on angels' wings
Be your one love's only desire
Fulfill your secret dreams
