The daylight burns like fire
Unveils the face of truth
No - I don't want to see
Why can't it be? - Can it be?

This heart beats a different rhythm
But it fades in the roaring noise
Of reality imprisoning me
Set me free!

And forever's my time of waiting
For what won't come

Crying for worlds that cannot be
And though are calling me so strong
My body imprisons me
My body is a cage that I cannot break free
The life that's pushed through my veins
Hurts so the pain is not to bear
I feel this lonely body dying
With every step it takes

And if it takes forever
I will wait every night
For dragon wings to take my soul
Far away - home

And forever's my time of waiting
For what won't come

Crying for worlds that cannot be
And though are calling me so strong
My body imprisons me
My body is a cage that I cannot break free
