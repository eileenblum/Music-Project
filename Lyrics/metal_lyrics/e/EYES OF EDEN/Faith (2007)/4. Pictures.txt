So I ride
Ride through seas of dreams tonight
Our souls united
Don't wake up, please stay with me
Or we will be divided

And I fly
On the wings of love tonight
Within this dream I'm living
I'd rather die than open my eyes
(I'll never die...)

Sad eyes
Burning their picture
In my heart
The pain will never die
Tears I cry
But they won't save you...you...
And my love will burn forever on

And I fly
Softly through your mind tonight
Our souls united
And I can feel your heart beats like mine
And we are one

My heart is bearing
(Don't wake up! Don't wake up!)
The pain of thousand tears gone by

Sad eyes
Burning their picture
In my heart
The pain will never die
Tears I cry
But they won't save you...you...
And my love will burn forever on
