Lights are flashing through my head
Is this the calling (of my heart)?
Every day I prayed: Oh, could this be the moment?
Or just a dream...

Dreamer among sleepers
I can feel the light
But I can't see
Thirsty soul in my heart's desert
Give me water
Don't let me die...
Don't let me die...

Daughter of a goddess
Turned into a human
Heaven's fire falling
Comes to life

Living here among the dying
I don't want to (be like this)
Give me faith - oh mother
Take me in your arms,
Shelter me!

Weakness of a human child
Strength of a goddess
Caught inside
I can feel this body fading...
Kiss me mother,
Set me free!

Daughter of a goddess
Turned into a human
Burning heart
Heaven's fire falling
Into earthy waters...
Comes to life...
Comes to life...

Into your heaven's waters
I'm falling from the sky

Will I ever fly?
Or will I rise up high?
Am I human kind
Or born to spread the light?

Will I ever fly?
Or will I rise up high?
Am I human kind
Or born to spread the...

Will I ever fly?
Or will I rise up high?
Am I human kind
Or born to spread the light?

Will I ever fly?
Will I rise up high?
Am I human kind
Or born to spread the...
The light?

Spread your wings
No heart beats like mine
But my soul is divine
Coming...

Fell the alter life
And raise up to the light
Though you're wise you didn't see
That this human heart can never be

Mother can't you tell me
Why the dying voice inside my heart
Is calling me?
Wise but didn't see
That a goddess and a human heart
Can never be

I feel mighty powers
But so many unknown feelings
Are confusing me
How could I command them?
Without having a pure human heart
That sees what's real

Not human kind - born to spread the light
Not human kind - born to spread the light

Fell the alter life
And raise up to the light
Though you're wise you didn't see
That this human heart can never be

Power of creation
Though I can't ignore the pain
That's beating on and on
Searching for another heart like mine
Oh, mother,
What have you done?

I do not belong here
But in your world will there be arms
To hold me tight?
Anyway - I'll  leave
Spread my wings up to my fate
And send me on my flight!

Not human kind - born to spread the light
Not human kind - born to spread the light

Will I ever fly?
Or will I rise up high?
Am I human kind
Or born to spread the light?

Will I ever fly?
Or will I rise up high?
Am I human kind
Or born to spread the...

Will I ever fly?
Or will I rise up high?
Am I human kind
Or born to spread the light?

Will I ever fly?
Will I rise up high?
Am I human kind
Or born to spread the...
Light?
