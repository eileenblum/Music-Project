Pictures surround me
Crystal dreams in ice-cold night

Night oh come and cover
Embrace me; shelter me
Moonlight touches the twinkling white

In endless beauty

[refrain:]
Sweet is the love of ice
Coldness chills human minds
I shiver in delight
Lost in a winter night

Clear air sharps my mind
Frozen lips kiss me alive

Summer felt asleep
Awakened autumns sight
Guided winter back to life

In endless beauty

[refrain]
