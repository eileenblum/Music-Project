Seems to be a life ago
I saw my heaven's light
Just for a heartbeat I could feel
That love could make one fly

Every day I was longing
Since standing in front of everworld
But you seem so far away
If I only had the wings to reach you there

To be with you is all I ever need
To be with you - my only friend!

Your voice echoes silently
Runs through my mind - confusing
Makes me remember heaven
Makes me remember you

Longing for arms of darkness
Embracing my soul so tenderly
Now you seem lost forever
Goddess give me wings, or I will fade away

To be with you is all I ever need
To be with you - from heaven sent
To be with you is all I long to be
To be with you - my only friend!

My only friend...
