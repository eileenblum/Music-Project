red skies are forsaken
allow for zero hour.
red skies are forsaken

the sacrifice of children
reborn to rule this time

stand before me
stand with ease
let me grant you gentle breeze

you... Don't deserve a face,
let me eat your cage
our... Hands are floods,
we mistake gardens

as we close our wings the castle
falls construction.
rebuild our lives

fountains the lucious break our
walls skylines and chapters
flee for the hills

trembling mouths fill the walls
oil and oak burn just for you
remorse is painted, fabricated
the century of man will burn
