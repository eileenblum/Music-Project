the seasons of fire
they take my heart from you
our kingdom of heaven
my dear, my royalty

where is your sword
as we fail

RUN

the seasons of fire
they take my heart from you
our kingdom of heaven
my dear, my royalty

where is your honor
my loyal earth

with my hands
placed around your neck

i will stand worthy
i will stand unbroken
i will stand in motion
i will stand in this love

sky will never forgive you
for what you did to me
sorrow, flesh, accomplished

as we ran through the trees
she whispered to me

we will remain sincere
sincerity
