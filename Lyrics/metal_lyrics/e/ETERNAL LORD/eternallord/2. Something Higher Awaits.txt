Father

his mountains move with the highest level of treacherously
the great winds blow from east
south in great privacy

salvation is needed to wake the army
we do not bare the mask

bow down to me
for i hold the key
for the existence of man
and i wont let go
as the same as them

never again
we will suffer for the cost of living
we run together in loving arms

the deconstruction of our humanity is overwhelming
it states in name

this life time ends
with love and passion for deceit
this life time ends
with love and passion

passion

be afraid
the darkness never goes
be afraid
the darkness

devastation
