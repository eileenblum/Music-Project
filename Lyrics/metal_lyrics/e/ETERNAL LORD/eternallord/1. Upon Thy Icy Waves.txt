Flames of sailors weep
there graveyard is deep
aquatic blood for there sins
an ocean in glass holds there limbs

she spoke in Atlantis
as the thunder crushed him

this is our kingdom
this is our ocean

flames of sailors weep
there graveyard is deep
aquatic blood for there sins
an ocean in glass holds there limbs

this is our kingdom
this is our ocean
this is our kingdom
this is your crown

now we are crushed by his jaws
below large eyes
the deep is the ours
his graceful waves of mercy
enter my realm to the water
feel the warmth of Oceania

secrets written by man

my angel i will dream of you

my angel i will dream of you
my angel i will dream
my angel i will dream of you
my angel i will dream

i never had a choice
i was bound and buried by grace
through storms we reach the shore
in neptunes call for blood
