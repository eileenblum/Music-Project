If this here what we speak of is destiny then why does it feel so wrong?
If this here what we speak of is destiny then why does it feel so wrong?

A blackened cloud that hangs above my every step to ensure that I am broken and bruised.
Forget its a downfall, lets raise our heads and place our bets that tomorrow is tranquil.
But to surrender and fear is not what we came for !
But to surrender and fear is not what we came for !

[Solo]

And as we closed our eyes, we both became weightless
We were saved by oceans waves, we both became weightless

A siren sounds, my every thought takes to the air but to regret is to surrender and fear.
Forget its a downfall lets raise our heads and place our bets that tomorrow is tranquil.

As fear sets in
Then side by side
We both begin to drown

I've filled my lungs with all the icy cold water my eyes will let me see
I've filled my lungs with all the icy cold water, these sea's wont let me breath.

You probably wont even care
Set your anchor deep its what you came for.
You probably wont even care
Set your anchor deep its what you came for.

The ocean fought my like a prize fighter
But who are you to care?
The ocean fought me like a prize fighter
But who are you to care?

And as we closed our eyes we both became weightless
We were saved by oceans waves, we both became weighless.
A blackened cloud that hangs above my every step, to ensure that I am broken and bruised
