She'll reach for familiar arms
yet still clutching her knees.
Then softly whispered
"I have become what you shall fear"

As the bandages fell to the floor
And the face was revealed.
Through your eyes I saw a shadow.

The devastation shall become
Ever so more apparent,
These hours are feeling like years,
But who said that they wouldn't?

You're idea of loving is laying on your back.
This whore spreads her legs for the last time
Then I say she's done.
This whore spreads her legs for the last time,
Lets have some fun!
Somewhere softly there's a woman who cries.
You can tell you're your mothers child

The devastation shall become
Ever so more apparent,
These hours are feeling like years,
But who said that they wouldn't?

Forgive is to Forget.
Relive is to Regret
