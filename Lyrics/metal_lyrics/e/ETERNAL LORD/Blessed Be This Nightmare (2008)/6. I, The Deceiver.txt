I was
The chosen one,
Who has been cast before you like stone,
Stone over water,
A thousand times I,
A thousand times, I've tread this ground.
Just to see my own reflection,

I know it takes a while.
But soon you'll realize
I'm at my best when I'm alone.
I know it takes a while.
But soon you'll realize
I'm at my best when I'm alone.

Lets waste our time,
Laying hand in hand,
These walls could have been ablaze but we
Wouldn't hear a sound,
Lets waste our time,
Laying hand in hand,
These walls could have been ablaze but we
Wouldn't hear a sound,

This time I'll waste my own time,
Waste my own time.

The seasons change often here
And I'm left out in the cold,
It's wished upon me,
This was wished upon us all
The seasons change often here
And I'm left out in the cold,
It's wished upon me,
This was wished upon us all

I know it takes a while,
But soon you'll realize
I'm at my best when I'm alone,
I know it takes a while,
But soon you'll realize
I'm at my best when I'm alone,

Lets waste our time, laying hand in hand,
These walls could have been ablaze but we wouldn't hear a sound.
Lets waste our time, laying hand in hand,
These walls could have been ablaze but we wouldn't hear a sound.

Tomorrows a brand new day
So take from rite now all you need,
Tomorrows a brand new start,
It's a shame that I'm happy with today.

I, I am the chosen one,
Who has been cast before you like stone,
Stone over water.
A thousand times I,
A thousand times I've tread this ground,
Just to see my own reflection
Just to see my own reflection
