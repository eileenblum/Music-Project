Of sacrifice and torture, an epic tale and ending.
I'll stand and gaze upon as it eats into her flesh.
Pray for her,
The corps lays breathless.
Low and behold there's probably nothing left

Incisions made into her chest, from hatred stored inside.
It feasts upon the vile blood that's fucking left.
Disease flows like the Nile, a river bed.
Disease flows like the Nile as promised.

Take nothing and die here.
Take everything sacrifice one equal
Take nothing and die here.
Take everything sacrifice one equal.
Pray for her.

Of sacrifice and torture, an epic tale and ending
I'll stand and gaze upon as it eats into her flesh.
Pray for her,
The corps lays breathless.
Low and behold there's probably nothing left

I'll try and overcome so the fear inside get left behind,
Results to nothing, I wont hide it, set it free.
I'll try and overcome so the fear inside gets left behind,
Results to nothing, I wont hide it.

Go.

Results to nothing.
Regurgitate, for all its worth...
This is where demon's sleep.
