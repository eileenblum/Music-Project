Curse the man that falls to his knees and prays to a savior today
Sever limbs so he wont get back up
We'll be safer there upon my tired head.
There upon my tired head
Grip the cross you place your hope in tight
As it comes to the end.
Close your weeping eyes as we rid this religion of its disease,
We'll kill it while it sleeps, We'll kill it while...

Bury it six feet for a good sleep
Tell them We'll bury it six feet for a good sleep
Nail your hope, Nail your hope to a cross
Nail your hope to a cross built of sand watch it wash away like the...
Blood will fall, fall like tears

Another day another victim to fall prey
I sincerely hope this is the last time you look back and say
"We are the victims, we have been led astray"
There upon my tired head grip the cross you place your hope in tight,
As it comes to the end.

Close your weeping eyes as we rid this religion of its disease
We'll Kill it while it sleeps, We'll kill it while...

Bury it six feet for a good sleep
Tell them We'll bury it six feet for a good sleep
Good sleep?
Good sleep.
