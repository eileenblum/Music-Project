OH SHIT!

I'll turn my back tonight as my eyes they see no more.
She creeps from corroded remains, oh her cries, her cries are for more.
The stench of decay was enough to bring me to my knees.
The stench of decay was enough to bring us to our knees.
'Give me tragedy' she screamed, 'I wouldn't give it back for the world'

Oh my god.

She wept through broken teeth, my silence means I am not through
I'll sever the head. Bury it all let the rot set in.
She wept through broken teeth, my silence means I am not through.
I'll sever the head. Bury it all let the rot in.

Reborn and raped of a chance.

Ten forty five and the sky was alive with stars.
Where will you be when the curtain falls on the act?
Ten forty five and the sky was alive with stars.
All I ever wanted was you in my arms, but for now ...

A black plague on your family
And all you've loved in the past
A black plague takes your family.
And all you've loved.

But you should know that just before your head caved in, you're eyes looked amazing.

Ten forty five and new silence is deafening.
Where were you all when the curtain fell on the act?
'give me tragedy' she screamed, 'I wouldn't give it back for the world'

Black plague on your family.
