Blessed be this Nightmare.
I'll lay diamonds where your eyes once sat,
Now look at me.
Blessed be this nightmare.
I'll lay diamonds where your eyes once sat,
Now look at me.

I'll find you where I left you,
Motionless on that white tile floor
Your insides torn out
I stitched that smile into your face

I never told you,
You were my prey.
I never told you,
I hunt my prey.

Pause,
I'll take you back to a time a place
A memory you where the angel,
I'd never trust to carry me...
Remind me the apathy
Remind me the apathy

Blessed be this Nightmare.
I'll lay diamonds where your eyes once sat,
Now look at me.
Blessed be this nightmare.
I'll lay diamonds where your eyes once sat,
Now look at me.

The dischord when you scream
Is the only sound I remember
As your skull cracked against the floor
The dischord when she screams
Is the only sound I remember
As your skull cracked against the floor
Fuck her.

Your insides taste greater
Than sweeten lips
This thought is destructive.
Fallen,
Don't wait up don't look down
This thought is destructive
As motion turns to sound Fallen,
Don't wait up don't look down
This thought is destructive
As motion turns to sound
Hopeless romantic had to leave you breathless
The hopeless romantic had to leave you breathless.
Hopeless.
