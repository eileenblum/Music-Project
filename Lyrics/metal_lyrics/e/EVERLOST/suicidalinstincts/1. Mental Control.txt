They blind your eyes
They force your deeds
Pervert the law
Dictate the needs

You have never give a damn before
And now they wash your brain with a blood of another

Curse
Poison
Mental control
The dissection of your soul
Curse
Poison
Mortal blow
Still you fall through this hole

Darkness surrounds me
You bring me light
When I'm full of aggression
You give me a fight

Twisted reality
Oppressed personality
Heading for insanity
Free will is an offence
You're tearing all my defense
Securing my confidence

It grips your mind
Rat in the trap
Bound forever
With deception strap
