Unveil the deepest of sensations
Don't let deception take control of you

Your guiding light is dying out
But still you follow this trail
Avoid the illusions of reality
They will lead you astray

And when your most secret dreams
Are turned to dust
Dwelling in darkness seems
To forever last

And when the hope's last breath
Is gone with the wind
The one who deals death
Will show his face

The one who always betrays
The one who never leave a trace

Dispel these twisted visions
Of formless silhouettes
Deny these shapeless dreams
Destined to be shattered
