So tell me how long will you feed
The hunger of this social mechanism
Sacrificing yourself to its will
All you heed is evergrowing voice of the egoism
Inflicting wounds
That never will be healed

Obliterator of belief
Slave of supremacy addiction
From now on you will always be
Imprisoned by your own ambition

So tell me how long will it last
The spreading slowly through the veins
Venom of power
Which you will never get enough
Flames of lust will have your soul and body devoured
The words of curse
Will be your epitaph

Come and worship emptiness
Slave of supremacy addiction
A monument of selfishness
Erected by your own ambition
