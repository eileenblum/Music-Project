When our own evolution
Turns out uncontrolled
We get to the point
Of no return
And releasing of demon
Becomes just a matter of time

Sands of time
Are running fast
So fast that one can clearly see
The end of our earth
Affected by the parasitical disease

Retribution for suicidal instincts
Of civilization
The frustration of creation
No reasonable explanation

But won't last forever
Destructive race
The day of reprisal
We soon have to face
