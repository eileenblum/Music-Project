You're manufacturing your own obsession
By the paroxysmal escapism
By the artificial senses
Fostered to provide protection
From the justified cannibalism

Wasting dreams you never had
Spilling blood you never bled
For the virtues that are force fed

Built to lust on blinded bliss
A synthetic masterpiece
You will never feel alone
In the gallery of scorn

You're attending this dramatic coronation
Of the self-inflicted sacrilege
Of the unforbidden myths
Once held in abomination
Behold them burning the last bridge
