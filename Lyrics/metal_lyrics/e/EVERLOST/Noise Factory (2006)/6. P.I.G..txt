Will you be the carrion to inspire
The ravens of lust
Will you please the weak empire
The only kind that lasts
After all the tributes
To the bloody regime
You'll have to pay the price
For being canonized

Still you lack things to believe in
In the world of make-believe
A life to die for is hardly worth living
When it hurts to live

The vulture in human form
Put into greatness by the swarm

Will you search for martyrdom
To redeem the righteous hate
Will you refight the battles won
Without the bondages of faith
With all the powers you hold
Will you ever dare
To practice what you preach
To face the one you leech

Pleasant is truth but the one you evade
Vicious are dreams but the ones you create
Those feeding desire to manipulate

Scars of submission are too deep to be healed
When the damage inflicted to the one who won't bleed
The one who will nourish the machine as you did
