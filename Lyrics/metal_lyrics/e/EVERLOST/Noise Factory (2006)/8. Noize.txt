Don't leave it and don't take it
Don't feel yourself mistaken
Feel free to look upon the world
The noise has grown violent
But death alone is silent
And my day is not

I'm not your god
Nor am I devil at your door
I'm just an ear-breaking whisper
I tell and you adore

The victories far-fetched
Hear everything but your own voice
And welcome with your arms outstretched
Millennium of noise

I'm not your conscience
Though can't escape your head
Once you have ceased to be, I'll leave you be
I swear you won't regret

The victories far-fetched
Hear everything but your own voice
And welcome with your arms outstretched
Millennium of noise

Deaf to sorry pleas
Noise of man and noise of beast
