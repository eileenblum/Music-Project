Crowned with purified illusion
Right behind the throne you stand
Get me rid of your religion
The religion of the damned

Stripped of all the gifts corrupt
They cease to live and cease to die
It is rude to interrupt
While you are preaching genocide

You're keeping the hands on the pulse
Of the mentally deranged
They are helpless, speechless
And too blind to be afraid of the world

Of your world that spins no more
Of the hatred that you brought
Right into the hearts of youth
The ministry of truth

Keeping the hands on the pulse
Of the mentally deranged
But it's their right
To nourish the mutual hate
Hate for the world

For your world that spins no more
Due to madness that you brought
Right into the minds of youth
The ministry of truth
