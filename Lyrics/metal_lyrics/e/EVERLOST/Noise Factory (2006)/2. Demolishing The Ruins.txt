Demolishing the ruins of ambivalence
Inhale the wrath of mortal flesh
Which defies the tyrannies of existence
Burning down to be reborn from ash

The adepts of the certain life
Soon they will be there
Proud to demonstrate their scars
Beings infected by the words so fair
Put at once behind your bars

Kneel as you approach
The ruins still to be demolished
By the one becoming obsolete

Demolishing the ruins
Prepare to celebrate
Beginning of the end
Demolishing the ruins
Of the one who doesn't bear the brand

Hey, bringer of faith
Searching for dreams to invade
With the privileged lies
The beast in its disguise

Hey, bringer of hate
Prepare to celebrate
Beginning of the end
Of the one who doesn't bear the brand
