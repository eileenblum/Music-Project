I take it while I can
On a way to the promised hell
I think, therefore I am
I sin, therefore Iâm well

Until you hit the ground
That you curse from above
Until redemption is near
The hesitation itself
As to whether you need
To commit or omit
It's out of fashion in here

Until you hit the road
That your intentions pave
Until the final recall
Don't you have any doubts
As to whether you are
To devote or devour
It's out of question at all

So when you're searching
For the greater of all evils
Be sure to seek among your greatest deeds
All your virtues
Will be enough to let you
Cross the river free of charge

I take it while I can
I sin, therefore I am
The hesitation itself
As to whether you need
To commit or omit
It's out of fashion in here
