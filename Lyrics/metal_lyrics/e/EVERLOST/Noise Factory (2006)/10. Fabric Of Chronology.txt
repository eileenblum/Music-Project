Now, who will be another saint
To inhabit the death row
Axiomatic equilibrium
Stained by the venom of the flow
The surest poison
You are the one to blame
The surest poison
For idols with the feet of clay

Now, who will be another sinner
To incur the blessings
Of the invisible sentencer
To wear one of his faces
The cruel savior
You are the one to blame
The cruel savior
I dare to take thy name in vain

Paths of the centuries
Are made by neither demons nor angels
They're but a threads in the fabric of chronology
A part of its silent grandeur
