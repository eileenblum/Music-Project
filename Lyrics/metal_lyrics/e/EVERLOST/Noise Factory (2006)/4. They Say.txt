Why did you grow attached to
All the pain that your life brings?
How come you found comfort
In pulling your own strings?

Don't speak these words
They fall on stony ground
In sands of time they drown

They say
No more wars in vain
They say it won't be the same
That's what they say
They reassure that no offence meant
By sacrificing you on the altar called Earth

Is it your way to struggle
For the gods which you can't face
How could you end up bowing
To your own former slaves?

A kind of pawn you're unable to queen - step aside
As if it wasn't your dreams you gave in - never mind!
A perfect hell for the ignorant - suits you fine
It makes you toe their line

Don't speak these words
For they will melt away
In all the things they say
