Spawn of chaotic abyss
Breathing pain and sorrow
The miriads of faceless shadows
Praying for tomorrow
As soon as will be reached
The apogee of desolation
They'll be the first to start
Praying for salvation

Bitterness of the triupmh is tasted
Abandon all hope, there is no chance
For humanity wasted

The victory wasn't meant to be so frail
Abandon all hope, no one will prevail
But humanity wasted

Behold fulfilling prophecies
Blind leads the one who sees
The world begun without men
Will end because of them
Too late for sins to be confessed
Remorse won't fill the emptiness
Too late for dying screams of fear
For there's no one to hear
