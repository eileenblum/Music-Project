The one with a thousand names unspoken
Is concealed behind your reflection
Who won't be overwhelmed
While confidence breeds self-deception

Though you can't see it does exist
This urge you can't resist
Obsession grows when indifference paves the way
Never mind choosing paths
To you they're all the same

They're all the same
Behind the reflection
Mirrored self-deception

Absorbing disillusions with everything you touch
Just carefull what you trust
Beware the unseen for it will consume you
To feed some morbid lust

You will forever be
The slave to this strange symbiosis
Of vital and the dead
Deprived of your own for the sake of force fed
