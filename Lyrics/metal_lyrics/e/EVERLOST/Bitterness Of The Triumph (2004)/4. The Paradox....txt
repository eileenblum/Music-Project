Those who kneel before the wooden idols of long ago
Will fail in adaptation
Someday the first born chaos will take its toll
On the oblivious nation

Now the animal inside is dead
It's time to bow your head
The face of the apocalypse is your own reflection
So take your part in the unnatural selection

Conquerers of life itself
Give up before the forces that they cannot comprehend
And there is no one to explain
The paradox of exceeding knowledge

The wooden idols of long ago
Someday the first born chaos will take its toll
On the oblivious nation

Slowly disappering the haze of aeons
Reveals the ornaments engraved
That praise the era of the technological dominion
Unleashed to be depraved
