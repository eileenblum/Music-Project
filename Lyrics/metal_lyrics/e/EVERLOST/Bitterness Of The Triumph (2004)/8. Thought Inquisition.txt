Who broke the silence of ages
With blasphemous voice of truth so called
Who turned those long forgotten pages
Revealing words never to be told

You've been processed by thought inquisition
How does it feel when memories die

Denial of sins is denial of life
Who dare to resist will be damned for all time

Who considered himself the chosen one to bring relief
To those who don't even need it
Who fell helpless victim to make-believe
Produced to be defeated
