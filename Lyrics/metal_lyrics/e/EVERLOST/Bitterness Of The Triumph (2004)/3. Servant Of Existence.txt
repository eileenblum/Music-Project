Condemned to live, bound to be for eternity
Before your very first breath was drawn
You had been possessed by the force unknown
But still you're trying
To make your way through the darkened mist
To see the light which does not exist

Servant of existence
So tempting to be trusted lies
Prevent you from hearing your own silent cries

Servant of existence
Your own silent cries

Denied by this colourless symmetry
Sometimes i feel pity for those of the ravaged
By agony within, they should envy the perished
Still you're trying
To make your way through the darkened mist
To see the light which does not exist

But still you're taking pleasure
In everlasting trance
Still you keep on feeding
On your own ignorance
