Exposing sources of absurdity
Among the refused foundations
Lies theory of anger
Which is the replacement for your reality

Driven by the phantom pain
Provided by the savage architect
Deprived of senses will find the panacea
So clearly visible yet so hard to detect

Driven by phantom pain
How can you live a life of hypocrite
When false constructions crumble

Join the circulation
To which you've become a witness
Empty shell
Craving for the void
Your will is now
Your sworn enemy
Your desires are caged in agony

Join the ceremony
Approach the altar of obedience
The more you suffer
The more you gain
Dogmatic contradiction
That made you fallen prey
To the phantom pain
