My hell is crowded
With angels of regret
My heaven's overburdened
With a swarm of living dead

It's funny how
This animal
Became the ultimate predator
When it only feeds upon its own flesh

The seed has grown
The birth machine goes on and on!

Immune to pestilence
And spared by war

The one who got the party started
Did you ever think
That it would end this way?
That your gift would be abused
By those made of clay

Worn out
By hate
This world keeps turning faster
Let's get it straight
We're heading for disaster
All empty words they speak
Drown in noise
But only for so long
The birth machine goes on!

In the age of sin
We are slaves to this machine
But now the only thing we are told
Enjoy your perfect life in a perfect world

Worn out
By hate
This world keeps turning faster
Let's get it straight
We're heading for disaster
All empty words they speak
Drown in noise
But only for so long
The birth machine goes on and on!

It's funny how
This animal
Became the ultimate predator
It's funny how
This animal
Became the ultimate predator
