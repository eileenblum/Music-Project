Words
Shallow excuses
For those pleasures of ours
Born
Of hate and abuses
Dreams
Lost in my network of scars

Cut me loose of the strings
Placed in the hands of the ignorant fools
'Cause starting today I'm gonna have my own way
And do what I choose
So cut me loose

Voice
Of a personal demon
Drowned in the echoes of hounds
Noise
Of my private redeemer
Scream
Ripping the ocean of sounds

Cut me loose of the strings
Placed in the hands of the ignorant fools
'Cause starting today I'm gonna have my own way
And do what I choose
So cut me loose

Now
The darkest hour's getting
Close
But never mind your fear
Now
It's time to clench the fist
For those
Who've finally made it here
