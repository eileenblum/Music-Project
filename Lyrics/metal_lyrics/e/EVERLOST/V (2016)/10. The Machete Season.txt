Through the static
I hear them call my name
This frequency of malice
Keeps me from remorse and shame

Will they grant forgiveness?
Will they teach me wrong from right?
Lost in the headlines
This inconvenient genocide

Let go of reason
No turning back
The machete season
Those words poisoned me
And revealed the enemy
Destroy to create
In the name of hate

In these trenches
Horror has a face
Traitors and invaders
They need to be erased

In their final hour
When all is said and done
Will this land belong to man
Or to the beast that I've become?
