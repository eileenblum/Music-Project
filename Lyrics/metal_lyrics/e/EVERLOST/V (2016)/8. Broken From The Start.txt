Every moment of day
Every waking hour
People sin and betray
So let them feed on each other

But you're
Trying to mend
Imperfections of men
Hey, what you see is what you get
In this godforsaken land
My will is done
And regrets I have none

I've filled my life
With hatred for the black lit sky
You see, love is not enough
For people kill the things they love
And I won't miss
Those who try to get me fixed
It's hardly smart
'Cause I was broken from the start

I'm broken from the start
Broken from the start

I am trapped in these walls
And it's safer within
Walls built from the stones
Thrown at me by those without sin

By those
Trying to mend
Imperfections of men
Hey, what you see is what you get
In this godforsaken land
My will is done
And regrets I have none

I've filled my life
With hatred for the black lit sky
You see, love is not enough
For people kill the things they love
And I won't miss
Those who try to get me fixed
It's hardly smart
'Cause I was broken from the start
