Traversing
This burning landscape
I miss the pouring rain
And all the years I wasted
Trying to be me again

There stands among the mist
A place of many fortunes
Oasis of my sins
The shelter of my virtues

I'm guided by the star
That shines upon your towers
Concealed within your walls
The secrets of our fathers

Rise from dust and blood
A child of eternal war
You're blessed by God
The one to witness your fall

When the earth beneath the sky
Did not even bear a name
Were the gods just like men
With their desire for fame?

The city of thousands
On its way to demise
Doomed from the start
But I beg you to

Rise from dust and blood
A child of eternal war
You're blessed by God
The one to witness your fall

I've waited too long
Oh, my Babylon!
Every man dies alone
In this Babylon of my own
