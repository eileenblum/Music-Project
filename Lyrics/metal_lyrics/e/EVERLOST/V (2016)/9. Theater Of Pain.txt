I dare you to look
Straight through my eyes
Visions you'll see
Of fear and denial
Shrines of forbidden emotions and desires

People who grew
Afraid of the light
Lions led by sheep
Afraid of the fight
Waiting for night
But tomorrow never comes

Welcome to the show
Enjoy the front seat
Pleasure's for granted
But it's pain that you need
Wait! Don't you leave!
We have only just begun
To have some fun

Lost at the theater of pain
Wasting your lives
In the web of lies
Keeping your feelings restrained

I dare you to crawl
The dark of my soul
Shadows of my thoughts
Condemned to these walls
Empty illusions
To feed the nameless ones

Welcome to the show
Enjoy the front seat
Pleasure's for granted
But it's pain that you need
Wait! Don't you leave!
We have only just begun
To have some fun

Lost at the theater of pain
Wasting your lives
In the web of lies
Keeping your feelings restrained

The nameless ones
Enjoy the front seat
Pleasure's for granted
But it's pain that you need

Lost at the theater of pain
Wasting your lives
In the web of lies
Keeping your feelings restrained

Wasting your lives
In the web of lies
Keeping your feelings restrained
