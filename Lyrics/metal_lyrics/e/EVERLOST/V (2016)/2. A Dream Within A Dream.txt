Once in a while
I dream I'm alive
In a world of my own
But as I get back
The sky becomes black
My heart becomes stone

Watch all your schemes and plans
Misplaced
Destroyed by helping hands
Erased
And all the hopes you had
As good as dead
Life is idle
Death is final
But can't you see
There's something in between

A dream within a dream

Once I'm awake
I'm surrounded by fake
Colorless smiles
Writhing in pain
Inside the domain
Of spiders and flies

Deliberately caged
Enclosed
Too weak to be enraged
Disposed
And all the hopes you had
As good as dead
Life is idle
Death is final
But can't you see
There's something in between

A dream within a dream

Tonight
Abyss calls out to abyss
That's the voice you can't ignore
The light
Invites you into the dream
No mortal ever dreamt before
