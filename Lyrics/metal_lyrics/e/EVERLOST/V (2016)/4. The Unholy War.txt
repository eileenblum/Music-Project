World is a will to power
And nothing else
The unholy war for cheap pretense

I hide my face
From this disgrace
The price of fame
Is mine to taste

So as we look upon the sky
We fail to see
That heaven is a lie

You can't reap what you sow
On this treacherous soil
As you struggle for breath
In the serpent's coil

Every single day
Oceans wash away
People with no need
To indulge their greed
Every fortune spent
In this tortured land
Keeps you wanting more
Stronger than before

The unholy war

We climb in vain
Up the food chain
But fail to see that heaven
Is not to blame

Every single day
Oceans wash away
People with no use
For a dead man's shoes
Every fortune spent
In this tortured land
Keeps you wanting more
Stronger than before

The unholy war
