Down we fall
To be cleansed of all
Sins and virtues
And on we fight
Dying to invite
The gentle vultures

Through the idols of lust
They try to gain our trust
With the treasures of another world

No man is a prophet here
Why can't you see?
The ones who will light our day
Are here to stay

What gifts do we bring?
Moral bliss and doublethink
Those things you can't live without
So join our cargo cult
