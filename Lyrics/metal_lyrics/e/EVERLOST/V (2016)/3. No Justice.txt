When the sky turns bleak
When the air's too thick
Don't be surprised that you've got
Nothing left in your hands
But sand and mud

As the sun goes dim
Just like it was foreseen
Don't be surprised when you see
Nothing left to hold dear
There's no justice in here

No justice in here
And no saints or sinners
I'm above the weakness
Of judging you

Learn to condemn when you've learned to forgive
Learn how to die when you've learned how to live

Oh, it's been too long
Since I knew right from wrong
Since I had the need
To blame you mortals
For your wrath and greed

Look, here comes your messiah
One to take you up higher
One to drag you to hell
Torments or bliss
It's your decision as well

No justice in here
And no saints or sinners
I'm above the weakness
Of judging you

Learn to condemn when you've learned to forgive
Learn how to die when you've learned how to live

No justice
Why can't you see?
There is no justice here
There is just me
