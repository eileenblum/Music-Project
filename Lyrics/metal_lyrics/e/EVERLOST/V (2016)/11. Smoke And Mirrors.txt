Fed with noise of the street
Stands the temple of concrete
Our salvation is for sale
Meet the one who doesn't fail

You'll never be the same

Built on greed, born from blood
Last resort to Neon God
Witness to his solemn reign
Watch in awe as he reaps again

I breathe this poison
Just to feel alive

I want to see
Through your smoke and mirrors
I disappear
In the echoes of your nights

You'll never be the same

Now I wear the dead man's face
Forced upon me by this place
Thousands watching through my eyes
Shadow's silent acolytes
