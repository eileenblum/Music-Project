[originally by Pungent Stench]Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
What a big waste for a body like yours
The absurdity of burials rack my brain
All those valuable corpses why should they stay unused

For God your soul... For me your flesh

Your mortal remains are too good for hungry maggots
That's why I dig you out from your last resting place
I hope it's not too late cause it would be a pity
If the decomposition already has advanced

For God your soul... For me your flesh

I think that's a fair bargain
For me your flesh, for me your bones
For me your brain and your entrails
I'll prepare you you got my word of honor
You will look nearly alive
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Don't be afraid I'll prevent it
