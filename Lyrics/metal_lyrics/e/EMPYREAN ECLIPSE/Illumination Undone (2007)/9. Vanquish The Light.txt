Look at my tortured body
With your needles plunged deep inside
The tattered Edge of my black-toothed grin
The life I live condemned to sin.
Peel backs a fingernail and you will find a piece of me

The bible I burn
The cross I shun
Vanquish the light
Illumination undone

The rage inside is now a gaping hole
Black eye blind, a sinful soul
I am your religion, twisted perfection
Scream the pain inside, live the life I hide

Chained and tortured
But all in my head
Subconscious pain
Turned to physical awareness
Existential suffering
Manifesting madness
Coarse and rotten skin
Amiss blood vomit eyes
Broken wings shadowed by a tattered dawn
Empty eyes burn within a face silhouetted

Ominous visions
Of an inevitable fate
A viscous debt collected

The bible I burn
The cross I shun
Vanquish the light
Illumination undone

The bible I burn
The cross I shun
Vanquish the light
Illumination undone

Rapture of us all, stranger spoke in tongue
As he stole the light, left us all with none.
