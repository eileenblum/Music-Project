Away from this existence
Alone I die
Emotionally severed
Lethargic spine
No one here, forsaken attachment
Pain dulled, ostracized attainment

Anchor me down
Six feet under ground
And ferry my soul away

Here where the past and the future collide
I will never be left alone
Chaos left me to the fates
Here where the past and the future collide

Here I birth upon the shore of time
Brought forth by a mortal demise

Here where the past and the future collide
I will never be left alone

Troth in darkness
Doleful in appearance
My soul bereaved

It moved convulsively
Emerging sickening shapes
Sand beds blaze black

Troth in darkness
Doleful in appearance
My soul be raved

Alone I die
Alone inside
Alone I die
Alone suicide
