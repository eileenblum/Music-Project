Scourged, blissful dying
Mesmerizing
As your life dissipates
Mutilation as it fades

Death,
Hatred rising
Pulverizing
As your soul levitates
Humiliation as it fades

I, Will Master
All that once was your flesh
Trough, thy torture
Your journey has come to an end
All your longing
Are just dreams that ever come true
Hope, a memory
As my blade ravages you

I crave your horror
I despise your soul

Whore!
I'll paint your face in torment
Lust!
In what I take from you

As you fade to nothingness
I consume my ecstasy

Blood, spilling out
With ever singular pulse
Numb, without shame
For ripping you body apart
Cold, now breathless
I blaspheme your body with ease
Screams, of pleasure
For you are now my disease

Scourged, blissful dying
Mesmerizing
As your life dissipates
Mutilation as it fades
