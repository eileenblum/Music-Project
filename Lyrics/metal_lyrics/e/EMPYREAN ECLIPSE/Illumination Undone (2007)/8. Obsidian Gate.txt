Gruesome shapes writhe across the endless sky
Cloaking all but the last red dying rays of sunlight
Voracious gulfs spit static whips
Whence I walked in a wicked paths into the cemetery
Slated arms
Horrendous fissures cleft the sky apart
To open from the dimensions lost
The time has come?
What waits in the chiasmic rifts will return

Open wide?
Breathe disease?
Winds of pestilence seethe
Throw wide the gates
Infestation shall lay waste

Vaporous winds emit a staunch, disgusting stench inside the crypt
Descending long down jagged steps into the pit
Where vaulted arches inscriptions seek to conjure charnel sects
Invoking what lays dead but dreams until release is set
With each spoken word of evil verse in an ancient tongue
Granite effigies hissed their answers sickly back to me as one
As I spoke the scents of ionization began to rise
And as I spoke the
Obsidian Gate emerged before my eyes

Open wide?
Breathe disease?
Winds of pestilence seethe
Throw wide the gates
Infestation shall lay waste

Beherit your graves, rise from R'Lyen
Reclaim your behest
The dead, the beast
This rebirth, I release

This infestation sets
The howls of beats' incest

Gateways still vomit filth
From now until the last Obsidian Gate!
