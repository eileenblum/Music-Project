Summon from the earth the wisdom of corpses.  From unlight abide in the thoughts of decay.  Upon ancient icons the spirits rest.  The obelisk of impending misfortune and agony.  Rebirth in the pools of ash and feces.  Their temples descend below the earth.  Their savior decayed upon the tomb of the world.
