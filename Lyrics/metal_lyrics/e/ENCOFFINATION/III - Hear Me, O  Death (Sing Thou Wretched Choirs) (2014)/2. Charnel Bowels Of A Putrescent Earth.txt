The heaving earth awaits.
From the deathless heavens purge the pitiful dead.
Their salvation lies deep in the bowels of the earth.
A depthless chasm to which we are borne; ascension from grave to dust.

A stench of humanity's putrescence will one day devour the earth, to it's bowels we again returnâ¦
