Beyond the embodiment of the pleasure you know as death.
Unto forsaken hallways of stone and beneath rotting inscriptions your reliquaries are abandoned.

Human flesh for the inferno of sanctity befalls it's doom.
The mould of centuries ensnares your dreams, sepulchered with all death, with all holiness, with Godâ¦

Dead forever, beyond forever.
