From his blood we will come to know perfection; death.

In his body we have become whole, with his blood we are empty.
A chalice of holy blood poured to our lips, devour his flesh to become holy.
Our heaven will be in his grave, heralded by the equality of death.
Let the blood make you whole; let the flesh be your rapture.
