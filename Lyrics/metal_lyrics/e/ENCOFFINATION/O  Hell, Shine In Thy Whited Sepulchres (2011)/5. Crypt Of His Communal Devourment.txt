Below the stones aligned for sacrifice,
Beyond the pillars of grief-stricken facades,
Upon ashen temples lieth his flesh
Mass of burial for the holy shroud,
Mass of devourment of his body and blood

Into the earth among the dead
Into the body among the waste
His communal ingestion, 
Devoured and passed as the filth into fire
