Prepare the flesh for inhumation
The body is weak, to be whole again
Upon the pale divine the death is whole
Limbs are gnarled and frail, extend thy hand to receive thy poison
Prepare the ritual incision
Lift the vessels of life, blood follows the poisons of man

Injection of the communal fluids... the flesh is bleak and poised to exist again
Massage the limbs of the newly dead; distribution of the divine poison
The body is poised in reverence, devoid of spirit, soul, or life
A fleshen offering to the god of death
