A cadaverous illumination upon the stone
Anointest thy brow with the viscera, holy; sacred
Temples enshrouded with the flesh of death, 
Communes flooded with the entrails of life

Hold thy organs as an offering of blood, extended to the congregation

Holy; sacred

A filthy chalice filled with the anointed offal, 
Pourest out thy offering back to from which it came
Suture the unholy shell with the ligature of dead angels
