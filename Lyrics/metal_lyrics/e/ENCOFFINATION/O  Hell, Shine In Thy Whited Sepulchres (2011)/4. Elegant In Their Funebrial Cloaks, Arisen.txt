They gather as a commune of ritual
Shrouded in cloaks of blackest putrescence
Preparation of the mass of unholy burial
Chanting as one, guide the newfound death

Their crypt-born voices fill the tombs with the songs of death
Wretch the hymns of their requiem
Arise with their song and they eulogize the coming of ends
Elegant in their blackest formality, arisen
