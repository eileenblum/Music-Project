Laid before the temple floor
Upon the altar of ritual cleansing
Prayers before the ceremony of burial
Bathed in the liquid of fevered death
Wash away the filth of humanity

One last repose before given to the earth
A final entitlement of life's virtue
Spared of the anatomist blade

Upon twilight thy death is given to the ground
Washed and buried before sundown on the day of death
To the earth swalloweth the dead, to the dead, rest of Ã¦ternity,
Untouched by the tools of man
