WANDER AMONGST THE DEAD. Their arms gnarled in ecstasy. Their faces drawn and feverish. These are the halls of DOOM, forever inscribed are the words of filth. Awaiting a personal HELL; rot. These catacombs beckon, the pathway to HELL. Beyond the grace of FLESH go I, beyond the future of ash and into the pools of fire.
