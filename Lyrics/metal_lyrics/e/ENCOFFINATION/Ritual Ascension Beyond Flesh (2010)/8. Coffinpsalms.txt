EXHUME THE FLESH FROM THE EARTH OF HELL. Reborn into the circle of flame. Rapture incarnate evolved. REPENT at the foot of false hope. The bell tolls the coffin psalm. Blessed is the creation of the MOCKED and REVILED. He who stands at the foot of the stone. The downturned cross set ablaze. For soon the wicked shall inherit this place of death and call this home of GRAVES.
