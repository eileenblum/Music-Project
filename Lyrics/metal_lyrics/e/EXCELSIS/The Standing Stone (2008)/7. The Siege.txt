[Chorus]
We're falling, we're running,
this is the endless calling,
We're fighting we're dying, now!
We're falling, we're running,
this is the endless calling,
We're fighting we're dying, now!

Tonight we fight, my brothers in arms, tonight my life is in your arms,
Born for the battle, born to the fight for the cross and for the right
Guardians in front of the line, before the sun will shine,
Guardians of the cross in the front line, before the sun will shine,
Soldiers, they came; soldiers, they did fall, we shall end them all!

[Bridge]
Oh Voices!
I breathe, feel my mind, I breathe, feel life,
I breathe, feel my mind, I breathe.. I am alive...

[Chorus]

Through the dark of night, I saw my brothers fall,
Behind the walls of this town, we're waiting for the fall,
And they told us we were winning, heroes of the forgotten time,
Thousands of my brothers must be gone, only 42 guardians in my lines

[Bridge]

[Bridge II]
memory of the forgotten souls, somewhere in this night,
memory of the forgotten sons, somewhere in this light,
In the memory of the forgotten sons, somewhere in this light,
Burg zum Schutz und ou gÃ¤gs FÃ¼Ã¼r, escape to the castle of angels,
Burg fÃ¼r Ã¼si LÃ¼t mit iserne TÃ¼r, escape to the castle of angels,

[Middlepart]
The Siege

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
