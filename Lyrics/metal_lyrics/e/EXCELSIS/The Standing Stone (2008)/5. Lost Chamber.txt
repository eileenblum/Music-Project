I walk alone on the deadly line,
Over the bridge I ran,
Where my wife is waiting
Bearing the wounds in my soul

[Bridge]
I hear the voices in the night, Somewhere.. still he cries
feel my end is in the light, where the soldiers lie

[Chorus]
Sleeping in the haze of the morning sun
Sailing away, to where the sunlight comes from,
Sleeping in the haze of the morning sun
Like the wings of the dragon, where it all began

[Chorus]

I see where I've been in my live,
I said (that) I will never die again,
I see myself walking without fear,
My own chamber will be the last (thing I will see.)

[Bridge]
I hear the voices in the night, Somewhere.. still he cries,
feel my end is in the light, where the soldiers lie

[Chorus]
[Solo]

Sailing away, where the sunlight comes from.

[Chorus (two times)]
