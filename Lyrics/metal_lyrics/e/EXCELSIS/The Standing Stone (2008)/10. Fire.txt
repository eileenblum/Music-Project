Treasures, in the name of gods,
books of eternity, power of this words,
Faces,( the) mirror knows this crime,
(a) broken promise, one more time

[bridge:]
it's just the pain, just another day in (the) fire,
it's just another way,
it's just the pain, just another day in (the) fire,
it's just another way

why, there is a open flame
Burning in my soul, with endless pain,
I try, try another way,
Someone's king has to pay

[bridge]

[chorus:]
walk alone in the dark with you, in the shadows I run,
fight alone in the light with you, behind the clouds and the sun,
walk alone in the dark with you, in the shadows I run,
fight alone in the light with you, behind the clouds and the sun

Treasures, in the name of gods,
books of eternity power of this words,
Faces, (the) mirror knows this crime,
a broken promise, one more time

[Bridge]

[Middlepart]
SchtÃ¤rbe...alleini ir nacht,
wÃ¤rde...mir nit mit dir macht,
kÃ¤mpfe...mit au Ã¼sre chraft,
Ã¼s ergÃ¤nze...das s jede es schafft!
SchtÃ¤rbe...alleini ir nacht, wÃ¤rde...mir nit mit dir macht

why, there is a open flame
Burning in my soul, with endless pain,
I try, try another way,
Someone's king has to pay

[Bridge]
