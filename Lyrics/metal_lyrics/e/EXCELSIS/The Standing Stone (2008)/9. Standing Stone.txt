voices of freedom in the howling wind,
dragons fly free with their mystic wings
Strong and proud, banners at the top,
Somewhere on the endless rock

[Bridge]
This is the place, this is the grave,
Where my brothers lie

Horns and flutes speaking final words,
Its time to pray together with the lords
Heat and fire, the rage inside my head,
Children and wives, taking away their last bread

[Chorus:]
This is the place of the standing Stone in the middle of the street,
This is the place of the standing Stone in the middle of the street,
Fire, wind and thunder, nothing can destroy the holy stone,
Time, rain and soldiers, nothing can break the holy throne

I think of old times when I look into your eyes,
Remember the days we fought, sword in the hands,
follow the stars hovering darkness,
rage is so deep and the journey is endless

Soldiers are ready for die..

[Chorus]

[Middlepart]
FÃ¼Ã¼r, Wind, sogar der Donner, nÃ¼t zerschtÃ¶rt dr heilig Schtey,
und mir kÃ¤mpfe, bis es Ã¤ndi vor WÃ¤ut, und ihr dÃ¤nket, mir kÃ¤mpfet fÃ¼r GÃ¤ut!

[Solo]

voices of freedom in the howling wind,
dragons fly free with their mystic wings
Strong and proud, banners at the top,
Somewhere on the endless rock

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
