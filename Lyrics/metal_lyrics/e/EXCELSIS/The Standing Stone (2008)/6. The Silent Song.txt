This is the silent song, close your eyes and tell me now,
hear the voices, the voices in your mind
What have your enemies done, with the lives they (have) counted on,
tell us what they (have) found, and tell us what they (have) found
They saw the clouds, they heard the thunders,
They feel the suffering in the wind

Wake up and find yourself,
brothers side by side,
your gave your swords to keep us alive,
we are falling down closer to the ground,
fight and die and I will follow now..

[Bridge I]
Life is nothing but the time of decay, take the ending path,
Endless skies behind nameless graves,
must be a brave.

Screams in the night, in a misty night,
welcome to the halls under the sky,
We are never going back, through the pages of the past,
now we wish the sky would say..

Would say, would say, would say...

[Chorus]
This is the silent song,
close your eyes and tell me now,
They saw the clouds,
they saw what your enemies have done
This is the silent song,
close your eyes and tell me now,
They saw the clouds,
they saw what your enemies have done

[Bridge I]

[Middlepart]

[Chorus II (two times)]
Illuminated skies "Liechtermeer",
somewhere in the night "i der nacht"
we must die "ha d SchtÃ¤rne gseh",
somewhere in the light "I der schlacht"

[Solo]

[Intro-part]
This is the silent song,
close your eyes and tell me now,
hear the voices,
the voices in your mind

[Chorus]
