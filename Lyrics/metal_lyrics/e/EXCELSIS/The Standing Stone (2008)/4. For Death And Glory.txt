[Chorus]
For death and glory, for sun and rain
Living without midnight and no more pain

Death and glory

When the stars begin to fall when the way begins to end,
Open your eyes and look around, somewhere in this land,
moments of magic as we are standing behind the shadows of this wall,
Banners flying so high, horns begin to play

[Bridge]
We are standing here, face to face
Like thieves in the night, sword by sword
We are standing here, face to face,
Like thieves in the night, sword by sword,
at the will of a lord, for honour and gold
Royal dignity...

Have you ever flown so high on the wings of hope?
Have you never broken the rules for cross and robe?
for cross and robe

[Chorus]
For death and glory, for sun and rain
Living without midnight and the end of the pain

moments of magic as we are standing behind the shadows of this wall,
Banners flying so high, horns begin to play.

LÃ¤be u Tod Sunne u Schnee
FÃ¼res LÃ¤be nachem Tod, fÃ¼rd Sunne nachem Schnee!

[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus (two times)]

We die for you on this stony ground to the greatest sound of battle,
falling, we find no sleep, I give you my soul to keep,
Shining bright, the last golden night, we will take the lost way home
