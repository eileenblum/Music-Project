[Chorus]
Across the rivers, across the lakes, over the mountains, without a break
Across the meadows, trough forests, trough the valley like a quest,
The march begins, the march for the right, the march through the darkest night,
Across the rivers, across the lakes
Across the meadows, trough the forests,

Looking up to the sky, acid rain burning in my eyes.
On a path, the journey takes us south to where the sun will rise

[Bridge 1]
fading moon in the sky is what they talk about,
Why are we destined to wander throught time, let the dreams come true

[Chorus]
Across rivers, across lakes,
Across meadows, trough forests,

Stories are made to be told, here is one that I know
Too many nights without days, too many days we were lost

[Bridge 1]
fading moon in the sky is what they talk about,
Why are we destined to wander throught time, let the dreams come true

[Middlepart:]
Zoberscht uf dÃ¤m HÃ¼gu, warte ufs Zeiche ir Nacht,
wÃ¤rde dÃ¤nke, wie mÃ¤ngi Schtunge, mir furt si Ã¼sre Stadt!

[Solo]

Looking up to the sky, acid rain burning in my eyes.
On a path, the journey takes us south to where the sun will rise

[Bridge 1]

[Chorus]
