Pray..
As soldiers ravage the earth at night,
their swords and shields at to their side
The time has come for all of us,
To find the end where your must die

[Bridge:]
The king holds the cross to his eyes,
for his victory he's left behind
the king rides into the dark of the night,
Towards home, soldiers side by side

[Bridge 2]

[Chorus:]
Oh voices !!
oh lord, please come to me,
(and) give me the armour of gods,
one day you will see,
warriors in the armour of gods.

Time flies away, away from me
It has gotten out, out of reach,
The whole land is turning, I will survive,
Remember the tales, memories will keep us alive.

[Bridge]

[Middlepart]

As soldiers ravage the earth at night,
their swords and shields at to their side
The time has come for all of us,
To find the end where your must die

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
