We're lost in this time
Ride with the clouds and take us away

This is the name of a great old eagle
We're the servants of a godly bird
This is the name of a great old eagle
We're the servants of a godly bird

And I want to ride on your back, away
Far away where the sun will shine
And I want to ride on your back, away
Far away where the sun will shine

So I, I close my eyes, open my mind
And fly away out here
So I, I close my eyes, open my mind
And fly away out here

Show me the way, I want to carry on
Gwaihir, the name of this bird
Show me the way, I want to carry on

Clouds, rain and water will never stop me, now
We must fly over fear and leafy crowns

We must fly over fear and leafy crowns

Far away where the sun will shine

And fly away out here
