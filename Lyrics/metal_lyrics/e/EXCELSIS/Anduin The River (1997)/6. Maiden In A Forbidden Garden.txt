Close your eyes and walk around
Close to the magic dreams
Far away the sign of the bells and the fog of the fear
Leaves whispering in the wind, shadows show me the way
Listen what the darkness says, when you try to run away

This is the rose of the maiden in the forbidden garden
These are the secrets of her mind
This is the rose of the maiden in the forbidden garden
These are the secrets of her mind

I'm lost behind the bed of roses
I'm lost behind the bed of roses
I'm lost behind the bed of roses
I'm lost behind the bed of roses

Look around, go and find the bed of roses in the darkness
Step inside and take one for your secret garden, secret garden

This is the rose of the maiden in the forbidden garden
These are the secrets of her mind
This is the rose of the maiden in the forbidden garden
These are the secrets of her mind

I'm lost behind the bed of roses
I'm lost behind the bed of roses
I'm lost behind the bed of roses
I'm lost behind the bed of roses

I am a man, sacred only in this garden, in this garden
You're the maiden and left your secrets in this garden, in this garden

This is the rose of the maiden in the forbidden garden
These are the secrets of her mind
This is the rose of the maiden in the forbidden garden
These are the secrets of her mind

I'm lost behind the bed of roses
I'm lost behind the bed of roses
I'm lost behind the bed of roses
I'm lost behind the bed of roses

This is the rose of the maiden in the forbidden garden
These are the secrets of her mind
This is the rose of the maiden in the forbidden garden
These are the secrets of her mind
