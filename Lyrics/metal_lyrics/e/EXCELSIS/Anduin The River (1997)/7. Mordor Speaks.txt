Silent in this land
Around the dark shadows
Footsteps deep in the sand
Brown are the meadows
Is this the invasion of the dark lords hand
Or the regeneration of the dark evil stand

I am your blood, I am your enemy before I die
Will fight with my sword, will fight to Sauron the dark lord
I am your blood, I am your enemy before I die
Will fight with my sword, will fight to Sauron the dark lord

The end of the ways are in Mordor
I hear the death voice into the night
The end of the ways are in Mordor
I hear the death voice into the night

Sam by my side, and the crows are black on this day
My good old friend, we'll flight side by side
We search the hills of faith for the grave of the lost ring
These are the last days, look backward and sing

I am your blood, I am your enemy before I die
Will fight with my sword, will fight to Sauron the dark lord
I am your blood, I am your enemy before I die
Will fight with my sword, will fight to Sauron the dark lord

The end of the ways are in Mordor
I hear the death voice into the night
The end of the ways are in Mordor
I hear the death voice into the night

The end of the ways are in Mordor
I hear the death voice into the night
The end of the ways are in Mordor
I hear the death voice into the night
The end of the ways are in Mordor, Mordor, Mor- Mor-dor
I hear the death voice into the night
The end of the ways are in Mordor
I hear the death voice into the night
