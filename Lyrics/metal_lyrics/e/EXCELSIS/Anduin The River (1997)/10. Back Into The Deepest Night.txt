Learn now the lore of a living law, the four
Victory, death and glory and last the war
Learn now the lore of a living law, the four
Victory, death and glory and last the war

Smog in the trees, I can't find the way out
Bag-pipers play a song, for outlaws only one

Warlords, knights and fighters follow me with pain
Thunders, clouds and riders, through the grey old rain
I am the king of this battlefield, I am the lord of war
I am the king of this battlefield, I am the lord of war

Silent in the dark, nearby by us, 5000 side by side
Waiting in the night, we miss the sky, we're waiting for the fight
Silent in the dark, nearby by us, 5000 side by side
Waiting in the night, we miss the sky, we're waiting for the fight

Warlords, knights and fighters follow me with pain
Thunders, clouds and riders, through the grey old rain
I am the king of this battlefield, I am the lord of war
I am the king of this battlefield, I am the lord of war

Silent in the dark, nearby by us, 5000 side by side
Waiting in the night, we miss the sky, we're waiting for the fight
Silent in the dark, nearby by us, 5000 side by side
Waiting in the night, we miss the sky, we're waiting for the fight

Dark, night, sky, light
Darker than a hole, waiting in the night
Higher than the sky, back into the light
Darker than a hole, waiting in the night
Higher than the sky, back into the light

Back in the deepest night, waiting for the fight
Back in the deepest night, waiting for the fight

Back in the deepest night, waiting for the fight
Back in the deepest night, waiting for the fight
Back in the deepest night, waiting for the fight
Back in the deepest night, waiting for the fight
