In the dales of Scotland I walked in the spring
[...] the colors and scents, [...] the colors and scents
And I said that was good, I wandered in the summer
And I thought that was the best

To the beeches of the highlands I came in the autumn
These are the tales of a silent song
The gold and the red, the whispering of the leaves
To the beeches of the highlands I came in the autumn
Tales of the tales of a silent song
The gold and the red, the whispering of the leaves

Far away, far away, far away, far away into the highlands
Far away, far away, far away, far away, far away into the highlands

My rose went up and sang in the sky
And now all these lie back in my mind
And I walked and sang in the highlands
My rose went up and sang in the sky
And now all these lie back in my mind
And I walked and sang in the highlands

Yes, this is my song of a land in the north, a never, a neverending, a neverending, neverending story
Yes, this is my song of a land in the north, far away from home, far away, far away from home

Far away, far away, far away, far away into the highlands
Far away, far away, far away, far away, far away into the highlands

Far away, far away, far away in the highlands
Far away, far away, far away in the highlands
Far away, far away, far away, far away, far away in the highlands
Far away, far away, far away, far away, far away into the highlands
