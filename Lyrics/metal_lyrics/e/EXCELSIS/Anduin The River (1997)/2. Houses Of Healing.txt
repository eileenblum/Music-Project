Deep within the defense wall
Down in the town of Minas Thirith
I am looking forward
To find the houses of the healing

This is the city which helps when you cry out
These are the people with the healing hands
This is the city which helps when you cry out
These are the people with the healing hands

When I hear the silent voices
I can feel the mystical hands
When I hear the silent voices
I can feel the hands
Yes the hands
Yes the hands

In a dark room in the night
Silent in my mind
Look around and you will find, will find
The house of the healing

This is the city which helps when you cry out
These are the people with the healing hands
This is the city which helps when you cry out
These are the people with the healing hands

When I hear the silent voices
I can feel the mystical hands
When I hear the silent voices
I can feel the hands
Yes the hands
Yes the hands

This is the city which helps when you cry out
These are the people with the healing hands
This is the city which helps when you cry out
These are the people with the healing hands

When I hear the silent voices
I can feel the mystical hands
When I hear the silent voices
I can feel the hands
Yes the hands
Yes the hands
