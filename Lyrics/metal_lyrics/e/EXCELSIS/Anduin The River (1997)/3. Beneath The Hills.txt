You can see the sign in the sky, where the eagles fly away
We're lost in the mountains, far away from home
Snow blocked my way, we must turn back now
Listen what the sagas say, through the gates of Erebor

Back to a hole, which the Gods forgot
Back to a neverland, which the Gods forgot

This is our only chance to take us to the exit
This is our only chance to take us to the exit

I will go beneath the hills
I will go when the enemy comes
I will go beneath the hills
I will go when the enemy comes

In the gates of Erebor are so dark, so dark and cold
Take us to the halls of the dwarfs, to the king of the dwarfs
We're the grey company, and the great old wizard
Take us to the lands of the free, yes, the lands of the free

Back to a hole, which the Gods forgot
Back to a neverland, which the Gods forgot

This is our only chance to take us to the exit
This is our only chance to take us to the exit

I will go beneath the hills
I will go when the enemy comes
I will go beneath the hills
I will go when the enemy comes

In the gates of Erebor are so dark, so dark and cold
Take us to the halls of the dwarfs, to the king of the dwarfs
We're the grey company, and the great old wizard
Take us to the lands of the free, yes, the lands of the free

Back to a hole, which the Gods forgot
Back to a neverland, which the Gods forgot

This is our only chance to take us to the exit
This is our only chance to take us to the exit

I will go beneath the hills
I will go when the enemy comes
I will go beneath the hills
I will go when the enemy comes
