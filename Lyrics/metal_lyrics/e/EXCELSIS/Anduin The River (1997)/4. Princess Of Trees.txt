Born in a house of stone, top on this street
Lives a girl so beautiful, can't she feel my need
Galadriel was the name, the rose
She has brown hair so long
She fights with her heart, so wonderful
Her will is so strong

Fly little dragon and take me away
Far away to the church made of trees
Fly little dragon and take me away
Far away to the church made of trees

The breeze is so fine when you smile
In your eyes one fire
Your heart is so warm, you don't know my love
Accept my desire
I want you everytime and your lovely smile
Your healing hands are gently fine, please take my heart and smile

Fly little dragon and take me away
Far away to the church made of trees
Fly little dragon and take me away
Far away to the church made of trees

Fly little dragon and take me away
Far away to the church made of trees
Fly little dragon and take me away
Far away to the church made of trees
