A broken sword is the last sign
that I dream, when I wake up in the present time
in Koppigen stand ruins
shadows of the templar in my dreams
and the stone which we can't find

[Pre]
A word, a light, one secret mind
a sign, a lord and the broken sword
that  is the last thing I will find

...was the dream that I feel
the lost secret dream, was the dream that I feel

[Chorus]
Just dreaming we're inside
with Baphomet's oath
these are the only tales
and they take us back to Kurt's time
with Baphomet's oath

[Solo parts]

A broken sword is the last sign
that I dream, when I wake up in the present time
in Koppigen stand ruins
shadows of the templar in my dreams
and the stone which we can't find

[Pre]

[Chorus]
Just dreaming we're inside
with Baphomet's oath
these are the only tales
and they take us back to Kurt's time
with Baphomet's oath

[Outro]
