Silent in the darkness of mystic
when I travel through the dark
on my way to Ãnz by the forest
to find a girl so strong in love

Swordstrokes I feel, careless to me

A dream of a wife
the crowning to my life

Born in a house near by the forest
Where the honoured lords want to live
in the middle of a trade route
where the hill begin to fall

Swordstrokes I feel, careless to me

[Chorus]
This is the tale of a girl like a nightingale
this was the night, when my heart began to break
beware the sign of Agnes' song

Born in a house near by the forest
Where the honoured lords want to live
in the middle of a trade route
where the hill begin to fall

Swordstrokes I feel, careless to me

[Chorus]
This is the tale of a girl like a nightingale
this was the night, when my heart began to break
beware the sign of Agnes' song
