In this place, far from home to me
blood in my body, faces in my souls
destiny is my reality of the daylight
behind me on my horse, the wild hunt is near

Went the footprints of malice follow your soul
then you will think it's too late
when the faces of your enemies in the fog
start to hunt you
look up and see the distant sky

[Chorus]
This is the point in Kurts life,
when his mind is shinning bright
take a dream of a holy world,
Bachtelenbrunnen is the point of a new return

Oh, oh, oh, lost in the sky
lost, lost in the fog of faith
forgotten resolutions are destryed in my soul
please God, help me tonight, the wild hunt will kill me
the wild hunt is just in my mind...
The rrots of regret are deep in Kurt and take him to another lord
the meaning of life under control

In this place, far from home to me
blood in my body, faces in my souls
destiny is my reality of the daylight
behind me on my horse, the wild hunt is near

[Swiss-German]
Wart nid ab, wart nid ab... wenn's z'spÃ¤t isch, isch's z'pat...

Went the footprints of malice follow your soul
then you will think it's too late
when the faces of your enemies in the fog
start to hunt you
look up and see the distant sky
