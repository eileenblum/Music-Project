I am running out of time, so Kurt can't sleep tonight
the lost chapter begins to end, the message of heaven starts to send
don't believe what you hear, believe what you feel
then I know what is real... and thew lost chapter begins to end

Don't look in the heart of strangers, eyes of the evil
the last of the secrets of Gods, dragons fly again, no tears and no pain
with the angels to heaven again
what is real in my soul, open the pages at chapter one
never take... this way before... somebody's just open the doors

[Pre]
Like the signs of the silver shadows
like the moonshine in the night
like the graves on the old green meadows
this part of the lost chapter starts to send

I hear for an answer to all, the things in my life...
it takes me back to childhood again
the voice of my mother, feel the tears of my father
I hate you, I hate you again

[Pre]

[Chorus]
I feel the moment to say goodbye, hope and fear performed my mind
what will follow when I must die, the lost chapter, darkness... the light

Now are coming my ancient days, my raimbow turns to dark
this is the end of all my ways, the circle of life closes the curse
...and the lost chapter begins to end

Don't look in the heart of strangers, eyes of the evil
the last of the secrets of Gods, dragons fly again, no tears and no pain
with the angels to heaven again
what is real in my soul, open the pages at chapter one
never take... this way before... somebody's just open the doors
