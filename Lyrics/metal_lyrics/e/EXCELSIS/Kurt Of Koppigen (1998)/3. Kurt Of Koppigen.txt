I am a king hallowed by my name
in this little village here
my mother said to me you're just an errand boy
and the church is the losers frontiers

[Chorus]
This silent rage, that makes me brave
and takes me to the holy grave
it's the history of Kurt

And let me hunt in the country of Bern
I want to fight so strong
bring me to the Gods
but my problem is, I have to be alone

[Chorus]
This silent rage, that makes me brave
and takes me to the holy grave
it's the history of Kurt

Alone... so strong... I want to be a king
and in his mind he went back in time
a name of the brave... back... into the fantasy

And let me hunt in the country of Bern
I want to fight so strong
bring me to the Gods
but my problem is, I have to be alone

[Chorus]
This silent rage, that makes me brave
and takes me to the holy grave
it's the history of Kurt
