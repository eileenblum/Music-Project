Just like a spider in the web with its flies
down through the forest of the Aare-Valley
a hunter, a vagabond of the lies
from Solothurn to Huttwil the king of the thieves

The dragonslayer he'd like to be
evil is his destiny

A hunter, a lord of the night
a vagabond and a king of the lies
a hunter, a lord of the night
a vagabond and a king of the lies

Just like the wolves hungry for flesh
this man is so hungry for cash
a sword in his hand - destroy and destruction
he wants to be a king of corruption

The dragonslayer he'd like to be
evil is his destiny

A hunter, a lord of the night
a vagabond and a king of the lies
a hunter, a lord of the night
a vagabond and a king of the lies

A dream of luck for all his time
freedom, glory and o crime

[Chorus]
In memory of a dragonslayer
In memory of a dragonheart
ohhohohohohoho...
In memory of a dragonheart
