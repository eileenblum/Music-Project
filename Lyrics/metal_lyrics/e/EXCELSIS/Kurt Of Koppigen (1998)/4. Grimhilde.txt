In holy lands beneath the sun
where the floers rise in spring
lives my mother on the holy throne,
she wants to be the queen

The queen over darkness and hate
and creatures of the night
but I will think it's too late
your life goes ever on and on

[Pre]
Out from the door where it began
No far ahead your life has gone

[Chorus]
but she can see deeper in your soul,
and she can take, the illusions in your soul
but she can see deeper in your soul,
she takes the illusions in your soul... illusions in your soul

Through here at journey's end she lies in the dark, so deep,
believe in God, it is too late, I hope she dies
above all shadows rides the sun,
where the stars forever dwell,
I will not say your life is done, but it is still too late

[Chorus]

[Swiss-German]

Bosheit roubt dir dini Seeu
Hingerlischt stiuht dir di Verstang
fÃ¼r Goud u Stuber, fÃ¼r das machsch aus
sogar vor em TÃ¶te mauchsch du nit haut

In holy lands beneath the sun
whee the flowers rise in spring
lives my mother on the holy throne,
she wants to be the queen

[Chorus]
