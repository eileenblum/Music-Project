This is the story of the lord of Halten
this is another chapter of this book

Wherever I've been lost in the sky, felt the inmortality
Whenever I've forgotten the lights, the dark tower of reality (x2)

Top of the tower near the forest of Koppigen, the lord of Halten on his hill
with seven daughters by his side, takes him to the holy pride
the crown of Halten for a man, a hero, to be the king of the Wasseramt
the rising sun waits for the command, to be the king of this land

[Pre]
take his crown in your hands
let him be the lord of this land

With the scepter of power like the water for flowers
my sword takes me on his side
with the power of glory like the poison of beauty
the mirror of love takes me on its way

[Chorus]
The lord of Halten down in the rising sun
The lord of Halten when the twilight has begun

...in the morning sun

Top of the tower near the forest of Koppigen, the lord of Halten on his hill
with seven daughters by his side, takes him to the holy pride
the crown of Halten for a man, a hero, to be the king of the Wasseramt
the rising sun waits for the command, to be the king of this land

[Pre]

[Chorus]
