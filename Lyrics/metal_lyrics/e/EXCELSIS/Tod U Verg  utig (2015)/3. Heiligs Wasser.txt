U loh mi do lo wohne... nÃ¤bem Wasser im Tau...
loh mi bie lo lÃ¤be... de schiint d Sunne scho ban...
uf de HÃ¼gle liegt dr Schnee... was wott ig no me...
aus hie blibe u z si... schunnt dr Chummer nie me

Near by us there is a church
They're waiting for all... they're waiting for her...
They're waiting for the birth of this child...
to spread the holy water as a shield of light...
Defenders of all evil at the night... 
For faith and glory... for life and for...

...Fight and live ...longer... fight... 
this water makes stronger...
Against the evil... against the night

They fear neither death nor devil, neither hurt nor hate...
But the lord in the hills, they do not want to bother
They're flying away... year to year... and it comes as it must come
The lord is suddenly greedy and... tyrannical...
Cursed and damned... everything he encounters...
Bad and mighty... sad and evil...

Hail for this water... hail for the king 
Hail for these mountains... hail for this ring...
For the good and the brave of this land...
For the people here... where I stand...

Heiligs Wasser dert i dÃ¤m Tal, 
beschÃ¼tzisch Ã¼s... vor so mangem Fau...
vor bÃ¶sem u schlÃ¤chtem i dr WÃ¤ut, 
vor Herrscher u Tyranne mit viu GÃ¤ud!
