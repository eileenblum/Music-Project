Buried in the valley where the skies are gloomy,
This tale was carved in stone
The hunters enraged a head removed,
The master of Rossberg can't come

[Bridge]
Death to the man, faithful to avenge,
Women disgraced all the while,

Here comes the man, to be a hero,
The hood pulled over his eyes,
Fight and die in the name of gods,
The best markman of that age

In the name of the axe, runs through his mind
For freedom and justice all time

[Pre Chorus]
Fallen angels are everywhere
Somewhere in your mind,
You have to stay when the nightfall must come,
And these are the words of the blind

[Chorus]
In an area in the center of Switzerland,
Lives William Tell
In a land so dark
In a land so dark, where the skies are cloudy

Two sons and a wife, make his life so real,
The truth is curical to him,
Will fight on the side of his friends
Death to Gessler all time

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Bim Urischtier, bim Urischtier
Do ha ig einisch gschwore,
Das ig bi nere Schlacht nid zwoite miech
Scho mi Vater het sis Labe verlore

Pre Chorus

Chorus
Land so dark and could... could
