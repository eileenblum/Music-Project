What have the arrows done
To form the path we see,
The pain the rage that I see,
It doesn't follow me,
And the victory of this life,
They take his holy forms,
As Gessler goes into the hell,
Your lords must never be born

[Bridge 1: Instrumental]

Echos of suffering
Through the darkest night,
Forget the laws of the enemies,
All the order bloody right,
Against the black empire
A defense wall of men,
Now thats your desire.....
Helvetia strikes (back) again

[Bridge 2]
Zundet ds Fuur doch a
D'Schlacht isch da

Bridge3
This is the time for the holy crusade,
This is the time that Gessler falls
This confederation is now together,
The confederation waits for the one

[Refrain]
Hillflames on high,
Signs in the sky for the fight
Hillflames on high,
Signs in the sky for the fight

[Bridge 4]
The tales of our lives,
Away in memories,
The spirit of all time,
Living in our dreams,
In a land built out of nowhere,
In a lot of lies,
The future in their hands

The power of your will
Is here to carry on,
The darkness was erased,
The faith is keeping strong,
He walks through the lane,
Heading his places he's been,
Is this reality,
Or a dream within a dream?
