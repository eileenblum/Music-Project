Hate and pain from the highest hills,
The time will come when we can'not stand still
The price of honour we will pay,
Against Gessler we will stay

[Bridge 1]
Stand up for your right,
Die if you must during this night

(I) often walked in this valley before,
But the crossway always closed its door
All that I want is much too high,
I'm going to Heaven where you're alive

[Bridge 1]
Stand up for your right,
Die if you must during this night

[Refrain]
I must tell you the tomorrow Song,
Behind the mask in a land a long
Time ago in a corrupted zone,
Was time for revolution against darkest crowns

All the people in the heart of the town,
Hear the voices of the black crows
A maiden stopped... please remember me,
I'm the king, not anywhere to be

[Refrain]

[Bridge 1]

[Refrain]
