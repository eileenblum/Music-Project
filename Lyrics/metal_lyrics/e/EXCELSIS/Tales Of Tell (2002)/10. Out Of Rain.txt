On Tells journey, through his land,
Disfigured bodies lie on the battlefield
Like a leafe in the storm,
Behind the mountains, behind the mountains,
Where my fathers were born
They work together 'til they die,
The perception of voices of lies

[Bridge 1]
Traveling through the dark,
The trail so far - hollow lane!

I can feel it coming down,
The rage in the air frees us of our pain
Now that your kingdom has to burn,
Now that it ends in a death
The final shoot, it has arrived,
From the sky it came to bring your destiny

[Refrain 1]
The wind is out of rain
The seeds of eternal pain

[Bridge 2]
I saw the diabolic armies,
They fight to the friends to their fall,
I saw the frozen souls,
They cried so loud, then the pain had sung
I can't shoot the arrow into the sun,
But I can shoot, shoot it for the sons

There is no light, there's no sun,
Where have the tales all gone?
Into an unsafe past, to a nameless place,
There is no hope for Helvetic sons
Into the hollow lane, I'm waiting for the faces,
The faces that Gesslers body carries on

[Bridge 1]

[Refrain 1]

[Refrain 2]
The time has come for the hollow lane,
The arrow must fly into the blackest rain!

[Bridge 2]

[Bridge 1]

[Refrain 1]
