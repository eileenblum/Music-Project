The end of this sacred story
I'll always remember this
I will, too, so you can follow
In hours of pleasure and pain

[Bridge 1]
And I will preach in this light,
I can't fall through this night,
Will awake in my own time
In my own time

I was born in this land
I grew up in a jungle of stone,
I felt the hate of all men,
But I fought my way up alone

[Bridge]
In cities in halls,
Revolution, to have a land
Raise your swords to lords stonecold,

[Refrain]
Dreams of a this time
Scenes from long ago,
Years have to flow,
.....memories still survive

In the distance far away
Escape in me, dreams let me out,
I can remain and feel the pain,
Of a land where the mountains sleep

[Refrain]

I feel the rain on my face its running down on me,
I lay in the grass in the alps,
This is the dream about my life,
Where my fathers want to, fathers want to fight

In the distance......

[Bridge 2]

[Refrain]
