And the machine is moving, just above the time
The wheels of time are singing, and the years are passing by
Warriors of the Helvetic cross, standing in front of the line
I was sent by the sky, step on the break and stay

Abwarte...
Ushaute...
D johr lanke...
Zyt schanke...

If you ever forget this holy place, the legends are going to die
Used to be a fighter in this twilight place, for only to tell this tale

And the future was gone
Only darkness still hung around
The perfect sign for to come, fur ds cho...
I hope for a place
Where the winds are screaming so nice
Travelling through the time is tough

A bell rings in the wind
As my machine stopped in time

Now, I am telling you an ancient tale
A tale of ancient man
A man from a land not far away
Travelling to the past

From a year I came
The seeds of the slavery
Nothing can stop my way
Have seen it all before
It goes on forever and more
The time of another chapter is near

U d'Zuckunft isch gange... nume d'Dunkulheit hanget umenang!
The future... was gone... only darkness... hung around!

And the future was gone
Only darkness still hung around

I hope for a place
Where the winds are screaming so nice
Travelling through the time is tough

U d'Zuckunft isch gange... nume d'Dunkulheit hanget umenang!
The future... was gone... only darkness... hung around!
