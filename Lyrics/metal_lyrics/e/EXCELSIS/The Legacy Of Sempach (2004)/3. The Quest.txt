Leopold's quest through Zofingen to Willsau started
On July the eighth on a summer day
Freedom now, for the Austrian king, my lords
He is taking the future on his own tale

Hail to the banner, spears and shields
The quest to Sempach, (in order) to fight

Dark cloudbank in the eastlands, silence before the storm
(The) Austrian lord is sending out his messengers
Commands have been given, hornsounds across the sky
The waiting has begun, under control of the night

Let us stay till the helmets are broken
We fight for Leopold's right

Quest to the battle
Of the Helvetic armies
The curse of the future
It goes along with you
Quest to the battle
Of the Helvetic armies
Pages of historical tales
Are telling you the ancient news

The machine drops me off at the forest nearby the pack
My hands are bleeding wounds, but the way must go on
I feel the steps of the Austrian knights on the ground
The landing was wrong, I can't wait for too long

Sang awag
It is the wrong place in the middle of these trees
Reis awag
To the territory with confederation breeze

Travelling away
Through the hole
To another place
Away from enemies
Of this time
To the city of lakes

Quest to the battle
Of the Helvetic armies
The curse of the future
It goes along with you
Quest to the battle
Of the Helvetic armies

Und I reise, cifach witer, an angere ort, as isch gschider
Schauter drucke, cifach witer, glichi sekunde, 1000m witer...

As isch jetz sowit, ig ha scho fasch gnue vo de reise dur die zyt
Uheiligi schmarze, die loh mir ke rueh, zum gluck ischs numme so wyt!
As isch jetz sowit, ig ha scho fasch gnue vo de reise dur die zyt
Uheiligi schmarze, die loh mir ke rueh, zum gluck ischs numme so wyt!
As isch jetz sowit, ig ha scho fasch gnue vo de reise dur die zyt

I'd go through the hole of time, where the lights are shining bright
Like a rebirth through a firewall
I feel my aching skin, he takes me to the other side
Somewhere at the lake
Between green meadows and people they pray
Lonely warrior, take a break...
I lost my soul in this place, like visions of a brave world
