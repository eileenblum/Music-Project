I'd travel through the hole of time, where the lights are shining bright (S liecht das schiint)
Like a rebirth through a firewall I feel my aching skin
He takes me to the other side somewhere at the lake (uf am See)
Between green meadows and people they pray
Lonely warrior - take a break...

I lost my soul in this place, like visions of (a) brave world
I lost my soul, verlorini seeu

Lands belonging to my mother, lies golden to my feet (Zu de fuess)
I want to stay forever here, but it's not very real
A cozy village on the lake side
In middle of a place (schwizer platz)
Knights with banners, shields and knives waiting for revenge

I lost my soul in this place, like visions of (a) brave world

In my life and in my brain
I would never travel again
Inside myself I was wrong
This is the right place to stay and to pray
In my life and in my brain
I would never travel again
Inside myself I was wrong
This is the right place to stay and to pray
...I lost my soul, verlorini seeu

I dam dorf vo de
Helvetische hit go z'wohne -
Das, das war doch racht
Numm reise dur die zyt
U hie blybe zum wohne
Jo das war nid schlacht
Sie luege zu de aute huser us
U gseh wytwag mi gstaut
Wurd haufe u kampfe
Dass es frei blybt eues huus
U freiheit fur's ganze land...
I bi gspannt...
I bi gspannt...
I bi gspannt...
I bi gspannt...
I bi gspannt

Verlorini seeu
Verlorini seeu
Verlorini seeu
Verlorini seeu
Verlorini seeu
Verlorini seeu
Verlorini seeu
Verlorini seeu

In my life and in my brain
I would never travel again
Inside myself I was wrong
This is the right place to stay and to pray
In my life and in my brain
I would never travel again
Inside myself I was wrong
This is the right place to stay and to pray
...I lost my soul
Verlorini seeu
