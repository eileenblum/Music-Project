Warriors, you can't stay so far from home
In this confederation night, you must go or stand alone
The thunder is rising, take the last escape
Endless pain and fighting, this is (the) time to break

Tonight give up the battle of our destiny
Let us hear it now, man at arms died for eternity
The thunder is rising, take the last escape
Endless pain and fighting, this is (the) time to break
In pain you seek the way out now, how many miles away
Your country goes where your gods will pray, and children try to stay
...and gods will pray and children stay...
...and gods will pray now...
...and gods will pray and children stay...
...and gods will pray now...

Now, it is time to die, don't tell me why
You warriors say goodbye, get home and tell the lies
This is the bag with the heads of your friends
A warning from your enemies from the hilly lands

Brothers in arms, forgotten in the night
In fear and in pain, in this senseless fight
The thunder is rising, take the last escape
Endless pain and fighting, this is (the) time to break
In pain you seek the way out now, how many miles away
Your country goes where your gods will pray, and children try to stay
...and gods will pray and children stay...
...and gods will pray now...
...and gods will pray and children stay...
...and gods will pray now...

Now, it is time to die, don't tell me why
You warriors say goodbye, get home and tell the lies
This is the bag with the heads of your friends
A warning from your enemies from the hilly lands

Brueder ir Ruschtig
Vergasse i dr Nacht
Ir Angscht und i Schmarze
I dere sinnlose lange Schlacht
Blitz u Donner zicht jetz uf
Mit are riesige bose Macht
Zu de Gotter wei mir batte
Das dr Himu uber us wacht

...and gods will pray and children stay...
...and gods will pray now...
...and gods will pray and children stay...
...and gods will pray now...

Now, it is time to die, don't tell me why
You warriors say goodbye, get home and tell the lies
This is the bag with the heads of your friends
A warning from your enemies from the hilly lands

...and gods will pray and children stay...
...and gods will pray now...
...and gods will pray and children stay...
...and gods will pray
