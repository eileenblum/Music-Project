How many miles you walked away (bisch furtgloffe)
So many times you had to pray (hesch battet)
So many nights you didn't sleep (hesch nid chonne schlofe)
Far away in your own land (wyt awag i dym eigete Land)

Deep inside your strange mind (fromdi gedanke)
Works a force we've never seen (wo mir nie warde gseh)
It's not so bad, think (of it) all the time (dank immer dra)
We think you're the chosen one (du bisch dr userwautnig)

You're the master of the dreams
You're the king of the minds
Maybe you're the chosen one
Warrior of Heinrichswil

Now it's time for standing up (zyt zum ufschto)
Remember, you're not alone (bisch nid allei)
Spread it now, the tales of your life (gschichte vo dym labe)
And think... you're the chosen one (du bisch dr userwautnig)

You're the master of the dreams
You're the king of the minds
Maybe you're the chosen one
Warrior of Heinrichswil

Far away in a strange land
A warrior fights alone
The war against the armies of the force in his mind
And illusions must go

You're the master of the dreams
You're the king of the minds
Maybe you're the chosen one
Warrior of Heinrichswil

Lost in the tale of the forgotten ones
Searching for the lights that are going on

Lost in the tale of the forgotten ones
Searching for the lights that are going on
Behind the mask of normality
Searching the ways for reality

You're the master of the dreams
You're the king of the minds
Maybe you're the chosen one
Warrior of Heinrichswil

Now it's time for standing up (zyt zum ufschto)
Remember, you're not alone (bisch nid allei)
Spread it now, the tales of your life (gschichte vo dym labe)
And think... you're the chosen one (du bisch dr userwautnig)
