Now, the return of the dragonslayer is near
The warrior of the chosen one
The last hero under the sun
Immortal life so beautiful
Your pain won't leave your soul
With lots of spears, her facing the death
The fights are beginning here but the one man starts this war
Warrior, a son of the freedom
Warrior, you are not unknown

The first time you have spoken the holy words
I will die, I felt my own sword
And my journey is rushing through me like the blood deep in my veins
Here are the warriors of a small land, but I remember your name

Warrior, a son of the freedom
Warrior, you are not unknown
Warrior, a friend of (all) those I need
Warrior, you're never alone

With lots of spears, her facing the death
The fights are beginning here, but one man starts this war
The brave one tried to make this time, the time in a human lane
Don't cry, (try) to understand that I feel the pain

Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno
These are the words of the one
Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno
The last words of the one

Return of the dragonslayer
The warrior of the chosen ones
Return of the dragonslayer
The last hero under the sun
Return of the dragonslayer
Immortal life so beautiful
Return of the dragonslayer
Your pain won't leave your soul

With lots of spears, her facing the death
The fights are beginning here, but one man starts this war

Warrior, a son of the freedom
Warrior, you are not unknown
Warrior, a friend of (all) those I need
Warrior, you're never alone

Ir erschte Zyt hani die heilige Worter gsproche
I ha gseit, i wott starbe fur mi Sohn und mi Frou
Einzig mit mym Schwart i myre Hang
Wird ig die schwari Reis atratte
Aber dir, dir wardet mir gedanke
Ime chlyne Land e Kampfer
Wo fur immer e Heud wott blybe

The first time
When I saw you
I will die
For my son and for my wife
I will die
For my son and for my wife

The brave one tried to make this time in a human lane
Don't cry, (try) to understand that I feel the pain

Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno
These are the words of the one
Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno
The last words of the one

Return of the dragonslayer
The warrior of the chosen ones
Return of the dragonslayer
The last hero under the sun
Return of the dragonslayer
Immortal life so beautiful
Return of the dragonslayer
Your pain won't leave your soul
