Tears in her eyes, left home as heroes
They crossed the hills, they fought for glory
Warriors, when they returned, blamed for the damage
She is in your memory all the time

We will remember until the morning light
Calla palustris on your side
She is the guardian of the night
Between armour and skin of the Austrian knights

He died in the battle nearby the lake
Somewhere on a dirty ground
The skin must go, the seeds are rising
Somewhere on this dirty ground

We will remember until the morning light
Calla palustris on your side
She is the guardian of the night
Between armour and skin of the Austrian knights

The death brings you the seeds of the flowers
In the middle of an ancient land
The death brings you the seeds of the flowers
In the middle of an ancient land

We will remember until the morning light
Calla palustris on your side
She is the guardian of the night
Between armour and skin of the Austrian knights

When you are wandering through this town
Smell the flowers with the white crowns
Then you'll think it's never too late
They are the victims, damned to die

We will remember until the morning light
Calla palustris on your side
She is the guardian of the night
Between armour and skin of the Austrian knights
