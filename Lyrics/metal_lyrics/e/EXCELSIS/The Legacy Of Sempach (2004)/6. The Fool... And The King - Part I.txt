The night is dark, the night is still
Somewhere on my way to the church hill
I saw the moonlight on this lake
I saw the fool in his secret cache

Welcome to the old forest, my king has deadly fears
My king has frozen tears, my lords must go back
Gods of this mountain, they have no understanding
Enemies in the distance, you must (go) back

The time has come - we all know, this is your only time
We all know where we have to go, on you way back home
This is the time of the last regret, your mission is now done
The opposition of (the) secret

Armies under different flags (in the morning sun)
Waiting down at the lake (the lake)
My king you must turn around now (around now)
The judgement day has passed by

He's the fool and you're the king
The enemies are growing stronger
He's the fool and you're the king
Helvetic spears are longer
He's the fool and you're the king
You are the liar
He's the fool and you're the king
I think it is your desire

Take your chance and turn the key (take it and turn the key)
Open the door to another history (another history)
Here's no future, no demand (no future no demand)
Here's the place for my dreamland

Welcome to the old forest, my king has deadly fears
My king has frozen tears, my lords must go back
Gods of this mountain, they have no understanding
Enemies in the distance, you must (go) back

He's the fool and you're the king
The enemies are growing stronger
He's the fool and you're the king
Helvetic spears are longer
He's the fool and you're the king
You are the liar
He's the fool and you're the king
I think it is your desire

Dr Heini vo Uri am Chonig si Narr
Dr Heini vo Uri u syni Wort mache klar
Dr Heini vo Uri macht am Chonig Bei
Dr Heini vo Uri seit oich got doch hei!

Desire

Desire
He is the fool and you're the king
Desire
