Now it's time that my journey starts, my pain, my sins and the broken parts
This is the end, somewhere in time, and (my) machine stopped at the front, at the lines (at the lines)
The gods decided, what's right, what's wrong
Alone in this timehole I was lost
Sunlight shines that unleashed the storm
Time for the heroes, now it's time for rebirth (rebirth)

Fight against the armies of hate
Fight or it is too late
Fight against the armies of the lord
Fight with your Helvetic swords

Back as a man of the gods
As a hero in whom we trust
Immortal lands in the sky
I'm waiting for my time

Now it's time to say goodbye
A warrior in the front of the line
Take care of my wife and my son
In the next dimension I will come

A lane against enemies I will gain
With spears in my hands, until darkest night
A lane against enemies I will gain
For my land, for my son, and for my wife

We are kings, we are fighting through this time
We are kings, a man catches the spears in line
We are kings, he died for the future rimes
We are kings, these are the forgotten signs
We are kings, we are fighting through this time
We are kings, a man catches the spears in line
We are kings, he died for the future rimes
We are kings, these are the forgotten signs

The gods decided, what's right, what's wrong
Alone in this timehole I was lost
Sunlight shines that unleashed the storm
Time for the heroes, now it's time for rebirth

He fights the black to save the truth
He fights against the secret lies
The wall of enemies (he) will destroy
Fight with spears 'til they die

Back as a man of the gods
As a hero in whom we trust
Immortal lands in the sky
I'm waiting for my time

Now it's time to say goodbye
A warrior in the front of the line
Take care of my wife and my son
In the next dimension I will come

A lane against enemies I will gain
With spears in my hands, until darkest night
A lane against enemies I will gain
For my land, for my son, and for my wife

We are kings, we are fighting through this time
We are kings, a man catches the spears in line
We are kings, he died for the future rimes
We are kings, these are the forgotten signs
We are kings, we are fighting through this time
We are kings, a man catches the spears in line
We are kings, he died for the future rimes
We are kings, these are the forgotten signs
