Leave for a country, that doesn't hurt you, there you will
Find war and death to no avail
Leave for a country without borders and all you will find
Is homesickness
Uechtland afar, we fear you
Your swamps and your calm, I fear them as well
Uechland you wait until you catch someone
With your dirty arms you seize those with fear
