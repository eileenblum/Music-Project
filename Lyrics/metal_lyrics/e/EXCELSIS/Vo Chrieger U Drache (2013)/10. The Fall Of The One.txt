One, two, three, four!
I will fight, and you will remember me
Against the behemoth of the night
Yet, all will be different, because my brother cannot be here
The dragon goes to battle against me
We fight... until we can fight no more
We fight... until only one remains
We fight throughout the night
My life has parted from me, you have imprisoned my soul
Through one thing I promise you... my brother will take revenge
