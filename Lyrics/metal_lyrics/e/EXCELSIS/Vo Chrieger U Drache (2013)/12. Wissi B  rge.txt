On the white and snow-covered mountains a fire blazes
And watches over us
It waits for the ghosts to arrive through the cold night
You will see... the white mountains
There lies the snow
That will never melt
There our ancestors live and are content
Glory and honor will endure
Yes, on these snow-covered mountains, I want to gain strength
I look to the sky, I look into the night
That is the dark and peculiar might
