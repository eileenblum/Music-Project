I'm getting colder and colder,
And I still don't understand
My loneliness is dragging me to the bottom,
I'm heading towards madness.
Maybe I didn't know how to seize these opportunities
And I'm dying or while you're away

It seems to be an eternity
Since I last heard your voice
Come... and change this terrible reality...

I don't want to live far away from you...
I'd like to see this love grow in your eyes again.

My heart is only ice now
Nothing is erased forever
No one can take your place.
Time heals some wounds, but the scars live on !
Not one day's passed by whitout my thinking of us.
I'm wandering in my memories,
Dealing with mistakes and regrets.
Frost has crept over my whole body,
And everything is worsening around me.

And I'm dying or while you're away
It seems to be an eternity
Since I last heard your voice
Come... and change this terrible reality...

only one step lies between ice and death...
The bell is tolling ! I'm doomed !
You didn't wait for me...
Everything is over !
You won't ever come back...

Only one step lies between ice and death...
You didn't wait for me...
Everything is over !
You won't ever come back...
