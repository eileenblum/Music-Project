Like all those stories that unfold
Under our eyes
Like movies without heroes

Where only the victims have the leading role !
What a sad destiny ! What a sad reality !

And nothing gets better,
Madness has crept over the people !
Evil is growing.
Life and death are almost one.
The rest is written like music paper.
And that's when everything becomes tragic...

And yet, everyone can change his path
And attain his aim...

Too much violence, too much hatred...
Everything is an excuse for confrontation.
And the reasons don't hold water !
Only lies and contradictions...
Is life still worth living ?
I don't know, but I remain so disappointed !

Like all those stories that unfold
Under our eyes
Like movies without heroes

Life and death are almost one.
The rest is written like music paper.
And that's when everything becomes tragic...

The more time goes on...
The more my dreams pass away...
And the future looks very dull for me...
But who will get us out of this dead end ?

Where only the victims have the leading role !
What a sad destiny ! What a sad reality !
