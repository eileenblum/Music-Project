And I remember everything,
The best as well as the rest.
You've never promised me anything
But I could have it all.
Only sheer pleasure !

But I see you disappear
Like a star vanishing within the sky
You leave me here like a traitor
Unable to be better.

Yet, you've really tried
To constantly fight that inner ennemy,
Which was gnawing you little by little
And preventing you from coming back to life.

You didn't notice anything, and yet, 
You, who were living only for me
You'd have given your heart away
So that our love would be immortal

You kept smiling at me,
I, who was living only for you
Would have given my life away
So that yours would be eternal !

So much suffering, so much despair
Due to the hiding of her pains within
And to feet a bottomless enticing abyss
Grow deep inside of you
Like a totally void ocean

AN the unlikelihood of your being healed,
I beg you ta face the life and death struggle
And hold on till tomorrow,
So that you could finally come back to life...
