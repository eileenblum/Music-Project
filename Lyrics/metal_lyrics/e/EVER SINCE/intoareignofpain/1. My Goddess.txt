My goddess, you who haunts my nights,
Why don't you come to meet me ?
Reign and power for eternity.
Come my beauty, together as one
We shall defeat the world.

I fall your coldness going through me.
But your presence restoring my strength
I can't see you but I know you're here
Show me the way so that I can finally deliver you.

It takes so long that I wait for this moment.
I've crossed centuries, alone, always alone...
Now I'm so tired !
I've explored all these worlds looking for you...
Never finding you.
I'm giving up, my heart is dying.

In this frozen night,
A storm is rising.
And death is coming to find me.
With dignity and without bitterness,
I went away with her...
I've crossed so many realms
Except the one of the dead..., of Death.

Finally, there you are, Goddess of my dreams.
Goddess of my nights.
Death has brought us together.
I'll never leave you alone now ...
