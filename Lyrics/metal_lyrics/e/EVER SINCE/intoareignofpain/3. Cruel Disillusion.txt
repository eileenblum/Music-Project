After all these days,
Watching our love grow,
Wishing too much to believe in it,
I've lost all hope ...

And you still don't understand ...

My feelings were not really bad
And gradually my fears go away ...
But my disillusion was huge
I who believed in you
Now I stay lonely,
Alone facing myself ...
Like at the end of a dream,
Followed by a painful awakening
In an unchanging reality ...

Everything in me becomes violence
I want to scream my pain,
To release all this hatred
Wish is heading towards you

But all is just patience ...

And one day my time will come.
My words will hurt you !
But that's the price I demand ...
To share my pain with you !
So that you can see in my heart
All this sadness that is mine !

And I will let you dive,
Dive in your depression
Until death takes you away ...

Repeat : Everything in me .....
Repeat : After all these days, ...
