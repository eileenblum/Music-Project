Pierce my heart so that I can live immortality.
Take my body forever in your arms.
Don't forget it among the unfaithful beings...
Take my soul in your incessant wind,
And let's go away when it's still time.

I've only lived once on this earth.
The one where I saw your reign appears.
But my living was short..., too short !
I've imagined this wind disturbing me one more time...
Its smoothness and its coldness deluded me...
My last breath before eternal rest...

And the wind turned into a storm
My body could not resist,
Its attraction was too strong...
It took me away...

I've found myself beside it.
Floating above the continents.
I cross the lands without laws, without boundaries.
I glide wherever I feel like.
Nothing or even nobody can stop me.

I'm the incessant wind,
Which fondles your faces and steals your thoughts
Fear me!
Or death will take you away!!!

Repeat: And the wind turned into a storm
