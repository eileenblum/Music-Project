During our body's sleep,
Our mind is linked with strangeness.
Which reveals none of its secrets, none of its pleasure.
It certainly doesn't wish it,
In order not to bother everybody's conscience,
And not to turn lives upside down forever...

The awakening of supernatural is done every night,
At anytime Morpheus fondles your face.
We are interested in the discovery of new beings, of new gods.

Just after our takeoff, everything seems so simple.
The heaviness of our wings doesn't disturb us anymore.
The only pleasure the mortals don't know,
Reach us at the right moment.
Just to forget our painful past.

Strangeness reveals us none of its secrets,
None of its pleasure.
It certainly doesn't wish it,
In order not to bother anyone's conscience.
Because one doubt, one fear and insanity could prevail.
