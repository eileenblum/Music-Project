Suddenly the sky darkens,
The sun doesn't shine anymore,
The clouds blacken the horizon,
The world stops turning ...
The night has invaded everything ...

Then chaos ...

Then this chaos that ends by reigning
All this violence,
All this hatred
Men are fed by disgusting images !
TV is showing us
Human stupidity through reality show ...

Moving into the 21st century to see that !!!!
Wars have not stopped yet ...
Tortures have not been forgotten yet ...
And religion is still causing a lot of victims ...

And I cannot do anything,
What a sadness towards so much desolation !
What are we leaving behind us ...
What kind of legacy for the next generations ...
The future seems so dark to me ...

Apocalypse is nearing
I go a little bit too fast
But by seeing the outside events
It seems that I have not much time ...
Solitude is invading me ...
And for me also, night is lingering forever

Repeat : This chaos that ends by reigning .....
