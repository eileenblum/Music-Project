My love faded â¦
Flown through a filter
Where only truth emerges â¦
And yours reflects only hatred â¦

I think the time has come â¦
To let go of all thatâs disturbing me,
To finally admit that something is wrong !

Dice are loaded 
the gameâs a fix â¦
Iâve not laid all 
my cards on the table 
yet â¦

Night princess,

A tragedy is unfolding before you,
Iâm not the one who keeps quiet â¦ and who follows â¦
And never â¦ Oooohh no, never â¦ !

Would I allow myself to be dragged so low !
Iâm in the opposite angle,
Iâm patiently waiting for the subtle moment

When I could declaim my reality â¦
Submissive, I was,
And you abused my trust
Like a child, I was deceived
But far off, I hear the tolling of the revenge bell â¦
And the fur is going to fly !!!
