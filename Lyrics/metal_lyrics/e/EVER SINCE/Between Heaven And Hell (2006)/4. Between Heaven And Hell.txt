And itâs here that my story starts again
What on earth have I done to deserve this ? 

Itâs the first time That life leaves me !
I donât know why ? But Death doesnât want me !

Is this Godâs Or hellâs creation ?
My life is splitting in two â¦

Whoâll be able to judge me
If even Death refuses to take me ?

Am i an angel or a demon ?
My soul is splitting in two
Who can tell me why â¦ ?
She didnât come to take me
