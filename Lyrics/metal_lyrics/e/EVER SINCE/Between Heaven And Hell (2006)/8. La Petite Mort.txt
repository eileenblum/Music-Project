Would you possess only heaven
Even if hell was given to you?
Wouldn't you taste life once
Even if I offered you eternity?

Swept by the cold breath
Of that small death
which takes us away
â¦ Both our bodies,
Thrill to the slightest touch
Of the tiniest caress!

But who's crazy?
The one walking in front of him or the one following him?
Who's crazy?
The one who stays in this world or who runs away from it?

Would you possess only heaven
Even if hell was given to you?
Wouldn't you taste life once
Even if I offered you eternity?

Having ended
Our wild rides
Much beyond reason
Like engraved in the depths
of the subconscious
Guided on the road of pleasures!

Insidious and haunting What else to do than â¦
Start again and again â¦My eyes riveted on yours,
Anxious to satisfy
your slightest desires,

To those impulses of ardour and complicity
From those refined pleasures, many a time given â¦
Facing that small Death,
that small Death

I delight in these instants
Preceding a uniqueâ¦ a unique moment
Similar to a powerful wave
Which leaves us satisfied,
half-dead â¦Till : Â« swept by the cold breath â¦ Â»

Would you possess only heaven
Even if hell was given to you?
Wouldn't you taste life once
Even if I offered you eternity?
