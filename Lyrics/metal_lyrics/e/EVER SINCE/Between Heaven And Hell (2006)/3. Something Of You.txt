Everything looks blurred to me
My clouded mind puzzles me 
Mentally racked, 
So many questions and so little truth

I didnât see the beyond 
But I returned with only one certainty 

I should stay here till the end â¦
Itâs impossible to slip away, the dice are cast

Iâm part of history But my role has already been written
I neither know the rules Nor the one who leads the play

Few answers, but only one reality â¦
My dreams are stormy â what perverse illusions !

Damned forever â what a sensitive situation !
Then like a cry piercing the night  Her face reappears before me
I donât know who she is ! But sheâs the only one who can tell me 
What Â« the future Â» has in store for me â¦

So many questions and so little truth
So few answers, but only one reality

Maybe itâs luck, Iâve to find her
