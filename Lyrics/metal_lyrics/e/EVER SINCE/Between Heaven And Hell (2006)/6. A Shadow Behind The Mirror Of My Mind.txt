Here and elsewhere,
I've suffered so many ordeals
Travelling all over the world
like
like a thief

Rather than just following me,
You got into my head to show me the way â¦
And it's what I did â¦ without without waiting â¦
White or black witch? your magic is
getting me out of despair â¦
In search of a single happinessâ¦ To be her,
be her beloved

Behind the mirror of my mind, you were hidden â¦

You read
my mind like a book
Sprouted from my most
profound fantasies â¦
Yet I have known
a good many women
Without however being moved
however being moved

Behind the mirror of my mind, you were hidden â¦
Nestled in darkness for a long time you let me look for you,

But what
a long way it was
To finally be as One!
Bewitched by this face,
Sent to me as an omen â¦
Good or bad?
Who knows that? It's too early to say
The game has hardly startedâ¦
Hardly startedâ¦

Behind the mirror of my mind, you were hidden â¦
Nestled in darkness for a long time you let me look for you,
But never were you far away!
You far away!
And finally, it's you who came to see me
