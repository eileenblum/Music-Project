A tragedy is unfolding before you,
I'm not the one who keeps quiet â¦ and who follows â¦
And never â¦ Oooohh no, never â¦!

Will I allow myself to be dragged so low!
I'm in the opposite angle,
I'm patiently waiting for the subtle moment

When I can declaim my reality â¦
Submissive, I was,
And you abused my trust
Like a child, I was deceived
But far off, I hear the tolling of the revenge bell â¦
And the fur is going to fly!!!

12. I'M JUST THE ONLY ONE

 And now it's time for revengeâ¦
Just a few words to the woman
Who wanted to conquer the world â¦
Nothing is like
what I picturedâ¦

After sacrificing me, she brought me back to life â¦
Fate is sometimes quite amazing,
From an ordinary mortal,
I've become
I've
Become Â« the Only One Â»

I tried to read in your look,
To find an emotion, a feeling â¦
But nothing â¦ only a dark and cold void
Like this blade which will pierce your ice-cold heart â¦

You thought you could love me â¦
But your reason has lamentably pushed me in
Your dearest wishes to conquer the Earth
To dominate these mortals, and corrupt their soulsâ¦

You thought you could love me â¦
But you pushed me towards oblivion â¦
And now â¦ I'm going to change
the course of the game
considerably â¦

All my excuses, as the choice would have been hard â¦
But anything can come out of me, the good as well as the bad â¦
My fury will be able to burst out, and prove that I'm Â« the Only One Â»

Betrayed by the one who loved you â¦
Loved at the point of being able to kill you â¦
And it's what I did â¦
So that our love could remain beyond time â¦
I took your life in return for my freedom â¦

My freedom â¦

Freedom â¦
