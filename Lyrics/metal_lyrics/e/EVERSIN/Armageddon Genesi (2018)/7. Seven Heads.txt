And so a beast came from the sea with seven heads and ten horns
A diadem for each horn and blasphemy for each head
Curses from its lion mouth, power of the dragon
The Earth admired its cursed power, undefeated wicked beast.
A beast with lamb horns came from the land of men, fire from the sky, ruling all mankind
Mark of the beast on the hand of man, its number or name to buy and sell, human is its number, six hundred and sixty six.
And from the sky an angel with chains, against the dragon in the deepest abyss.

Angels in a bloodred sky, demons speaking thousands lies, vindication, annihilation in the day of doom.
Seven heads of fear and seven heads of tears, Babylon the scarlet, Babylon has fallen.

And so it begins, the final battle, who shall win?
Gabriel is rising, the evil one is falling
Winds of destruction, prepare for Armageddon
The book of life is open, the seven seals are broken.

On Har Megiddo the wrath of God, prison of impurity Babylon death destiny
The seven cups upon the Earth, water of the sea turned into blood.

Angels in a bloodred sky, demons speaking thousands lies, vindication, annihilation in the day of doom.
Seven heads of fear and seven heads of tears, Babylon the scarlet, Babylon has fallen.
Angels in a bloodred sky, demons speaking thousands lies, vindication, annihilation in the day of doom.
Seven heads of fear and seven heads of tears, âI am the beginning and the end and I am coming soonâ.
