You lead the blind, you lead the fools
Believe the lie and close your eyes
Get on your knees five times a day
Pray for salvation.

A bastard world, a world of rage
Behind a black veil on your face
Hatred and pain what you adore
Pray for redemption

Killers, haters of life, iconized.

Lapidation, death on the streets
You kill your women in the name of creed
Who has no sin cast the first stone
Armed children, innocenceâs gone.

Kamikazes ready to die
Kill yourself, pain divine
Another head rolls over the floor
End of the games, they want control.

Killers, haters of life, iconized.

Legions - extermination, faith.
Legions - made of blood and shame.
Legions â unholy, false, insane.
Legions - obey! The dark doctrine of pain.

Pray! Arm! Die! Kill!

Get on your knees five times a day
A sick world, a world of rage
Hatred and pain what you adore
Your god is money, ask for more.
Kamikazes ready to die
Believe the lie, close your eyes
End of the games, they want control
End of the games, they want control!!!

Here is your god, money and pain
The reason youâre killing again and again
Soldiers of death, hatred and fear
Get down your knees, your ending is near.

KILLING THE BRINGER OF DEATH.
