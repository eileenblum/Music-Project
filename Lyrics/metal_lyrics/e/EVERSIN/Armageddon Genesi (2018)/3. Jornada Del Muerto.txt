Born from nothing, we are alone
In this world, reign of confusion
Flesh and blood, with no soul
Made for war and illusions.

Dying bodies, forgotten lives,
Old price for a new creation
Violations and common graves
A sad world so devastated.

We live in an age of living pain
Subhuman conditions of life
Purification through acid rain
Burning bleeding eyes.

Infections - growing in our minds
Oppression - feeding hate and lies
In chains - we lead our lives in vain
Again - we leave our race in pain.

Weâll be devoured by the Earth
For another useless war
In the name of future progress
Bastard children of mothers whore

In chains - we lead our lives in vain
Again - we leave our race in pain.

In the name of sin, in the name of pain, mankind dies
In the name of war, in the name of death, mankind cries
Jornada del Muerto
Jornada del Muerto

There is no future in a death creation
There is no future for our burned breed
In a world adoring annihilation
In a world where hate is what we feed.

And we are on the edge of oblivion
The embrace of dark for us all
And we are the engines of our failure
We built a world next to fall.

In the name of sin, in the name of pain, mankind dies
In the name of war, in the name of death, mankind cries
Jornada del Muerto
Jornada del Muerto
