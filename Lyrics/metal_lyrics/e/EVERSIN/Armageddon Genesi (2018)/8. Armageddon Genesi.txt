Wars burn the lands, eternal silence.
Fire tears the sky, we are so blind
Stars fall from above, pray for our souls
Now the time has come and all shall fall.

And the world becomes black and burned.
The man himselfâ¦an harmless prey.
The seed of life becomes the seed of rage
A dying godâ¦walks the Earth.

Seven heads from the dark sea
Scarlet Babylon in pain still bleeds
We are the shameful warbringers
We, born as ageless sinners.

We are made of ashes
We will turn into ashes

And behold! The Earth is burning bright
The day of wrath, the angels fall and die.

We are made of ashes
We will turn into ashes
In a world made of pain
Angels screaming in vain.

Endless pain, suffering in the abyss of hell.
Armageddon Genesi, war eternal rebirth.

Solar wind blowing from the dark
To the vision of a spiral maze
The seven lambsâ¦slain again
A bloodstained cross to save the world from lies
Angels cry foreverâ¦lies.

Gloria! Comes from the sky.
Gloria! We all shall die
