On a field made of skin and bones
Blood tyrants lead the way
Blind, deaf and dumb we are
We walk the field in chains.

From the sky and from the stars
Titans of fire speak
Dead soldiers with no face
Innocence is what we seek.

Guilty by our own nature
We are pathetic liars
With no rules we lived our lives
Stupid, useless parasites

Hand in hand we walk in line
As we walk, the old men die
Divine justice, divine wrath
For a reign of fools.

A throne of gold we see
With skulls and bones below
A howling wolf with two heads
With blood and fear he is fed

The abortion called society
Made of shit and bastard minds
People lived by their depravity
Without sense and without life

Selfishness and indifference
Money rules the world
Politicians, shitty men
Now itâs time to fall.

Memento mori, pulvis erit et in pulverem reverteris
Nunc et semper, nunc et semper.

There is a room with rapists in
Screams and cries from the inside
For those who lived in sin
For those who ruined their life.

The dark embraces us all
Firestorm from beyond
No light to show the way
Alone, we are led astray.

The gates are open
Itâs time for justice
The divine Judgement comes
Upon us all
The wait is over
The sky is boiling
Tears of fire are falling now
From the universe.

Saints and sinners we stand all together
Waiting for the one to come, the Maker
Women scream with fear, scared, full of tears
Eyeless creatures to burn their flesh.

There is a pool full of blood and money
With inside many lifeless bodies
Thereâs a writing on the wall
âPoliticians, first ones to fallâ.

Memento mori, pulvis erit et in pulverem reverteris
Nunc et semper, nunc et simper.

Itâs time to pray and die,
purification has come
A voice upon us all,
Time to give our soiled soul.

The flesh betrays the flesh
Forget, forgive and die
We stab our brother once again
Who is Abel and who is Caine?

To the gates of the abyss
To the gates of the abyss
To the gates of the abyss
We march
