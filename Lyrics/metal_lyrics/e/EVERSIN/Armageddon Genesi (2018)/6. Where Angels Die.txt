Into a world of frustration and pain
We are the unborn, we live the lie alone
And close our eyes, close our eyes and let the sin arise.

Lies! Lies! Lies!

Another angel is dying
Another mother is crying
Mutilation? No!
Suffocation? No!
Indifference and shame, hate forever.
A cry of pain rises, mother Earth withers
Insane eyes and insane minds
We love to kill
We love to kill at will.

Rivers of fire where angels burn
Forsaken liars to lead the world
Lives fade forgotten, children cry denied
Our souls lie rotten down there where angels die.

Cries! Cries! Cries!

The rain of fire is coming, upon the ground is falling
And from the edge of darkness, the titan brings his sadness

The screams of pain and vengeance, cracking the sky with anger
Another angelâs dying in the name of human madness
