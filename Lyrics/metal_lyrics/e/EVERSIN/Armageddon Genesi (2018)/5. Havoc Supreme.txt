Sin after sinâ¦Havoc Supreme!

In this world of cold creations
Births in lab, biohazard
Machine gods, dark evocations
Slaves and servants we are
Angels nailed for our salvation
on the Earth they shall fall
Burning eyes, no resurrection
Piece of meat with no soul.

Fallen stars from blood red skies
Tied in chains, we are purified
Revelationsâ¦machine breed
Annihilationâ¦human seed.

Slaughter, of the new born
In a world so cold and old
No redemption, genocide
Brutalized mankind.

Parasites to exterminate
Mistakes to eliminate
Devastation, violation
Itâs the end of Godâs creation

Godâs creation
Planned for self-destruct
Godâs creation
Meat in a plastic sack

Extermination, the threat is concrete
Fear and oppression, mankindâs so obsolete
A fake, deadly future we made by our own hands
Oblivion is our future, endless dead ends.

Eradication of mankind.
A weak creation born to die.
The new dominion of machines.
No resurrection
Havoc Supreme

Life, in the name of what? Death, in the name of what?
Love, in the name of what? Birth, in the name of what?
