Silence around of meâ¦this room has no windows alone with my memories, with my sins and repents.
Iâm crying inside, crawling towards the night, they are coming back, to take my mind.
Rulers of the mind, serpents with lamb eyes, bastard messengers of my sweetest pain.
And Iâm trying to find the truth through the lies, and Iâve tried to read between the linesâ¦
Ambassadors of lust, betrayer of the light, they whisper in my earâ¦to follow them
Dark waters still warp my thoughts, I still think to the past, I still think to their deathâ¦
I think when I was death, when I was hate and pain for thousands of people
But I was a soldierâ¦ yes, I was a soldierâ¦a soldier.

In silenceâ¦In darknessâ¦I know Iâm not alone, I know with them I have to goâ¦
In silenceâ¦In darknessâ¦I know Iâm not aloneâ¦the pain of mine, soldier of Godâ¦
My sins are shadows that are blackening my soulâ¦Beloved war of mine, leave this man alone.

The sound of lost forgotten screams is deep inside my mind and my soul..
Fields covered with fire and flames, creating the shadows once I fearedâ¦
Air raid sirens call my name as the wind whispers namesâ¦ Iâve never known
Tears from the eyes of a motherâ¦her sad eyes, on a cold tomb made of clayâ¦
As blood pours down from the sky...Iâve seen people crying and Iâve seen people dying...
Marching soldiers like a thunder roaring, the star of chaos is rising againâ¦
I look myself in the mirror, smiling to the past, thinking to what I wasâ¦
And as the blood of men keeps on flowingâ¦I think to myself...what a wonderful world.

In silenceâ¦In darknessâ¦I know Iâm not alone, I know with them I have to goâ¦
In silenceâ¦In darknessâ¦I know Iâm not aloneâ¦the pain of mine, soldier of Godâ¦
My sins are shadows that are blackening my soulâ¦Beloved war of mine, leave this man alone.

Lost in time â another day spent in sorrow
Silent tears â hand in hand the pain I followâ¦
Endless thorns â nail my hands, my soul, my feelings
Pain Divine â my love is dead, my will of livingâ¦Yeah.

From my past â come the storms bringing madness
My dear friend â close your eyes, embrace my sadness
Take my hand â my heart is cold, my heart is stone.
In the end â I closed my eyes, I die alone.
