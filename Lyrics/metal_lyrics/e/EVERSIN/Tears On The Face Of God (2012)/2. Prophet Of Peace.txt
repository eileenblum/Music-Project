In a time of war we close our eyes
Visions from the battlefield
Mouth of war is open wide

Blood on my face
The colours of fear blind our eyes
Twisted mind to lead the world
Promises and liesâ¦

We feel the tide changing, we are cold insideâ¦
Under a tired, old, pale skyâ¦We live and die

âI see a shadow tearing the skyâ so he said
Stranger in a strange land
He knew he was alone, he know he is alone again.

What you want from this life?
What you want from this world?
I am the one who sells your cry
I am the one to buy your peace

Why donât close your little eyes
Why donât you try to call my name
I am the one who pays for your dreams
So give me peace I give you sin.

I am the Lord of War, I am the death of you all
So give your dreams to me, I am the law again, againâ¦

Prophet of Peace â Despot of Fear
Prophet of Peace â Despot of Fear
Prophet of Peace â Despot of Fear
Prophet of Peace â Despot of Fear
