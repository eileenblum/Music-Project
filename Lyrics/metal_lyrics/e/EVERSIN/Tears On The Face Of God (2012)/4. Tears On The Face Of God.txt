Another war, another scar on the face of God
Hate keeps on feeding our madness
Blood rivers, forgotten screams, death from the sky
Rage and pain fill the heart of men,
Kill, die, obey, command
Tongues of fire, bleeding eyes, life desire brutalized
Sorrow, loneliness and fear
Revenge, madness and tears
The warmachine is still hungry.

Fear and painâ¦Tears like rain

Try to look inside their eyes, try to feel their fear
War is the hell on earth and heaven has the end here
Sons, fathers, brothers and sisters sent to death for the glory of their masters
â¦and the warmachine is still risingâ¦
Horror in the name of Godâ¦No!

Is a river on a desert
Tears on the face of God
For the death of those unknown men
Tears on the face of God

Another war another scar on the face of God
Another war another scarâ¦Who is their god?
Another war another scarâ¦Who was their god?
Another war another scar on the face of God
