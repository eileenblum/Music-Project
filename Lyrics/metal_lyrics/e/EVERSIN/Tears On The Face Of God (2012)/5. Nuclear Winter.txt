Angel of silence, angel of steelâ¦
Angel of sorrowâ¦fire at willâ¦
Come from the sky, they come for the endâ¦
Future and pastâ¦Mankind will know the end.

1945 â Hiroshima was opening its eyesâ¦A pale sun above.
From the sky a Little Boy was watching the people living their lives.
From the womb of Enola that Little Boy fell, payback time...
A devasting shock wave killed thousands of people, women and children.
Without a soundâ¦they died.

Nuclear Winter reapes their souls
Nuclear Winter take them home

The voice of that Little Boy, the terrifying mushroom formâ¦
Deformed children, diseases, radiactionsâ¦
The world changed, mankind died inside, but no one learned
The cold embrace of fear, the black curtains of death
Warped a nation, obscured that pale sunâ¦
Acid rain burning the eyes of mankind
That Little Boy was sent to kill.

Nuclear Winter reapes their souls
Nuclear Winter take them home

Fire â purify their sins with your sacred flames.
Death â Welcome their souls in your eternal temple
Fear â Bless their names, teach us to live
War â Bringer of dark, forget our lives.

Antichrist is the name of war.
(forgive us Father for we have sinned)
Antichrist is the name of war.
(forgive us Father for we do sin)
Antichrist is the name of war.
(forgive us Father for we have sinned)
Antichrist is the name of war.
(forgive us Father for we will sin)
