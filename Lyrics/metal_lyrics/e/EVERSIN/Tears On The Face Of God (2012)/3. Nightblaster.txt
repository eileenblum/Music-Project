I am the chosen one, nameless born in pain
son of a bastard son, I kill and kill again

Warrior of thousands wars, living for your fears
Nemesis is my name, wash me with your tears

Father of children lost, strong arm of hate
wolf hungry of human blood, life for me is a shame

Flesh burned on panzer jaws, is my way to live
Soldiers, they're marching on, never to forgive.

Falling on your knees, I'm the world desease.

Armies of steel and sin, memories gone by
Passions and wind of death, a blaze in the nightsky.

Another war, another day, another mother curses my name
Time has come for you to die, just kiss my ass and say goodbye.

Falling on your knees, I'm the world desease.

âFor the blood red sun
warriors marching on
feeling fear and pain
cold blood falls like rain...

And from the other side
They seem to call my name,
There is nothing to regret
and nothing to forgive.â


Praise the Nightblaster.
Angel of death, wind of disaster.
Praise the Nightblaster
Warmachine, almighty Eversin

Fear, pain, other ways to call my name
Madness, terror, of the men I slay in battle

Hate,death, hand of doom, great soulburner
Father, master, I am he, the Nightblaster
