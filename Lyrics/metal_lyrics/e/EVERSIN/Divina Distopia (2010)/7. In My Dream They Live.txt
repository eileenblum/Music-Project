[music: Nicastro - Lo Pilato;  lyrics: Nicastro]

Like a flash into the night you've been stolen to my eyes,
faded away, just faded away...forever.

I remember all our days, all our joies, all our pain,
I remember, I cry and scream, but you live...
You live in my dreams.

["Suddenly" &amp; "In My Dreams..." are dedicated to all our beloved ones who believe in us and watch from above]
