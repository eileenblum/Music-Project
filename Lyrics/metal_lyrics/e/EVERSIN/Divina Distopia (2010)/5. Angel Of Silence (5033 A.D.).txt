[music and lyrics: Nicastro]

I'm your conscience, blade in your forgotten soul.
I'm the night, swallowing your eyes of child.
I am wind, voices of ancient sorrow.
I'm the sun shining upon your life...

Fight! Rise! Ride! Shine!

"Hear my voice inside you son of my purest dreams,
is the sound of the ancient knowledge of me,
when he first of the men closed his eyes in the night.

I shall give you the strenght to feel me once again,
to be another time near to the whole yourself,
you'll be able to fly wit me!

And I shall wait for you in your inner self
to make you feel like one, to make you feel complete.
Where our union will...
Where our union will live forever.

Fly, fly and tell me what you see,
fly and let your soul be free.
Ride, ride son of the ancient dreams,
Rise, rise shining side of me. "

Nevermore the shame on me, nevermore the pain for me,
nevermore your light will shine on the past of me...
Painful tears from children eyes,
washing the fears from twisted minds.

Nevermore the shame on me, nevermore the pain for me,
nevermore your light will shine on the past of me...
Shadow in shadow, the mask I am, eternal betrayer
Nemesis of man.
Warfield of sadness, warfield of pain...
Angels of silence dead in vain.

Rhymes of pain screaming from heaven again and again
painting the sky with the...
Rhymes of pain screaming from heaven again and again,
screaming the rhymes of my pain.

Nevermore the shame on me, nevermore the pain for me,
nevermore your light will shine on the past of me...
Painful tears from children eyes,
washing the fears from  twisted minds.
Warfield of sadness, warfield of pain...
Angels of silence dead in vain.

[Act 3 End]
