[music and lyrics: Ferrante]

[Act 4: Past]

Living into my dreams, suddenly your presence turns
into an absence, and start our meetings in my sweet dreams.
The threads of your contact, suddenly swept away,
I don't want to accept, death has taken you away from me.
Let me see your eyes, let me see you.

When the heart burst, into tears I strike the wind,
the wind with my fist, you vanished into that thin air.

You are next to me I know you 'll follow in my tracks,
now I'm fearless, I know I can go where I can't.

Thanks for the time, for my shame I couldn't tell you,
thanks for all time, suddenly you get so close.

I know you in every winckle, in every black shadow
I know you and you know me.
You glance at me , you are right inside of  me,
suddenly you' re inside of me.

Let me see your eyes,
let me hear your voice,
let me see your eyes.
