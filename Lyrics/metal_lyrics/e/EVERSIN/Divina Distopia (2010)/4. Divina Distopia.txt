[music: Eversin; lyrics: Nicastro]

[Act 3: Signs of the Ordered Chaos]

So, I know that now I will sin, my soul cries of pain,
will I redeem on my knees?
Now I pray the Lord to bring the Light
to let me see, now I can play with
my death in my dreams.

When night falls I see all the sins they 've made
like a neverending curse, the cries of
thousands of children lost.

When night falls I see those colours
which make me blind
the colours of thousands of men died
on forgotten grounds

And when night calls I close my eyes
to escape from a retribution
which makes my heart bleeding
again and again...

And for one more time I face
the human disease, looking through the
heart of darkness, embracing a pain
which will never pass...
