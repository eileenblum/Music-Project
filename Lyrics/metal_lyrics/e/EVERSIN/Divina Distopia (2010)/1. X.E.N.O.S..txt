[Act 1: Strangers in a Strange Land]

I see a shadow tearing the sky but I know to be alone
I hear in the wind the echoes of distant fights
but I know to be alone.
Spit on me the fucking truth, save me from
this pain my Lord, save us all now from ourselves.
I'm ready... I 'M READY TOO!

A chlid smile purifies us, but I know to be alone.

Truth - we search the truth in unkown eyes
Lies - when we feel life is a lie
Black - spitting fire words in black
Reality - and never...no never.

Strangers forever, dreamhunters, warriors of light, living
alone like the stars, rhymes of dreams never dreamt for
a lifetime.

Fall asleep into my deep rotten void from the past.
Androyd tears feed your fears, betrayed again by your lust.

Dragon breath upon your head, spirit of your enemy
Metal sky, I see your eyes, son, you will never exist.

Strangers forever, dreamhunters, warriors of light, living
alone like the stars, rhymes of dreams never dreamt for
a lifetime.

[Act 1 End]
