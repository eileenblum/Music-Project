[music: Nicastro - Lo Pilato; lyrics: Nicastro]

[Act 2: Inner Struggle]

Deepest cry, so cold inside my soul, memories fly
there is no why at all, I'll try to fly and live again.

Here I am, lost in the twilight, alone again
chained to a world of lies, loneliness until the end.

Blood tears I cried on the petals of rose in white,
On my vault I fly, falling star, I'm the chained angel.

Deepest cry, so cold inside my soul, memories fly
there is no why at all, I'll try to fly and live again.

Like an eagle I spread my wings flying away with no sin,
to the moonlight cold as ice I'm not Icarus, I can fly

...Yes I can fly on my sad wings tears, yes I will fly on my sad wings of tears.

Like a damned I cry my pain, I hear the wind whispering just my name,
Only my flight may free my soul, chained forever and ever alone.

Leave my soul alone.

Just a dream I'll never fly, tied forever, forget the sky...
Blood tears I cried on the petals
of a rose in white.
