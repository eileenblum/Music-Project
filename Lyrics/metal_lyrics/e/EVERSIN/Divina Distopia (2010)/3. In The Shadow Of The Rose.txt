[music: Ferrante; lyrics: Nicastro]

Celestial dreams fly over the sea,
far memories from the battlefields,
go now in the black.

Imaginations from a far world explode in me
my heart is crying now a pain is not mine.

Angels cry, voices from nowhere,
in my mind echoes of despair.

Sin after sin and tear by tear, blood rivers
flow but there is no fear, no remorse , no repent.

And now I pray in pain: "speak gods of war, you tell
me why this life of mine, my salvation or my pain,
the cries of world upon my shoulders
in the name of what ?"

Virgins of fire appear to me, burning desire for all to see,
nailed to the hearts of men.

And now I pray in pain: "speak gods of war, you tell
me why this life of mine, my salvation or my pain,
the cries of world upon my shoulders
in the name of what ?"

The rain comes down, tries to wash away the pain
from the heart of men once again dead in vain
And when the time comes, their eyes begin to close,
they say a pray in the shadow of the rose...

And nw I wonder in the night by full moon,
tryng to hide myself in the shadow of the rose.
Under the stars far, silent and brave a whispering voice calls my name.

[Act 2 End]
