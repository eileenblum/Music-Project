Master- I am the master of you lost dreams.  Keeper â I am the keeper of your worst sins. Listen - the wind of death that brings you madness. Praise - the ghost of past who takes you down. Sin - sin after sin on the land of no one. Pray - join your hands on the graves of your sons. Fight - fight for me, you will die for me. Dream - dream of me, the war is meâ¦again!!! On the fields I see their bodies lying on the ground, seas of blood and sadness tears to cover all around. Nervine gas and acid rain falling from the sky, Iâm the ruler of mankind, on your knees and close your eyes. Planned to be a slave, from the cradle to the grave. Soldier of endless wars, I pull your strings again, again. Panzer marching on, barbed wire and machine guns. Now my kingdom comes, call me master, call me god.
Pray! Crying in fear, lost in my realmsâ¦I am the crown of nails.
See! Burning in tears, youâll be my slaveâ¦I am the crown of nails.
Coming from the sky, the angel of death, eternal warcry of destruction and pain. Raping, killing, starving, looting and maim, hell on earth again and again.
