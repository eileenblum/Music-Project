In a world of liesâ¦disillusion, the angels fall from the sky. Planet of God? Dead and gone. We are puppets on a string. Masters on a throne of gold, servants on a seat of nails. Itâs time for them to leave, itâs time to purify. Burning damned souls, living a world of lies. Under a grey old sun they speak of freedom liars, mentally ills. They feed madness with our hope, death cannot be killed. Burning damned souls, living a world of lies. Burning damned souls, as life eternally dies. Angels fall with no soul, time to be, time to resist. Angels fall with no soul, time to be, fire walk with me. Can you hear the screams of pain coming from the sands? Another lord of war destroys  the tribes on âhisâ lands.We are here to die in silence? Take a look to the past, years of violence and fear, from the pyramids to the oceans, deserts of blood, seas of tears. We are here to die in pain? Fire walk, fire walk, fire walk with me, be my guide, be my light, you and I, purify.  Inside their golden palace they watch us from above, upon his throne of gold an old man âspeaksâ to God. We are here to die in silence? Children die inside a cave as they feast with fruit and meat, we close our eyes, they keep on feast, feeding  all this shit. We are here to die in pain?  We are here to die in silence? No!!!
