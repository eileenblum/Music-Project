Lands of anger under a black sun. War of races, another sin is done. Insane rules infest humanity, desperate cries, violence we see. Souls cry, the sound of modern death. In silence, blood, war and faith. Getting older, the world is getting cold. Life is fear, we wait the final call. In our minds forgotten litanies, suffocation, death or dignity. From the futureâs coming another war, from the past has come the sin of the world. 
War, litanies of war, hymns of despair. War, litanies of war, end is coming near. Cold wind of death, neverending pain, litanies of war, thousands deaths in vain. In our eyes solitude, fragments of death, indifference. In our minds selfishness, litanies of war, madness. Behind the enemy lines. Can you hear what I still hear? Can you see what I still see? Can you say what I still say? Can you be what still I am?
