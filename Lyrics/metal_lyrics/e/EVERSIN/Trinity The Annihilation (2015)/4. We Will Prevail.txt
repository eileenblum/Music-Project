False emperors speak to the world, we will prevail. Old monarchs of empty realms, we will prevail. Tired lion hearted dying men, we will prevail. Unholy dethroned tyrants, we will prevail. Call us messiah, we are the war, soldiers of a time to come. Weâll never be engraved, weâll never be enslaved, we are the hand of God himself. We are the poisoned apple, the hungry wolf in disguise, we are the lamb who kills the lion. Terror and destruction to cover all mankind, killing with no reason, praise the genocide.
We are the enemies, a crown of nails. We are the virus, we will prevail.
Towards a sea of lies they tried to lead us, they, fake heroes of a dying old world. Corrupted politicians, pollution and decay, we are the war, our blood belongs to us. We are the shining sun that blinds their eyes, the hands of doom, the jaws of death. Ashes to ashes war to war, we are immortal.We wash away our sins with the blood of unknown men, the smell of self destruction that creeps across the lands. Searching for redemption in another forgotten face, we kill and slay our enemies, annihilation of their race. The sound of tanks and machineguns, symphonies of hate. Crying children on the run, but we all know their fate. Holy wars, holy pain, how many people died in vain? As our future die slowly, terror, violence, disdain. We are immortal.
