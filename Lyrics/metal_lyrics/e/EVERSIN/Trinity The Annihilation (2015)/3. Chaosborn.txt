Hail [6x]

Call me war messiah
Call me blaster liar
Call me warmachine
I'm living for your sin
Master of humanity
Sacred Reich of fear
Black wolf bloody eyes
Your end is coming near
Is coming near

Chaosborn from chaos
Chaosborn from fire
Born in pain

War after war
I am the chaosborn from chaos
Chaosborn from fire
Born in pain
Day after day I will curse all humanity
