The warhead is armed, praise the genocide, the plant of hate is fed with tears and pain. Rain of gasoline, infection and disease, the world is slowly dying, on freeways of blood. Under a flag of hate soldiers marching on, another holy warâ¦itâs the âendâ. Unnamed souls, warfields and tanks, people ask for more and we praise the war!!!
The jaws of death ,the eyes of war, the sons of God dead to the core. Death in the air, rivers of blood, fire at will angel of steel. Devastation! Vindication! Death and pain, blood like rain. World destruction! Soul pollution! Death in vain, Flagellum Dei. Warhead, death. Rise! I will rise! Rise forever. Rise! I will rise! In aeternum.
