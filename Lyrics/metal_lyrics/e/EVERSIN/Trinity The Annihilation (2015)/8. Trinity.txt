Empires of war, empires of blood, towers of bones that reach the sky, eternal struggle in our eyes. Unleash the fire of war desire, unleash the war of death and fire. Trinityâs birth - the creation. Trinityâs birth â annihilation. War desire! Orgasm of death the world admire. Children burned from the past, panzer marching, death is fast. We are the people of the lie, a curse is falling from the sky. From the sky! A curse is falling from the sky. We are the servants? The sign of chaos in our eyes. We are the master? As mankind is going to die.
Pushed by a supreme hate, the holy wars, the hands of faith. Tears of blood upon our face, marks of death upon our race. We are the nuclear gods. We are the eyes of war. Jornada del Muerto.
For the people of the lie, the sign of chaos in our eyes. For the people of demise, as mankind deserves to die. For the promise of the life, for the people of the lie. For the war they will arise, for the people of demise.
We are the nuclear gods.
