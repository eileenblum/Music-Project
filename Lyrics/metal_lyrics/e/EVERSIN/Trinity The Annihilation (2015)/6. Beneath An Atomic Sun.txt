Look to the sky, to the eyes of the dead watching from above. Atomic stars  like thousands of gazes accusing mankind. Titans of fire at the edge of the galaxy tearing the universe. We are children of the stars, waiting for our fathers to come. Through the pyramids of time, human-faced stones, beholding the skies, another solar stormâ¦Can you hear the scream of the wise? Can you see the signs on the lands? Can you see the tongues of fire? Can you hear the call of the dead? Can you hear them? We were born from nowhere and to nowhere weâll return. Atomic Sun, the ones, atomic sun weâ re your sons. Years of war and genocide, we are the plague. From below a cry of pain, the Earth is dying. Pollution and toxic wastes, lethal weapons. Mass destruction, oblivion...in the end.
