Enthralled to see. enthralled to see my fantasy
A seed is sown with soiled minds in tow
Journey with me close your eyes with believe
Tearing through this lie known as the truth
Shifting through the infinite distance of space
A majestic kingdom whose beauty and secrets await

From times that have passed and times yet to come
Visions of mystery beyond our own sun
Scaling the walls into unseen worlds
Where sleeping giants rest in a cosmic swirl

The coming tide of a fallen star
Tracends the vortex pulling apart
Light can't escape his violent grasp
Dimensions fold with all existence

Secrets dwell inside the darkness
Tempted by magic and sorcery
Mindful of the fate that awaits me
Master of my dreams
Weave illusions in my soul
Through the art of alchemy
The sun of shadows I conceive

Into the everdark!
