The swirling madness. chaos begins
Farther away from a galaxy
Twisting and churning the universe forms
Light years prevent us from ever knowing

To small and insignificant
Species born from the cosmic rainfall
Blue planet mystified
We are all stardust children

Our lives are vexed aware but alone
Can anyone hear us
Time has been spent this candle will fade
The will of the cosmos

Beyond our dreams nothing seems out of reach
Human beings cannot see our failed attempts
Technology hold us back not quite yet
Persistent minds create and define our planet
