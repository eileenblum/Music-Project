Venomous bastard vicious tiny beast
Stealth-like ninja stalks when sleep
Paralyzed victim flesh for the feast

Myriad of pins crawling on my skin
A wicked fever envelopes me
My vision clouded and I cannot breathe
Another fatality scribed for the centipede

Am I dead but awake? a host to digest
The throes of misery suffer in constraint
Edging off my face a slow labor continues pace
Object sustenance quite the eccentric tasteï»¿
