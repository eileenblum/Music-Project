I've travelled a thousand miles
To a land across the sea
These are the last days of my journey
And no tears shed as I leave
Fear and doubt slips from my thoughts
My past is only a memory
Wooden ships are sailing west
Long have I waited to be free

Close your eyes the time has come
Forever dreams in the arms of the sun forever

A voice welcomes my stay
Into her everlasting sleep I stray
Hold my hand as I drift through worlds beyond

Close your eyes
The time has come
Forever dreamï»¿
