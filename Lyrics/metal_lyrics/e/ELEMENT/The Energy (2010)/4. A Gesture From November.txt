When nature's charm pulls me in
And winter's bite is close to the edge
Falls's rust keeps her at bay
A free wind clears a path for me

The morning sun breaks through the trees
Blinding warmth catches my eye
There isn't much to do today
My thoughts to keep me company

Getting lost for a day or two
Smoke dances around the morning dew
Leave my mind at peace and
Feel the Earth beneath my feet

The silent calm surrounds me
Embraced by a soothing voice
My fears soon leave my heart
Among them I am not alone

A sad man walks into the woods
To forget about the pain a while
Searching for nothing but harmony
Ten years gone and everyday a memory

Soon a blanket of stars surround
The cosmos spins and draws me in
I want to leave everything behind
And find a new way to beginÃ¯Â»Â¿
