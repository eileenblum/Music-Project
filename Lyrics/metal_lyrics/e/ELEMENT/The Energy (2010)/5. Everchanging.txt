A maze in a game of perpetual shame,
Behind each wall own a fear you hide,
The labyrinth has you-there is no escape,
Intricate passages are all you will find

Surrounded by screams-flood a wave of
Despair, integral visions of infinite madness,
Under your skin the insects quake and
Regale, abandoned reason, a fragile mind collapses

Slipping away-you can't catch your breath,
Running in circles-there no way back,
A quest of the sense has been compromised,
Life hangs on a thread sanity is denied
