Enigma crashing down
Translate metaphors
So meaningless
Awake, dying in a dream
Nothing is how it seems

Only here to serve
The thoughts of machine
Unlock the past, hidden beneath 
Always searching for a way to connect
Lost in a dream, blinded by their control
Fear is drawing in and no one is aware
Cloud reality, diminishing seas
It's around me, taste of the haze
Open your eyes torn from this wicked maze

I am learning - I am changing

My mind feeds from wounds so deep

Show me the path, know of the pain
Leaving behind, no more to gain
Blackened the sky, rotting the earth
Creating a strain of demonic birth

These illusions

Only here to serve
The thoughts of machine
Unlock the past, hidden beneath 
Always searching for a way to connect
Lost in a dream, blinded by their control
Fear is drawing in and no one is aware
Cloud reality, diminishing seas
It's around me, taste of the haze
Open your eyes torn from this goddamn maze
