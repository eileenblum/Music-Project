Drifting through time and space
Involuntary celestial egression
Lapsing of form a place
Alludes to sardonic funeral procession

Falling within spatial distortion
Senses are crumbled and changed in proportion

Through impossible forces, ceaseless travel
Causes his wit and will to unravel

Interminable predilection
For self-estimation
Opens gateways for
Displacemental excruciation

Swirling maelstroms of
Retrofit reality
Transversing the void
Towards singular plurality

Plummeting aloft Xenthor Prime
Inhabitants endowed with prehensile theocracy
An infinite army of dung-gilded morons
Bent on infliction of serial mediocrity
Bloodstained shores of Kronor VII
Insatiable sadists of inscrutable horror
Dispensing grotesque humiliations
And unspeakable tortures

Lavishing the torment of
One chronological explorer

Drifting through time and space
Involuntary celestial egression 
Lapsing of form and place
Alludes to sardonic funeral procession
