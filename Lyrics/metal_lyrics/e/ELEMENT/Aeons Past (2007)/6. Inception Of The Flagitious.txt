Fated for aeons our coming - our accession forms the terminus
Trailing astral currents - divergent from the locus of conception
The expanse of microcosmic perception
Awaiting the genesis of forces anew
The plenteous void again to be conquered
Brought to its knees in perpetual subservience
Infinitesimal energies ebb and flow
Guiding the altruistic hands of creation
Revolving cogs of the great machine
Unparalleled degree of ubiquitous automation

Conceived to receive the fruits of subjugation
Proceed to deceive the will of creation
Looming beyond an abhorrent inundation
Moving procession of unquenchable conflagration
Exponentially expanding in every direction
With nothing to stem this truculent infection
Bleak and inclement bodes this caustic inception
Of those who take species and worlds for collection

Triturating populations, shattering their will
Exploiting their weakness, rejoicing the kill
Assimilating peoples, consuming our fill
Gravid with malice and gorging on spite
Feasting on sorrow, proclaiming our might
Gravid with malice and gorging on spite
Swallowing worlds, ignoring their plight
Advancing from the vast expanse
One consciousness crossing the void
Our accession forms the terminus
To render creation destroyed

Gravid with malice and gorging on spite
Swallowing worlds, ignoring their plight

Advancing from the vast expanse
Our consciousness crossing the void
Our accession forms the terminus
To render creation destroyed

Foretold through consecution of celestial isochronism
