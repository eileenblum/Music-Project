Grafted flesh on hardening steel
Capacity void of the will to feel
Stretching skin across alloy frame
Biomechanoid has been made
Sickened dream of perfect order
Feeding terror unto the masses
Arrant cyborg advances
Rifts of terror between classes

I - scourge of the populace
Lord of malevolence
Carry out collective will
I - bring of execution
master of retribution
Order, kill, one solution
I - virus unto the innocent
Decimate the penitent
And fulfill my mission still

Incredulous automation lumbers forth uncontested
Laying waste to all without discrimination
Making way for a world less congested
Through rampant construction of obliteration

I - scourge of the populace
Lord of malevolence
Carry out collective will
I - bring of execution
master of retribution
Order, kill, one solution
I - virus unto the innocent
Decimate the penitent
And fulfill my mission still

Created for ends of peace, order and unity
Through means of destruction, I've seized opportunity
A pile of humans later - perfecting the craft
Standing on their corpses, I kill more and laugh
