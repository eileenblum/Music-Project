Awakened - slowly rousing from transcendental bliss
Cognizant - a bitter stench fills the air
Redolent - the acrid taste of blood and rust

Vivified - privy to a landscape of humanoid wreckage
Espying - an epic display of utmost vanity
Descrying - generations bred in rancor and hate
Empire - man and machine living in dust

Awakened - slowly rousing from transcendental bliss
Cognizant - a bitter stench fills the air
Redolent - the acrid taste of blood and rust

Rising to my feet I beheld
A world torn asunder

Bodies strewn across the landscape
Torturous visage tormenting the senses

Clutching in my hands, the remains of a man
A cranium in disuse
Decorates the sand, an age long since passed
Forged empires which could not last

On my knees at the shoreline
Fumbling to cleanse bloodstained hands
A futile act in the crimson surf
I gazed at the tide and saw what it had imbibed

Awakened - slowly rousing from transcendental bliss
Cognizant - a bitter stench fills the air
Redolent - the acrid taste of blood and rust
