Entices the will for
Sensory devotion
Self-effacing terminal affliction

Accentuates propensity towards seclusion

Chaotic mental discharge wired
Ribosomal reuptake inhibition

Extrasomatic - chemical degradation
Interpersonal - relay retardation

Through medication resolved
A sentiment dissolved
