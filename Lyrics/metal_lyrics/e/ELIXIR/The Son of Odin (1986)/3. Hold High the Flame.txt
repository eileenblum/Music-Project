Remember the men
The young and the old
Who on Flanders Field
Lay still and so cold

Remember the men
The aircrafts and crew
Whose spirits and souls
Still fly in the blue

Hold high the flame
Up to the sky
Hold high the flame
Don't let the memories die

And what of the ships
Where no hands were saved
They still serve their cause
From watery graves

So remember the day
When petals they fall
Be grateful to them
They died for us all

Hold high the flame
Up to the sky
Hold high the flame
Don't let the memories die
