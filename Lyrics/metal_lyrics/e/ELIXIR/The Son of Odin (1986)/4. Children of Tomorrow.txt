In another time, another century
Four magic children did walk upon this land
To keep us all from pain from sin and misery
To bring us news again and make us understand

They found the secret
To end our tears and sorrow
They found the secret
The Children of Tomorrow

Where they had come from no one really knew
Or where they went just like the planets, sun and moon
So little time to see but yet so much to do
To try to teach us all how to avoid our doom

They found the secret
To end our tears and sorrow
They found the secret
The Children of Tomorrow

Not all the people they looked up to the sky
The storm had come and now the sea and sky now raged
Lost and frightened, they all began to cry
It was too late, too late, and no one could be saved

They found the secret
To end our tears and sorrow
They found the secret
The Children of Tomorrow
