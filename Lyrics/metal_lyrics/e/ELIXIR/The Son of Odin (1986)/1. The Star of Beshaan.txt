Long ago they placed a charm
Upon this jewel of the damned
On any man who crossed his palm
With the ancient Star of Beshaan

Deep within there burns a flame
Its light as bright as the sun
Many fear to speak its name
The iced blue Star of Beshaan

Its power can draw you
It's calling your name
To gain its glory
Just look into the flame

Many men have tried in vain
To own this stone so fine
But no mere mortal can retain
The cursed blue Star of Beshaan

Its power can draw you
It's calling your name
To gain its glory
Just look into the flame
