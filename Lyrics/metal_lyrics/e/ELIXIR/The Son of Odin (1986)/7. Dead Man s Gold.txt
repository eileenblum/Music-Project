On the day that we set sail
The sun rose on a shiny sea
Spray fell in a misty veil
And we were free

We heard tales in the tavern
We heard the legends told
Of one man's buried treasure
The story of a dead man's gold

For three months we had sailed
On rough and stormy seas
Heading for an inland cove
To find our destiny

On the voyage we all remembered
All the stories we'd been told
Of one man's buried treasure
The stories of a dead man's gold

When we saw the headland rising
Blue skies and pure white sands
With our hopes held in our hearts
And our maps held in our hands

Soon our dreams has all been shattered
We believed the lies of old
We spend our whole lives chasing fables
The ghosts of a dead man's gold
