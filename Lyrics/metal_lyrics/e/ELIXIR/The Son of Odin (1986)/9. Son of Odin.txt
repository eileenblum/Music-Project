When you're in danger
You feel your life blood slip away
Then you wonder
Do the Gods hear you when you pray?
But if you stand strong
Don't let your spirit ever die
Then he'll send down
A winged avenger from on high

Oh, oh the Son of Odin
He's coming...

When the suns rise from the west
That's the time that you should start to pray
When the eagle leaves the nest
That's the sign that he is on his way
The Son of Odin

So when you're weary
And you feel like giving in
Don't surrender, no.
Never let the tyrants win

Oh, oh the Son of Odin
He's coming...

When the suns rise from the west
That's the time that you should start to pray
When the eagle leaves the nest
That's the sign that he is on his way
The Son of Odin
