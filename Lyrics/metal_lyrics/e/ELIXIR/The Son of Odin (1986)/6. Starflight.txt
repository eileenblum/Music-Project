Darkness is all around
You won't know day from night
Helpless there's no laws here
There are no wrongs or rights

On a starflight
Your retro - rockers burn
On a starflight
Gods will your safe return

Sometimes you can forget
You're from the human race
Does no one care for the fate
Of our ships in deepest face

On a starflight
Your retro - rockers burn
On a starflight
Gods will your safe return

Vessels from other worlds
Come through this constant gloom
Each one another threat
Each one could seal your doom

On a starflight
Your retro - rockers burn
On a starflight
Gods will your safe return

For not passing your test
You'll get hell without rest
You'll have tears in your eyes
But they won't hear your cries
On a starflight
