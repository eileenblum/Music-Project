To gain the king's glory
They'll fabricate stories and lie
They've offered me reasons
But murder and treason, not I

Must ride like the wind
Treachery
Will be the death of us all

I must find my master
Before this disaster arrives
We surely are done for
And now we must run for our lives

Must ride like the wind
Treachery
Will be the death of us all

I must keep on riding
There's no use in hiding my tracks
If you lead a good life
You'll end up with a knife in your back

Must ride like the wind
Treachery
Will be the death of us all
