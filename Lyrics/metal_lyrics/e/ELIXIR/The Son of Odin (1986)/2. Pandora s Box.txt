I must leave you now my daughter
With the key to all mankind
Within there lies the sins of all creation
And whatever happens to me
You must promise me one thing
You will never lift the lid for any reason

We've a world so full of beauty
Where we have no fear of sin
For I keep here things yet unknown to man
So again I beg you daughter
You must never look within
Or I guarantee you we will all be damned

All that you see here
All that's before you
Came from Pandora's Box
All that's unholy
All that is evil
Came from Pandora's Box

Oh but when the box was opened
Every demon there ran wild
All that remained was hope so we were told
She had tried so not to weaken
But temptation was too strong
Which goes to prove curiosity killed the world

All that you see here
All that's before you
Came from Pandora's Box
All that's unholy
All that is evil
Came from Pandora's Box
