As darkness draws near
The coven appears
Weaving together a spell
All through the night
Performing their rites
Calling the demons from hell

The prisoners they take
Are tied to a stake
To go through a trial by fire
Cursing their names
They scream as the flames
Grow to get higher and higher...

Trial by fire

In dark dampened caves
No one was saved
Satan had watched their cremation
On the other side
Watching with pride
And greeting them all with elation

The victims they send
To go to their end
To go through a trial by fire
Cursing their names
They scream as the flames
Grow to get higher and higher...

Trial by fire

Watch for a while as they go through their trial
Into the fire the flames growing higher
Sing with elation and see their cremation
The bodies are burning and Satan's returning
