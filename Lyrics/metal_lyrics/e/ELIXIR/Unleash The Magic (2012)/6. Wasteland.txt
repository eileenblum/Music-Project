the Horizon is on fire
flames are burning all around
the earth is breaking down with my steps
thereâs no water to be found

Now the world is desolated
thereâs no trace of human life
the blade of greed mutilated
all the hopes for what theyâve died

We have been through very hard times
many rights already lost
and while no one is suspecting
I am fearing for the worst

Fight is what keeps us staying alive
While the world is collapsing weâre gonna survive

Mother Earth you will cry for your sons overthrown
But your tears of life will empower all
Let us be safe when the danger returns
Or weÂ´ll suffer in wasteland awaiting the end

thunders from the constant fire
cannot hear them anymore
but this silence grows around me
and will soon deafen my remorse

Many souls condemned to suffer
lonely victims of a war
Power struggle for command
A battlefield that killed them all

Soon all this lands into oblivion will fall
Thereâs no hope for salvation wherever you go

Mother Earth you will cry for your sons overthrown
But your tears of life will empower all
Let us be safe when the danger returns
Or weÂ´ll suffer in wasteland awaiting the end
