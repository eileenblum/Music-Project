When the night is falling
And the shadows are stalking
I can hear the screaming of
the souls with no glory

Damned to hide into the darkness
living in sorrow
Canât feel their heartbeats
but theyâll still live tomorrow

When wind becomes a whisper
I can hear the mourning of the humankind

By centuries returning
from a hellish empire
Haunted by an instinct
Carry out their desires

We became the sacrifice
To be slaughtered in a rite
Even older than the time
that never stops its ride

In thirst to imbibe your essence
Hidden from the sun to get back out tonight

Open your eyes  
to the land of the undead
From where you will never return
Doomed to the pleasure of an everlasting thirst
Gazing at the rise of curse
