look at the sunrise
and tell me what you really see
open your eyes
understanding all what it means

long time ago
you denied to walk on the way
chasing your shadow and
living in yesterday

leave the time behind
give it a try
find your place again
soon you will see the sign

Time is an ally when it comes to facing the truth
Tell me what freedom means to you
You will reach a day when all your fears are left on the way
Trust on the force within yourself

now you realize that
the world DOES not revolve at your feet
Itâs in your essence
the worth of what you can be

Now play your cards
and just bet it all to the hearts
thatâs your best weapon
to face your concerns right now

leave the time behind
give it a try
find your place again
soon you will see the sign

Time is an ally when it comes to facing the truth
Tell me what freedom means to you
You will reach a day when all your fears are left on the way
Trust on the force within yourself
