Weâre standing here
Showing all the world
âbout what weâre fighting for
All our hopes, all the power
That remains inside our soul

All as one, weÂ´re together
Let your heart withstand the truth
Find the way to bring the dreams that lIE in you

Break down the chains around you
Theyâre carrying all your pain
And soon the magic will reveal

Far beyond
Thereâs a mistery that brings you to life
A secret makes your spirit rise
Get the answers only you can find

Walking the path of a true heart
That prevails against the lies
Just a spark will bring the light upon your eyes

Break down the chains around you
Theyâre carrying all your pain
And soon the magic will reveal

Far beyond
Thereâs a mistery that brings you to life
A secret makes your spirit rise
Get the answers only you can find
