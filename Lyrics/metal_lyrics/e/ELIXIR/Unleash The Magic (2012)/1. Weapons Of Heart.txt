Ashes and bloodshed wherever you see.
Surrounded by ruins of damnation
Remains of a kingdom that came to an end
ON Fighting to reachING salvation.

Weâll find the way to get the curse out of this place
evil tomorrow will go away

time will soon arrive
legions allied are marching proud
thereâs only a reason, to face
the one who condemned human race

The battle is raging now
weâll carry the fight untill the end
taking the weapons of heart
Defeating betrayers again

Blinded by greed and ambition they sought
a reason to spread all their madness
to shatter our lives, to take us away
and leave us alone into darkness

Weâll find the way to breaking free from hands of fate
Live for the day we will make them pay

time will soon arrive
legions allied are marching proud
thereÂ´s only a reason, to face
the one who condemned human race

The battle is raging now
weâll carry the fight untill the end
taking the weapons of heart
Defeating betrayers again
