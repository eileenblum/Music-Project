Now is  your time, pay the price
face the way to your end
As more you killed us
you thought you could get your revenge

But now your chances have been spent away
Your trial will be held
YOU CHOSE YOUR destiny, NOW you canâT escape

feel the wrath
Hell is awaiting
feel the wrath
Burn in flames
feel the wrath
Drag your misery

All the damage youâve caused
Canât be taken aside
Search into your soul
Thereâs nothing inside

Even if you avoid it youâll be trapped again
And youâll feel the sense of pain
yOU JUST DESERVE IT, NOW YOUR HELL AWAITS

feel the wrath
Hell is awaiting
feel the wrath
Burn in flames
feel the wrath
Die in slavery
