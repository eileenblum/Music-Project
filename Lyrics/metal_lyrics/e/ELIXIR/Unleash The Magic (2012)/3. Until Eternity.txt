So many stories to reveal
Accept the truth within
the tales about a lifetime
from all what you will see

All those things to be recalled
thereâs always room for more
In your mind is kept the secret
thatâll live forever on

Thereâs no reason to return
Now itâs time to turn the page
You forge your destiny

No one will ever take away
the essence of your dreams
for all eternity

Power makes you brave
Go ahead and do your own way
Nothing stops you again
So take your chance

Donât you be afraid
if you rush into the deepness
Darkness canât prevail
The might is running through your veins

Facing the failures from the past
Thatâs your reality
Learning out from your mistakes
makes you strong in your beliefs

All promises already made
Youâre never gonna break
Always true to your ideals

No one whoâs coming from the dark
will ever shut your spark
If your soul remains as bright
