Sit in the shadows of my cherry tree,
having a lonely journey inside of me.
Looking for answers, emptiness I find,
I don't need questions, battle's there to fight.
Walking alone the paths of no return,
quiet and silence, the calm before the storm.
Victory or death depends on the sky's will so I don't care,
there's no defeat for me.
No shame, no cry, no disdain even if I die,
the consciousness of my death makes me smile!
Right here, right now, there is no more ways out,
my duty is my will to win or die!

When the shadows fall down in my heart,
I will raise my eyes up to the stars,
may their light guide me through the paths of night!
I won't hide anymore, from the darkness I will reach for the sun,
flying high over white clouds in the sky...
where heroes lie.

Before leaving I've promised that
I would have come back to my dear cherry tree.
"Dead or alive, I'll be sitting close to you, we'll wither together hailing the moon!"
But now I ride with sunshine in my eyes,
a bloody day has begun for me.
Right here, right now, there is no more ways out,
my duty is my will to win or die!
