Why can't you hear, destiny is calling,
it's our last chance to sail on the dream,
back towards the time when we were children
and our eyes could see the divine.
All my life I've been trying to preserve the light of innocence in me,
as the world falls in the darkness; every day is a fight to face,
no matter what the future has in stone for us, we carry on!

Shine, we will ever shine! Embrace your dreams hold 'em tight!
Shine, we will ever shine! Through the seasons of life we will ever shine!
Find a place in your heart a shelter where memories won't fade away.
