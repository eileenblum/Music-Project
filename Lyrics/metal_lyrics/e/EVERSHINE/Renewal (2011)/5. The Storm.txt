In the silence of the night look up there, there is a light,
it's not so far my brother, take your sword!
Side by side to carry on, don't be afraid you're not alone,
together we will fight the world forever.
Now it's time to be strong again, feel the steel in your heart.
Let your spirit burn in flames as far as the edge of stars.
I don't kneel, I go on, I will fight and if I fall,
rising from the ashes I'll reborn.
Riding through the paths of hell, ice and fire, I don't care!
I'm in quest for truth, I won't surrender.
But now it's time to be strong again.
Feel the steel in your heart!
Let your spirit burn in flames as far as the edge of stars.

Don't give up refuse to yield, our victory is not far from here, go on!
Like a thunder we'll strike them all,
what will only remain is a desert of pain and nothing more,
nothing after the storm!
The time has come for you to choose, live by your heart or live their rules.
Now you're alone at all, it's your freedom at stake.
Remain a slave or break these chains.
