Armies of the night, we are ready to fight
striking faster than lightnings from high
All of you should want, you'll be killed!

Destiny's calling for us to reign over fire, water, land, air.
Our lust for dominion will take us there,
on the throne of the mighty gods' realm.

All the human race you cry and complain!
Blood tears and pain are the price to pay
for the ones who will try to be brave.

Destiny's calling for us to reign over fire, water, land, air.
Our lust for dominion will take us there,
on the throne of the mighty gods' realm.

Rise together, fight and never stop our quest for victory!
Feel the power, it's the hour, get ready to start the demon's ride!
Red rivers flow, beneath a dark sky, into the storm I feel my power rising.
