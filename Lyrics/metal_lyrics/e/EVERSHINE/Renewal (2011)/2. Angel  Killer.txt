Lain on the grass beneath the stars I call your name.
I shout it loud against the wind, against my fate.
I saw my heaven in your eyes when we first met,
I saw the moonshine in your smile, I can't forget!
Come back to me just one more time!
My only dream lies in your eyes.

Through the night, through the storm, burn the candle of neverending love.
,ay the wind dry your tears and whisper to your ear,
that I think about you every day, that you made me live a fairy tale
for a night, with a kiss. Angel/killer.

A falling star tonight will cross the northern sky
to make revive my hope to find you!
I will not give up, 'till I breath I will believe!
