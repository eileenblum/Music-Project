Wake up from your too long rest, now it's time to be awake!
They come from the deepest hell, you must get ready to be attacked!
No god will help us now, we're alone in the night but we're ready to fight.
No chance to run away, it's your turn to be the brave.

Stand up, heart the fighting bells, they are sounding loud for our quest.
Your pride, now it must be great, feel the fire burning hot in your chest!
Tonight we won't step aside, we will banish the dark, many voices, one heart,
no chance to run away, it's your turn to be the brave.

Here we come, marching on the rhythm of the pounding steel.
The destiny's choice we are, you'd better kneel!
Back to back we'll survive, 'till the last hope bright will shine in the stralit sky,
for our freedom we cry!

Shouts of freedom call, justice once for all!
Spread your wings my friend, head towards tomorrow.
Here we make a stand, ready what we all believe in, for a new beginning,
now!
