Dark is the sky that we fill with our restless hate, poison's the wind and the rain.
Seeds of corruption we sow proud of our sins, dead to the cry of the slain.
Washing the blood you shed with our tears of pain,
you think there's no-one to blame since all do the same.
But united we stay 'cause tonight you will pay!

Fight your evil side and let the light prevail in your heart,
close your eyes and feel the power growing beyond the stars.
And we stand up proud before the gold horizon,
spread your wings and leave this world below!

Faith and timeless dreams,
in our eyes a blazing power within lights up the universe, sets us free.
Like torches n the wind we go on and fight the storm drawing near,
it's time to be fire and to burn up their lives.

If you stare towards the horizon far, you will find another reason to fight.
Distant shores, magic and wonders wait for us, then go on!
