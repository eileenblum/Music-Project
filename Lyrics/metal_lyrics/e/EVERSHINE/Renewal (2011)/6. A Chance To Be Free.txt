A wonderful sunshine is lightning my face,
dark clouds above our lands have no more tears to cry
for the blood we've spread to save our souls from the night that won't fall anymore!
Victory's come but the price's so cruel, demons have lost but we all are losers!

The lord of the shades lies and waits his end.. his life is my hand.

But something strange inside of me is filling my heart, warriors from the sky,
please, don't ask you revenge!
His sword is wet of our blood but I can't kill him,
I would kill the human's chance to be free...
by choosing my way and not the evil one.

Dead children's lament and their mothers' cries corrode my spirit,
why have I to spare his life while my brothers have died to give me this chance
paid with blood? At the end, how could I betray my friends?
