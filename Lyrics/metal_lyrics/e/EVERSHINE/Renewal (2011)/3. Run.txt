I gather heart and power burning with desire foe another run to the top.
On the road towards freedom, searching for a reason
to rise from the ashes and go.
From the past come to me colors, perfumes and dreams,
only here they seem to be so clear.
Though the wind and thunders or with the heat of summer,
always on the run to the top.
Heart beats pounding faster, no rules I have no masters,
I feel like I was leaving the ground!
No more fear, no more pain, not for glory or fame,
it's just my way to feel alive again.
Run towards the place where it all's begun,
through thousands memories so far, they will take me on forever!
And I fly over the white clouds in the sky,
I feel like when I was a child,
angels keep your heaven 'cause I got my own one here.
