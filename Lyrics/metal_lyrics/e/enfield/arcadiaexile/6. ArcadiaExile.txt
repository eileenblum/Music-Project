Taken from all that I knew
No longer living in this world
For one more moment

With
My mind set on those whose answers
I beg for!
Nothings how it seems
And with the path ahead
You stand In my way

Through these eyes I cant see
But the subject of beauty
That dawns over me!

It attracts its prey to discard all
And takes them when they're weak.

Fuck

Blinded, I step into the unknown
With you holding my hand
Blinded, I step into the unknown
With you guiding me
(Guiding me)

ARCADIA
EXILE!

You whisper my name
As you lead me the depths
Of our damnation

All I ask
Is that you let me
Hear and see the world

One more time

Through These Kaleidoscopic Eyes
