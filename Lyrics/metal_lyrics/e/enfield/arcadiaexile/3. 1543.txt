Close your eyes

Take a deep breath
feel the existences within.
Can you hear the voices?
Can you see the void?
My instructions.
Can be used to your advantage
Using old remedies
To break open the fabric
of space and time,
To peer in and reveal
A refuge

Now it's time to breakthrough

This is our chance
The stories in the stars
The tales in the sand
We are beings of
misfortune
We have been lost
to lies told before us
For we have observed the untruths
From the moon.

It's time fucking let up
Give your piece to the world
Accept reality
Is just an
illusion

Fuck this place

I am your eyes
Transcending focus
Within your mind

For you are blinded
By the unyielding fog
Created by prophets
we call gods

I am your eyes
Transcending focus
Within your mind

For we are grounded
With no where to escape
No where to escape

We will conquer
All demons that breathe
Lies

Fuck this place

I am your eyes
Transcending focus
Within your mind

For you are blinded
By the unyielding fog
Created by prophets
we call gods

For we are grounded
With no where to escape
No where to escape

No Where To Escape
