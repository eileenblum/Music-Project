We must, leave before our last shard of sanity is shattered to where glassed dreams go.

This map of faultless beauty is something more to strive for.

We are helpless to defend ourselves as our only option remains to cower in the dark and hope for a light to guide us.

I beg you to rip a page from this book of lies.
Of tales and morals that are false in this world of mine.

Hear my story and hear my mistakes,
See that they were not all in vain.
Relics of a bygone age lost deep within my brain.
Hear my story and hear my mistakes
See that they were not all in vain

Everything you took for granted lays shattered in this strange new world.

Left here all alone to pick up all the peices and reinitiate your life.

May the moons elimination
Leave us with our lives
