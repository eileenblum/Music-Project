Remember when you brought me back,
From the brink of death.
From that moment our existences conjoined.

Wake up and feel the breath of life
Consume you.
are the very words you spoke
as death was overthrown

I am growing weary
Your distorted visions of a reality are a veil to shield you from my gaze.
Oh
I am no longer subject to your unlawful verses,
I will cease to be the entity that we once were.

Our lives once intertwined, until the day that I broke free of your mind.
Our lives once intertwined, to found a whole new world beyond my eyes

You're just a fucking ghost.

The power
To turn a wretch to a king
Is nothing but an apparatus for destruction
You created me, now it's time to face up to what you've done.

I break bonds as were once one
and I end this unfaithful transmission.

Shielded by shadows,
Guarded by grief,
Deprivation of existence
for a sigh of relief.
