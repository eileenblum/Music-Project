I can hear them inside my head
Reverberations of a language long dead.
Pigmented words from a time before the light
All I can hear is a shade of red.

I dare not stray from the path that was chosen for me,
Allocated by a greater strength,
Something they could not foresee

Enlighten me to the master plan,
What does this life really mean?
We're all engineered for hopelessness,
A defective design.

Tested by the worst that you can throw my way,
I'll push on through the gloom,
I won't permit this wasteland to be my tomb.

We all have demons
But yours are unneeded
your sin, depleted
My sympathy for you

(Willows)
You can't escape elimination; a defective design.

Your existence in this world is nothing but a frail excuse to engineer my fear. You don't hold the keys anymore.

You don't belong here.

(Observer)
This time I am beyond your lifeless boundary.
I will end your woeful existence
Life leecher
How does it fucking feel?
