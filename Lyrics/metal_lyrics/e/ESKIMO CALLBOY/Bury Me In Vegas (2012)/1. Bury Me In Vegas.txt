bury me in fucking vegas!
bury me in vegas
bury me in vegas baby
I want sex, I want cars,
want the drugs, grab the stars
leave the past behind
with some drinks in those bars
bling bling
I wear the biggest rolex baby
lowride my car with slim shady
âR.E.S.P.E.C.Tâ
girls make me going crazy
lipstick
high-heels
do you wanna fuck me?
take the money
ride my cock
bright light vegas-rock
I fucked jenny from the block
take me by the hand
turn off the lights
this star shines bright
through the darkest night
take me tonight
take me by the hand
letâs take a ride
everything is possible tonight
take me tonight
wohoho!
wohoho!
bury me in vegas baby!
Iâll take my money back
you fucking slut ruined me
fucking vegas the place where youâre calling me
bitch!
whore!
fuck you!
knock knock who is there on the door?
now crank the music up
âcause this is party time
cumshot-glas with tequila and lime
take me by the hand
turn off the lights
this star shines bright
through the darkest night
take me tonight
letâs take a ride
everything is possible tonight
take me tonight
wohoho!
wohoho!
bury me in vegas baby!
