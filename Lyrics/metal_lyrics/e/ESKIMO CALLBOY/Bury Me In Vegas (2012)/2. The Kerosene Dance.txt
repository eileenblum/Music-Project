I tell you a story
I swear it is true
I never met a girl
I despise more than you
day by day it is hard to handle
this fucking mess inside my head
a dance on the edge of the heart
so ugly
so starved
and if this curtain falls
youâll be nothing more than a fuck
Iâve given up and always too much
what youâve given to me?
nothing less than a touch
you try to drag me down
but Iâm so much stronger today
youâre goddamn worthless
likeâ¦
the cigâs in your ashtray
do you remember?
Iâve given up myself
donât want to feel this way again
fuck you whore
say goodbye
do you remember?
my world turns into a lie
donât want to feel this way again
fuck you whore
say goodbye
with every step you changed your face
your greatest pleasure was
my moments of disgrace
the hell with you
you mentally retarded whore
Iâve tried my best again and again
always cursed the moment
where it began
so many times you made me feel
that Iâve been the mistake in your life
thank you for nothing
for all your lies
you try to drag me down
but Iâm so much stronger today
youâre goddamn worthless
like..
the cigâs in your ashtray
do you remember?
Iâve given up myself
donât want to feel this way again
fuck you whore
say goodbye
do you remember?
my world turns into a lie
donât want to feel this way again
fuck you whore
say goodbye
fuck you whore, youâre nothing to adore!
fuck you whore, youâre nothing to adore!
and if this curtain falls
you will be nothing but aâ¦
and if this curtain falls
you will be nothing but aâ¦
FUCK!
