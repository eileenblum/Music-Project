[originally by Benny Benassi/Skrillex]I could watch you for a lifetime, you're my favorite movie
A thousand endings, you mean everything to me
I never know what's coming, forever fascinated
Hope you don't stop running, to me 'cause I'll always be waiting

You are my cinema, I could watch you forever
Action, thriller, I could watch you forever
You are my cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are

My cinema, my cinema, my cinema
Cinema, cinema, cinema

[x3]
Get up get down,
Lose that sound,
My DJ gonna break it down

Get up get down,
Lose that sound,
Drop the bass

Stars spell out your name, like in a science-fiction drama
Romance growing, like a flower in the summer
You always keep me guessing, forever my wonder
Hope you start undressing, all my dreams and take me under

You are my cinema, I could watch you forever
Action, thriller, I could watch you forever
You are my cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are

My cinema, my cinema, my cinema
Cinema, cinema, cinema

[x3]
Get up get down,
Lose that sound,
My DJ gonna break it down

Get up get down,
Lose that sound,
Drop the bass

My cinema

You are my cinema, I could watch you forever
Action, thriller, I could watch you forever
You are my cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are

My cinema, my cinema, my cinema
Cinema, cinema, cinema
