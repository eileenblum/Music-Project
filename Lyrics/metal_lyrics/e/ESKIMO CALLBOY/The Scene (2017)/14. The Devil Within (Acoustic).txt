[feat. Tobias Rauscher]I pack up my bags to leave this place
Pick up the pieces and take them with me
Haunted by ghosts across the streets

Lost on the highway, my heart's beating quietly

Feels like I'm lost in space
The past became my casket nails
Can I fix it by another way

I am turning around
What's inside of you, inside of me
I am turning around
What's inside of you, inside of me

I've lost all I've got
My self anyway
I still miss the smell from the smoke of your ashtray
Give me a sign to show me the way
I promise to change and I'll just take the blame for you

Feels like I'm lost in space
The past became my casket nails
Can I fix it by another way

I am turning around
What's inside of you, inside of me
I am turning around
What's inside of you, inside of me

I don't know why you're running away
The scars will shape you from the inside
I don't know why you're feeling dismay
The scars will shame you from the outside

I don't know why you're running away
The scars will shape you from the inside
I don't know why you're feeling dismay
The scars will shame you from the outside

I am turning around
What's inside of you, inside of me
I am turning around
What's inside of you, inside of me
