Everyday I've lived soldiers in between, incomplete
So tell me
Why we live in a cage we're won't to be free, with us we need?

Just tell me
Where do the fake ourselves stress dissuccessed, there you'll repeat?
Please tell me
Everyday I've lived soldiers in between
So why you'd take my?

Take my hands
We are the wave from the new evolution
Take my hands
We are, we are, we are the wave

We'll come on a tree without planning see, can you see?
So tell me
How we long to a trust so walk the leaders bridge, misery?
Just tell me
Why'd do we locked to ourselves to just fired knees deliver repeat?
Please tell me
Every changes one side lesson dream

Take my hands
We are the wave from the new evolution
Take my hands
We are, we are, we are the wave
You will need us, we won't give us
So take my hands
We are, we are, we are the wave

This is a new age
In running out of time
Saving from myself

We are, we are,
We are, we are,
We are the wave from the new evolution
We are, we are,
We are, we are,
We are the wave from the new evolution
You will need us, we won't give us
So take my hands
We are the wave from the new evolution
