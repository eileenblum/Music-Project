[feat. Little Big]Alright everybody
Let's go

It's Friday night
And I'm heading to my favorite club
Skip the line
And greet the bouncer with a nod
Turn it up! Turn it up!
As I enter the floor
Live it up! Live it up!
Cause I wanna let it go

Let's get down
I'm gonna dance like a god
Kill the bar with every shot after shot
DJ spin the tables
Lemme get wasted to your beat
Cause I really wanna dance away
The bullshit of the week

We won't stop stop stop
Till the sun will rise again
We won't stop stop stop
Everybody lose control

You gotta wake up
The night is not over now
Dance, drink, party
All day and night
You gotta wake up
The night is not over now
Clap your hands
To the rhythm of this song

I've had a lot
But I'm up for some more
You gotta
Hail to the weekend
So back to the bar
And my vision gets blurry
But my dance moves are sick
This is why the girls are crazy
For my sexy big nose

So let's go!
Bring the beat back!
I wanna dance away the bullshit of the week
Bring the beat back!
I keep on drinking
Till the week will start anew!

We won't stop stop stop
Till the sun will rise again
We won't stop stop stop
Everybody lose control

You gotta wake up
The night is not over now
Dance, drink, party
All day and night
You gotta wake up
The night is not over now
Clap your hands
To the rhythm of this song

The night is not over now
The night is not over now
The night is not over now
The night is not over now

While this planet is spinning
We will dance side by side

Our hearts work like engines
Pump that acid! Ignite!
No pit stops are allowed
In here tonight
We're lighting your fire
Dance floor is burning alright?
What do we want? - Party!
When do we want it? - Tonight!
I'm dying for your sins
On this heavenly ride
I'm your personal Jesus
Just for tonight

The night is not over now
Clap your hands
To the rhythm of this song

The night is not over now
The night is not over now
The night is not over now
