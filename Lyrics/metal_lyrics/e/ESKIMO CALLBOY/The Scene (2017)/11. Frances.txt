I'm standing here alone now, afraid of the dark
Watch your light shine on me, sure the ways are too far
I just can't make a move anytime you are near
Feling crawling up inside

The moment that I met you get under my skin
With your fallen smile and the way I moved in
The flower in the glass top you are out of my reach
You're beautiful beautiful

I just wanna take, take, take anywhere you want
I wanna make, make, make you my shooting star
I wanna take, take, take anywhere you want
I'll never be the same again with you
The same again with you

I just wanna take, take, take anywhere you want
I wanna make, make, make you my shooting star
I wanna take, take, take anywhere you want
I'll never be the same again with you

Let's all drink it up now I'm standing still
As you mesmorize me this life is not fair
I wish I'd been around that you dream of it at night
I'd do anything for you

I'm waiting for a chance to get closer to you
And my feet down this and my voice rakes down too
The flower at the glass top you are out of my reach
Forever untouchable

I just wanna take, take, take anywhere you want
I wanna make, make, make you my shooting star
I wanna take, take, take anywhere you want
I'll never be the same again with you

Talk to me for a little while
Cuz I can't wait one more night
Everytime that I see your smile
I just wanna be by your side

Cuz I am paralyzed and the time are us we
And my heartbeat is going much faster
Everything I want is to be with you
I wanna get close to you

I just wanna take, take, take anywhere you want
I wanna make, make, make you my shooting star
I wanna take, take, take anywhere you want
I'll never be the same again with you

Cuz everything I feel and the time are us we
And my heartbeat is going much faster
Everything I want I just wanna get close to you
We'll never be the same again
