I can feel the end and grow inside of me
I'll keep on losing things that always set me free

I can never give in
I can never get out
Screaming my lungs and my heart out
I can never give in
I can never get out
Screaming my lungs and my heart out

In the heart of the blackest sea
There will be something to believe
I can't see the ghost and it's calling, it's calling me
In the heart of the blackest sea
I've found the missing part of me
I can't see the ghost and it's calling, it's calling me

Every time I'm getting closer to the edge
What's are closing in with every single step

I can never give in
I can never get out
Screaming my lungs and my heart out
I can never give in
I can never get out
Screaming my lungs and my heart out

In the heart of the blackest sea
There will be something to believe
I can't see the ghost and it's calling, it's calling me
In the heart of the blackest sea
I've found the missing part of me
I can't see the ghost and it's calling, it's calling me

I keep on walking
See the end is coming
But it's drifting away from me
And it's drifting away from me

I keep on walking
See the end is coming
But it's drifting away from me
And it's drifting away from me

I keep on walking
See the end is coming
But it's drifting away from me
And it's drifting away from me

In the heart of the blackest sea
There will be something to believe
I can't see the ghost and it's calling, it's calling me
In the heart of the blackest sea
I've found the missing part of me
I can't see the ghost and it's calling, it's calling me

In the heart of the blackest sea
There will be something to believe
I can't see the ghost and it's calling, it's calling me
In the heart of the blackest sea
I've found the missing part of me
I can't see the ghost and it's calling, it's calling me
