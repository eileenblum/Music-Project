Ah, I know you bitches gonna like that
Fresh sneakers, gold print on the snapback
Two 17, evergreen like Charlie Sheen
Pornstars on my 80 inch TV screen

I said, all you haters better rep that shit some more
Rock that shit, everybody gonna let the good times roll

Bounce that shit
Rep that shit
Do you want some more?
Bounce that shit
Rep that shit
Death to all the hypocrites

And I'm standing on my rooftop
On my rooftop
All eyes on me
I just want you to see that I
Always give my best shot
Give my best shot
All eyes on me
Cause I'm keeping it real

20k iced out grills
Autotune than T-Mills
Chilling with the Uzi
In the Jacuzzi and counting bills
Everybody's dropping
shitty mixtapes in the charts
But I keep on hustling
Shopping carts full of gold bars

Getting fly high
Living life like an OG
Don't even try
Cause you're never gonna be
Gonna be like me
I get what I want
Anytime and I won't even ask for it bitch
I just grab it
Like the devil by the horns

And I'm standing on my rooftop
On my rooftop
All eyes on me
I just want you to see that I
Always give my best shot
Give my best shot
All eyes on me
Cause I'm keeping it real

Crispy crackers caviar
Butlers fill up the bars
My crib's bigger than Wayne Manor
Got a yard full of cars
Got diamond topped fruit loops
Breakfast in the marble kitchen
Still number one on the hit list
I was born as business

Getting fly high
Living life like an OG
Don't even try
Cause you're never gonna be
Gonna be like me
I get what I want
Anytime and I won't even ask for it bitch
I just grab it
Like the devil by the horns

And I'm standing on my rooftop
On my rooftop
All eyes on me
I just want you to see that I
Always give my best shot
Give my best shot
All eyes on me
Cause I'm keeping it real

Still the baddest boy in the neighborhood
Throw my money at the crowd
From the top of my roof
Work hard, play hard
And never get lazy
Living life fast
Keep on balling baby!

Just keep on ballin!
Ballin, ballin, ballin, ballin baby!

Gettin' fly high on the top of my roof
You see me ballin
You see me ballin
Livin' life high on the top of my roof
You see me ballin
You see me ballin
