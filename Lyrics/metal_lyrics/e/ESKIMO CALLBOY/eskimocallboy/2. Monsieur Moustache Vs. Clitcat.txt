Yeah, Eskimo Callboy 2010

Backbeats on Saturday
Whiskey instead of toothpaste
Tonight would be so awesome
Tonight would be so awesome

Kokain lies like snow on my moustache
Party milfstyle now with pam's comeback
Gay like a funky track
Gay like a homofag

Wohoho wohoho
I drive drunken in my car
I have to fuck her hard
On dirty backseats in mom's car

Wohoho wohoho
It can't be real
Rub her clit, comeshot tits
On dirty backseats in mom's car

Have a lot of partys
We gonna step out of line
We are gangsterfied
Like black guys

Rubberducky clusterfuck
Rubberducky clusterfuck

Let's get this party started
Get the feelings right
Take a picture
I just wanna have sex tonight

We are harder than your mom's cock
We are harder than your mom's cock

We are harder than your mom

Party milfstyle now with pam's comeback
Gay like a motherfucking funky track

Wohoho wohoho
I drive drunken in my car
I have to fuck her hard
On dirty backseats in mom's car

Wohoho wohoho
It can't be real
Rub her clit, comeshot tits
On dirty backseats in mom's car
