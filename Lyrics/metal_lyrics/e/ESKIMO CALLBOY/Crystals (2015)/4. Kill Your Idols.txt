Sometimes I feel like nobody cares, when Iâm sitting alone on the hallway stairs. I need a friend, a love, a life to fit in. But I am to weak to get out of my skin. I was down on my knees and I never felt release from the pain that is hiding so deep inside. I have fought
my heart, so full of delusion. But now I see it clearly right in front of my eyes. Woohooho, youâre not alone. Kill your idols! Together we are standing strong. Woohooho, weâre not alone. Kill your idols! Together we are strong. Tonight weâre breaking down these walls.
Though you never believed us. Tonight we learn to live again and we never let you down. I will never back down. I will never back down, now itâs my time to sin. Iâll make you eat the dirt that you put me in. I was a coward to not stand up for myself. I got a beaten in
the face first when I was twelve. And now I have more than I ever had before âcause I Just stand up and I make it mine. The fear of always being rejected turned out to be just a ghost in my head. Iâm not a fucking misfit in your perfect world. I just wanna break out as
long as I can. I wanna break out. You never let me in. Iâll never back down on the way to myself. Never back down. Just let met go. I wanna be part of the fun. I got 99 talents but you ainât see one. I need a chance to show you what Iâve got. I just wanna be me cause
Iâll die if Iâm not.
