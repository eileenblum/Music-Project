Come take my hand, letâs take a walk on the thin line. Do you know how the story ends? Show me a world that is worth to die for. Love against the law. Scar by scar. The city lights lead the way to the crown. So restless and thoughtless, nothing can stop us now. We are
the criminals! With faces of innocents. Just give me a reason! I would die for you, I would kill for you. Give me a reason! Love against the law. Scar by scar. No matter what they do, no matter what they say, weâre gonna live forever. They canât stop us now âcause I know
that we will never die, we will never die. Not tonight. So take a gun and bet your life on freedom. Donât give a fuck what is left behind. âCause tonight we are the criminals with faces of innocents. Just give me a reason! I would die for you. I would kill for you. Give
me a reason! Love against the law. Scar by scar. Here we are. You and me. I know our love will last forever. Now count on me. I know our stories last forever. And we donât care about whatâs left behind âcause tonight the world will die in our hearts. You and me. We will
be the lovers breaking free.
