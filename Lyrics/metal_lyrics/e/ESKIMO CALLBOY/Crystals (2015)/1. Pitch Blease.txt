I call my homies, call my hoes, âcause thatâs the only way it goes. I know that partyâs gonna be just fine. Iâm coming! Tonight weâre dancing to the beat, I move my hips for you. So baby can you feel the heat? Letâs do it one more time. Weâre getting fucking hammered,
weâre getting fucking drunk! Tonight weâre gonna party, tonight Iâll spread my spunk. Have you seen the girl that rocks to the beat? Everything sheâs got is all that I need. Have you seen the girl that rocks to the beat? Party all night long! Party all night long! And
thatâs the way it goes, you are all that I need. My party overdose, all night long. Letâs party, get naughty! So baby rock your body! Letâs party, get naughty! And thatâs the way it goes. So raise your middle fingers up to show that we donât give a fuck. And all the
single ladies wait in line. Iâm cumming! I share the liquor with my friends, I know this party never ends. And all my people scream out loud. âCause now itâs time to break the rules. Now itâs time to break the rules. Just hit it! And thatâs the way it goes. And thatâs
the way it goes. Have you seen the girl that rocks to the beat? Everything sheâs got is all that I need. Have you seen the girl that rocks to the beat? Party all night long, party all night long. You are all that I need, youâre all that I need. I wanna confess myself
tonight. You are all that I need, youâre all that I need until the end of the night. Look me in the eyes while I rip you apart. I need a hole from your cunt to your heart.
