Now the week is done and everybodyâs up for some fun. Grab your beer and get your sexy ass in the sun. We are the party people, so raise your fucking glass for your favourite season. Sunshine Baby, this is the time when we write the stories that are one of a kind. Letâs
cherish the time like we just donât care. Every time I touch your body it is love in the air. You are the one I ever wanted. You are the one I ever needed. Take my hand, turn the music on. So get it on âcause life is what you make it. Every time I get that feeling inside I
know my friends are around for a crazy party night. Everything I wish is that tomorrow never comes. Till the sun is rising we will dance to the drums. Sunshine Baby, this is the time when we write the stories that are one of a kind. Letâs cherish the time like we just
donât care. Every time I touch your body it is love in the air. This is the time, like a treasure in a chest that we keep in our hearts. And tonight, everybody feels alive. We are alive. We are alive. I know that we are alive. You are the one. Weâre getting down, down,
down. This is our time tonight.
