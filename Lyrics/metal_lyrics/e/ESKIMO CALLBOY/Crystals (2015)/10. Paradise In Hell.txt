Can I get a OUH OUH! Now bitches give me OUH OUH. Here we go now! Show me what youâve got! Show me what youâve got! Grab the tequila, letâs have a body shot. Have you seen the bright shining lights down at the sunset strip? Have you seen the girls with the burgundy
lipstick? Do you need some cash, a car, a gun or anything else? Go get your keys to a paradise in hell. We never have saved a dollar, we never have missed a single night. When the sky is changing colors, bring it all back now, bring it all back tonight. We never have
saved a dollar, we never lost faith in our hearts. When the sky is changing colors, bring it all back now, bring it back tonight. Welcome to our neighborhood. Hail to the king of the frauds. Shake your booty for a single malt shot. Sip the champagne, put the dollars in
her thong. Donât ask about my business, party all night long. Every single moment in my lifeâs called success. Every fucking partyâs just a sexual excess. Tonight weâre getting drunk darling like in a movie scene. Just take a seat in the devils black limousine. Gold
teeth, gold watch, my money spend on strippers crotch. Baby tell me whoâs your daddy that the cops never caught? If you need a friend just call me anytime. If you need a job. Iâm your brother in crime. Every single moment in my lifeâs a success. Every fucking partyâs
just a sexual excess. Tonight weâre getting drunk darling like in a movie scene. Just take a seat in the devils black limousine. And everyday Iâm chillinâ with da homies in my crib. Countinâ all my money like the toys of a kid. Rockinâ bitches down like a sex machine.
Since Iâm sixteen itâs a business routine bitch. Dollars gonna make my dreams come true. Stay like the ink of a fresh tattoo. And every single moment that reminds me of the past. Life is short and always too fast. Itâs always too fast! All the times that Iâm missing in
my life. Bring me back tonight.
