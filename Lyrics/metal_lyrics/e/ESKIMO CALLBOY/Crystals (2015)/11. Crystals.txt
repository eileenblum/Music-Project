Put your motherfucking hands in the sky

Her eyes so crystal clear
Her taste like diamonds in my mouth
This freezing touch of fear
wonât let me go until my heart stops

I canât remember last night
Whoâs the person next to me?
The drugs, the drinks, my love
Baby, you make me feel free

I close my eyes, inhale the air
Floating away, but I donât care
I just wanna be with you darling
I wanna feel free

I just, just wanna be with you
I will do what you want me to
I just, just wanna be with you
I will do what you want me to

I hear your voice
that runs out of tune
Iâm floating in the haze
of your perfume

I hear your voice
that runs out of tune
your crystals shine
bright like the silver moon

Even life's always shit
I know that I am not alone
Everytime I kiss your lips
you make me feel at home

I try to kill my despair
flirt with the death, but I don't care
I just wanna be with you darling
I wanna feel free

I just, just wanna be with you
I will do what you want me to
I just, just wanna be with you
I will do what you want me to

I hear your voice
that runs out of tune
Iâm floating in the haze
of your perfume

I hear your voice
that runs out of tune
your crystals shine
bright like the silver moon

Put your fucking hands in the sky

I gave my life away

I gave my life away

I hear your voice
that runs out of tune

I hear your voice
that runs out of tune
Iâm floating in the haze
of your perfume

I hear your voice
that runs out of tune
your crystals shine
bright like the silver moon

I hear your voice
that runs out of tune
Iâm floating in the haze
of your perfume

I hear your voice
that runs out of tune
your crystals shine
bright like the silver moon
