Letâs go! Baby, I need a chance to make you understand. I live my life for you till the biter end. I confessed my love to you. In my dreams I have faith that you feel it too. All my life Iâve been into you. So take a deep breath when I say to you: Baby, I just wanna make
it stop. Right now! This chase took a big part of me, but you never really cared. You are the one that I wanna spend my life with. Itâs tearing up my heart when Iâm with you. But when we are apart I feel it too. And no matter what I do, I feel the pain. With or without
you. So tell me, how can I make you feel my love? When will I be the one that youâre dreaming of? This love is more than I ever felt before. And I know youâre the one that is worth fighting for. All my life Iâve been into you. So take a deep breath when I say to you:
Baby, I just wanna make it stop. Right now! This chase took a big part of me, but you never really cared. You are the one that I wanna spend my life with. Tearinâ up my heart and soul. Weâre apart I feel it too. And no matter what I do I feel the pain. With or without
you.
