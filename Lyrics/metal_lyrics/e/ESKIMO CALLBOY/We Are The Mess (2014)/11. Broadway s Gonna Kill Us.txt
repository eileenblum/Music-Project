So Broadway's gonna kill us. Fuck drugs and the lights. We are too tired to sleep.
I need some pills for the night. I've never expected how deep we can fall.
We smashed our crystals against the wall. I'm getting higher and higher as skyscrapers can be.
Paint the moon in sunset. We are the rebels and free.
Paint the moon in sunset. We are the rebels and free.

When Broadway is gonna kill us let us be forever. Baby, let me be your drug tonight.
When Broadway is gonna kill us let us be forever. Baby, let me be your drug tonight.

And even God wouldn't bless us. We're living a lie, an illusion, a dream.
We die like clouds in the sky.
Freedom's our drug -- as bad as heroin. Till the day we stuck the needle too deep in the vein!!
I'm getting higher and higher as skyscrapers can be. Paint the moon in sunset.
We are the rebels and free. Paint the moon in sunset. We are the rebels and free.
Don't give a fuck about love when you're here with me.
Follow me and the feeling's gonna last forever.
Let's set a mark in time.
Follow me and the feeling's gonna last forever.
Let's set a mark in time.
Follow me and the feeling's gonna last forever.
