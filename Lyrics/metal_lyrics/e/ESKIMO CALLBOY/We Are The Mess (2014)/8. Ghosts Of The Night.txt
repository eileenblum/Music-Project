Let's claim to be more tonight. Keep the love in your heart. Let's claim to be more than the night would ever give us. Glittering masks made of shards from broken mirrors.
Forget names and faces, your failure in the past. Fuck all the hate - keep the love in your heart.
All the disbelievers, conservatives and the saints.
Nobody will be better or worse 'cause we are all the same 
We are ghosts. We're the Gods of the night. We'll destroy the light. Let's start the fight.
We're the ghosts of the night. We're the ghosts of the night.

Can you feel my breath? It belongs to you. Let it be your heart that I'm talking to.
And I'll follow you if you follow me. Let's claim to be more tonight.
Can you feel the shadows we are walking through? Come and take my hand like I told you to.
And I'll follow you if you follow me. Keep the love in your heart.

Fuck your Gods. Fuck the saints. We're the goddamn apocalypse. Fuck your Gods. Fuck the saints.
We're the goddamn apocalypse. We're the godless. We're the useless. We're the outlaws of the new aged youth. We have nothing to lose and no place to hide, live our life once so we start the fight.
We're the ghosts of the night. We're the ghosts of the night.
