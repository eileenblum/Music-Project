When the bound of day falls
sky-line glows as your passion
the scent of anquish small
though only such futile impression

A night queen runs along my lid
she invites me to her foggy empire
no borders, I laugh as the small kid
and all I feel is a desire!

I wish to lead a blind man through the labyrinth of thorns
to kiss with phantasy in her soft embrace
I wish to enthral your love and to believe eternaly
to send a farewell to dead river, it's boring gace

Wandering in paradise of my mistress
I meet a white-haired old-man
with the next steps I feel your presence
and I see the picture again, inviting woman

Life's murmur and the song of birds
foggy rays of stories
the fresh breath lets down from clouds
but already doesn't tempt my senses

The velvety wind propels my raft
always nearer to eternal throat
I've no longer force to break a stream
I send to next-borns the last scream:

"When the graceful queen of stars
offers you her tender love
don't hide your desire to holes
but grip her and fly with a dove!"
