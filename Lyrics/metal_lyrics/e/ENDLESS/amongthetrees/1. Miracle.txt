The silence..the silence and the dark
neverending tunnel in empty space
the movement... the only movement and the whole empire
of silence is forever lost
space isn't interested in what's up
and millions of molecules set out for the journey of life
next actor comes

Fumbling intellect
... meanwhile only looks through door of mystery
... to the boxes of wealth of own soul
... and touches the life with the clumsy fingers

He lives here in his own loneliness
he only takes for this time... he has nothing to give
... the first dreams come
the first thoughts... I am!
... and thousands of questions without answers
