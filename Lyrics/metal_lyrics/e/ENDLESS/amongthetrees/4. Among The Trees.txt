Deep inside the forest
I'm talking with the trees
I want to tell them the story of mankind
- isn't it too late?â

The singing winds in the maze of trees
the unknown mountains and the charming silhouette
fighting with the burning light

Dance in the mad rhythm of life
among the rays of jewel
there, deep inside the heart of earth
its cry sounds in my soul

Almost the stoned eyes
saved from the endless sleep
they fuse and begin cry
hear that quiet weep
- the tears of enchantment!

It's like violin in my ears
- I want to embrace but I'm too small
laughter, sorrow - whatever I see
waiting for the evening fall

"Only the chosen ones visit that land everyday
only the chosen ones can talk with the trees!â
