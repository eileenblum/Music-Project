torn up into pieces at the bottom of a downward spiral
with only yourself to blame and only yourself to change
you've got to find your strength,
catch your breath in the cruel light of day

and you end up betrayed at the end of the world
erase the thoughts, experiences and feelings that you had
at the end of the world

you need to feel how the wind fans the waves
how the tide heals all wounds
for the moment you wait until you find your own way

you can hardly breathe, your heart is bursting
you can't regain what's gone
and you feel so betrayed at the end of the world

you need to rest a while
only then you'll be able to laugh again
and forget the ones who nearly killed you
