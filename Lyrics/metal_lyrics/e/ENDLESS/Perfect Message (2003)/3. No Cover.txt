you know the sky before the storm
when the dark sun covers the clouds

when all around us sadness falls
before ligtning kisses the ground
we are scared
we are afraid
you can see the dust swallow the rain

you can see the people run for cover
you can see the dust swallow the rain
you can hear the dark distant thunder
I can feel your fear

you stand frozen in the rain
it's the way it has to be
i'll always be with you my friend

i'll move closer to you...safety we'll find
we'll live through it together like so many times
I can be your tree...your shelter from the storm
but the help in my eyes is obviously lies
