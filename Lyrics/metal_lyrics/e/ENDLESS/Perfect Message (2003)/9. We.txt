there are people who are like tongues of fire flame
everything that they touch turns to ash

there are people who are like a pile of dust
just one touch and they fall apart, nothing remains

everyone has their life in front of them,
it is not an easy journey

to turn back means to lose your own life
there are people who climb straight to the top
to turn back means to lose your own life
there are people who through fear of failure

wander in the valley will never be
come with me, I am offering you company
