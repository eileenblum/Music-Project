sitting...current dragging...wind mills
I'd like to be the vital no.1...everywhere for everyone
standing...hearing voices which come to me

gust of wind knocks me down, I lie in the dust
tears, rivers, the small kingdom
I fall asleep... strangeness surrounds me
dragged away... losing my soul

flying I see landscape surreal
I feel like a child, careless in the world
then I am caught in the whirlpool
I feel like a child, careless in the world

I'm heaven that gave you promise find my way maybe somewhere in between
I wearily try not to hurt them find my way maybe somewhere in between
