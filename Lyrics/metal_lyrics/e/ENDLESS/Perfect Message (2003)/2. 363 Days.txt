one day you felt something strange
I wasn't there anymore
the one who used to be so close
I wasn't strong anymore

like the eagles' wings on which you rode
I was gone so far
like the eagles' wings on which you flew
to experience life I guess

overhead flew the eagle and offered again to experience life

which disappears like sweat dried up on your face
my soul was looking for a change I guess,
wanting to be wings somewhere else
it felt into the trap of my reality
in self destruction
it wasn't made to be alone
in self destruction
it wanted to feel your love
my other side wanted to return but was scared
it wanted to feel your love
my soul was looking for a change but was scared
it wanted to feel your love

in the whirlwind it didn't know
'cause in the river of fate it was different
so that my soul could be there
where its always been
where it belongs
it needed to hurt, be surrounded by magic
in self destruction
it wasn't made to be alone
in self destruction
it wanted to feel your love
my other side wanted to return but was scared
it wanted to feel your love
my soul was looking for a change but was scared
it wanted to feel your love
