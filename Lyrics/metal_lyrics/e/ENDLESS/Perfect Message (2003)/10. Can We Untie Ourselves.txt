what do we know of hidden fears, thougts, hopes, of those around us

all the sences of the creature are concerned with the here now
but we can separate ourselves remember sympathize with others

are they our friends?
are they endangered?
what are they feeling?
can we overcome the distance between us?

all the sences of the creature are concerned with the here now
but we can separate ourselves and remember sympathize with others
pain fades with the death of one
there is nothing of anger, failure, ecstacy, torture
which is a praiseworthy gift of evolution
