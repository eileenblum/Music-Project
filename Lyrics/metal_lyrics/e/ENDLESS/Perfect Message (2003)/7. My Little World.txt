one touch was enough to join our worlds
every movement of yours is for me a miracle
even though we have never met to join our worlds

I observe your struggle for life with desire to protect you
I will send you my strength, be the sun that brings you home

you change my soul, my inner self
when the heavens calm
and lighten up our faces
I am waiting for you, my son

but still we know about you and we have been one from the beginning, my son
you are the friend of my soul's most secret corner, my son
I observe your struggle for life with desire to protect you
I will send you my strenght, be the sun that brings you home

when I see you floating in that turbulent space
so far and yet just a breath away, away from me
and I am powerlessly gazing at the stars, my son
paralysed by pulsing adrenalin
you will never be alone again
I observe your struggle for life with desire to protect you
I will send you my strenght, be the sun that brings you home
I am awaiting your arrival my chosen son
when you feel my tears then I will be happy and clean
