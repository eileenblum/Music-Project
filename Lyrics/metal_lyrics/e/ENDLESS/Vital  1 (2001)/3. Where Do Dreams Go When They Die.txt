I fly unseen through
The wind of the worlds
After a long gloomy
Pale winter night
I fly unseen through
The wind of the worlds
Can I interest you in silence?

Once I looked to the stars
They were all blood
Once I looked to the stars
If you open that door
They were all blood
Once I looked to the stars
If you open that door
Why can't we all just walk away?

Dance in the harmony
In heaven of death
Wishing no longer upon stars
What when is love but mourning
So let me fall into you

First time I felt like unborn
I'm your son without your name

Why can't we all just walk away?
I shall arise
