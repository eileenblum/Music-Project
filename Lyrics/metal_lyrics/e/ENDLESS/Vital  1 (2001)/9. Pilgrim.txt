The pilgrim is looking for a hidden place
When he's hungry and thirsty
When he longs to wash dust from his legs
He wanders to mountains' foot
Day and night the sky is his vault
The pilgrim is looking for the words
When he's seeing the beauty
That surrounded him

The pilgrim is looking for
The answer to questions
That don't let him sleep
Until he closes his eyes
And falls asleep

The pilgrim is looking for understandin'
Coming through experience
He rises abot the cliff and watches
Sundown in the sea

The pilgrim is looking for
The answer to questions
That don't let him sleep until he closes his eyes and falls asleep
That don't let him sleep
His soul will set out on a way home
