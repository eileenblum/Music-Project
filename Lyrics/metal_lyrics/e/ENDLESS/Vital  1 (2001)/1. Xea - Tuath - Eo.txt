Future love
Always I walk in the dark deep forest
To the places where
I saw you for the first time
But I don't know how should
I show you my feelings
That came here now
To the dark empire of trees

I lay down into dead moss
And I wait just for your touch
And in cold mornings
I was coming back to the people
Whom I couldn't understand

Our mind are entwined in stars
Entwined in new extasies
We spent lots of nights this way there!
