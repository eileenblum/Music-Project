What a man felt
When he saw a sundown
For the first time
Over a high fence
In the end of the world
Far away from shores

Far away from sea
Far away from ground
That four elephants decided
To carry on their backs
How long was he waiting?
Watched the horizon
Where the last rays got lost!

Before he shut his eyes
He saw pictures in the stars
What was on his mind
When the morning sun
Started to bask his neck

What was on his mind
Wondering he turned
Away from the west
And saw the same sun
For the second time there
Deja vu.
