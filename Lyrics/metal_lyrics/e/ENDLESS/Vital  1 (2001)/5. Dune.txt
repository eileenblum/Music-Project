Maybe there's crater of oasis behind another dune
Who knows?
I don't want to guess
I want to go on and make myself sure
I want to see another shadow behind the hill
One shadow is like a wrinkle in the dust
You sit on the crest of dune
And you have the whole world
In your palm

The rays refract in a crack of clouds
And glitter that wants to warm
Maybe there's crater
Behind another dune

I don't want to guess
I want to go and make myself sure

And you have the whole world
In your palm
Where the single chase can't decide
Even though it plays a part
Light and shadow
In the grey dust between dunes

I want to see another shadow behind the hill
One shadow is like a wrinkle in the dust
You sit on the crest of dune
You're alone here so ask with whom.
