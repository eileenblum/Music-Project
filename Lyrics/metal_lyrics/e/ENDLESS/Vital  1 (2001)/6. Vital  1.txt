I'm the one who gave you life
Worship me with every dawn

I'm the bomb that takes your life
I'm the star of your solar system
I'm the owner of your planet
Your lives
You'd lose in darkness without me

I'm the owner of your planet
Your lives
Your would lose
In darkness without me
It takes me 8 minutes to you
It takes you 93 millions miles to me
I'm your star

I'm king here, dominant being
My moment is your eternity
I'm master of chain-reaction

I'm turning your earth
I swung your oceans
I'm the drug
That shines your faces
I'm your star
