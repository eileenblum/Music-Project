Immersed in my armchair
I'm leaving my body
I'm watching the atomic hell unleashed beneath me
I'm alone... only I'm to see...
Who decide it about?

Like cigarettes' smoke... they're rising to sky
The souls that watched together with me
...how children were dying with open eyes
...tears instead of blood... blood instead of tears

Only I saw how the angels' wings burnt

Maybe they'll see what I saw
Maybe they'll densely turn their heads

Only I saw how the angels' wings burnt
