I sit here and observe the sky with my dreamy eyes
My soul leaves my body and flies to far stars
I visit unknown worlds where I can see
No lies... dirt... betrayal... everything is white

Unknown places full of admirable secrets
Thousands of stories where I'm the main hero
Fallen kingdoms
Fallen cultures
I'm happy and free... so free here

Why do we have to run to other worlds
to feel secure
Why does the reality kill my soul
and smother my thoughts

In my mind I build worlds
Which even god couldn't create
And that's why it's good we can dream
...even though it's under the grey sky
