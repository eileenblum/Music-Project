By the landscape where you're hearing the shadows sing
Where clouds are dancing the dance of anxiety
You can meet us there...you don't have to scare

Everything is eternal
We hung time and icy wind tore it's hair
And we go on... 'till there will be the sense
You can hear the black thoughts from thorns of roses
There's not only gloom what is laughing in the darkness
Go on and don't turn around... you don't have to scare

And thousand crows are throwing themselves into the sea
Waves of surf eat cliffs here
You can see strange tracks in the sand... you don't have to scare

We don't stop... there's dark deep forest in front of us
All alive long time ago turned to stone by horror
And still you're hearing the strange singing...
You don't have to scare

And forever we'll go on with flames in our eyes
With fire in our hearts
You can see us... you can hear our singing
It's endless way... way of darkness... way of fear
But you don't have to scare... endless!
