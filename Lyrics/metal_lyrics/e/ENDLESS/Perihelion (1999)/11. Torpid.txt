I'm just laughing... why do you cry all the time?
I'm standing here upright... don't look down all the time
I'm alive... why do you die all the time?
I want to fight... do you enjoy watching?
I'm flying... so why are you crawling?
I wonder... why do you stand aside, as if...
Torpid, sleepy, weak and paralysed

The end of joy?
The end of life?
The end of summer and the beginning of winter?
Think of the difference between us...

I keep of walking and don't turn around
Why did you turn back to the object?
My eyes are open...
Why do you wear sunglasses at night?
I don't confide in strangers... why are you scared?

I was never afraid to turn my head against the wall...
And that's why I'm not like you...
Torpid, sleepy, weak and paralysed
