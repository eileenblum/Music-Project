Scream lost in dry, salty lake
Crystals of sult glitter
The sand is moist and hot
Like human sight calling for help
Before their boats got on the dry place

Dying vicinity and country
Where human's life lost the sense long time ago

Last scream
If there were any trees
Maybe it'd knock off and return to an old-man mouth
Who's leaving
Perhaps dying just like the lake
Imprints of dead fish in salt you walk on
Surely it burnts with the blood of cracked soles

The scream left lost long time ago
With the last drop
Salty like a tear
