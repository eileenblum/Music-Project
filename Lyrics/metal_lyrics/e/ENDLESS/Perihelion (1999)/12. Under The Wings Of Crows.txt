Just a whisper of thousand crows
Spreads my palm
Somewhere behind the fence, where's the world's end
Perhaps there, just there I fell on my knees
To black mud on the ground

Just a whisper of thousand crows holds my hand
A palm knocking on the door of blindness
The scream of crows, only wings of blindmen
I want to hear their yell
In echoes of blind crows in the black nights

Just a whisper of thousand crows
Transfers my soul from all parts
The soul torn out of an old picture
The wing gring to human's world
Where the infantry man with a white stick
More than I can see!!
