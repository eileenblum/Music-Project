[Lyrics by Chris]

Falling further into your mind
searching for the keys to unlock
meaning to the answers of the
sea of dreams which float before me

Journey into the abyss
of the random excess thoughts
controlled by your mind
swimming through the ocean
of thoughts you can't create when you rise

You've stepped foot in my mind
you won't find the answers here
but don't forget your way
there's nothing to fear
