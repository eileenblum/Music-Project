slipping through the universe
as I lay dormant in space
I think I have found my place
far away from this discordant race

gripping tighter, day by day
asphyxiating the masses
with this world set ablaze
we are shrouded in an endless haze

gripping tighter, day by day
lacerating the master's slaves

I have found peace
stretching through the horizon
devoid of all inhibitions

time is collapsing
reaching through the event horizon
through space and time, we will align
and I am finally free

what's always confused me
has entered inside
it's killed off my body
but opened my eyes

we exist within a system
we can not escape its grasp
