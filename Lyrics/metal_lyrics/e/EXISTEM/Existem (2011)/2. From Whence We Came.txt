realize this universal fact of life
consciousness will define the fine line
between fallacies and reality

all the minds that create
they love, have, and annotate
shaped by cosmic powers you can't fathom

recreate your mind
leave the ones behind
who can not
resonate with those around you

feel the ascension lift you up and bring you back
bask in the light, to return to the origin
from whence we came

fleeting fractals of light
racing through space and time
know that we are gods of of this earth

This carbon based malicious race
exists to serve its system, we fall prey
