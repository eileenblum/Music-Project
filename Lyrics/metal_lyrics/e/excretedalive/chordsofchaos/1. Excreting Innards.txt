[musick - Matt Harvey, Derrel Houdashelt; lyrixxx - Matt Harvey, 1992]

Gnawing the stools, I masticate with fervor, Enthusiastically I ingest the
discharge of your gaping anus, Anal disgorgement of steaming bits of meat...
  Each smelly mouthful I devour, Your rectum is now going sour...  I divulge
the latent feast of your colon, As my drill gouges an avenue of
ano-obliteration...  Steaming fecal morsels expelled, Chunks of watery
bloodied stool, Your salivating sphincter is throbbing, As I begin to
heartily drool...  Shredded chunks of your buttocks, Your gaping anus is
ground and mulched, As you are made to excrete your innards, Your pulsating
sphincter emits a septic belch...  Sanguineous anal discharge...  Loosened
bowel segments, Your colon hemorraghing in fecal fistula, This disemboweling
enema, Turns your anus inside-out...
