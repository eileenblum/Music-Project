[Lyrics: Mattias Holmgren]

The world arose before my eyes
I thought I heard Jesus cries
But then it happened I begun to change
My soul left my body
An erotic sin was born inside of me
From now and until I die
Emotions flows through my body
Like a never ending stream
Hear my call from the other side
I am free,oh I am free
Deep in me violins play my song
Late at night I dance with you
In velvet dress I killed you
Now when you are dead I am alone
On this world of stone
In the forest deeper, deeper
Searching for the shortest way to hell
The man inside of me is gone
And replace by a demon
