[Lyrics:Mattias Holmgren]

When last light fades and all that was returns
Mysteries never known by humans
We thought they were lost
But we were wrong
Now they're to far to reach
Among ancient gods they will sleep
In the grave I am buried
A treasure lies
Resting with me sharing my dreams
For every day that passes I get weaker

Soon my body wither away 
And so my love for you
The fountain of magic has dried out
No more a spell will be cast

Why do we want such a world
What madness lies behind all this
Every day the sky is crying pitch black tears
The world is soon covered by shadows
