[Lyrics:Mattias Holmgren]

Shapeless faces in the break of dawn
My mind shatters like a mirror
Every part a remembrance from me
Symphony from my deepest sorrows
Played by tortured angels
This is life but still I am dead
Through the twilight in the roaring of a storm
Life seems to end
Heroes from past they battle at last
Slowly I die away from this world
Entering another dimension
White clad they walk by my side
Their laughters I still hear
Chains on my arms i scream: fuck god
Nobody hear me as they take me away

I close my eyes but still I can see him
Tearing with nails in human souls
(Close and closer) for every moment
Soon he is here to take my life
Shapeless
