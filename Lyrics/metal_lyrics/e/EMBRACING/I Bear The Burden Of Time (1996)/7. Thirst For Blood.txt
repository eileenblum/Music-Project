[Lyrics:Henrik Nygren]

When you appear the wind turns to ice
Time stops, I can see your eyes
Glitter in the night, see your thirst for blood
It can not be satisfied, you are fearless
And won't leave
You always watch us until you get hungry
Then you choose your victims on random
And you play your shadow game
Until insanity, until weakness comes
You play with them like the puppet master himself
You are mighty but not impossible 
This night I will get you
Run through the living night, and find your weak spot
Make you suffer like you made me do
But time is not on your side
This time I will win, I'm your destiny
You will become a victim in your own system
I am coming to get you
