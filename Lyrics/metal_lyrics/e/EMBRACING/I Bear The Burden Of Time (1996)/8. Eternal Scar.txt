[Lyrics:Henrik Nygren]

Dagger of destruction
Stabbed into my torment soul
Lived my life through pain
Death is cold, just like you
From the stars I was thrown down
To this worthless world
But I will grow strong once again
And slowly take form to strike back
Against your kingdome, against you mighty wall
Send you through my dream, through my hell
You won't see tomorrow
Only hate and eternal sorrow
The light shall be no more
Eternal scar
