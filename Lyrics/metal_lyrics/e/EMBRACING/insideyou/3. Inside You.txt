Sometimes I wonder why
They never could, could let me die
Your body is my resting place now
Can't move or speak like before
I'm limited inside your thoughts
And only by your sight I can be sure I exist

[1]
Darkness, when you dream at night
Pain, you never know what it is like
Hate, in envy you lost yourself 
Inside you, I'm your mirror image

[Chorus]
Inside you I can feel your anger
It's just like hell but only colder
Inside you, united with your dark mind

Through your eyes of eager
See you end so many lifes
I wonder why you keep going on
Inside your head I'm your greatest triumph
It's a joy for you knowing that I'm the watcher
Trying to make me like you

[Repeat 1:]
[Repeat Chorus:]
