Behind this mirrorwall
Lurk something evil
I've touched it's nakedness
And keep seeing creatures of the dark

[1]
Tempting me rebirth 
Promising eternal life

They call for me every night
Give me reasons to destroy myself
I really tried to avoid this
But now my prophecy is rewritten

[Repeat 1:]

[Chorus]
Stop crying, you must face your destiny
Stop crying, when it's done one can't return

I stare into the wall
It's like a dream but now it's real
Strange shapes waves back to me
They want me to take part in their dance

[2]
With a hand araised infront of me
I'm entering the reflection

When I have reached the other side
They're not here, only me and the stars
And then again I hear the voices
You wanted eternal life 

[Repeat 2:]
[Repeat chorus:]
