There was a time when I was young
I walked inside the forest on my own
No one cared for me I was not of their kind

Aside a little river I lay down in the silence
Looking up in the clear blue sky
This was like the finest dream I've ever had
The rising winds made me wonder 
I could feel the presence of Gelhein Thari

[Chorus]
Fell the dragon rage tonight
Don't let the beast out of your sight
He'll be guiding me to the land
Into the land where I belong
Dragon rage

Everyone had screamed to me in disgust
I had never had a friend
The only one who cared for me
Was the woman I loved
But she was was hanging the gallow now
Because she had brought me a rose

[Repeat Chorus:]
[Repeat Chorus:]
