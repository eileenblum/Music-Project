I know that this is sad
But can you hear me from the shadow world
I am so weak and soon to die
Wish I could see your face once more

[Chorus:]
Heroes die in a battle
I am one of those
It feels like we are together
But still I'm so, so cold

I know they will write songs and stories
My name will be remembered
At least my word of victory
And the silver tears that I cry

[Chorus 2:]
Heroes die in a battle
I am one of those
We will never be together
Perhaps when you are dead

"People die, but still they live on in our hearts..."
