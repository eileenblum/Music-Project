The first daylight stroke me
I lost the word I was about to say
And left in my hand was only a leaf
I think I'll name it Tomorrow
Beautiful field of serenade
They play my song on their violins
Golden gems reaching for me
Never fall for the shiny temptation
Hear the echoing screams calling
Drown in a lake 
Deep down to the bottom of my sorrows
A meeting in silence
The lost girl and I
We circled into the unknown
Greet the homecoming
Wave them inside the hall
Sit down, hail with us
Guess the king is proud of me
Giant cubes upon my shore
Torn down by oceans tide
We sit there all alone in the blue
Spill venus blood
A darkred stream down her spine
I think I'll name it Tomorrow
I will name it Tomorrow, name it Tomorrow
Itching in her open eye
I must give a helping hand
Taste my fingers and my words
And I will give you more than so
A dream with a white sea
I think I'll name it Tomorrow
I will name it Tomorrow, name it Tomorrow
