I used to be blind
Living inside a dream someone had created
Without knowing where I really was
Searching my mind for the answer
My hands was still shaking
The lightning I had called
A burning feeling but still I felt it was right
That strike destroyed my enemy
Burned his face into ashes
I was never again the same 
Once again I'm here
My eyes are shining
Deep in the dark shadows
I?m hunting desperately for a victim
Blood will soon be shed, but I bet you already knew
I don?t want to do this, but that?s a killers nature
Had never believed that I existed
As a statue I had guarded his cave
Then one day there came a man
His hands made the stone turn to flesh
I could see again and hate pounded through my veins
I had returned again to be the killer
Called back from my sleep
Once again I'm here
My eyes are shining
Deep in the dark shadows
I?m hunting desperately for a victim
Blood will soon be shed, and I bet you already knew
But that's a killers nature
