When you watch the sun set
And listen to the ocean for a while
Touch the water feel the cold
You have awoken from a dream

Morningdew slowly dries away
And so the feelings for a lost friend

But you know they will come back tonight
As soon as your head is resting on your pillow
The dreams will be driving you so insane
You blamed someone so close
But you knew that you was the cause

It's not as it seems
The memories come and then they go
But then they always return
We are always reminded of the past

Morningdew slowly dries away
And so the feelings for a lost friend
