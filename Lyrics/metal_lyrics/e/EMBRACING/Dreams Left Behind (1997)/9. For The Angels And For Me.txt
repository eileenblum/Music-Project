When I can't see what's real and unreal
Reality but a bleak memory to me
Of years in sorrow and hatred 
The dreams they helped me through
Lifted me up from the shadows
Suicide was near, but not here
In a world no one can see
Only for the angels and for me
I escaped the truth and the lies
Forced my soul to depart with my body
That always was sitting by a window
Gazing out into that cold and rainy street
Tears in eyes because of someone lost
Or maybe never found
My mind was always filled with so much anger
I don't carry that burden anymore
I'm free of feelings, but still I care
For all the ones I left behind
