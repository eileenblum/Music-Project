It was my last night here in life
For thousand years I had lived
The elven magic kept me alive
Not even a poisoned arrow could made me fall
Long time no seen
Are you still the deep nights queen
Long time no seen
They told me you were here
Pale, crying faces I can see
Are these your lost childrens hands
Will I become one of them
Are you afraid of what we can do
Long time no seen
Are you still the deep nights queen
Long time no seen
They told me you were here
I've come to seek the answer
Why my elven friends are gone
They travelled in the time and so they never returned
Now I'm here to vitness your confession
