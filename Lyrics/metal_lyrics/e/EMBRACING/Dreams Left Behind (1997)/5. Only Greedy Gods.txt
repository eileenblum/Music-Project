Freedom...
We are travelling to a new age and to another land
Are we afraid of what?s behind
Or perhaps what?s to come
Once there was a promise 
A name would free us from all lies
A word would unite all the dreamers
That day was last year
They are all the same
Only greedy gods
In autumn yellow we saw him rise
We had wished for a savior
But the newborn was the opposite
In his glowing eyes we saw nothing but hate and greed
The great hall was soon filled with our own blood
Fear was spread across the land
Our king was weak and soon died away 
With his kingdom the crown fell
No one's left there to the story tell
We were the last ones to escape
Another world shall not fall
They are all the same
Only greedy gods
