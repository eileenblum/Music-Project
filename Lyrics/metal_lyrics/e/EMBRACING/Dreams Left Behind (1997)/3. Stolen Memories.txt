Gleaming eyes out in the night
I've been lost in these woods
Since the priest cursed me
Made me blind to the reality
And now all I can see
Are the mourning angels

It will soon be hard to remember
My memories and secrets
You never could imagine
My stolen memories

They had named me dragonprince
I was born with the eyes of a dragon
And now I'm inside a forest
With no entrance nor exit
Trapped inside a sick dream
Where the light is dark
And the red is blood

Watch me tremble in the night
Laugh at my every try
I no longer care
Stolen memories
