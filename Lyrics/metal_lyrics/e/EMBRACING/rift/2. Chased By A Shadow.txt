It' s hiding from daylight inside the eastern crypt
You have seen him and shivered with his presence 
He' s a killer but yet not very unlike me 
A bi-product of a dimensional journey 

[Vers 1:]
Something tells me I' ve seen him somewhere before 
Maybe I lost a part of myself inside the rift 
Flashing fragments turned into place
Incomplete as he needs the final piece, "it's me you want"

[Chorus:]
Chased by a shadow
How can we possible escape 
Try to keep your heads low
But he already knows my second take 

Gelhein... Who is calling me by my true name?

[Vers 2:] 
How come the shadows grow before me
Caught in their paralyzing embrace
Maybe it's time to turn myself in 
But I can't just give up and write down: The End 

[Solo:] 

[Chorus:] 
Chasing the shadow
I take back what was already mine
And there's nothing left for you 
New signs form in the heaven 

( Gelhein... A telepathic voice still calls me by my true name )
