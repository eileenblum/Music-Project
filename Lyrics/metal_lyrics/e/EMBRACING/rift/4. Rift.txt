[Vers 1:]
I've made a tough decision 
We must make sure that mankind will survive
They' ve taken everything, but this sacred promise
Though this might be the last day for me with you
I have to make you sleep and dream of someone else
Seal your past, so you won't be able to tell them 

[Chorus 1:] 
I open a rift into the unknown
And take a silent walk, through time
Where ends this colorful journey 
Will I ever see the curtain fall 

[Vers 2:] 
The dream is strongar than ever
There is unchained magic in the air 
It's right before me on a transparant plane 
Juggling with a liquid substance
Is it a final test I have to break through
Which way am I supposed to chose 

[Repeat chorus:] 

[Bridge:] 
Suddenly I'm able to hear my own steps 
But still unable to sort out what's far and what's near 
And when the unseen walls I pass becomes concrete
Is it all in vain, am I about to spend my time with time 

[Vers 3 :]
I made a tough decision a long time ago
After I realized we were falling apart 
Though it was the last day for me with you 
I made you sleep and dream of someone else
It's blocking out the truth, buried deep in you

[Repeat chorus:]
