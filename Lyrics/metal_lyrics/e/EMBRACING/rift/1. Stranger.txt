[Vers 1:]

Octagon sided summersun blinded my eyes
Though overwhelming curiosity itched in me
Exhausted arms trembled and touched a tree
Familiar senses hungering for more 

[Pre-Chorus:]
A dry silence fell to pass by a feary whisper 
This little maid seemed as helpless and lost as I
Then shimmering words asked for a favour
Lay down with me tall stranger 

[Chorus:]
Simple words unable to reach my tounge
Songless birds never be the same without
Ruby hearted from then and ever after 

[Vers 2:] 
Wet grass met my naked and frozen skin
Their purple clouds was like ours used to be
And the distant lovely laughter helps me remember
It hurts me to say I'll never see them again 

[Repeat Pre-chorus]
[Repeat chorus]
