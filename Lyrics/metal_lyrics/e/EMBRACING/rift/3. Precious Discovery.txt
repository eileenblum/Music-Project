There is something I have wanted to tell you
Though I'm afraid to let it fall into the wrong hands 
An endless burden is upon my shoulders, it tears me apart 
Hurry, I'm losing the words and the strength in my voice 

[Vers 1:] 
The last survivor from a parallell dimension 
Chosen to prevail and remember what once was 
All memories are at place but it's uncomfortable 
To be so close an overfilled energy source

[Chorus:]
There is something I've discovered beyond the shining stars 
Your wildest dream was never close to the beauty
-Is it as precious as our burning sun 
-Sweet words from one we judged as a threat 

[Vers 2:] 
What about you, where will you turn 
It was so easy to harm, but takes alot to repay
A touch of my fingertip can heal a withered flower
But your world I'm unable to recreate 

[Repeat Chorus:] 

There is something I have wanted to show you
Though I was afraid to see it fall into the wrong hands 
But with the time it slipped away from my own:Why? 
You wouldn't believe in my precious discovery:Why?
