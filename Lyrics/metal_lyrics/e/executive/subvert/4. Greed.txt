Debt is mightier than the sword.
Banking cartels push us into a corner.
Religion suffocates our quest for knowledge.

Are we going to succumb to these tyrants demands?
Or can we still win back our natural rights?

So much injustice in the world today, but no one gives a fuck about the world, it's all about themselves.
These humane values we have created never truly existed to begin with.

Intelligence is a flawed concept.
We are destroying everything.
We live within the most destructive period of human history on a global scale.
Do you realize you must destroy in order to create?

Perpetual production for profit contaminates the land, seas, and air.
At the expense of the less fortunate, they profit from their greed.

It has already begun.
The media is owned.
Human rights activists being blacklisted as "terrorists."
