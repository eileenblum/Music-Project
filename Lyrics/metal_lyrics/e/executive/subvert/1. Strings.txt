I have finally become what I despise.
It was only a matter of time.
Always fucking shortchanged, always stepped on.
For once in my life with no remorse I got what I wanted.
The sweet taste has grown bitter.
I hated everything you are, now I'm no better.
I have become like you.

The world is starved by greed, we must force the corporations to recede.
Why has (this) war become a mechanism of peace?
Value is a term of the past, modern life knows only price.
We must bring the change before we reach, self-manufactured downfall.

Keep the weak in ruin, put the strong to shame.
Keep the rich in power, keep the poor at bay.
Money being created, never to be repaid.
You and the tyrants, you're one in the same.
