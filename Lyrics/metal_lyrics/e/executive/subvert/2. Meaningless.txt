Their lives are meaningless perpetuation of corporate interest.
Indentured servitude to the pay governments.
They are just pawns in the corporate scheme.
Puppets of international banking fiends.

The 1% drown the rest in debt.
They will only stop taking when there's nothing left.
Money leads to power, power leads to greed.
We will only find freedom, when society recedes.

What is the meaning of a life like this?
Our livelihood, stolen as a gift to the already rich.
This flawed system, armored deep into its roots.
How will we progress believing lies as truth?

The words you speak, mean short of nothing to me.
You think you're so sly, how you dance around the lies.
All this time I've wasted on you.
You're transparent, I see right through.

We have wasted years on this worthless charade.
I will never make the same mistake again.
Your words are meaningless to me.
I've spent my life, living out these lies.
My only regret is that I never opened my eyes.

If I had cared I could've pushed the change.
The 99% stuck in this eternal game.
