We've been fucked from the start.
Poisoned since conception.
We are all experiments.

If I never awoke again, I wouldn't be happy in the least.
The dead don't feel emotion, at least I'd be at peace.
Waiting is no longer my game, I've been playing it for years.
Your lies have grown old, and cold; And now for you I've grown too bold.
The feelings inside, the feelings you hide.
And within you I will not confide.

Step the fuck back, before you regret it.
Before you regret everything you said.
You didn't even have the common decency, just to let me know.
Fuck you.

Fuck you, and everything you've ever made me feel.
Your twisted values are a fucking disease.
I feel sorry for anyone that you have ever loved.

Question your beliefs.
