[Lyrics by J.]
[Music by Elenium]

Shades of Gray are your another existence,
Times they combine here in your little world.
Slowly the essence of you pines away.
Alone here you are, the world of your chaos,
The world of your pain.
And in the place of your agony,
Lays the key to your madness.

Come with me, follow me you'll see.
My inner voice tempts you, haunts you.
Try to scream and you'll be that little child you used to

Give in to your fears, give in to your anxietes.
Epochs past and you awake, just to see the dream again.

I can see what you see not,
Your cries for help are all you got.
When you turn, I'll be gone, whispering my hidden song.

Shades of Gray are your another existence.
Times they combine here in your little world.
Alone here you are in the world of your chaos,
World of your pain and in the place of your agony.

Whispering my hidden song, there is no place you can flee. My shadows roam
where light should be.
Alone here you are the world of your chaos,
World of your pain. And in the place, of your agony.

Come with me, follow me you'll see
My inner voice tempts you, haunts you
Try to scream and you will be,
That little child you used to...
