Two times the failure
was the value of our triumph
This is it, the frontier
and we're about to take the leap

Who was that
had your heart bouncing
Curiously looked like me
but with other plans

Three times into the bull's eye
the price in a mistake
This is it, the familiar
and I'm bored

Everyone before me
everyone in your dreams
everyone is after me
everyone in your dreams

What kind of reasoning
fulfills us completely?
What kind of hammering
makes us stronger?
what kind of reasoning
what kind of hammering

[music: Salo]
