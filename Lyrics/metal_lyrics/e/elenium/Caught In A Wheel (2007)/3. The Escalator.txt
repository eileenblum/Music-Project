The paths we choose
the edge we loose
The Eden we're living in
the Hell we're giving in
Persuade the opposition
to agree on the goals
they're here to stay
in their position

I have no time to explain
how I feel
I am too busy to see
how I feel

The fights we win
when battle is no sin
the times we pray
we hope they're here to stay
And when we finally have the time
a spit's what is next online
was it really a surprise?

To explain the explainable
to witness the bearable
to carry the rocks by ourselves
you are losing it, can not feel it
grasp it
until you can feel it

[music: Leinonen, Salo]
