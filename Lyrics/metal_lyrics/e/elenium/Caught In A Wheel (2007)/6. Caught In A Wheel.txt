Deep within the mirror
you're trying to hide the snore
hate night after blows
you try but lost energy

Today is decided...
we are not alone

When caught in a wheel
you'll play a part
improvise say:
"I... am caught in a wheel"

Today our plan
is to taste real good
a constitution will be written

it's as we see it
did someone repeat
what I just said
it's like we're grasping it
re-initiate the repeat

[music: Salo]
