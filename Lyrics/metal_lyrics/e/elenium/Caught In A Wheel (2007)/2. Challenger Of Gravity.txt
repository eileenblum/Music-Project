Looks like a shadow
but a ray of light is what you'll get
seems like moment
a lifetime is what you'll deserve

What is what
and does it count that much?
of course it does

Yesterday I climbed
into a tree of knowledge
yesterday I saw it cut down
Today, planting
on a fresh ground

Remember the cutting edge
that day,
shoes tied firmly into the ground
Today o' today
we're walking
and indeed we bleed

[music: Salo]
