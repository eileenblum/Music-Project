I didn't provoke you for nothing
You did not wake up without a reason
We try to aim to heaven
one piece out of time
One says: "our purpose is to be"
when one is lost to it's call

What if you have no way out
what if you have no safe floor
What if you're caught
what if you're gone

You do your best to sell out
a first class maneuver without a doubt
containing the right amount of everything
And then the jump
a new deck of cards
but our hand only leads
A summit to another flaw
a summit to another fall

[music: Salo]
