Sideshows follow
not seen by the bright eyes
but the stench fills up the air
A trail full of beggars
leads into nausea
we would rather be elsewhere

Wise men try to speak up in the crowd

King's seat is always taken
and the brave want to be orbese
They've taken the liking
to be tugged in their beds
they're fast asleep

At some point
I'll start to laugh

[music: Leinonen, RÃ¤isÃ¤nen, Salo]
