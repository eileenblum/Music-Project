There used to be a grave
standing here
where now
and old forest grows
There used to be a voice
to stand up and shout:
"In the midst of life
we are in death!"

There used to be woods
around here
some ten thousand years ago
Now look at it
just a grave standing on it

There used to be a world here
now a cloud of dust
and a grave
standing on one of the rocks
