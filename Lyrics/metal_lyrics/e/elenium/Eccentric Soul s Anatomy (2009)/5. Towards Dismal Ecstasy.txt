the night has come
the night of full moon
stars of your eyes are gold
my spirit perceived the gloom

my ears heard troublesome melody
strange voices in the fog
I feel your breath on my neck
I feel the warmth of your hands
frozen tears on your cheek
deny my swollen delusions

the time has come
the time of tragedy
diamonds of your mind are blind

my sensual eye embodied your shape
spherical flowers of your breasts

the day has come
the day of funeral
treasures of your womb are mine
