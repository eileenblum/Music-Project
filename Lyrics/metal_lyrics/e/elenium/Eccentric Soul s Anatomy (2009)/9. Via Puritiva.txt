bleeding colours poisoned my heart
I was the holy martyr
impassive voice ripped the dead silence
I was the great creator
scar on the face, crimson axe in hands
I was severe warrior
now I'm straying. I can't find my tongue
I'm an empty god

what have I become?
answers are too much tumultuous
new fire blossomed in the bosom of mine
my suicide is in the offing
path of debris - my curse
I'm holding flames in the palms of my hands

I can see the deepest despair
I can hear chaotic breath
what have I done?
cry, cry cruel world, for me
derisive laugh inside my mouth - my claws
the man I should have arose
insanity

there are no other words to express my suffering
there is no other way to understand my fears
touch the land of my spiritual darkness
taste the soil from my lonely grave
it's so cold

call me now
kiss me now
