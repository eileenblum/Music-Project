from immortal fairyland
from vineyards of blood
ventriloquist has come
his eyes were like pearls
like glamour of tawdry deed

shattered
eternal whisper on fiery lips
kiss of infectious betrayal

shattered
black wings of insane sage
journey through suffering

shattered
filthy touch of ravished body
he was an innocence of fluttering souls

black vision of allegiance
deceitful matrix of reality
altar of blind tradition
pernicious allegory of hypocrisy

eternal whisper on fiery lips
kiss of infectious betrayal
filthy touch of ravished body

sermons - vision in a shroud
blessed by the carnivorous gods
almighty illness which is a fate
destiny for betrayers and fools
affected pride in flames of glory
rituals closed in mediterranean circle
old ethical system, epos of sorrow
prelude to ambiguity, purple denial

burn the inheritance
burn the past
