[Lyrics by J.]
[Music by Elenium]

Had a weird one last night
Gave me the chance to creep
Everything isn't over for me
I feel the need to continue
Could I be wrong?
So if I'm wrong
Illusion replaced the truth
If I'm misguided
Illusion as the truth
Had a weird one this night
Gave me the chance to creep

[chorus]
Why is it everyone understood
In what way?
They proceed to live again
I died when I peeked
I begun to malfunction
Shut down, reboot, shut down

Now I laugh and grin
I'm the mockery, the joke, the mortal
You see yourself in me
You'll have your weird one too
Prepare for the show

[chorus...]

This much I, I will tell you
You aren't what you appear to be
Life as the camourflage
Death as the last point on your way
I too see them in me
Your white lies and the black ones
They will seem as the point
They are the ultimate failure
This much I will tell you
And the rest is just meaningless
Chatter of infinity
False hope for you and for me

[chorus...]
