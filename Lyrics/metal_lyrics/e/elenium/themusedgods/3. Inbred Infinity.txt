[Lyrics by J.]
[Music by Elenium]

I create, ejaculate, this world

I am immortal
I am eternal
I am internal
Infernal
Creator, saviour, the end

I create, I cease this world

I am alone
I am with you all
I am external
I love
Victim, follower
The reason for it all

[chorus]
These things I repeat
These things I live with
These plains I'll summon
This life
I'll try to create
These things I repeat
I'm immortal, I'm eternal
I'm internal -infernal
I'm alone, I'm with you all
I'm eternal -I love
Creator, saviour
The end, victim, follower
The reason for it all
