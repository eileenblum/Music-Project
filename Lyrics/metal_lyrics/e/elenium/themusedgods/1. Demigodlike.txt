[Lyrics by J.]
[Music by Elenium]

You see yourself as the next step
From the divine afterglow
Pulsing, vibrating, individual
Everything under your control
Every moment a born victory
On your private show

Demigod - look at yourself
The mirror is shattering
Fake ruler of your being
Is looking back at you

[chorus]
Can you please come with me
And gaze at the truth
Now you finally see
You're just one of them
One of Them Used Gods

And you're amazingly similar form
To the followers
Simple, bleeding,
From the gods palm feeding
You just don't comprehend the fact that
You're alone, alone, totally alone

Demigod - see closer
The mirror is catching up on you
True dealer, your shaping figure
I saw you shaking hands

[chorus...]

What did you find? was the coldness still there?
Was it a loathsome place? did it stain your privacy?
Was it really on fire or were you kicked out?
You, as transparent as any of you
