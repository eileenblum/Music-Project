[Lyrics: J. &amp; T. Raisanen]
[Music by Elenium]

We're gonna share it all - and all is made for us
Anyone not fast enough falls - consequence or cause?
Now is the time - for us to reign
I promise and comfort - but we`re not holding hands

Make the modern life
Worth it all
Cause I'm the stabber - opportunity grabber
Just pour it in

It's a matter of bullets between you and me
We've come this close -blindfolded
We claim we're free

How high and fast are you ready to go
Or will you be the last - the least in line
And the leech in our spine

Ludicrous to witness the smile
A pile of rubbish wiped out of time
In the line is the objective
Most subjective of all
