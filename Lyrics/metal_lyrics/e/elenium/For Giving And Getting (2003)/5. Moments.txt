[Lyrics by J.]
[Music by Elenium]

Dead man walking
Dead man on his way
Dead man talking
And breathing in the day

Sometimes a gun in his mouth
Sometimes happy with a doubt
Never slowing down
But not so sure

It's always todays turn to shine
It's always todays turn to be

I'm gonna be wondering
There so long, so strong
Realize what is wrong
And the time is moving
The clock is ticking, ticking, ticking
So I'll be guessing, undressing
The moment I'll soon be caressing

Dead man walking
Dead man on his way
Never slowing down
Still breathing in the day
