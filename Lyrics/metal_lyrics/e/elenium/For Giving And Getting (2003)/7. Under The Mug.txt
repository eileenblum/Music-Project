[Lyrics by J.]
[Music by Elenium]

Been looking for something
Been here before
Had to search the light
Never found the darkness
Been here before

Tried to listen
For the sake of hearing
To catch a glimpse
To see it disappear

Been back, been gone
Been the one and only
For far too long

I can laugh and live
And prepare to die
I can swallow my love
And for once spit it out
Goodbye
