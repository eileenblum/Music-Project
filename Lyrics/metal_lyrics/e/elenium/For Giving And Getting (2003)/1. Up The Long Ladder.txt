[Lyrics by J.]
[Music by Elenium]

Familiar suits are usually the ones,
Who ask the most
For what ever the reason being
They still wait on their post
Lost is the cause
And the means of doing
Gained some information
To cause awful noise
Somebody has to wake up the neighbours

For all we care
There's still a bunch of miles to go
For all we care
There's still a bunch of miles to know

Grown to give names in the same games
We others too play
It's a shame they had to stay
And wait, oh wait, they were slain
Admit it and be on an easy street
Take more, eager lazy feet
Someone will pick you up
