[Lyrics by J.]
[Music by Elenium]

You said you would be - you said you would love
You claimed the house - you claimed the soul

That mortal coil can't be nothing
You promised - are you there, anywhere?

To fill the void outside
And share it with me

Kill for me - you'll do it for free
Put out the flame that fades inside you

I will be there - I will be love
Let's share the home - come to bury the shame

You don't need it anymore
You'll have my kind of love
Let's share your soul

I was the child - you were the way
And the path - you led me astray
Promised kingdom to come
Like fools gold it glittered
You're still the one for some
But reality ate me

Used in my name
The king in my fate

Kill for free - you'll do it for me
Put out the flame - it dies inside of you

I will be there - I will be love
Let's share your soul

Look at your world now - look at the mass now
It's coming apart, but they're still praying
Look at your world now

You don't need it anymore
You'll have my kind of love
Don't dare to ask for more
