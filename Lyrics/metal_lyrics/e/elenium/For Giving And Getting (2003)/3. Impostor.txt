[Lyrics by J.]
[Music by Elenium]

Life - you've been doing it again
And now I'm a few steps behind

Curious isn't it
How I hang on to you
And for what reason?
For what indeed
I really like to hang on

Hey life - I lost another one
The train moves on
And I'm just catching my breath
(A shellfish moving in lead)

And life - I apologize for making this so hard
For myself, I really like to hang on

I wish I could understand
I'm doing all I can - I'm giving a hand
I wish I could understand - I'm doing all I can
For myself, I'm getting there soon
