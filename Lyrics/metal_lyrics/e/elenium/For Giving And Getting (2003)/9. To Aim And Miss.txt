[Lyrics by J.]
[Music by Elenium]

Today is my right to feel and live
All the moments to the bone
I never saw it coming, but it happened
Not to me

I am in unity with the feeling
Sunshine definitely now forseen
Now that I'm used to living
Steady chaos

I am in constant motion
Here, there, at the same time everywhere
You'll have all I can offer
And more

you said you'd take me to safety
You urged and I believed
You said you'd take me to safety
And I believed when you said
You'd take me
