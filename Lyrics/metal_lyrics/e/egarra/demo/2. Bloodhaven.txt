In bed, feeling left in my head, nothing said.
Slept through the sun again
In bed, feeling like I have no friends, ashamed instead
Slept through the sun again
In bed, feeling left in my head, nothing said.
Slept through the sun again
I canât help you wonder whatâs the purpose or why Iâm in any place.
Fuck me, all I want is sleep and not to dream anything
Weâll spend our entire lives searching for nothing
Whatâs the point?
