Disconnected, drained, dragged along.
Forced into circles of those who change.
Those you've called, "The ones who cashed your faults."
Head deep,
Empty, but aware and away.
All those nights, holding tight, Iâm here and there but fine.
I just want out of my skin: fuck you
all Iâm done, Iâm going home.
Itâs easy to loath this city.
Am I slipping away?
