Sing the remains of your anguish
Tormented exhausted move forward
Feel strength relief its a new page
It wont write itself we've much work to do now

Cried lied to yourself
Wired fired senses fail

I cant hold back tears in my eyes
I see the red lines scars forever remind
You're not alone don't forget that
You're not alone don't forget that

Find what you know
Were you afraid to show
You hid it well from me friend
I'm someone on which you can depend
Please don't

Cry or lie to yourself
Wired fired sensed failed

I cant hold back tears in my eyes
I see the red lines scars forever remind
You're not alone don't forget that
You're not alone don't forget that

You're not alone don't forget that

I cant hold back tears in my eyes
I see the red lines scars forever remind
You're not alone don't forget that
You're not alone don't forget that
