Cry for comfort, cry out the betrayal
Were lost and silent, the silence remains today
I waited I squandered, everythings insane
One last misdemeanour, seals our tragic end
Six years ruined, six years unsettles the dust
Six years ruined by one nights lust
Six years unsettles the dust
Six years ruined by one nights lust

A sincere sentence, a look of shear delay
My words rot decay heart pounds the great giveaway
Miles away from this hurt find a way through this
Happiness unbeknown, distinction lost in turmoil

I'm slumped I'm defeated, lost sight who fell first
Intense confusing, like cowards pretending to fight
Filth covers the night sky, stars share our plight
We have this procedure, to seal our tragic end

A sincere sentence, a look of shear delay
My words rot decay heart pounds the great giveaway
Miles away from this hurt find a way through this
Happiness unbeknown, distinction lost in turmoil
Lost in turmoil

Lost in turmoil

Distinction lost in turmoil

A sincere sentence, a look of shear delay
My words rot decay heart pounds the great giveaway

A sincere sentence, a look of shear delay
My words rot decay heart pounds the great giveaway
Miles away from this hurt find a way through this
Happiness unbeknown, distinction lost in turmoil

Distinction lost in turmoil
