One foot closer, every step faster
Catastrophe avoided, we're in the same place
Reaching surface, eyes to the wall
Watch when we fall, don't look away, see it all

I sit embraced by this disgrace
You move elegant, silence my regrets

Grasping clichÃ©s, nothing's changed
I'm just the same as before, I've looked no further
Grasping clichÃ©s, all sound the same
I'm just the same as before, I've looked no further

We've been building relentless unforgiving
Destroying and making while they were suffering
They scream and they cry, we've only time to say goodbye
It was over before we left, forgive, forget, don't pretend

I sit embraced by this disgrace
You move elegant, silence my regrets

Grasping clichÃ©s, nothing's changed
I'm just the same as before, I've looked no further
Grasping clichÃ©s, all sound the same
I'm just the same as before, I've looked no further

Grasping clichÃ©s, we've not changed

I bet you won't change a thing
All they need is your charity
Messed around enough to know
Which directions good to go
You are just as responsible
Don't turn your eyes to the wall
Need to see this for yourself
Need to save them from this hell

Grasping clichÃ©s, nothing's changed
I'm just the same as before, I've looked no further
Grasping clichÃ©s, nothing's changed
I'm just the same as before, I've looked no further
