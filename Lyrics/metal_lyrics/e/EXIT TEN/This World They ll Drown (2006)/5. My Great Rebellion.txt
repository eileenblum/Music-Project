Ive been told hundred times hypocrites advise my life
We have no hope of better happiness than to join them
We are drifting you and I down a path that's so defined
Blinding light tides advance dreams are swept from my sight
Its freedom in a way from the mind that's been so betrayed

My great rebellion has yet to end
It seems the current is stronger these days that I swim against
Aren't you scared of the day
That well all have to let go and flow freely

Hysterical as it may seem I'm not quite sure where Ive been
Twenty three years now I'm losing the will to keep counting
Craving something more than this broken heart now nothing fits
Where to now I'm holding on as tight as I can
Its freedom in a way from the mind that's been so betrayed

My great rebellion has yet to end
It seems the current is stronger these days that I swim against
Aren't you scared of the day
That well all have to let go and flow freely

The galaxies unfolded once for me
But I cant see the stars anymore
I laid out my dreams to you
It took me time to realise the truth

Its freedom in a way from the mind that's been so betrayed

My great rebellion has yet to end
It seems the current is stronger these days that I swim against
Aren't you scared of the day
That well all have to let go and flow freely
