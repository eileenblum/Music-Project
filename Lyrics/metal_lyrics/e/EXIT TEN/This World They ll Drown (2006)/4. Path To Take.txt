Fly crash and burn
Eventual fait is none of my concern
Lie and hurt yourself
I wont degrade my soul by hating you

I will not permit influence on how I stand how I sit
Narrow-mindedness flippant insults throw about in fear
And you I realise that Ill be coming back
And Ill be showing you what I mean
And Ill be saving this for you and I will
Set out a path to take

I'm better than you anyway
Why don't you look inside
Yourself you might just find
What makes you like this
Makes you act maliciously

Fly and crash and burn
None of my concern
Lie and hurt yourself
I wont degrade my soul by hating you

You've excelled yourself
Sat amongst your fears and your doubts
Cant hide from your lies
Feelings fuelling parts were here to play
And you I realise that Ill be coming back
And Ill be showing you what I mean
And Ill be saving this for you and I will
Set out a path to take

I'm better than you anyway
Why don't you look inside
Yourself you might just find
What makes you like this
Makes you act maliciously
And you undo this for me
Ill be showing it to you
And I will show you hate
Ill show you hate
Ill show you hate
Fly crash burn
Fly crash burn

I'm better than you anyway
Why don't you look inside
Yourself you might just find
What makes you like this
Makes you act maliciously
And you undo this for me
Ill be showing it to you
And I will show you hate
I will show you the way
I will show you the way
I will show you the way
