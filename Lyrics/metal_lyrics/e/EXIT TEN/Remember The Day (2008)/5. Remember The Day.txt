We've lost the love that we shared
We can't speak we just stare
I'm afraid to look you in the eyes

So have we claimed the last life tonight?
We loved we lost we died you and I
All around us an emptiness fills this room
I'll remember the day something changed within you
Soon we'll chant
Our love ends

We've lost the love that we shared
We can't speak we just stare
And I'm afraid how much you changed tonight
We've lost the love that we shared
We can't speak we just stare
I'm afraid to look you in the eyes

Don't look at me if it has to be this way
Soon we'll change and the bitterness fades away
We'll be wondering just what the hell happened here
I'll be happy but just now I'm gripped with fear
Soon we'll chant
Our love ends
Soon we'll chant
Our love ends

We've lost the love that we shared
We can't speak we just stare
And I'm afraid how much you changed tonight
We've lost the love that we shared
We can't speak we just stare
I'm afraid to look you in the eyes

I'm breathing but not alive

We've lost the love that we shared
We can't speak we just stare
And I'm afraid how much you changed tonight
We've lost the love that we shared
We can't speak we just stare
I'm afraid to look you in the eyes

I'm breathing
But I'm not alive
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
