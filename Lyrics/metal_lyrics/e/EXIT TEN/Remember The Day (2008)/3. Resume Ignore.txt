One foot closer every step faster
Catastrophe avoided weâre in the same place
Reaching surface eyes to the wall
Watch when we fall donât look away see it all
I sit embraced by this disgrace
You move elegant silence my regrets

Grasping clichÃ©s nothingâs changed
Iâm just the same as before, Iâve looked no further
Grasping clichÃ©s all sound the same
Iâm just the same as before, Iâve looked no further

Weâve been building relentless unforgiving
Destroying and making while they were suffering
They scream and they cry weâve only time to say goodbye
It was over before we left forgive forget donât pretend
I sit embraced by this disgrace you move elegant silence my regrets

Grasping clichÃ©s nothingâs changed
Iâm just the same as before, Iâve looked no further
Grasping clichÃ©s all sound the same
Iâm just the same as before, Iâve looked no further

Grasping clichÃ©s
Weâve not changed
I bet you wonât change a thing
All they need is your charity
Messed around enough to know
Which directions good to go
You are just as responsible
Donât turn your eyes to the wall
Need to see this for yourself
Need to save them from this hell

Grasping clichÃ©s nothingâs changed
Iâm just the same as before, Iâve looked no further
Grasping clichÃ©s nothingâs changed
Iâm just the same as before, Iâve looked no further
