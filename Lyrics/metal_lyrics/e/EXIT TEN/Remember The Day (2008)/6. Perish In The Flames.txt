All I need you to know
That you never ever left my soul
And you never will
I could not comprehend
A life living without you
But now I have to
All I need you to know
That you never ever left my soul
And you never will
I could not comprehend
A life living without you
But now I have to
I could not comprehend

How could I admit that I had fallen
You weren't there to catch me
You left me alone
And now that I am sick and I am broken
I need you get me out of this hole

Is this how you repay me
Self righteous fires burn
Standing consumed now
How an earth are we to learn
We perish in the flames
We are mortal in the end
We are mortal

How could I admit that I had fallen
You weren't there to catch me
You left me alone
And now that I am sick and I am broken
I need you get me out of this hole

I walked down
Your road today
And I stood outside
Your door briefly
Alone

How could I admit that I had fallen
You weren't there to catch me
You left me alone
And now that I am sick and I am broken
I need you get me out of this hole

I walked down
Your road today
And I stood outside
Your door briefly

I miss you
