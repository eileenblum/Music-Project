I had created the person I was
No fear of losing pace in the direction I walked
Seems harder these days to choose
Devastated I lose I lose

Your eyes succumb blinded at once
Still yet to learn be yourself don't be led
Your eyes succumb opened just once
Reveal yourself reveal yourself

I've lost the will to fight on
My corners fuelled with fear not the love I want
How could it be that I'm lost
With freedom nowhere to run
I've not long to decide what's right

I'm not sure where we're headed
We've got to figure this out

Your eyes succumb blinded at once
Still yet to learn be yourself don't be led
Your eyes succumb opened just once
Reveal yourself reveal yourself

I wonder why I'm more lost now
Then I have ever been in my life
I wish I could start this over
But where would I be then I be then

I'm not sure where we're headed
We've got to figure this out

Your eyes succumb blinded at once
Still yet to learn be yourself don't be led
Your eyes succumb opened just once
Reveal yourself reveal yourself

Your eyes succumb
Blinded at once
Your eyes succumb
Still yet to learn
