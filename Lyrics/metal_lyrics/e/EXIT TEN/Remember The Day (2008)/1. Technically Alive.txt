These are the ways we die inside,
Granted I may have to cover my eyes,
Don't be a fool I heard them say,
Don't be a fool and throw this away.

Ability got the better of me,
Our freedoms suddenly served to limit what we could achieve,
If we want to see what it would be like,
Not to desire, I wish I hadn't lied to myself.

Technically alive,
Just not inside,
I'll be shielding your eyes,
If you shield mine.

I changed how I perceived the world,
No longer in the pursuit of their dreams of future's ours to be made,
We are not slaves, they are enraged,
We can still save ourselves.

Technically alive,
Just not inside,
I'll be shielding your eyes,
If you shield mine.

Not for the first time,
I feel revived,
My heart free, my mind wide,
Now's the time that we decide,

My heart is free,
My mind is wide.

Technically alive,
Just not inside,
Technically alive,
Just not inside,
I'll be shielding your eyes,
If you shield mine.

Not for the first time,
I feel revived,
My heart free, my mind wide
Now's the time that we decide.
