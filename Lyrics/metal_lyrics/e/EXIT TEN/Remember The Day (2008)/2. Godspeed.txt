I've been trying
I've been disguising the truth
Every moment consumes every bit of my youth
I have watched as my dreams died
Their light reflected in your eyes
Lessons are only learnt once you've tried something first

They'll be honest
We'll be relieved
They've broken their promises
Nothing to anchor me
Send us somewhere safe
With sunsets and sandbanks
We'll be holding hands
And there's nothing to harm me
Nothing to harm us
Nothing to harm us

No idea can succeed
Without sacrifices
All too easy to complain
And not face the consequences
I see clearer now more time has passed

They'll be honest
We'll be relieved
They've broken their promises
Nothing to anchor me
Send us somewhere safe
With sunsets and sandbanks
We'll be holding hands
And there's nothing to harm me
Nothing to harm us
Nothing to harm us

Let's escape and get lost
The two of us gone
The two of us gone
We can be free and safe
If only we could imagine such a place
In our minds we are explorers
Great discoveries await us

They'll be honest
We'll be relieved
They've broken their promises
Nothing to anchor me
Send us somewhere safe
With sunsets and sandbanks
We'll be holding hands
And there's nothing to harm me
Nothing to harm us
Nothing to harm us
