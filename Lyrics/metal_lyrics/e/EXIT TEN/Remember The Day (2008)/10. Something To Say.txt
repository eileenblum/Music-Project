We won't lie down at least I can guarantee
We'll not be seen to frown in the face of adversity
Their words ring around our heads, got to right these wrongs they said

We all do it in our own little way and we've got something, we've got something to say
That we all live once and we've got this chance, let's not argue who's to blame

Souls bearing under one another, I fight to the top to rediscover
Some element of truth some part uncomplicated but I'll not be distracted

And you aren't the only one who is guided by the sun
And It's with a heavy heart that I climb to the top

We all do it in our own little way and we've got something, we've got something to say
That we all live once and we've got this chance, let's not argue who's to blame

I've got this funny feeling that I missed some discussion
Where power was more important than their suffering

And you aren't the only one who is guided by the sun
And It's with a heavy heart that I climb to the top

We all do it in our own little way and we've got something, we've got something to say
That we all live once and we've got this chance, let's not argue who's to blame

Demonstrate this to me, demonstrate this to me
That you are as bold as you seem, demonstrate that you are bold

We are souls buried and I will not be distracted
