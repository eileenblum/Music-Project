Some will say they love you
Their world surrounds you
You're better off not fighting it
Better off not fighting it
We pretend we don't know what you're going through
We'd help you out if we could
Help you out if we could

We're the warriors and breakers of hearts
We'd be better off together let's start
I'll be showing you what we are capable of
I'll be showing you what we are capable of
We're the warriors and breakers of hearts
We'd be better off together let's start
I'll be showing you what we are capable of
I'll be showing you what we are capable of

I don't mind if you bury me
I will be loving you honestly
Heart races I'm in no doubt
Your hold on me is tight enough
Love, lust, words stuck in my throat
There is something you ought to know
Love always leaves a scar
Love always leaves a scar

We're the warriors and breakers of hearts
We'd be better off together let's start
I'll be showing you what we are capable of
I'll be showing you what we are capable of
We're the warriors and breakers of hearts
We'd be better off together let's start
Showing people what we're capable of
Do you know what you are capable of?

It's just a part of life
Lonely me, lonely you
We can't be without
Each other, we have to let go
Rain down on me
Heartache and misery
Alone I live on
My heart broken
I'll mend
I'll need my friends
Time seems to have stopped
My heart keeps beating on

We're the warriors and breakers of hearts
We'd be better off together let's start
I'll be showing you what we are capable of
I'll be showing you what we are capable of
We're the warriors and breakers of hearts
We'd be better off together let's start
I'll be showing you what we are capable of
I'll be showing you what we are capable of
