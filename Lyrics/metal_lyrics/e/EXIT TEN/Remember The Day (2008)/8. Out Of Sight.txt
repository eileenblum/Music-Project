Two white lines a strong cocktail
Semi-sober thoughts now I can't tell
What happened to the dreams I had
What ever will I do when things turn bad
I've lost my sense of self
Lost my eye for detail

Eyes fixed on what you're doing
His voice vanished in to the dark

Lately I've not been myself
It's one of the many things that I do well
And if you were to follow my lead
Then our dance would soon end in defeat

Eyes fixed on what you're doing
His voice vanished in to the dark

We've given little thought to them
How they've been living
They spent so much time
And left so much behind

Look to the climactic ends can't find my way down
I need some violence to make me fell alive
When I know it's safe love me love me
And then I'm drifting out I'm lost and out of sight
I don't think sympathy
Averts tragedy

We've given little thought to them
How they've been living
They spent so much time
And left so much behind

We've been sacrificed
We'll be well tonight
But we wont belong
We'll be fighting force
We've been sacrificed
We'll be well tonight
And we won't belong
We'll be fighting force

We're sacrificed
And we'll be well tonight
And we wont belong
We'll be fighting force unknown
