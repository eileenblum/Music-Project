It's a tear drop given unto a sea
Of emotional outbursts diluting we
It's a status we don't deserve
A personal response to our every word
There's no true holiday if you never went away
How can you live by yourself anymore?

Suggest a path suggest a route we take
Our web is spun we are trapped things got ugly
Suggest a path suggest a route we take
Our spirit lead us here we've forgotten the way

Try not to ever lose touch
We're all the words, we're all the words within us
We stand by the river side
Staring at all they have to hide
There's no true privacy
If you give it all away
How do we live by ourselves anymore?

Our web is spun we are trapped things got ugly
Suggest a path suggest a route we take

Suggest a path
We're trapped we can't get out
Suggest a route
We are longing for you

When they write about these times their ink would have all run out
We were lost and covered over the swelling waters surround
We'll all find ourselves in reflections in time
We'll all realize there was a life to be found

We are longing for you
