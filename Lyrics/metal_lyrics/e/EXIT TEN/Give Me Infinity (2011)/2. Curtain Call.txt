We were talking foolish words,
And telling lies to all of them.
Trying to cover up the only thing that mattered then,
And now it's plain to see that we've failed in our task.
The final curtains call came at last to tell it's done.

I see that you are falling off,
The van wagon of your love.
Don't get back home
It's not your turn. [x2]

We were feeling youthful work
And sharing truth with all of you
Failing to find the truth,
And the crowd too knew what we'll do.
And now it's plain to see that we've failed in our task.
The final curtain call came at last to tell it's done.

I see that you are falling off,
The van wagon of your love.
Don't get back home
It's not your turn. [x2]

And we were talking foolish words,
And telling lies to all of them.
Trying to cover up the only thing that mattered then,
And now it's plain to see how we failed in our task.
The final curtains colors came at last to tell it's done.

I see that you are falling off,
The van wagon of your love.
Get back home and it's not your turn. [x4]
