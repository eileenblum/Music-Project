waiting for the cut of the waves 
that threw me to the ground, there I lay
donât be weary, don't be undone, 
now count to ten, then we can sing,
never let lies, grab your spirit, 
go head-first into the mouth

life, life
life, life

you're a sight, for sore eyes
you're a sight, that changed my life
you only live once, so donât think twice
bones break and they mend
its just a part of life

searching for a way to rule, 
and do things like you knew we would
don't be the one who doesn't exist,
whatcha waiting for? 
wake up child, we can fight it
we are bold we are capable

you're a sight, for sore eyes
you're a sight, that changed my life
you only live once, so donât think twice
bones break and they mend
its just a part of life, of life
just a part of life, of life

live,
like, you wont exist
we fire our gun, we hear the screams, 
we hid the bombs under your seat
we ignite

you're a sight, for sore eyes
you're a sight, that changed my life

you're a sight, for sore eyes
you're a sight, that changed my life
you only live once, so donât think twice
bones break and they mend
its just a part of life, of life
just a part of life, of life
