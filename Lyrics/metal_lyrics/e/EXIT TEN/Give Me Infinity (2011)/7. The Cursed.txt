They never believed
That we would be
Able to change
(That we would be)
And reveled in what
They saw as our cynical gaze
(They saw as our)
There is much in me, could be happy
So they decree
(Could be happy)
But we've yet to see the light within
We've yet to see the joy it brings

A cynical view
Will not bring joy into your life
(Will not bring joy)
While always surprised
You'll not see life
Like the wise
(Always surprised)
There is much to see,
If only you'd open your eyes
(Open your eyes)
There is more of us that could be happy
With the right will and energy

I've often wondered at the truth it offered
Is that to work or making our dreams happen
We'll all discover this earth
Has so much to offer the cursed
How about we try being absurd
Be positive for what it's worth
Although
We struggle
Life will be better than this
Trust me I promise
That you will not fall down
If you can enjoy now
Enjoy now

I won't
Be any longer
Down-trod
This sentence ends with
You lost
You never had a chance
With your view of the world
Eyes wide
This is the start of
The cure
To all your ailments
We are the words
At the beginning of
A victorious monologue

We'll all discover this earth
Has so much to offer the cursed
How about we try being absurd
Be positive for what it's worth
Although
We struggle
Life will be better than this
Trust me I promise
That you will not fall down
If you can enjoy now

How 'bout we try
To find
The positives in life
Your time to make good
Your time to make good

Send "The Cursed" Ringtone to your Cell
