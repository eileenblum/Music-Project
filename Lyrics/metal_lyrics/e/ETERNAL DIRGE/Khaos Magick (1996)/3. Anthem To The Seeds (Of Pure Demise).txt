[Music: Eternal Dirge]
[Lyrics: Eternal Dirge]

Incarnation of infernal malice
Soaked with wincing life
Far beyond the boundaries
Of phantasmagoric rage

Deep into the reeling suction
Insane eruptions of destruction

Twisting dissociation
Into the radical void
Ascending cataclysm
Of divine delight
Spawn of the underworld
Seeds from the sepulchre

Time is extinct
In the seas of the unreal
Where limitless oblivion
Floats in me eternally

O Legions of voracity
Proceed on thy way
To shores yet undreamed
To reign with thy will

By the black altar of Tsathogguah
And the leathery wings of hate
I'll serve thy power absolute
Devoted to my fate

Remember
O Prince of the black seas
Bestow on me the powers
To crush my enemies
Remember
O Master of black skies
I chant this anthem
To the seeds of pure demise
