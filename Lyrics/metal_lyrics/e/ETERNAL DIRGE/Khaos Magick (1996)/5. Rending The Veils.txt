[Music: Eternal Dirge]
[Lyrics: Eternal Dirge]

Deny the day
Onthrough the night
The light shines bright

Force my way
To the end of day
Onthrough the night
Hunt for prey
In rust of might
The only way

Yearn...burn
It's a return
To the mother, to the pleasures
And the comfort of the womb
To that ancient cauldron of plenty
That feeds all who come before it
The wisdom men seek far and wide
But is inside them all the time

Render of veils
Point me the way
To the place where I lost my sanity
Render of veils
Waste my life
Put an end to my way...
