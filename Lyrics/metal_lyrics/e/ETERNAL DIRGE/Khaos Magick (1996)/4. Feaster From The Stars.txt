[Music: Eternal Dirge]
[Lyrics: Eternal Dirge]

The potion faints my view
As my mental journey begins
To places I once knew
They deliver my astral remains

My long winging flight through the void
I have to cross the universe of light
To claim what was, is and will be mine
Infinite quest through endless time

Recreated by the thoughts
Caught in the Trapezoid
Send me through the Abyssos of radiance

Oh feaster from the stars!

I am the fulfiller
Oh prophecy of BA'Al
Come speak to me in ancient tongue
Answer the elder's call

All my life, all my love
All my soul, all myself
I will give to you

There is a light at the end of the tunnel
Oh feaster from the stars!
