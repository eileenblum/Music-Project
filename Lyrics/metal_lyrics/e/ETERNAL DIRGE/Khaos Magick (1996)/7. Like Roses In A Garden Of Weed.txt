[Music: Eternal Dirge]
[Lyrics: Eternal Dirge]

We are the joy and strength of this world

As we ride over night-skies
Through spheres once unknown
The breeze of the north wind doth lead us
home
Back to the land where my forefathers died
Back to the shores from which truth once
derived
All that remains is a flash of red in the snow

We are an image of time and stone
Forlorn in darkness we roam alone

We are like roses in a garden of weed
We are as wolves that wander among sheep

Their false beliefs died under our horses' hoofs
Accepting their judgement - facing the truth

From a glorious crusade we proudly return
As soul-cleansing flames of redemption still
burn
Watch them consume all life as it dies
As corpse-fire melts the so-long-frozen ice

All that remains is a flash of red in the snow
Wir sind ein Bild aus Stein und Zeit
Verloren steh'n wir still in Dunkelheit

We are like roses in a garden full of weed
We are as wolves that wander among sheep

All that remains is a flash of red in the snow...
