[Music: Eternal Dirge]
[Lyrics: Eternal Dirge]

Burn within me, pleasures
Fees my empty mind
Strengthen my desire
My perfect queen of night

And I'm receiving more
Than I bargained for
Dedication everymore
To the order of the sore

My own Satan
Oh sweet Satan
Say you love Satan
My own sweet Satan

Every man
And every woman is a star [AL 1,3]
Thou hast the right
To do thy will
None shall say nay [AL 1,42-3]
Slaves shall serve
Love is the law, love under will [AL 1, 57]

Thrown onto this world
So unknown and unreal
And no-one seems to share
The emptiness I feel

Deep within my heart
The Flame of prometheus burns
And I will swim against the tide
Until it turns!

Jesus!!
Thou shalt not lead my way of life
Satan!!
Ride my soul onthrough the night.
