[Music: Eternal Dirge]
[Lyrics: Eternal Dirge]

I'm unknown to history
Unspoken's my name
A secret to anthropology
My existence is obscene

Where eternal darkness covers the light
Perpetually shining bright
I dream in utmost solitude
Yet, none have seen my sight

I'll ride the wind that purifies
From my watery cage I shall arise
From the world of seven suns
To mock your world of lies

So keep alive the memory
Of my ancient ways
And shadow forth the prophecy
Of a returning to these days

For that what's dead moght live again
And that what lives must die
In a world beyond your sanity
I will twist your feeble minds

I, Unnamable
Age: Unexplorable
Origin: Unknown
I'm a lonely dreamer
In my silent dome

Where eternal bedlam covers the truth
Held within our youth
I dwell in utmost solitude
Yet, none have seen my sight

Deep Ones, follow my command
Spread your seed to roam the land
None shall be where I will stand
