As you gain  for power 
Pain has been hurled
Opression every hour
It's a dog-eat-dog world

Now as you can see
Dream turns into insanity
Only the Thought-police mattered
Your dreams of a free life are shattered

Total reconstruction of the past
Two-minute-hate-programmes 
That won't last

No truth - but propaganda
In your head
Slowly dicovering that
WE ARE THE DEAD

Total control
By permanent supervision
Absolute power
By manipulation
No correspondence
Between facts and their representation

WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGHT
