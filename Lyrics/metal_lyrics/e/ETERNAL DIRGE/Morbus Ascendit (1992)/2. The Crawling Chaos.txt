Everyone listened -
And everyone was listening
As it lumbered slobbingly
Into sight and gropingly
Squeezed ist immensity
Through the black doorway
Into the tainted outside air
Of that poison-city of madness

Nyarlathotep, great messenger
Bringer of strange joy
Father of the millions 
To Yuggoth, through the void

So from the wells of night 
To the gulfs of space
And from the gulfs of space
To the wells of night

Now that we've come together
Our mind's unite as one
The stars are standing right
For Cthulhu to come
Chant the ancient rhyme
That maketh the Absu gleam
Iae Hastur c'fayak
Come forth, Archaic Lords

Shubb Nigghurath
Goat with a thousand young
Lord of the black woods
Arise and spread your breed

Nyarlathotep ... have mercy
The lightning ... no longer flashes
I can see all ... that is not sight
Where light is dark ... and dark is light

I've seen the dark universe yawning
Where the black planets roll without aim
Where they roll in their horror unheeded
Without knowledge or lustre or name

Nyarlathotep, I call to thee
Return from the black star
That lies within the Hyades
Not far from Aldebar
