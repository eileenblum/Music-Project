Economy prevailing morality
The principle on which we are all lived
More inventions to accumulate prosperity
To feed the greed of industry

The crushing wheels of society
Greased with our bloody sweat
Spill forth some new deformity
Mindlessly blind, outrageously mad

What extent of degeneration 
Can be achieved by exploitation
My generation rots at consciousness
Just mere sad crawling putrescence

Not more than raging human scum
A waste of spermial fluidum
Desoyribonucleicacid rape
A twisted mass, a morbid shape

Evolved mutations
Warped by your inheritance
Walking perversions
See us suffer without sense

A passion for dying
A craving for death
Tomorrow is worthless
We are already dead
