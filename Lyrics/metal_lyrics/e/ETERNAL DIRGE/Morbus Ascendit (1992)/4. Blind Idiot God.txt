Nameless is this ancient city
Beyond the R'lyeh gate
Blasphemies from elder stars 
That dream beneath the sea

The green spawn of the universe 
Shall awake to claim his own
Regurgitated from his tomb
Now finally free to roam

Praise the three-lobed burnig eye
Ascend from below through the gates
Ever the praises of mighty Tsatthoggua
And Him-who-can't-be-named

A kind of force
That doesn't belong
in our part of space

A twisted truth
That is all wrong
And can never be a fake

If heaven is mercyful
The sight I saw
Will some day efface

And if there is a god 
In the heavens above
Let me live my last days in peace ...
... of mind

Blind Idiot God
