See our cities, our civilization
Sick termite disorganisation
Ant colonies, divided in floors
Stocked up in sections
Like segments of worms

Domesticated primates strive
In ignorant mindless policy
Claiming evolutional enormity
For dehumanizing life

Crawling embryonic beings
Protected by weak crusts of ego
Yawn infantile obedience
Of vegetative decadence

Excessively producing cubic isolation
Eroding the need for communication

Sluglike, larval citizens in embryonic phobia
Roam sinister vaults inside the tombs of metropolis
Harmonized the unity of insectoid construction
Mercylessly cloning more machineries of consumption

Reveal bio-intelligence, the dominance of species
Emerge from tubular cavities, show necropolitic faces
Populate a dying world, bare of vegetation
Dwell forth in anguish, citizens - complete degeneration!

Creeping larval creatures,
No longer individuals

The decadence within

Crawl forward to obliteration
Efface in self-immolation
