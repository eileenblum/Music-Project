I am the lord of desire
who sent pestilence on this world.
Droll dwarf of derision
is my songster, my blasphemy.

In my kingdom of divinity
I'm creator and I'm devotee.
My believers live in distant fear.
They try to repose holy sanctity.

I am the mist which crucify all religions.
Testimony, rusty nails, pain and blood on the cross.

Blast of my breath
is ethical misunderstanding.
My truth turns the coffin,
turns black roses and tears.

Darkland's dwellers and eternity.
Perturbation lead to cruelty.
Armageddon somewhere disappeared.
All proggression is the prodigy.

Belief, hope and love.
Three cursed words, old wryfaced promise, lie.
My secret spells, words of edge, clue.
My secret spell, words of my edge.
My spirit cry dancing with shades and die.
Question and sense, sequel of art and kiss.
