Life is fading as you sleep.
Stop what's happening, get on your feet.
The time is now to start your way,
life is yours - awake!

From your slumber you shall awake!

Unite the body and the soul,
feel the passion in heart and mind.
Take a chance and break these walls
and you'll be granted with peaceful harmony. 

From your slumber you shall awake!

From your slumber you shall awake!
