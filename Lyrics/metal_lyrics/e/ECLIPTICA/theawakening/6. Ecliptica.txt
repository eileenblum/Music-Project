Mother, see how our children slowly fade away.
There is no hope for us to stay.
We have to pay the price, sold to us as freedom.

Father, see how our land lays poor and bleeding,
Broken to pieces at our feet.
This is not our world; war isnât the key to freedom!!

Slowly fade away/there is no hope/lays poor and bleeding

No war can justify the destruction on our lives.
There is no single reason to start up with this crime.
Corrupt politicians are playinâ their games of might.
No signs of human dignity in their acting!!

The last battle has begun.
The light of life takes revenge!
Weâre travelling back into darkness!
Ecliptica forevermore!!

Black in black weâre on the way to our funeral.
Natural disasters one by one created by ourselves.
Climatic overkill could be the final act.
Revenge comes crawling slowly to their makers.

The last battle has begun.
The light of life takes revenge!
Weâre travelling back into darkness!
Ecliptica forevermore!!

There is no song of hope, which I can sing for you.
I am just here to take your hand and remind you.
That dreams canât die, if you believe in to.
That you can change the world, 
with every step youâll take!

The last battle has begun.
The light of life takes revenge!
Weâre travelling back into darkness!
Ecliptica forevermore!!

-The last battle
Take a look at mother earth, what weâve done to her.
-Has begun
Destroy ourselves, killing time and we do not care.
-The light of life
Take a look into the past, try to understand,
-Takes revenge
The futureâs near, donât forget, it is in our hands!
