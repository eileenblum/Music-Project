My parents theyâve taught me right from wrong.
All these years theyâve made me strong.
But this is a fight I cannot win!
Am I a fool who lives in sin?

If you will leave thereâs empty space.
Why do we live to fall from grace?
Father I wish your wounds could heal,
by the force of my steel.

And Iâve never felt the rain as cold as tonight,
the candle burned out, delivered from all the pain.

At the twilight hall- we will meet again.
At the twilight hall- no, no more pain.
At the twilight hall- to reach new goals.
And Iâll wear your memory drawn on my soul.

Mother I swear, I will be there.
The knight that my fatherâs proud to see.
My senses are weak but I will fight,
since the dead met us tonightâ¦.

And Iâve never felt the rain as cold as tonight,
the candle burned out, delivered from all the pain.

At the twilight hall- we will meet again.
At the twilight hall- no, no more pain.
At the twilight hall- to reach new goals.
And Iâll wear your memory drawn on my soul.

Drawn in flames, your sign on my skin.
I will not rest and in the end weâll win.
