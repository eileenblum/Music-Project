She was such a beauty face, innocent eyes,
can't know about the weight that lasts on her shoulders.

She's forced to be queen by the ring, common blood.
Lost in the twilight and left from her god.
All of her dreams were betrayed by the one.
She has loved him and trusted, that noble son.

Greed and hate have taken all his senses for reality.
Make the kingdom grow and fill up the mighty treasury.

The morning sun is opening a new chapter of her life.
Peace for her people, but the price she's forced to pay...

These careless words she has spoken, left the spell unbroken
and all of her dreams are bound to die.
These careless words she has spoken, left the spell unbroken
and all of her dreams are bound to die... are bound to die!

As the night arrives that day, 
I'm not longer afraid to change my way.
Out of sight for what he's done, 
blow out the candle of the noble son...

She's forced to be queen by the ring, common blood.
Lost in the twilight and left from her god.
From sickness attacked she is fading away,
and her cries 'round the court you can hear 'til today!

These careless words she has spoken, left the spell unbroken
and all of her dreams are bound to die.
These careless words she has spoken, left the spell unbroken
and all of her dreams are bound to die... 
are bound to, are bound to... die!
