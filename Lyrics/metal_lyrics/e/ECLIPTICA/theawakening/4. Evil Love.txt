She wears an angelÂ´s smile in front of tied up eyes,
bittersweet and strange to realize.
Words surround her female art by lips of cherry done,
assuring me that innocence is gone.

A spark she sets has grown into a sea of flames.
A razorÂ´s tongue walks back around my neckâ¦.

This evil love has got me bad,
shootinâ from my toes up to my head. 
This evil love it keeps me going on,
straight from hell or sent from heaven above-
Evil love!!

Just like a shadow in the night she disappears,
awakening a handful of fears.
As she moves, she grooves a dream into my head,
paints it down in burning red.

Suddenly she turns her back against myself and then
she whispers, catch me if you canâ¦.

This evil love has got me bad,
shootinâ from my toes up to my head. 
This evil love it keeps me going on,
straight from hell or sent from heaven above-
Evil love!!
