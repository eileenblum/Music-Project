[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler; June 2010]

The stormâs getting closer and we are far too blind to see.
This path that weâve chosen led us to this misery.

And now we feel like never before.
Youâre still the one whom I adore.

Baby, Baby - why canât you hold me?
Baby, Baby â could you say that youâd die for me?
Weâve crossed this fine line between love and misery.

The rain feels colder and even some sunbeams cannot heal.
Weâre dancing through ghost lights and nothing seems to be real.

And still we feel like never before.
We canât cry forevermore.

Baby, Baby - why canât you hold me?
Baby, Baby â could you say that youâd die for me?
Weâve crossed this fine line between love andâ¦ miseryâ¦

[SOLO]

Baby, Baby - why canât you hold me?
Baby, Baby â could you say that youâd die for me?
Weâve crossed this fine line between love and misery.
