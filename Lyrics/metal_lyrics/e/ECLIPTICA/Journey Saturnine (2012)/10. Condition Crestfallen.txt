[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler; April 2010]

One life could never be enough, to break these chains to win your heart.
Feels like hitchhiking âcross the desert land.
Iâve played the clown, I was the king, was the one who searched the ring.
All in all it seems your heart is hot-wired.

Togetherness is just an illusion.
The longing for home stays a dream. 
Youâre waitinâ âtil someone will knock on your door 
to serve a solution to you. (Shivers to the coreâ¦)
How can you act like a whore?

Long goneâ¦ awayâ¦
There is nothing left to say.
Pride betrays your passion everyday.
Long runâ¦ nowhereâ¦
Somehow you should take some care.
You canât stay in shade and hide out there.

Youâre eyes wonât fool me once again. No more dances in the rain.
Not another night caught in your sweet cold jail.
I was your shelter, Iâve fought your fears, was the one who dried your tears. 
But this time you have killed all emotions.

One fuckinâ match could also be a failure.
The treasures in life are still close.
And youâre waitinâ âtil someone will knock on your door
to serve the solution to you. (How can you ignoreâ¦)
I will not wait anymore!

Long goneâ¦ awayâ¦
There is nothing left to say.
Pride betrays your passion everyday.
Long runâ¦ nowhereâ¦
Somehow you should take some care.
You canât stay in shade and hide out there.

[SOLO]

Togetherness is just an illusion.
The longing for home stays a dream. 
And youâre waitinâ âtil someone will knock on your door
to serve the solution to you. (How can you ignoreâ¦)
I will not wait anymore!

Long goneâ¦ awayâ¦
There is nothing left to say.
Pride betrays your passion everyday.
Long runâ¦ nowhereâ¦
Somehow you should take some care.
You canât stay in shade and hide out there.
