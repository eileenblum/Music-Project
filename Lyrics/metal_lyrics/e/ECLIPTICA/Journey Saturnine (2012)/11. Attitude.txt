[Music by Markus Winkler &amp; Alen Duricic, Words by Markus Winkler, November 2008]

Donât tell me what Iâve got to doâ¦
â¦and donât pretend it is the same youâre going through.

Time after time you try to change my inner senses.
Your uncomprehending words are full of lies.

No troubles, no pain are pulling me down, itâs all in vain.

I wonât give up my attitude!
Just wanna live my life!
Times are changing, lifeâs rearranging,
but itâs non-agingâ¦
I wonât give up myâ¦ attitude!!

Open your eyes and take a lookâ¦
â¦life is not as simple as youâve read it in your clever books.

Can you remember my words? Youâve never listened!!
Your stolid intelligence will never understand.

Go your own way; I donât give a damn, thatâs what I sayâ¦

I wonât give up my attitude!
Just wanna live my life!
Times are changing, lifeâs rearranging,
but itâs non-agingâ¦
I wonât give up myâ¦ attitude!!

[SOLO]

Go your own way; I donât give a damn, thatâs what I sayâ¦ 

I wonât give up my attitude!
Just wanna live my life!
Times are changing, lifeâs rearranging,
but itâs non-agingâ¦
I wonât give up myâ¦ attitude!!

No, I wonât give it upâ¦Baby!
