[Words and Music by Markus Winkler; February/July 2008]

Annihilation âcross the nation,
supported by violation.
Blinded rulers lead their life.

Mean minded, weak excuses,
form slogans soaked by fear,
an endless baiting every year.

Greedy hunting treasures of the soil.
Stealing gold and tons of oil-
No constitution.

Wasting life as if itâs a game,
standing proud and show no shame,
just ignorance.

Magical towns, treasures and crowns, flourishing gardens in desert landâ¦

It was the kingdom of heaven, a secret dream that came true.
It was the kingdom of heaven, a rich empire full of variety.

Exaltation for damnation,
without hesitation-
unknown justice speaking right.

In the name of god and native land
there is blood on their hands-
no understanding.

Magical towns, treasures and crowns, flourishing gardens in desert landâ¦

It was the kingdom of heaven, a secret dream that came true.
It was the kingdom of heaven, a rich empire full of variety.

[SOLO]

Greedy hunting treasures of the soil.
Stealing gold and tons of oil-
No constitution.

Magical towns, treasures and crowns, flourishing gardens in desert landâ¦

It was the kingdom of heaven, a secret dream that came true.
It was the kingdom of heaven, a rich empire full of variety.
