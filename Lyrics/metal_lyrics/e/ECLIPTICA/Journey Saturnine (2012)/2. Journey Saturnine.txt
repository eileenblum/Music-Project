[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler; May/June 2009]

Once again itâs rainy season.
My eyes are bloody red.
Mistrust and disbelief leads to a blue fairytale.
No hate just blinded hope.
Canât you see my bleeding heart?
What is this constant fear that makes me run away?

This time the blameâs on me.
A long and rocky way, 
leads me back to better days.

These are my fears that heal your pain. 
These are my doubts that make you sure. 
Iâm hunting loneliness, you long for sweet caress.
So this is my journeyâ¦
Welcome to my journey saturnine.

Another long black night,
to hunt this solitude.
This life seems bitter-sweet like a bitch and your best friend.
Lifeâs like a journeyâ¦ (Saturnineâ¦)
Led by what you are.
Where is my paradise? Seems near but not for meâ¦ 

This time the blameâs on me.
A long and rocky way, 
leads me back to better days.

These are my fears that heal your pain. 
These are my doubts that make you sure. 
Iâm hunting loneliness, you long for sweet caress.
So this is my journeyâ¦
Welcome to my journey saturnine.

[SOLO]

This time the blameâs on me.
A long and rocky way, 
leads me back to better days.
The fire never dies!

These are my fears that heal your pain. 
These are my doubts that make you sure. 
Iâm hunting loneliness, you long for sweet caress.
So this is my journeyâ¦
Welcome to my journeyâ¦
So this is my journey saturnine.
