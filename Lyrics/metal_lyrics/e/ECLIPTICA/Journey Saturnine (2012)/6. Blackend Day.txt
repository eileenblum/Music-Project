[Words by Markus Winkler; July 2008, Music by Markus Winkler &amp; Alen Duricic; July 2008/January 2010]

Time cannot heal the scars I wear.
Trust in you I cannot restore.
This is my bleeding soul, memories in old black-white,
every day seems like an endless road.

Rainy days- excessive nights,
busted dreams and fading lights.

This is my blackened day,
feels like I have gone astray.
My life fades into grey,
feels like the beauty dies away.

Faith is the hope inside the dark.
Rage controls my disappointment.
So this is my lonely pain, my dying dream of yesterday,
wherever I may go, Iâll take it (all) with meâ¦

No one there- just empty space,
caught in silence and disgrace.

This is my blackened day,
feels like I have gone astray.
My life fades into grey,
feels like the beauty dies away.

[SOLO]

This is my blackened day,
feels like I have gone astray.
My life fades into grey,
feels like the beauty dies away.
