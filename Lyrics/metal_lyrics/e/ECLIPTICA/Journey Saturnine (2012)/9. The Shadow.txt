[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler, August 2008]

Now that the storm is over and the sun clears the sky,
it feels like everythingâs so far away from yesterday.
All of your tears been dried by the hope that carries you,
but deep inside your soul some doubts remain.

Sleepless nights caught in disbelief.
A broken heart that dwells in griefâ¦

Itâs only fear that your dreams are dying.
Hunt that shadow let it disappear.
Itâs only fear that you break down crying.
Hunt that shadow let it disappear.

Nothingâs secure and save, you should prove yourself
and every break down will make you stronger.
All what happened makes you feel weak and blue,
it ainât an easy life, but your fate is in your hands.

Sleepless nights caught in disbelief.
Shattered faith remains to be reborn.

Itâs only fear that your dreams are dying.
Hunt that shadow let it disappear.
Itâs only fear that you break down crying.
Hunt that shadow let it disappear.

Your fearsâ¦ your insecurityâ¦ Hunt that shadowâ¦

[SOLO]

Itâs only fear that your dreams are dying.
Hunt that shadow let it disappear.
Itâs only fear that you break down crying.
Hunt that shadow let it disappear.
