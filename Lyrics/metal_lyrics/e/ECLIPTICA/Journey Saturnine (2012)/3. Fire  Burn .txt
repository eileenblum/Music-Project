[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler, March/April 2009]

The lights have faded into black. Blackâ¦
What am I longing for? Is this my destiny?
Torn apart, thereâs no way back. Backâ¦
Iâve crashed straight ahead into reality!

Endless hours mirrored in black- white.
How I wish you could be here for just one night.
Lead me out of this lonely misery.
Come on Baby, letâs break away!!

Fire! Burn!
Come on enlighten me!
âcaus I donât wanna face this night alone!
Fire! Burn!
Come on and save me!
âcaus I donât wanna live my life alone!

The night is cold without your near. Nearâ¦
All these memories canât hide the fact away,
that missing you is soaked with fear. Fearâ¦
Heal my wounds and make the demons disappear.

Countless seconds dressed in gloomy light.
How I wish you could be here for just one night.
Guide me out of this painful tragedy.
Come on Baby, letâs break away!!

Fire! Burn!
Come on enlighten me!
âcaus I donât wanna face this night alone!
Fire! Burn!
Come on and save me!
âcaus I donât wanna live my life alone!

[SOLO]

Endless hours mirrored in black- white.
How I wish you could be here for just one night.
Lead me out of this lonely misery.
Come on Baby, letâs break away!!

Fire! Burn!
Come on enlighten me!
âcaus I donât wanna face this night alone!
Fire! Burn!
Come on and save me!
âcaus I donât wanna live my life alone!

Burn! Burn! Burn!
