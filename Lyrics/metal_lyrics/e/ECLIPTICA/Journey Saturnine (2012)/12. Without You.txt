[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler; 2009/2010]

â¦oh and I will never forget
your smiling eyes at this night where we first met.
These times were easy simply live without regret.

â¦oh and baby, baby, baby
I took it all for granted, never thought about what may be
if I lost you â now the blameâs on me.

Good bye donât mean farewell my dear.
This broken dream wonât disappear.
An aching in my soul because Iâve lost my goal.

Without you Iâm facing cold and lonely nights.
Without you stars falling down to fading lights.
My broken heart is caught in pain. Give me shelter from the rain.
You know, it will never be the same â without you.

All these mirrors staring straight at me, 
showing reflections of a life that could have been.
Now Iâm a stranger walking in a memory.

Good bye donât mean farewell my dear.
This broken dream wonât disappear.
An empty place inside my soul remains.

Without you Iâm facing cold and lonely nights.
Without you stars falling down to fading lights.
My broken heart is caught in pain. Give me shelter from the rain.
You know, it will never be the same â without you.

Without youâ¦ without youâ¦

[SOLO]

Without you Iâm facing cold and lonely nights.
Without you stars falling down to fading lights.
My broken heart is caught in pain. Give me shelter from the rain.
You know, it will never be the same â without you.
