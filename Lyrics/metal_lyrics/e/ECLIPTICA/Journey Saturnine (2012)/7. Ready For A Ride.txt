[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler; July/August 2008]

When the day goes by and soon the club lights fade.
Time to go on stage, we gonna love this trade.
Weâre livinâ dreams and you could take us higher.
Each evening killing time, letâs set the stage on fire!

Miles and miles, a long road to go.
Just let it rock, weâll never stop!!

âcaus 
We are ready for a ride!
Just let it rock!
We are ready for a ride!
Just let it rock!

In every town there is a place that we call home.
Some sort of vagabonds in heart and soul.
Across the highways from the east end to the west,
weâre a travlinâ band and we never take a rest.

Miles and miles, a long road to go.
Just let it rock, weâll never stop!!

âcaus 
We are ready for a ride!
Just let it rock!
We are ready for a ride!
Just let it rock!

[SOLO]

Miles and miles, a long road to go.
Just let it rock, weâll never stop!!

âcaus 
We are ready for a ride!
Just let it rock!
We are ready for a ride!
Just let it rock!
