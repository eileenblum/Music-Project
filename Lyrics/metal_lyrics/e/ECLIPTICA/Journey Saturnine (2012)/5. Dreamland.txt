[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler; July 2009]

Out on the streets where the dirt smoke appears,
where a glimmer of life is covered in mist.
Demons of metal keep hunting themselves
and the crowd following its self made creations.

Until the system fails... they keep on pushing and gather the gain!
It was not made for me.
Iâm back on the track in this cold realityâ¦

Stars guiding my way back to where I belong.
Where the sky meets the earth and the sun sets deep red.
There where all of my dreams are still alive.

The giantâs awake and the beautyâs a fake,
behind this mask sleeps the evil in black.
Trademarks of death being shown everyday
like an acid fallout on steaming sidewalks.

Until the system fails... they keep on pushing and gather the gain!
It was not made for me.
Iâm back on the track in this cold realityâ¦

Stars guiding my way back to where I belong.
Where the sky meets the earth and the sun sets deep red.
There where all of my dreams are still alive.

[SOLO]

I am lost in the twilight with a spark of hope.

Stars guiding my way back to where I belong.
Where the sky meets the earth and the sun sets deep red.
There where all of my dreams are still alive.
