[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler, 2004 / 2005]

My parents they've taught me right from wrong.
All these years they've made me strong.
But this is a fight I cannot win!
Am I a fool who lives in sin?

If you will leave there's empty space.
Why do we live to fall from grace?
Father I wish your wounds could heal,
by the force of my steel.

And I've never felt the rain as cold as tonight,
the candle burned out, delivered from all the pain.

At the twilight hall- we will meet again.
At the twilight hall- no, no more pain.
At the twilight hall- to reach new goals.
And I'll wear your memory drawn on my soul.

Mother I swear, I will be there.
The knight that my father's proud to see.
My senses are weak but I will fight,
since the dead met us tonight....

And I've never felt the rain as cold as tonight,
the candle burned out, delivered from all the pain.

At the twilight hall- we will meet again.
At the twilight hall- no, no more pain.
At the twilight hall- to reach new goals.
And I'll wear your memory drawn on my soul.

Drawn in flames, your sign on my skin.
I will not rest and in the end we'll win.
