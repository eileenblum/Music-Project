[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler, April 2007]

The sun is setting down,
another rainy night alone,
so far from home.

This land is caught in silence.
The fear of losing you-
it keeps me restless, keeps me going on.

Whatever you feel, whatever you dream-
My heart is still burning, the flame's alive...
...is alive!

In the land of silence, I'm on my journey through the dark.
In the land of silence, I'm here to save the light of life.

The evil is hunting me,
spitting fire, dust and hate,
but it is not my fate.

On the wings of silent hope,
I'm on my way to find the road back home-
guided by your star.

Whatever you feel, whatever you dream-
My heart is still burning, the flame's alive...
...is alive!

In the land of silence, I'm on my journey through the dark.
In the land of silence, I'm here to save the light of life.
