[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler, July 2006]

I stranded somewhere, where I don't want to be.
Heat makes me blind now I cannot see,
the exit of this labyrinth.

I'm caught in a nightmare, surrounded by fools
and at least I am forced to play by their rules.
A golden cage in a lonely place!

After the rain there will be sunshine, so they say...
Where is the storm, which will hunt those clouds away?
I will not wait until tomorrow
So I move on, further

Away -- To where I will stay.
The place of my dreams is my own little paradise.
(Far away)
To where I will stay.
The place of my dreams is my own little paradise.

Smoke spitting factories covers the south.
Headache comes daily and dust in my mouth.
A dark place made of greedy might!

Some monsters of metal are passing the streets.
Managers are acting with dirty deeds.
Yeah, I know that I do not fit in.

After the rain there will be sunshine, so they say...
Where is the storm, which will hunt those clouds away?
I will not wait until tomorrow
So I move on, further

Away -- To where I will stay.
The place of my dreams is my own little paradise.
(Far away)
To where I will stay.
The place of my dreams is my own little paradise.
