[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler, September 2007]

They come along with their designed lies
in the name of right and protection.
Corruptionists with their hearts in their wallets
and eyes blinded by their might.

They hear your calls and answer your phone,
they're even ready to build your clone.
A cam is spying trough your doors lock
to film even when you fuck!!

It's in your room!
It's at your work!
Big brother's watching you!!

Collecting movies in their databases
like an own private video store.
They know your name and they know your wife
it's a silent control of your life.

It's in your room!
It's at your work!
Big brother's watching you!!
