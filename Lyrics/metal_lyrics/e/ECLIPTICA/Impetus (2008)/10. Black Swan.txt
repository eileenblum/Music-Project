[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler, September 2007]

"CUM DIE SEPTIMA IN MENSE SEPTIMO LUNA
ANTE SOLEM MOVEBIT.
AQUAE DIVIDEBUNTUR ET HORROREM
EMITTEBUND E TENEBRIS ABYSSIS.
NIHIL ENIM INULTUM RESTAT."

A storm comes closer from the north.
An icy breath of death and fear
is howling through this cloudy night.

Lightning strikes and thunder,
a roaring force of darkness breaks
the waves and sets its sails again.

Once upon a long time ago
we led a frightening legion of pirates at war.
Our master sold our souls
straight to the conquerors to fill his treasure chest.

Slaughtered for cheap gold,
counter-sunk and sold,
we rise again to seek revenge!

I am the helms man of the black swan.
The sunken fear of the oceans
rises again from its deep wet grave.
Vengeance for the undead souls of the black swan.

In front of the northern shores
the master has abandoned the ship to save his bloody soul.
Surrounded by aggressive fleets
there was no way out, we're damned to die alone.

Slaughtered for cheap gold,
counter-sunk and sold,
we rise again to seek revenge!

I am the helms man of the black swan.
The sunken fear of the oceans
rises again from its deep wet grave.
Vengeance for the undead souls of the black swan.

"...NIHIL ENIM INULTUM RESTAT."

The master's safe no longer.
Our quest will not end until
we cage his soul into his mouldy chest...
