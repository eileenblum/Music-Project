[Merlin:]
A traveller through time am I, so close to the edge.
My heart weights heavy and my soul cries in a cage.
I believe in you, o king, whatever fate will be,
follow just your heart into eternity.

[Artus:]
You have taught me, how to judge wise.
You have forced me, to end up with all lies.
And in my darkest hour, I will trust, in your mighty words.

[Guinevere:]
My love, my king, will never die, there ain't no reason why,
to turn away, to turn away, to turn away

[Merlin:]
As the dragon breaths that fateful night,
I have seen our fate.
Still I try to change things I saw, but I know it's late.
I am hunting demons of the past and
know about the quest,
my soul will never die, never die at last!

[Artus:]
You have taught me, how to judge wise.
You have forced me, to end up with all lies.
And in my darkest hour, I will trust, in your mighty words.

[Guinevere:]
My love, my king, will never die, there ain't no reason why,
to turn away, to turn away, to turn away

[Merlin:]
So we're sitting here in Camelot,
our hearts full filled with pride,
I will never lose these memories,
when I'll turn away from your side.

[Guinevere, Merlin, Artus:]
To turn away, to turn away, to turn away
