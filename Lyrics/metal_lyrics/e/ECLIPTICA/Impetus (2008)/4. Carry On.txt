[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler, January 2007]

The night is falling down,
your bleeding heart seems to be broken
'cause no one's there.
Where's this veil of light that guides you?
Where's the shining star that lights your way
back home one day.

Just take a look up to the sky,
take a breath and fly so high.
No one's alone -- you should not cry!

Carry on -- you're not the only one.
The future's in the air, so please don't care!
Carry on -- you're not the only one.
The future's in the air, so please don't care!

A kind of empty silence,
shattered hopes are hunting through your dreams-
nothing's what it seems.
Where's the one who can save your heart now?
Where's the one who'll share the life with you-
to help you through.

Just take a look up to the sky,
take a breath and fly so high.
No one's alone -- you should not cry!

Carry on -- you're not the only one.
The future's in the air, so please don't care!
Carry on -- you're not the only one.
The future's in the air, so please don't care!
