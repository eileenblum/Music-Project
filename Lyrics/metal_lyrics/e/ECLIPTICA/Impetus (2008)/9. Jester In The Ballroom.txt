[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler, January 2006]

He's joking on the world's sobriety,
the sweetest melodies he sings.
He's from urbane serenity,
an evil smile in naÃ¯ve eyes.

Lost all alone,
he's hunting your deepest fears and hurts,
far away, far away from your soul.

The jester in the ballroom.
Makes you laugh and sing.
The crowd in the ballroom,
just like puppets on a string.

Religions lost in our twilight world,
we're on the quest for some light.
The jester smiles as he feels,
the pain to take away from us.

Lost all alone,
he's hunting your deepest fears and hurts,
far away, far away from your soul.

The jester in the ballroom.
Makes you laugh and sing.
The crowd in the ballroom,
just like puppets on a string.
