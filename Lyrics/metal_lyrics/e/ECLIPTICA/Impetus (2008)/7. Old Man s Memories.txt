[Words &amp; Music by Markus Winkler, June 2007]

Another dream has turned into a nightmare
and now he can not sleep.
It's just like every night, the past is hunting him
since he fought senseless wars.

A million faces marching through his brain.
Crushing bones and screams makes him insane.

Lost in silence,
tyrant leaders blow his mind.
Acts of violence,
broke his will so long ago.
But there is a glow in the old man's eyes.
"Don't turn away my son; our journey has just begun (has just begun...)
let's fly on broken wings into the sun!!"

A trip into his soul seems like a rise across
a sea of blood and tears.
Any little louder noise keeps scaring him until the
day he closes his eyes.

A million faces marching through his brain.
Crushing bones and screams makes him insane.

Lost in silence,
tyrant leaders blow his mind.
Acts of violence,
broke his will so long ago.
But there is a glow in the old man's eyes.
"Don't turn away my son; our journey has just begun (has just begun...)
let's fly on broken wings into the sun!!"
