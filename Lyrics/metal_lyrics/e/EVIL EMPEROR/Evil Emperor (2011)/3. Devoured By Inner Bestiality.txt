I feel
Like being devoured from within
Losing all my sanity
Lusting for blood of my own kin
Now here dies my humanity

Donât waste my time with lies
My eyes wonât deceive me
For this Iâll severe my ties
And your head we shall see

This greed is in your soul
Your body just plays along
A sin you canât control
But now you wonât last long

Words you wonât hear by now
Only screams and shouts
No more choices but to bow
Here rises your new destroyer

Scream
Cry
Run
Die

This hate took over me
My soul has faded away
All I wish to see
Is your blood dripping in vain

Words you wonât hear by now
Only screams and shouts
No more choices but to bow
Here rises your new destroyer

Scream in pain
Cry for help
Run in fear
You will die

My sight has turn black
Now all I see is red
Smell of death fills the air
As I tear your head

Words you wonât hear by now
Only screams and shouts
No more choices but to bow
Here rises your new destroyer
