From the abyss I rise
Dark is the reign of the dead
Where blood falls from the sky
Demons to slave as my prize

Behold my coming
I travel through time
Iâm the ruler of the worlds

Evil Emperor
That chills in your spine
Evil Emperor
And your souls are mine

Iâm gonna chill you up
And spit you out

From the fire I born
A king with a crown of fear
Prophetic ancestors delighted
Shadows crawling under my sight

I gather the wisdom now lost
My timeless prison of chaos
Behold my coming
In ecstasy I mock the worlds

Evil Emperor
That chills in your spine
Evil Emperor
And your souls are mine
