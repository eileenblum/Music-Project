Smell of death surrounds me
As I chose my next victim
Anyone it may be
To fulfill my darkest wishes

Cut open the chest
Tear out the skin
Rip off the heart
Thatâs my torture fetish

This way of life
It feels so good
I kill for pleasure
My art in flesh

All that I want
All that I need
Mutilation addicted

Bodies laid down to rest
Severed heads exposed
Limbs torn apart
Thatâs my satisfaction

Soaked in blood 
The beauty of gore
And when the sun goes down 
I seek for more

All that I want
All that I need
Mutilation addicted
