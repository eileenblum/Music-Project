Hellish creatures
Born from the darkness
Come to clean this vile world

Rise from the shadows
Spreading fear and pain
As you punish the sinful ones

Black demonic hordes
Slay all the faithful ones
Fallen army rise to scatter all the earth
As we march to... To the battle... We celebrate death

Your town will be consumed
Darkness will blind you all
As we kill every one that breaths or stands

Your sons will suffer to
No one shall be spared
Death to the living, our master's who demands

No use to run
Don't even think to hide
'Cause your fate is already sealed

Those who came for you
Are your nightmares made flesh
They will eat your soul and crush your bones

Weak beings, prepare to die
Give up, your souls are mine
Defeated, death sets you free
Lifeless... Welcome to hell

To live no tracks
We will destroy your race
And devoure those who have fell

All hope is gone by now
Not even god can save you
And if it tries, we'll slay it to

Weak beings, prepare to die
Give up, your souls are mine
Defeated, death sets you free
Lifeless, welcome to hell

Black demonic hordes
Slay all the faithful ones
Fallen army rise to scatter all the earth
As we march to... To the battle... We celebrate death
