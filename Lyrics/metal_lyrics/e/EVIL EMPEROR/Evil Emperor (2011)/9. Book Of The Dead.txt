Rise!

Rise again to feast upon flesh
Spread the curse in every bite
The dead walk and prey for the living
Your life, it ends tonight

Wake up the dead
And start to scream
Thereâs no regret
Itâs time to die

We will hunt you down
Like the beast you are
No one will live
To see the sun rise

Rise again to feast upon flesh
Spread the curse in every bite
The dead walk and prey for the living
Your life, it ends tonight

All your kind
It will die
And like us
You will rise

No where to run, donât even try
No place to hide, your turn to die
Youâll be consumed, the bloodbath begins
Your race is doomed

Your blood we craves, the dead will walk
To fill our emptiness
There wonât be graves, start the carnage
No more resting place

All your kind
It will die
And like us
You will rise
