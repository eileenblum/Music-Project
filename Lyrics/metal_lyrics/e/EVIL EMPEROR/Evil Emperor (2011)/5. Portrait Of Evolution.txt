Here we begin
Please stand a side
Or youâll be disposed
It canât be stopped

Like a parasite, drains your life
We will rule, donât interfere

Destroy all life
If is what it takes
To evolution reigns
Weâll do it for sure

Burn down, cut off
Demise... Donât get in the way

Kill all, slay it
Devour... This is evolution

Burn down, cut off
Demise... Donât get in the way

Kill all, slay it
Devour... Portrait of evolution

We grow stronger with destruction
Who are we to judge who are weak

Stop crying for mercy
No one will answer it
God wonât save you, thatâs for sure
Because evolution will kill it

Like a parasite, drains your life
We will rule, donât interfere

You wonât be welcomed
No even in hell
Canât you see it
You are the weak one

Burn down, cut off
Demise... Donât get in the way

Kill all, slay it
Devour... This is evolution

Burn down, cut off
Demise... Donât get in the way

Kill all, slay it
Devour... Portrait of evolution

We grow stronger with destruction
Who are we to judge who are weak

No use to rebuild
Thereâs on oblivion
Evolution will consume it all
The next one to die it will be you
