Tragedy will fall upon you
Youâll be consumed in pain
Your flesh will turn pitch black
And your soul hell will claim

This hate I feel for you
Will make you suffer more
The way to set me free
Gives you a death full of gore

Crimson flames will burn you down
Pay for your betray now you must
Iâll watch you turn dust

Your skin will start to peel
It has become hard to breath
Believe this pain is real
Burning âtil your life fades away

Hell fire will burn you up
Show me that you are brave
âCause tonight youâll meet your grave

This flames will consume your last breath
Nothing lasts but your body carbonized
Meanwhile just wait for your black death
I wanna hear you scream as you burn

Burn, burn now
Pain drives you insane
Burn, burn down
Your life fire will drain

In pain you bow before me
Begging for what you wonât have
âCause mercy isnât part of me
Iâll be laughing as you die

Burn motherfucker, burn
Now you see how weak life is
But a fool we wonât miss

This flames will consume your last breath
Nothing lasts but your body carbonized
Meanwhile just wait for your black death
I wanna hear you scream as you burn

Burn, burn now
Pain drives you insane
Burn, burn down
Your life fire will drain
