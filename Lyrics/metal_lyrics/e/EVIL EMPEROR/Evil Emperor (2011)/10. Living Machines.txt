Start the life
Share your will
Mind turns black
Dreams of steel

Look out! Keep the system running
Itâs time to die for your robotic dreams
No doubt, no face, no guilt
Welcome to the digital society

We are the machines
Living machines

Your mind cannot be calculated
Your heart beat is not a program
The machines are alive
Alive

Canât you see
What was done
Virtual slaves
The end has just begun

Start new life
Spread your will
Mind turns free
Dreams are real

One day the system will fail
And you will see it bleed poison
No doubt, no fear, no pain
Waiting for the revolution

We are the machines
Living machines
