Butcher of soul, the face of the fear
Master of lies, you feed of my pain
No joy at death, the torment builds inside
My hate wasted, I canât stop this game

Only the dead are smiling
Tricked easily you have a false freedom
Thatâs the way they play
Bury within is the key to damnation

Always the same, their twisted preaches
Behold the drug running through us all
Evil has come tearing your soul apart
Under illusions weâll march to the fall

Meeting a world drenched in blood
Painted in the colors of divine reason
Thatâs the way they play
Deny your wish is the key to damnation

You follow the shepherd
The butcher of souls
They wicked puppeteer
Of your stolen life

The poison has spread out
I see in your eyes
Depravited of your will
You follow the lie

Burning desires, you can realize them
Destroy your chains, let the dream awake
Monsters always will try to stop you
Restore the life, it will never be too late

Thereâs a different road
Wish youâre not restrain by submission
Thereâs a different game
But you have to avoid you damnation

Blind to the world inside of us
Slave of the world outside of us

The poison has spread out
I see in your eyes
Depravited of your will
You follow the lie
