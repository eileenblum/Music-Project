Your visions are twisted
Following a wrong faith for rewards after life
Welcome to the pit where the fools will learn
That dreams of heaven in ashes will turn

I beckon the night to live and overcome the fear
This is the ordeal of fire and I must go on
I trusted in lies âcause I wanted answers
Now let me change it all waking the demon

Blinded by the insanity
I face the truth to live
Took away my pain
Unleashing the evil I hide

I beckon the night to live and overcome the fear
This is the ordeal of fire and I must go on
I trusted in lies âcause I wanted answers
Now let me change it all waking the demon
Invocation
Open my eyes
Redemption

Thorns and lambs in nameless graves
Ruled by their creeds we are puppet slaves
Buried in this place my deception has gone
Without sorryness falsity where undone   

I beckon the night to live and overcome the fear
This is the ordeal of fire and I must go on
I trusted in lies âcause I wanted answers
Now let me change it all waking the demon
Invocation
Open my eyes
Redemption
