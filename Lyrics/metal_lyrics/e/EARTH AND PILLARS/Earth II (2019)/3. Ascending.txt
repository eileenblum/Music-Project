The leaves fall from afar
Like distant gardens withered in the heavens
In the nights the heavy Earth falls
out the stars into the Solitude.

This all doth fall.
This hand of mine (too must fall), is the Law.
There is One who holds this falling
Softly in Thy hands! If only Thou wast eternal!

Surging then reposing, the ancient sea
And mountains all ascend in Thy roaring streams
Winds respire and rush within the woods
From vale to vale below.

Here above, the lingering light as ether stills
The spirit and the mysterious yearnings
That lie deeper in Thy breast

In the heights as silver
The snow and ice withstand
Witness to Thy immortal chant
A sparkle from a burning coal
It shined a trice and vanished like us
Ascending to the Heavens
Staring at the Gods
What Once and Never Was!
