Angels of rain and lightning spread
On the blue surface of Thine aÃ«ry surge
Like the bright hair from the head of some fierce Maenad
From the dim verge of the horizon to Zenith's height

The locks of (the) coming storm
Thou dirge of (the) dying year, this closing night
(Will) be the dome of a vast sepulchre
Vaulted with all Thy might

Make me Thy lyre, (even) as the forest (is)
My leaves are falling like its own!
The tumult of Thy mighty harmonies
(Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone)

Sweet (though) in sadness
Be Thou, Spirit fierce, my spirit! Impetuous one!
Drive my (dead) thoughts over the universe
Like wither'd leaves to quicken a new birth!

By the incantation of this verse,
Scatter, as from a fire's hearth
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!
Be through my lips the trumpet of the prophecy!
