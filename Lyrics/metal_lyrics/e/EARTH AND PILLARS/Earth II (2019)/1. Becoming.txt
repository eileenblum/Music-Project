Wild West Wind,
Thou breath of Autumn's being
Thou, from whose unseen presence
The leaves dead are driven

Like ghosts from (an) enchanter fleeing
Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red
Pest(ilence)-stricken multitudes

Thou, who chariotest to their dark wintry bed
The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low

Each like a corpse within its grave
Until Thine azure sister of (the) Spring
Shall blow Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth
Wild Spirit, Thou art moving everywhere
Destroyer and preserver hear, oh hear!

Thou on whose stream, mid steep sky's commotion
Loose clouds like earth's leaves are shed
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean
