With this wind comes fate
Let it come all that surging and blind
Before which we will glow
Be still, don't bestir yourself, so it finds us.

From somewhere this winds brings,
Staggering from bearing, nameless things
That which we are, over the sea.

... If only we were it, so we would be home
The heavens in us would rise up and down
With this wind, fate goes immensely
Beyond us ever and anon.

The storm, the shifter of shapes
Drives on across the woods and across time
The world looks as if it had no age
The landscape, like a line in the psalm book,
Is seriousness and weight and eternity!

What we (choose to) fight is so vane!
What fights (with) us is so great!
If only we (would) let ourselves be dominated
As things do in storms
We would become power and need no names!
