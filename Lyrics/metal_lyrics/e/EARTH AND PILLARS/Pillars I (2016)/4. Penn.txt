Thou art the mystic homeless One;
Into the world Thou never came,
Too mighty Thou, too great to name;
Voice of the storms, Song of the wild wind sings,
Thou Harp shatters those who play Thy strings!

Feral melody, come forth from the stars
Cherish me in eternity's silent waves
Through blazing marble altars
Ascend to a world beyond
Where the pillars rise again, from Thy mind engraved
In the temples resounds Thy voice sublime
Everything turns to Thee before time.
