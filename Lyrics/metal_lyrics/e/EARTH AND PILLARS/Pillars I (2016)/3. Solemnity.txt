Destiny, the doom of time
For the passing is crystal
Yet the stone here lies.
Thy sight, no eyes
Feel the spirit beyond its shine
Burn like a fire that never dies.

For the solemn to Thy yell down bows
As Thy voice through the aether flows
For the silence of the ages Thou withstand
As the sound of Thy chant here descends.

All things are long passed away and far
A light is shining but a distant star
From which it still comes to me
Has been dead a thousand years
Beneath the sky's vast dome, I long to prey
Of all the stars there must be far away
A single star which still exists, apart
Alone has endured
All space commands
'Tween white pillars
In the high heavens stands.
