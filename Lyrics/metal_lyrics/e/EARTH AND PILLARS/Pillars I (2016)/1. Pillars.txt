A watcher of Thy spaces make me,
A listener at Thy stone,
Give to me vision and then wake me
Upon Thy mountains alone.

Thy rivers' courses let me follow
Where they leap the crags in their flight
Where at dusk in caverns hollow
They croon to music of the night.

Send me far into Thy barren land
Where the snow clouds the wild wind drives,
Where the ancient firs as guardians stand
To protect Thy reign that silent here lies.

White pilgrims climb slowly one by one,
No moon to brighten (where) Thy footstep goes
Blindly trust the summons, 'till the journey is done
Up the pathway that no one knowsâ¦

Is there a light to gaze?
Is there a voice to guide?
For the silence is not ours
For we long for endless music and warming ancient fires.
