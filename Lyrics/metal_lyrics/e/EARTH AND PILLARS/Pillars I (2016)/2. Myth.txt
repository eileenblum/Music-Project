Up high, 'tween ever-growing silver clouds
Thy mountains peaks aim to the sky
Of snow eternal Thou made a shroud
There, where Thy hidden portals rise

To wide open highlands rest
Where grass and marshes grow lush
Fertile whispers of old in Thy chest
Purity that gush eternally

The vastness of Thy centuries past
In stones, vales and mountains forever lasts
The face of immortal living statues we gaze
Longing for stories they will not tell
As they stray in a timeless haze
In their silence hides their farewell

Alone Thou wanderest through space,
Profound One with the hidden face,
Thou art Poverty's great rose,
The eternal metamorphose
Of gold into the light of the Stars.
