Winds hiss
Caress the shores..Water ripples
The face shivers
Like a portrait drawn by the rain

Of time and memories
Of voices and screams

Dither the trice and fragments fall
The contours remain, thin and empty
Outlines of my shape
This matt surface..the well of the valley
Where mountains reign

Surrounded by the fathers, the lake speaks..
"Behold the stone-throne..listen to their voices..
They know the eternity you seek.."

May the peaks, so hold and wise, break their silence!
Speak through me!

"Give the spirit to the crimson clouds!
Who abandon this lake at the sunset
And dye the mountain ranges of gules"
The wind far blows
Where everything sleeps
To the sea..
