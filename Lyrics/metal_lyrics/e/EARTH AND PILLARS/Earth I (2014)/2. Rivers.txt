From this river to roots
Of this forest, of the Earth he soaks
In deserted dikes flows
Where leaves lay silent in their sleep

Feed me with your voice
The silence of the glaciers
Trough branches of sacred arms
Your frozen wispers

As the rivers crushes on these banks
Elevates his roaring voice to a chant..
Scent of fir spread through the air
As the rite becomes alive

From Earth to leaves
To a sky beneath
From flesh to spirit
Cracks the wooden dome

Trees, as my flesh, have no rest here
Consumed to ash in the womb of the earth
My skin as your cortex
Is the past, wrinkles and scars
Quenched in the cold sight of the stars

The river renews this wooden cathedral
Reborn in the altar.. lit are the fires
Prayers roars in cascades
Arise, gods and stars
Behold
