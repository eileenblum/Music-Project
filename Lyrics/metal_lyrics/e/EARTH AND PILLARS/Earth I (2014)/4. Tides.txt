Ancient, I am silent as your voice
Yells from your mouth of waves
As once, become stone
At the solemn monition of your breath
Teach, from the abyss, the ferment
Of our hearth is nothing

(As your relentless law sway beyond our time
Vast and ever changing, the foundation of the pillars
Feel the cycle of seasons and the drip
Of the hourglass sand, You know nothing of this)

Vastness redeems our flesh, the calm
Pervades and destiny awaits on the edge
Of the Halcyon days

Yet, reject us
Inhuman hearth pulsating
Means and not end, we are

Your silent erupts form your womb
Our hum a distant echoes of your voice
We depart, we burn and as dust
Come back and fall, into you...
