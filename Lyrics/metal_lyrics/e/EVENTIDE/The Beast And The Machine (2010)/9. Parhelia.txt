I am apart from my equals
Because I know of what's to come
The future holds no sequel and no new dawn
As the light from the halo flows

Betrayal, deceit
The ground is shaking underneath your feet

Now watch what I have seen
The markings in the sky (deserved and predicted)
A proof of our belief
The ending of our time (as expected)
Beware of the halo

And I see in your blackened eyes
That you would rather become blind
We face the truth from the scenes
That has been haunting me
Now I know what it's all about

Now watch what I have seen
The markings in the sky (deserved and predicted)
A proof of our belief
The ending of our time (as expected)

Here in these blank surroundings
At the eye of a perfect storm
There's no excuse, no escape, no exit
May a constant darkness bury us all
Predictions never lie

Now watch what I have seen
The markings in the sky (deserved and predicted)
A proof of our belief
The ending of our time (as expected)
