Dim light, curtains closed
A silence fills my head
Eyes shut, a glimpse of hope
As the needle twists my vein

Pitch black, soulless shell
Pure sorrow swept in sin
Dark dreams, even darker days
No colors may shine in
Wish I could see the end

Mr. Death would you take my pain away?
I cannot stand the waiting
Mr. Death please lead my soul astray
This broken body is not worth saving

The deep red clears my mind
A thought is taking hold
Black ink against the white
My truth at last be told
Now I'm off to meet the end

Mr. Death would you take my pain away?
I cannot stand the waiting
Mr. Death please lead my soul astray
This broken body is not worth saving

Dim light, curtains closed
A silence fills my head
