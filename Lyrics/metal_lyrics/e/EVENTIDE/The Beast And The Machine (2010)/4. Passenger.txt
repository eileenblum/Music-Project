This is the mask I wear
A silent surface just to hide my fear
A violence stirring within
Control is caving in
Dark thoughts gathering

Black fog embraces me
Now let the chaos begin

I let the dark inside me
Take control now
So let the dogs behind me
Run me down

For every good thought I think
There are seven dark thoughts
Pounding on the barrier
My endless struggling
To quench the will of sin
It gave me nothing
But an empty void

Red skies descending
Now let the heavens come down

The last light is slowly fading
Dead night is drawing near
Black souls in swift ascending
Closed eyes now open wide
