I've seen the death in your eyes
You use consumption as a way of life
I've seen it enter your mind
Like a disease that made you blind and weak

We're the souls manufactured and tuned to perfection
This is what we've become
Robotic, mechanical slaves of our own greed
This is the modern humanity

I see excitement in your eyes
You found salvation in an advertise
In a world where everything's for sale
The quest for wealth has replaced the Holy Grail

We're the souls manufactured and tuned to perfection
This is what we've become
Robotic, mechanical slaves of our own greed
This is the modern humanity

I've seen this apathy expand
In the air, across the seas, throughout the land
It's just a matter of days before we erase ourselves
It's time to wake up
Open your eyes

Souls manufactured and doomed to perfection
This is what we've become
Robotic, mechanical slaves of our own greed
This is the modern humanity
