I want to know
Where I should go
Should I follow your path or find my own?
I know it's time
To decide
To figure out what to do with this life

But can I really be free in your society
Adjust to your norms and your beliefs?
Can I be tamed within your frames?
Can I be free if I'm in chains?

I am the monster you tamed
A beast inside its cage
Now I'm the bitter clown in your play
A proud man drowning in shame, drowning in shame

Gave up on my dreams
Sucked down in the flood that is the mainstream
I transformed, became the norm that I fear the most

I am the monster you tamed
A beast inside its cage
Now I'm the bitter clown in your play
A proud man drowning in shame

There's something calling deep within me
Begging to be released

I let myself die piece by piece
In your machinery
I've been adapting for so long
It's time I finally got to see
Who's the strong and who's the weak
The beast or the...
The beast or the machine

I am the monster you tamed
A beast inside its cage
Now I'm the bitter clown in your play
A proud man drowning in shame
