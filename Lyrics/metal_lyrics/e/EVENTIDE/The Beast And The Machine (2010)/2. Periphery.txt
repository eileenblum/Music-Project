The bitter reminder of all that is gone
A rapid reflection, a suffering heart
Somewhere but not here, anywhere
State of denial continue leading me wrong

From time to time I catch a glimpse
There is never more than just a glimpse
Existing here beside me now
Faithfully, dear periphery

For a fraction of time nerves unwind
The precious moments I live to find
Distracting, disrupting, disturbing me
The second I feel it, it's killing me

From time to time I catch a glimpse
There is never more than just a glimpse
Existing here beside me now
Faithfully, dear periphery

Timing, lightning â always too late
Fractions flashing for me
Stretching, reaching â never enough
Distance, approach me now

I can see it there
I see, it's there
I believe it is here
Just out of sight

From time to time I catch a glimpse
There is never more than just a glimpse
Existing here beside me now
Faithfully, dear periphery
