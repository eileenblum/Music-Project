Every day is a repetitive grey
No sharp edges, no color, no shape
Every day is just a short-term solution
An endless confusion, a longing for escape

Take me somewhere
Far away from this weight I'm under
Save me now, release the floods
Wash away what is left of the grey

Every day is an endless delay
I'm just waiting for the barriers to break
Every day I build up more desperation
Increasing frustration about to explode

Take me somewhere
Far away from this weight I'm under
Save me now, release the floods
Wash away what is left of the grey

You spend your life doing things you don't want to do
Every day is the same, nothing breaks through the grey
I forgot who I am, I forgot where I came from
And where I belong

Take me somewhere
Far away from this weight I'm under
Save me now, release the floods
Wash away what is left of the grey
