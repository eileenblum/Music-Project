Eyes wide open in here

Sensing there's something wrong with me
And with the room they've put me into
I try to fall asleep when there's no really need to breathe
How come I ended up alone?
Absent, forgotten, slowly withering away

Wither away, wither away I
Wither away, wither
Through black holes I stray

Eyes go blind in here

Wither away, wither away I
Wither away, wither
Through black holes I stray

Now I don't want to turn this around, bring me the stars
When the last of the bright goes dark I am a part
We are all of the same old matter, it matters no more
We unite, reconcile
