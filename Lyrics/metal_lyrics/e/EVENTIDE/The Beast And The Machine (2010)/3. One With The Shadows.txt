The more I observe, the more I want to close my eyes
And ignore the entire world
Ignore the fact that I'm a part of this herd
A part of me wants to
Run from my existence, shed my skin
I'm running out of persistence
This is a fight I'm never going to win
So I disappear

I become one with the shadows
I step away, from the weak and the shallow
Watch me disappear

The life in my eyes, was taken long ago
The thoughts in my head, once rebellious, are dead
I'm shaped, sharped and polished to look like the others
I need an exit, something to help me
Run from my existence, shed my skin
I'm running out of persistence
This is a fight I'm never going to win
So I disappear

I become one with the shadows
I step away, from the weak and the shallow
Watch me disappear

Cannot take it, cannot take it
Cannot fake anymore
No adjusting, no abjection
Cannot adapt to the norm
So I disappear

Disappear, I become one with the shadows
I step away, from the weak and the shallow
Watch me disappear
