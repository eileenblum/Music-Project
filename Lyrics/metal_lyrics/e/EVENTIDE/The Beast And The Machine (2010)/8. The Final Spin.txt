A cold wind sweeps across the land
It reminds me that it's time
The last sunset seems ages ago
And the light should have long ago arrived

On this dreadful day
All is silent
Fuel ignites and burns
We are the last to leave

So wave goodbye to the world we know
Mother earth now dies
And taste the shame just for a moment
We stand and watch as rotation stops
See her final spin
Is this the peak of our revolution?

Our evergrowing thirst for more
Resulted in decay
Inspiration painted thoughts that common
Sense should have long ago denied and
Thrown away

We turn and look away
As the earth collapses
Her last motion still with grace
Our mother forever laid to rest
