Why should I care what you do with
your ambition?
You're just a mark on the map of nothingness Why should I speak when
the truth's a contradiction?
When i no longer have the strength to trust in my own words

And so we go on one more day
in the name of apathy
We greet the dawn in the same old way cause we fit in perfectly

Don't ask me why I stay the same
I'm just a part of one big game

You're in denial of the beast that you
once shackled
the silent storm you believe you can defy
So let the word once again belong to
silence
And be a slave to a world you dare not understand

Our dreams collide with fate
courage turns to fear, fear to hate
hate to frustration
and cradle to grave
still we remain indifferent
