Waking up still weary
Fingers cold as snow
medicates my madness
This is getting old
Still numb
my eyes are open now
Distorted vision
Can't focus somehow

How long have I been here
within these pale white walls?
Drugged up and strapped to the bed
I am not a man I am nothing at all

There's no way down from here
despite the light there's no place darker
Without the dark i'd dissapear
for who am I without my fear?

I hear voices down the hall
A silent mumbling
and the warning sound of steps
echoes through the walls
Door opens
enter sweet madness
Inject your cure for my
artificial sadness

There's no way down from here
despite the light there's no place darker
Without the dark i'd dissapear
for who am I without my fear?

How long have I been here
in this chaos the world of mine
Force-fed with constant nightmares
Give me back my mind

There's no way down from here
despite the light there's no place darker
Without the dark i'd dissapear
for who am I without my fear?
There's noone here but me
a ghost of what I used to be
No god and no belief
in my place so dark
