In my head there are places I avoid
Too dark to see and too painful to feel
When i'm awake they are numb by my control
but when I close my eyes they arise

In this deafening silence
that pins me down
they're the thunder and the storm
that throws me to the ground

They arrive in the evening
along with the dark
Carrying the strength of a thousand
and the chaos of one
from deep within
where skeleton meets skin
and where I put aside
all that I deny

The fear and anxiety
that brings me to my knees
You're the thunder and the storm
that I could never seize

So strike me once again
with the claws of fever
For you are not my friend
You're my closest demon

In this definite silence
that pins me down
you're the thunder and the storm
that throws me to the ground

So pierce me one last time
with your tusk of fever
For you are not my friend
You're my closest demon
