A story, a tale, about a city of souls
Where once lived a great man, full of principles
No, we shouldn't break our promises
Cause a person without principles is a person you cannot trust

We do or die, we never lie
No matter what, we shall not fail you
All those who lie, lay down 'n' die
A few white lies they shall not hurt you

A storm it came, a darkened sky
And deep in his heart he knew, there could only be one way out
It's sad but it's true, when push comes to shove
A person can change and principles to the wall

Tell me how far will a person go
When someone's closer to the edge then bending the rules they must

We do or die, we never lie
No matter what, we shall not fail you
All those who lie, lay down 'n' die
A few white lies they shall not hurt you
