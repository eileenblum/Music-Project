Demonic seed runs in her blood, poisons her soul
The creature awakes, it's full moon tonight, the nightmare begins
Morbid conversion now occurs
All innocence fades away
Greed for human flesh takes over now
Now the beast is free

Howling at the moon
Run with the pack tonight
The beast is free, say your last prayer
A full moon in sight
Moonstruck and free

Chasing her prey her passion for blood awakes in the night
She feels no remorse, bestial instincts rage deep inside
But when the dawn breaks no signs remains of the dark beast no more
Cause her memory where evil hides
Hides from her mind

Howling at the moon
Run with the pack tonight
The beast is free, say your last prayer
A full moon in sight
Moonstruck and free

Cursed by the moon, forever she can never find peace
And those whom she loves are nothing but prey to her in the night
For eternity she's doomed to kill, a timeless evil spell
Nothing but a silver bullet will, will release her soul

Howling at the moon
Run with the pack tonight
The beast is free, say your last prayer
A full moon in sight
Moonstruck and free
