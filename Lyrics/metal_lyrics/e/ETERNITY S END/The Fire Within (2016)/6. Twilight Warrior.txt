Darkness is falling, shadows passing by
From the distance a storm is closing in
Time seems to stand still as thunder rolls, lightning cracks the sky
An' icy winds howl, the demon is free
In your sleep it creeps into your soul, haunting your dreams
You cannot run, you cannot hide no more from the dark

In the night, a twilight warrior
Unveiling dark mysteries, where all are just battlefield dreams
By the light of the moon - a twilight warrior
You are dancing with demons in the hour of the twilight witch

Hiding in shadows during daylight hours
Undead souls wander free when darkness it falls
Dark images rise inside your mind when the last light fades
When you close your eyes your fears become real
Evil spirits dwell inside your soul, forever cursed
The fourth dimension opens up for you while you sleep

In the night, a twilight warrior
Unveiling dark mysteries, where all are just battlefield dreams
By the light of the moon - a twilight warrior
You are dancing with demons in the hour of the twilight witch
