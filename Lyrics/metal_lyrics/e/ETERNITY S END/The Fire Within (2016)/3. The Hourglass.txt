Living in sorrow, in constraint and fear
Taking no chances, your chains are real
The nature of your spirit, oppressed and pushed aside
You sacrifice hopes and dreams, distressed you find no joy
And tomorrow where will you be, for how much longer
Can you run from the reflection, of the years wasted and gone
Life is just not existing, joy is not the absence of pain
But when you wake up, time has run out forevermore

Feeding the machine day by day, while the sands of time go astray

Seize the day, feel the magic of the moment
See yourself, in The hourglass of life
Live your dream, do not wait until tomorrow
Hold your fire save the hero inside your soul

The world you desire which exists can be won
Your thought is your weapon your tool of choice
With only their vision men took first steps
Down new roads through the centuries, the true spirit of our lives

Feeding the machine day by day, while the sands of time go astray

Seize the day, feel the magic of the moment
See yourself, in The hourglass of life
Live your dream, do not wait until tomorrow
Hold your fire save the hero inside your soul
