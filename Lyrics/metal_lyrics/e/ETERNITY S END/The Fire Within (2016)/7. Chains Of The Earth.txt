Well I'm guarding my world, guarding my freedom
My world is my own forevermore

Through the years of falsehood and shame
Still this battle can never be lost
Through the sorrow and pain
Through the darkness and torment
The spirit of man will remain

With no fear in my heart, no shame in my soul
I shall break all the chains of the earth
Through the fire and the flames, in the eye of the storm
We shall break all the chains of the earth

Now as high as the sky we build our new homeland
The heart of the earth, it will become

Leave the blood of centuries behind
On the threshold of freedom we stand
Lost and hidden at first
Beating louder every day
A glorious empire will rise

With no fear in my heart, no shame in my soul
I shall break all the chains of the earth
Through the fire and the flames, in the eye of the storm
We shall break all the chains of the earth

It may sleep but it will awake
It may wear chains but it will break free
For centuries of suffering
Our night's not without hope
