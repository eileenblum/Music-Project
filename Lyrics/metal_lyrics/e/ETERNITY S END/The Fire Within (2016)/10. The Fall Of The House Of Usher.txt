Fear lives in the walls of this castle, it's haunted by memories
Black - darkness descends on our souls a curse of the family

Oh - take this pain away, rescue my soul
Oh - take this spell from me, this line must end

Dreadful contortions of life, the madness lives on and on - dark souls reborn
Morbid perceptions of fear, the spirit diseased and torn - forevermore

She carries the plague of the soul as a part of the family tree
Dreams of death torment her soul in the night she feels the curse just like me

She was the last in line, I put her to rest
Still I can hear her calling me, what have I done

Dreadful contortions of life, the madness lives on and on - dark souls reborn
Morbid perceptions of fear, the spirit diseased and torn - forevermore

Still through these walls I hear her breath
Down in her tomb she calls my name in agony
Her fingers scratching in the dark
Now that the madness reaches out into her soul

Oh no, I dared not speak at all
She was buried alive inside the tomb
Many days ago
I could still hear her move inside a grave
I dared not speak what have I done
She's now coming back to me...

Oh - take this pain away, rescue my soul
Oh - take this spell from me, this line must end

Dreadful contortions of life, the madness lives on and on - dark souls reborn
Morbid perceptions of fear, the spirit diseased and torn - forevermore
