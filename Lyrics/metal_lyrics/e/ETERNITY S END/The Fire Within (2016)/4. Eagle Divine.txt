A new empire is rising up from, up from the ashes of my life
I spread my wings to fly, my soul in the sky
is the end of my quest
It is my eyes which see
A sight which grants beauty to the earth
I follow the guiding star the road
Points directly at me

Is it my will, is it my miracle
To own and keep to use what's mine
Kneel thy spirit before

Here at the gates of glory I look behind one last time
What is my life if I just (bow and obey)

We join our hands, we walk alone, however we wish
A holy temple must be untouched
Don't surrender just

Fly and be free, be the master of your destiny
Spread your wings and raise your spirit like an eagle divine
You will rise to the sky, let your mind break free from the lies
You are no longer a servant, but an eagle divine
You are free

Fly and be free, be the master of your destiny
Spread your wings and raise your spirit like an eagle divine
You will rise to the sky, let your mind break free from the lies
You are no longer a servant, but an eagle divine
Now I'm free...now I'm free
