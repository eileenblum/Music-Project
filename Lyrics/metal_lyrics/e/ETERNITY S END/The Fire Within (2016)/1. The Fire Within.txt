I awake with deadly visions as I hear voices in the dark whispering my name
Memories, I'm lost in twilight, as my heart is paralyzed with fear the black raven cries
And the dark river's calling my name, burning my soul
Cos' there's a fire inside, I will return

All these reflections from the past, the aftermath of sin
The spark inside will last, the fire from within
Dark shadows lift before my eyes, the eagle spreads its wings
The magic force that rules my life, the fire from within

From the ruins I rise to power, on the edge of death I carry on, a burden in my soul
A new dawn, a new beginning, nevermore shall I step aside my glorious path
For a magic flame won't cease to burn, a hero reborn
With a magic flame, I have returned

All these reflections from the past, the aftermath of sin
The spark inside will last, the fire from within
Dark shadows lift before my eyes, the eagle spreads its wings
The magic force that rules my life, the fire from within

With a magic flame, I have returned
