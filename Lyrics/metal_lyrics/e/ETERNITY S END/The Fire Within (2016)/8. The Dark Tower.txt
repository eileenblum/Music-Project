Far away beyond the crimson sky somewhere deep within
A dark void where space and time collide
It's calling me
Thousand moons, still I travel on and on, for all eternity
Will I find the meaning of it all
For my eyes to see
For my pain is the price I have to pay, cold and bitter
Is my heart while my soul is just a shadow
Of my self

Where time begins, where it ends, where all the worlds converge
Balance is lost, dark forces reach out, reach out to hold the key

Time marches on far beyond reality
I'll carry on, dark tower my destiny

Our universe is the final mystery, to great to unfold
For a mind can't conceive eternity
Now the world has changed
Time and space, every universe within, a single nexus
And within all the endless the reality
Might exist a room

Will you ever dare to ascend, to seek the final truth
And to find, primordial chaos, ruled by the crimson king

Time marches on far beyond reality
I'll carry on, dark tower my destiny

The dark wizard demands a sacrifice for his final requiem
From his cards he reads my destiny
Drawing of the three
Another world, I travel discontent, deep within the mind
A prisoner, a demon on my shoulder
Follows me home

On through the gate we will find the lady of shadows
Death guides our path as we march on through this waste lands

Time marches on far beyond reality
I'll carry on, dark tower my destiny...dark tower my destiny
