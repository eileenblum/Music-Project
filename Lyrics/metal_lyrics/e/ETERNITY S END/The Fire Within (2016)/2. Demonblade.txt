Through the eons of time
A dark legend is told
Of a black soul, immortal
Restless, walking the earth

Baptized in blood
Spawn of the night
Bringer of death and despair
The ruler of hell

Rise! - Demonic breed
Kill! - Kill for revenge
March! - Legions of evil
Fight! - Demonblade

Undead armies are marching
Spreading plague and disease
Evil forces awaken
Closing in for the kill

Fallen from grace
Evil divine
Leading the armies of doom
The end of mankind

Rise! - Demonic breed
Kill! - Kill for revenge
March! - Legions of evil
Fight! - Demonblade

Angelus delapsus
Peccatis hominum
De profundis clamavi ad te domine
Nos inducas in tentationem
Libera nos a bono
Tuum est tenebra

At the end's drawing nearer
Chaos ruling the earth
Blood red skies breathing fire
Demonblade has returned

Mankind dethroned
Forevermore
Eternal darkness will fall
The crimson king's back

Rise! - Demonic breed
Kill! - Kill for revenge
March! - Legions of evil
Fight! - Demonblade

Angelus delapsus
Peccatis hominum
