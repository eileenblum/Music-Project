"Xel'terras, my brother. By the time this transmission reaches you, I will most likely be dead. The Pryarus' push through the Raulm system and Helon IV's defenses has been much more seamless and brutal than what the initial reports makes it out to be. Intel says their main target is the planet's capital, Onyx Prime. I needed to message you personally to let you to know that and to remember that . Do not let this affect your mission. You must place your trust in yourself and Cyclonus. I know about your issues with him but he is our last hope and our most brilliant tactician. Earth must be warned. The Pryarus are guarding all the hyperspace portals throughout the galaxy and the HGK transmitter in the city core is our only means of long-range communication. We will create a diversion and attack their fleet head-on, so the Cyclopean Force may take the city back and transmit a distress signal. Please do not make our deaths meaningless. May Armon'Sul watch over you.

End transmission

Spectral beams of energy ignite the obsidian skyline
Flagships from the Orion belt burn through the stratosphere
Transluminic thrusters shimmer through impenetrable darkness
G-diffusers burning bright, they charge into the fray

In the midst of amaranthine twilight
Resound the trumpets of reprisal

Steel angels fly high on winds of victory
Transcending to astral realms in eternal glory
Gleaming-white specters spreading their wings
At one among celestial spirits for evermore

Planetary interceptors merge into cryptic formations
Gliding through the air, they obey the war command
Whirlwinds of psychic thunder follow in their wake
Wielders of omnipotent might â transmundane synergy

In the dead of everlasting night
Bear witness to our triumphant ascent

Steel angels fly high on winds of victory
Transcending to astral realms in eternal glory
Gleaming-white specters spreading their wings
At one among celestial spirits for evermore
