"(...) In accordance to the Crimson Concordat, potential galactic civil conflicts would "no longer be resolved in the barbaric ways of old". It all depends on what your definition of barbarism is, however. Have you ever seen someone getting his entire skin envelope peeled off after being exposed to G-Force currents on the race tracks? Have you ever seen a former wingman falling off the rails to his death while the horrified screams of his wife and children in the grandstands are drowned out by the cheering and laughter of a million spectators thirsty for blood and violence? My military background and mastery of G-Force travelling was the reason they hand-picked me for the race, but truth is, they needed a scapegoat. On that day, I represented the interests of my people and became a legend, a hero. Forever to be remembered for a victory that would affect the fate of a trillion souls. This is what had been said to me and to countless others. The slow realization that I was but a mere puppet came later, while diplomats reaped the benefits and used this victory to justify their greed. This isn't a sport. It's war, and it's no wonder humanity is hated. All was for naught. The controversy surrounding my departure from the circuit was justified, but perhaps this will help you understand why I did so in the first place."
[Xel'teras Errod, on his victory during the 1989 Grand Prix, Sol archives, 2001.]

In the distance, floating city lights paint the horizon
Metal machines race towards infinity in unison
In their wake, serpentine trails of fire radiate
Exceeding supersonic velocity, end of the line.

Bound for glory, fatal quest for exultation
Only the bold will prevail
Interstellar travellers hammer away
For the race has just begun

Hovering superstructures rise through the clouds solemnly
Anti-Gravitational pathways lead them to triumph
Smoldering remains fill the labyrinthine city streets
Challengers from unknown lands race to the death on burning wheels

Speeding phantoms drift into the Stygian twilight
Blazing towards victory
Reaching out to the heavens in exaltation
We arise and fulfill our destiny

"Onward we ride into the setting sun
Standing proud and tall, forever daring
Our legacy echoes through the halls of time
Far beyond the realms of eternity!"

Speeding phantoms drift into the Stygian twilight
Blazing towards victory
Reaching out to the heavens in exaltation
We arise and fulfill our destiny

"Onward we ride into the setting sun
Standing proud and tall, forever daring
Our legacy echoes through the halls of time
Far beyond the realms of eternity!"
