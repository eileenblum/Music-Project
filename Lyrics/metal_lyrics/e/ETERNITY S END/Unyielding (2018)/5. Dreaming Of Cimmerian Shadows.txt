[Music: MÃ¼nzner, lyrics: Tougas]

"Dreamâ¦.

Hearkening to the distant chiming of cathedral bells, shadowy apparitions danced around me as I ventured forth into the vastlands. Guided by the voices from beyond, the slumbering ancient gods of olde spoke to me in their mystifying tongues, with malignant exuberance.

Dream...

Through obscured dreams of saturnine landscapes of morbid splendor, I have beheld the shadows of their magnificence darken the stars and have witnessed the birth and death of a thousand universes. Sha'lakh zhol! It was under the dimming light of the twin moons, that the vestigial ruins of my lost heritage rose before me. Alas, my quest is over. From beneath the soil, the whispers of my slumbering ancestors beckoned me. Through their dreams, I see the kingdom that awaits me. Am I awake, or is this just a dream?

Dreamâ¦"
