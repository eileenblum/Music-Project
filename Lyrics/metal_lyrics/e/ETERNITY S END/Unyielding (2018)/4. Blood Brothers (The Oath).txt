[Music: MÃ¼nzner, lyrics: Sanson/MÃ¼nzner]

"(...) Alongside him came the templars of the twin suns ; blood brothers from the Hyperborean planes of existence.

With sword in hand, the Armonian Guard stood proud as the crescent horn resounded through the hills with fervor.

The extinguishing darkness from beyond was vanquished by the righteous light of the gleaming ones as they fulfilled their oath.

And as we celebrated the eminence of our new hegemony, our saviors vanished, leaving behind to us their legacy, wisdom and teachings."

[Excerpt from "Encyclopediae Aethemonium", chapter IX, War of the first Emergence, 1399 A.D. Written by Enel Sul'Gana, Elder Historian and Archivist.]

[Armonian Guard:]
We were born to survive
We are soldiers of light
We will never give up our lives
Surrounded by evil veiling the soul
We always find a way out

No matter if we're losing now
The strength is contained within our blood

Blood brothers
You have the force to change this world
"Make them believe!"
Blood brothers
You have the courage to make a stand
Blood brothers

We believe in this fight
Full of glory and might
Blood brothers need to arise
Guided by honor, fearless we march
We always find a way out

No matter if we're losing now
The strength is contained within our blood"

Blood brothers
You have the force to change this world
"Make them believe!"
Blood brothers
You have the courage to make a stand
Blood brothers
