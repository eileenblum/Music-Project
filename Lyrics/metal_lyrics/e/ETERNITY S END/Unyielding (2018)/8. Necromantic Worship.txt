[Music: MÃ¼nzner, lyrics: Tougas]

"Dreamâ¦

I opened the gates of the Exxul with haste and marveled at the jewels of the Xixmloprtech as they shimmered in the penetrating starlight.Grasping the sword of Shtligudnra, I wept as the ghastly faces of those who perished at the end of its blade flashed before my eyes. As I solemnly stood alone amongst the silent tombs, I inhaled the ancestral miasma from Azhok's chalice and became entranced as the memories of my ancestors became mine.

Dream...

Here lie the ruins of the Kingdom of Shtligudnra and its long lost legacy of darkness. By the powers of Iirzhol bestowed upon me by my forefathers, what once was, shall be again. Sh'tlozhk'akta! We shall be the harbingers of their return. Our progeny shall sing to the stars and the voices of the resurrected dead shall echo through the coalescing void! Hear us hail the return of the Pryarus!

Dream... no more! Sha'lakh zhol!"

Awakening to the twin moon's eclipse
Horrors unseen lurk in the shadows
Cimmerian towers of frozen dusk
Stand tall amidst the nocturnal stillness

Spectral stronghold, a fearful vision
Shades of darkness descend upon the land

Hear the funeral choirs mourn
The coming of the end
Solemn elegies sung
In ancient tongues unknown
Hear the howling dead hail
The coming of a new reign
Tenebrous hordes are gathering
The ritual is complete

Entranced wraiths dance to sepulchral hymns
Deep within once silent candlelit halls

Resurrection â begin the sacrament
Necromancy â on unhallowed grounds

Hear the funeral choirs mourn
The coming of the end
Solemn elegies sung
In ancient tongues unknown
Hear the howling dead hail
The coming of a new reign
Tenebrous hordes are gathering
The ritual is complete

Spectral stronghold â a fearful vision
Shades of darkness descend upon the land

Hear the funeral choirs mourn
The coming of the end
Solemn elegies sung
In ancient tongues unknown
Hear the howling dead hail
The coming of a new reign
Tenebrous hordes are gathering
The ritual is complete
