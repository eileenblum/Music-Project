[Music: Tougas/MÃ¼nzner, lyrics: Tougas]

"We stood and watched as the great rift opened the burning heavens and archangels of iron descended from myriad stars to smite us.

We stood and watched as once triumphant realms fell into nothingness and the shadows of forgotten monuments enshrouded us in despair.

But in the hour of our final judgment came the righteous one with his undying steel, he who rode the north winds under the guidance of the twin suns.

In the hour of our salvation he came aboard a golden ship, sailing from shores unknown.

He who rode with the Armonian guard at his helm, crossed the streams of time."

[Excerpt from "Encyclopediae Aethemonium", chapter IX, War of the first Emergence, 1399 A.D. Written by Enel Sul'Gana, Elder Historian and Archivist.]

[Armon'Sul:]
"Sitting atop towering spires, the gods tremble
Impotent as they witness our might
From the crumbling ruins of our kingdom, we rise anew
Across the realms, the clarion call is heard again!"

[Armonian Guard:]
"(Let) our shields glow in the light of hyperborean stars as we bathe in the crimson wine of battle!"

"Grant us the strength and valor to carry on
Take hold of the flame that burns within
Raise your swords and hail the blazing dawn
Fearless in our hearts, forever Unyielding"

[Armonian Guard:]
"Consecrated in the crystalline waters of Mimas
(let our) prismatic blades sever the shackles of iniquity
Armored in alloys forged from moonfires
We stand united under the banners of Armon'Sul"

[Armonian Guard:]
"Bestowed with iron will, the path before us is clear"

[Armon'Sul:]
"Bear the mark of anointed steel, take your fate within your hands!"

"Grant us the strength and valor to carry on
Take hold of the flame that burns within
Raise your swords and hail the blazing dawn
Fearless in our hearts, forever Unyielding"

[Sul'Gana:]
"And here, they stood at the crest of destiny
From the mountains to the seas, their light shone one last time"

[Armon'Sul:]
"There can never be victory without sacrifice.
(You must) find the power within yourselves.
Stand up and fight!"

[Sul'Gana:]
"The price we pay for the sins of our fathers
is the blood of our kin staining our once mighty halls
Forget not those who stood their ground on that day
In time, even death may die, but their legend lives onâ¦"

"Grant us the strength and valor to carry on
Take hold of the flame that burns within
Raise your swords and hail the blazing dawn
Fearless in our hearts, forever Unyielding"
