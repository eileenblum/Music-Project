[Music and lyrics are by MÃ¼nzner/Tougas]

"What are gods to man? Shepherds watching over their flock, shielding us from the wolves of the night? Nothing but mere delusions created by beguiled men arrogantly claiming to be their disciples. Hidden in the darkness, the gods are but a collective consciousness, unseen and untouched, their omniscience absolute.
They are the beginning and the end of existence. They don't have to want to. They don't have to think about it. They just are. I have seen them in my visions, slumbering in the deepest depths of cosmic darkness beyond the stars themselves. I have seen them awaken in their darkened domains, their cries shattering the stars and planets alike. Heed my words or all will perish under the scythes of their divine wrath!"

[Ghar Sul'Emun, moments before his execution, 1167 A.D (68 years after the discovery) Excerpt taken from "Encyclopediae Aethemonium".]

The legend of the elders, an ancient prophecy
Foretells a future vision, the final cataclysm
Eternities have passed by, we saw the last star fall
Bells chime the last rites of uncreation

Riding on solar storms through cosmic endlessness
Synthetical intelligence created to evoke the wrath of the gods

Legions of steel marching on through the night
Cosmic rays of high energy blaze the sky
Stellar raiders emerge from the depths of infinity
Time and space merge on the battlefield
Under crimson moonlight

Dark comets fill the night sky, burning with astral fire
Divine creations bring the fall of time

Stardust and asteroid fields, infinite dimensions
The dawn of time, the end of days, a boundless sea of infinite realities

Legions of steel marching on through the night
Cosmic rays of high energy blaze the sky
Stellar raiders emerge from the depths of infinity
Time and space merge on the battlefield
Under crimson moonlight

Legions of steel marching on through the night
Cosmic rays of high energy blaze the sky
Stellar raiders emerge from the depths of infinity
Time and space merge on the battlefield
Under crimson moonlight
