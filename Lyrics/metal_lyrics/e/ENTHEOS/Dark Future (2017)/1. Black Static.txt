Drowning in a sea of static
Forbearance wearing thin
Night was already long long before this
The consistent patterns begin to blend once again
Ever expending and full of regret
All of my solace lies
In skin I've shed and left behind
I've been losing sleep
Searching a meaning in anything
I have thought I'd learned to separate myself from the surrealistic void
But now I see it's engulfing me
And I've no rope to grab ahold
Something so frail and fragile
Was certain to never float at all
Inevitability in this static sea
We all dissolve
Shifting along with the flow
Existing simply to say so
I've been losing sleep
Searching a meaning in anything
All of my solace lies
In skin I've shed and left behind
I've been losing sleep
Searching a meaning
Sweating swirling my descent
I bend and contort
Incredible black hole
Torn into the fabric of the earth
Distorting not only thought
Compromising vision
Great delusional mind
In control of everlasting time
And as the light from the sun washes over me
I will never find relief
I've held the world in my hands
I couldn't keep it on my own
I've held the world in my hands
I couldn't keep it all alone
