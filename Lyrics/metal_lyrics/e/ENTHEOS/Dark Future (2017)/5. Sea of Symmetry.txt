I'm now drowning into question
Everything I've ever known
The answer is not in my heart nor in my hand
It may never be
I've looked to the sky
I've grasped for the sun
I've witnessed a tectonic shift
And have seen the static hit
And ever through the darkest of the night
Mornings never fails to comes
I am living I am breathing
Perhaps what is meant to be sought stand before us
And not beyond
While there may never be meaning
So different from what I have envisioned
Witnessing every neuron collapse
But I paid no mind
It made no difference
Learning to live on and let go
Reminiscing over what could have been
But it will never be
And with black cloud above me
I catch my breath
It all fall into place
Like we we're made for this
Patiently I gather words that I had forgot to say
In another passing wave
If this life temporary let come what may come
Perhaps what meant to be sought
Stand before us
And not beyond
Beyond
My will versus that of a force that I will never know
Perhaps it's the way in which I observed and felt that I must grow
To push forward
This room with no door is filling us
Filling us both with dread
It's almost as time is choosing to exist
Only within our head
And with black cloud above me
I catch my breath
It all fall into place
Like we we're made for this
Patiently I gather words that I had forgot to say
In another passing wave
