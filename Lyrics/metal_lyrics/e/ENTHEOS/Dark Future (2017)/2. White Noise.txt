My body become one with comfort
One with pain
Acceptance is now my guidance light
I no longer find truth within subconscious
These thought only led me to a lack of control
It's so obvious the voice guiding us
The void guiding us they don't consider us at all
Black static be mine
Let new life form intertwine
See infinity come to life
Vulnerable complex machine
A mind in full decline
Let the sound of static embrace me
What does it mean to be alive
All my solace lies
In skin I've shed and left behind
I've been losing sleep
Searching for the light
