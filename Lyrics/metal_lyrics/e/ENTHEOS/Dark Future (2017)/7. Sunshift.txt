Fears fade into uncomfortable realities
Endless processes leave me chewing my finger
Grinding my teeth
Insecure and delusional
Revisiting reopening old wound
Immersed in reflection
Resisting neutrality
Motion paralyzed
I'm losing it all
There is no certainty in that which
We can never come to know
An assumption a delusion
This lack of sleep weigh on me
One for those whose eyes will never close
And through my total deseperation
I screamed into the dark night
Thought I know my word will never reach you
I'd give anything to try
To begin again
Like lead in my lung
I'm burning the wick of candle from both ends
Isn't it obvious blow the flame out
