A glimpse of clarity in the haze
Of my mind burning in and out
Around on itself
Kaleidoscopic vision consume me
So let the night be still
I want to feel the arms of the earth surround me
And if it will prevent me from falling
I would gladly start over again
Mirror illusion of my fantasies
Those which once only awoke in daydream
Take breath and thrive within my flash
All inhibition disappears with the sunset
Drifting somewhere between waking and dreaming
The weight of every fear is exposed
Thought I've hid them deep beneath my bones
Tightening coil of anxiety
Lingering inconsistencies brought to light
Those which can only be found when we go searching
Just like night into day
Day into night
I feel the shift
