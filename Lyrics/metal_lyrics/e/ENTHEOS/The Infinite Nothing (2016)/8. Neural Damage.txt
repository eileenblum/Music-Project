Pressing forth with swollen lungs
Manipulated moments,
Constructed through the mere persistence of an unwanted mechanical extension

Inhaling the celestial air
Anxious, cold sun follows closely,
I'm drawing a parallel
In every, inching moment

So pull me from the wreckage
Manipulated moments,
Constructed through the mere persistence of an unwanted mechanical extension

A familiar sense of comfort;
Mind becomes one in parallel
Eminently calculated
All that is known is from within
One with the void,
Forever with the void,
Forever

Observing the array
Color floors
Entrancing,
Light bends
Consciously forging hallucinations
I have witnessed the radiance of the sun,
And I know that I am the one with illusion

Pressing forth with swollen lungs
Manipulated moments,
Constructed through the mere persistence of an unwanted mechanical extension

So pull me from the wreckage
Manipulated moments,
Constructed through the mere persistence of an unwanted mechanical extension

[2x]
Observing the array
In the void forever

Forever
