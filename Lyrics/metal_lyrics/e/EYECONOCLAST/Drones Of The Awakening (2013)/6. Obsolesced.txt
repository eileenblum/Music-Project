de-evolving back to the primary form
divert from the path of evolution
into a parasitic suicide

Awaken, paralyzed among swarming polymorphic beings
My flesh is rotten,
Connected, erased, my ego is defaced
Reborn, enslaved through karmic gasmask I stare
I rise as the bastard son of the ill-conceived race

one by one we fall in the anoxic fate
surrounded by corpses
my essence is drained, our failure proclaimed

I crawl extending my lifespan to zero
while the collective mind condemns me to life

AT WAR!!
revenge runs on thirsty blades
AT WAR!!
i' ll be nameless and shrouded in hate
AT WAR!!
scream for help, scream in pain, run for life
AT WAR!!
I'm condemned to live, you re condemned to DIE!!!

Falling down, guilty-disarmed, you withdraw
Risen from ashes, I stare at the malevolent sky

I glorify myself soaked in blood
as the last man standing dominated by his ravenous soul

sick, drugged and stunned, among swarming polymorphic beings
my life is trodden
connected, erased, my ego is defaced
reborn, enslaved through karmic gasmask I stare
I rise as the bastard son of the ill-conceived race

AT WAR!
one by one you fall
in the anoxic fate
surrounded by corpses,
your essence is drained, your failure proclaimed
