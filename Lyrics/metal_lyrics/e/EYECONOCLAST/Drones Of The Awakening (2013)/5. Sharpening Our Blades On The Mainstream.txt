In silence we happily wait

Once Pronounced , âTerrorâ embodies in the massive speech syntagma,
Obsolescientist recruited from fleshfarms , now slaves of a DEAD dimension
epicentral âH.E.A.R.T-quakeâ intelligentia.

The pain now dwells in cyberteardromes once called cities, 
Sharpening our blades on the mainstream.. 

A Skyline Grasping For A Breath Of Liberty
auras necrofusion, a sign of Metropolis promiscuity

Identity screams searching its way out of this prosthetic netherworld
Conformism-cancer burns in fractal dual textures..
Slaves dressed in sinâ¦a death in stereo already foreseen,

For the shape of despair is a mirrored fractal scream
Sharpening Our Blades On The Mainstream..

Colours melt into a deadly diorama, humanity trades his sight
And close the eyes on this new millennia wormcracy.

Silently we leave our shelter , murmuring black lullabies.
As a grey multitude we lay in eternal criosleep..

feeding the Central Brain Frenzy 
waiting..(dreaming)..for future improvement..
feeding..
Once Pronounced , âTerrorâ embodies in the massive speech syntagma,
Obsolescientist recruited from fleshfarms , now slaves of a DEAD dimension
epicentral âH.E.A.R.T-quakeâ intelligentia.
(condemned is our fate unblessed)

The pain now dwells in cyberteardromes once called cities, 
Sharpening our blades on the mainstream.. 

Our Conscience Detunes The Neo â Cyber Dumb Nonsense Chorus
As we become living naked lunch of the Mechaspawn.

In Silence We Happily Wait.
