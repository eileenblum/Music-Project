Entangled in the dream-web of the real-world delusion
Reprogrammed, I react in compulsion.
Executing erratic codes...
Nanoribonucleic acid is injected in my genetic waste

(I feel a death spasm)

Swarming nanodroids assaulting my mind...
With methodical practice, to stabilize the unborn race...
My brain's cortex is invaded of energy signals...
Divinity is at hand, but I just choose the end.

PRAY FOR GOD
The machine is released
PRAY FOR GOD
From my womb, I'm diseased

Hailing the dawn of biomechanical co-evolution
It feasts on my flesh, in darkness I repent.
Disembowled to feed the unmerciful one !!!

The newborn lifeform rises,
Fierce as a tombstone for humankind
A never dormant orgamechanism aimed to unleash despair and death !
Perfect, hostile, infecting.
D.iabolical
N.anotecnological
A.berrancy

I bear the crown of this putrid world
Only worms survived...
I am the monarch of nothing !
I bear the crown, the crown of guilt !
