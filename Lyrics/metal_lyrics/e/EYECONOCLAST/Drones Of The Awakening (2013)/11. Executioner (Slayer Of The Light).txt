There's no escape, as the darkness falls...you can't resist, the Devil's call!!

Misanthropic - Frozen soul blaze black and cold
Luciferian - Slave to the beast and marked for life
Order from Hell - To send souls to the other side
In Dark Devotion - Living for terror and destruction

Executioner...executioner...executioner...slayer of the light!
Desecrator...violator...devastator...messenger of death!

Sworn to Satan - Morbid minds close horrid pacts
The Dagger Strikes - Blood is shed for the faceless one
Possessed with Murder - Angels of death amphetamine sped
At the Mountain - A body found in killer's park

Evil lives and death draws near
Serve blind that dreadful voice you hear
With violence, horror, pain and fear
To make them see the reaper clear!

Shot like a dog, emptied on blood
Life won't return, to the silent corpse!
In the staring eyes of both the victim and the killer...
All light has now forever fled away... the darkness fell to stay

Electrified - Stunned, down, and sacrificed
Two Shots for the Dark - Through the head and through the heart

Executioner... executioner, life destroyer! Executioner, shadow in the night
Desecrator... violator, Satan's soldier! Devastator, cruelty and death!
