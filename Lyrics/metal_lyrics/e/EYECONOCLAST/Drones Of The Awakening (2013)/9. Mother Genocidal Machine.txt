with none, exhausted last resources
I foresee the extent of all my beliefs choked with a Gordian knot
undone, I'm vanishing, no defenses
I misperceive the steps of (an) incorporeal erratic routine

Mother genocidal machine
enchanting us, eclipse unforeseen
manipulated, she's bleeding for me
axiomatic truth: my aura is obscene

I am no more

mentally falling in
SMOTHERING
we're thrown into awareness
CHALLENGE
the architect
SINKING
the all in one
CONFINED
the Elsewhere
DROWNING
the one in all
FACING
the limitless
THE MOTHER MACHINE
CASTS THE SHADOWS OF PAIN FROM THE DEPTHS OF PARANOIA

introspective vanishing in my thoughts I suffer in deception
my mind scatters in shards, deprived, dispossessed of the primal identity
I am not mine, I am not.

a cyberorgiastic ceremony with the inner self
rusts my soul in pain, life dressed in vain
An ANNIHILATING FLAME!!!!!

inhumanoids lying all around me
crawling in pitch black fluids with no consciousness of their demise
Interconnected, processing at terminal speed
only (for) selfsubstinance
I fall in the pit
