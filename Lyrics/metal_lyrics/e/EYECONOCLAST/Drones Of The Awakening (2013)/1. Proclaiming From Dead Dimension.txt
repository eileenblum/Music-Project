Travelling, motionless into the unknown
Frozen in time, I have no control
From a slowmotion mental anesthesia
I'll come back to life !

Thousand years for mankind,
for me: a blink of an eye,
with a blind, prophetic smile
I leave this world of death and sleeping minds

When the crimson day turns into silent night
I'll be waiting in the shadows !

My life was a bug of time !
Of time and destiny...
Vitrificated, bravely towards my fate !

In the nightfall I accelerate
To the future with no divine guidance,
In life-stasis I await
To live where I belong (and) see from beyond !!!

I'm going where I belong !
As last immortal prophet
I'm going where I belong !
To the future with no divine guidance
I'm going where I belong !
Enshrined, to the enlightenment
I'm going where I belong !
STILL PROCLAIMING FROM A DEAD DIMENSION

Surviving through epochs, I stop my core...
Ages as solemn chains grinded with no halt...
No other odds, I decide to evolve !
I don't accept demise !!!

Transhuman in trance !
My potentials will be enhanced !
We are not made to be as we are
But to be as we decide, and to improve !

My first heartbeat will be as deep
as a quake for the global mind,
-I will rise !-
It will be hailed as an hymn for all humankind

I'll ascend to divinity as a relic of the past !

Nostalgic of the future
My echo resounds as my epitaph

Hailing from the future, where I belong !
