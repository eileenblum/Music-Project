...and the fool will rise, claimed by the crowd

... mindless seers as chosen ones

electro-opium induced trinary logic - deceit for the masses
predicts the global inferno

the inheritance tree subverted - father against son
fratricidal genocide

aligned to system, identity dissolved
vanity disperses aborting all the thoughts
in a sentient anomaly, 
multiplexed wrong signals to my thought machine
addicted to an altered state
recoding storms of random data, doped, the gates are open, I am divine
I rip my synthetic self-observing eyes
so I'm blind enough to see 
all our septic miseries
mind isolation, multiplied self negation
central processing mind revels in distortion

...and the oppressor's thirst quenched by these tears

our breed's mind mangled by the new narcotic heavens... 
skeptics leaving the "here and now" unresolved...
stepping up, to face the final unpredictable result 
descent to the depths - to unveil the eradication plan

and while, improved, the system loops itself
I cycle myself in the nothingness of artificial serenades
under fallen venomous skies

while radiations implode and the wisdom corrodes
alteration regenerates the pulsating core
I summon She, who all see
and under Her tracks, She enchant us...
