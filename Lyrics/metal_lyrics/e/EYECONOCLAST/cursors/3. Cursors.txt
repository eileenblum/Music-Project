Behind the fading mask, we're cursors in disguise

Vengeance comes from inside/outside
The light is still so thin
To see the burning flowers, engulfing all my dreams

All the coils are stickin' in my soul
While my neon stops watch the crumbling world

Of a creed without it's Lord,
an headless body self devoured

Restless, forgotten human worm,
headless overpowered god

Numbered cursors, paradigm of sorrow

Lonely Useless Absynth Nothing Antigod
That's why I see, pulsating cursors

Restless, forgotten human worm,
I dream to calculate your pain
I dream binary encoded rain
