Now when all the things are enlightened
Hypocrite - you're getting weaker
I rise on your faults
Smashed crystals of dreams - to dust - shattered

Things will blame you - mind feed by lies
Hardly you'll believe - soon you'll fall
Beauty washes away, waves of emptiness
Hardly you'll believe - in disgrace you'll live

Right now I'm sinking - falling - crushing to the ground
Endless monologue with empty cosmos

Apothecary of illusions, I will not live in my cell
Mindless slave of society, frailty feebleminded one

Down, at the beginning of pantheism
Mouldered, ruined, enslaved - smashed crystal of dreams
Pregnant of your mind - wander in your space
Life has chained yourself to this destiny - eternally
I will breath again, stand and live again,
But the faults you've done will
GRIND US

Feeling invisible, white line in a blank page's book
Section between the infinite part, divided by anger
Alternate reality - mirrors reflecting mirrors
I have no mouth and I must scream
