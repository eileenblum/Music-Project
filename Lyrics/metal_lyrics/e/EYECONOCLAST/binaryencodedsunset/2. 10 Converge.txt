My throne is the pale distorted smile of
a venom fueled sky,
a moon whose collapsings surface
is the reflection of my fall

plus and minus blessing the digital
ceremony of contraddictions
one and zero converging, in the
eternal deflagration of my tears

my solipsism explodes
fire as smell of death

sacrifice of sanity, sanctified obscenity

Sentence of future to come,
the blind mankind dyin' alone
death symphony
