I feel the lack
of the void once surrounding me
I see the black
betrayal of dreams

Innocence, purity
have committed suicide in me

Bitterness unlife
Mind's and soul's deception
Agony strong as hate
Agony strong as hate

In this cold rain, my misanthropy
My frustration is genocidal
Pain will be spread with brutality
Ashes there will Be
Ashes there will Be

Human suffering is symbolic
Human suffering is symbolic emanation of our soul demise
Our  wormlife
Our soul demise
Of our wormilfe

In this cold rain, my misanthropy
My frustration is genocidal
Pain will be spread with brutality
Ashes there will Be
Ashes there will Be
