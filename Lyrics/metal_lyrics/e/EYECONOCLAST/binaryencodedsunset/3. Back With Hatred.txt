Distance between insanity and
calculated rage... is the thin line of my
revolution... nonexistence

War! my cosmic vision full ofhatred
in the darkest hour of my existence
burning angels, bless my ecstasy
world falling on my knees

....slaughter feast.....

Going blind, burning minds
from inside, side to side, (suicide),

tears are gone, as the sunlight
turns to stone, I'm alone, from above,
my constellation calls my return...

and it feels good to be Back With Hatred.

..hear the voice of Hades..
I am the downfallen, back with hatred
I am the forgotten one, spawn of sin
I am the prayer receveing no answe
I am back, back, with hatred 3.2.1. fuck you!

Going blind - burning minds - from inside
side to side - suicide - burning pyres - lust desire
my empire...
