[performed by Extreme Noise Terror]You take part in creating this system 
That we all must suffer in 
We can't stop going round and round 
We got to fix this rat race 

This is the system you helped to create 

They use you for corruption schemes 
You're the unrealized and unintended 
You're the one, the one they don't like 
You let them know your fears 

This is the system you helped to create 

You ask me why I'm fighting the system 
Why I'm preaching anarchy 
I'm fighting for the freedom 
Fighting for the rights 
For the likes of you and me 

This is the system you helped to create 
This is the system you helped to create
