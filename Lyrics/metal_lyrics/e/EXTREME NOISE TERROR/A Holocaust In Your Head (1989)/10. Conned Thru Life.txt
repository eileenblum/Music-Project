Your life is a stagnant pool of shit
And if you donât want to drown
Then you have to eat it

From birth to death youâre conned through life
Is living your life just a waste of time?

And if you choose to swallow the shit
Itâll poison you SO MUCH; youâll wish you drowned in the first place

From birth to death youâre conned through life
Is living your life just a waste of time?
