You say we wonât change nothing but at least weâre fucking trying
You say weâre always moaning but at least we fucking care
You say we should be happy, weâve tried to and we are
You say we should see sense but we already fucking have

Use your shit filled mindsâ¦ and show you fucking care!

You donât care about the rich as long as youâre not poor
You donât care about vivisection âcosâ you canât change the law
You donât care about the police force because they havenât beaten up you
You donât care about the starving because itâs nothing new

Use your shit filled mindsâ¦ and show you fucking care!

You say we wonât change nothing but at least weâre fucking trying
You say weâre always moaning but at least we fucking care
You say we should be happy, weâve tried to and we are
You say we should see sense but we already fucking have

Use your shit filled mindsâ¦ and show you fucking care!

Comfortably placed within your four walls of tranquility
Brain-dead and oblivious to the carnage of life
You are the carcass of society
Void of thought, intelligent reasoning and care
You are the reason millions of animals are slaughtered
You are the reason people starve
You are the reason women are raped
You are the reason children are sexually abused
You are the reason people are beaten in South Africa
This is no newspaper headline, this is reality
All because you are too scared to show emotion
You self righteous shitâ¦ show you fucking care
Stand up, these are your problems too
And together we can bring about a change!
Change! Change! Change!!!!
