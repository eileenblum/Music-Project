Police protect the rich
Uphold their fucking law
The police uphold the system
As they smash you to the floor
Because our so called âfreedomâ
Is nothing but a farce
Restrictions, lies and laws are rammed right up our arse

With bullshit propaganda
Itâs you who cause the wars

Donât you try to cover up
The suffering that youâve caused
With bullshit propaganda
Itâs you who cause the wars
You cannot deny your crimes
Although you fucking try
You so called free speech
Is nothing but a lie

With bullshit propaganda
Itâs you who cause the wars

[Repeat all]
