Working class heroâs reveling in a dream
White and proud the glorified chant
Ignorant imposed political thought
Ideologistâs creating divisions of hate
Nationalist pride the worst pride of all
Creating an army of robots in support of the state
Offering nothing but a selfish hate
Of anyone considered different whether they be black, brown or white
If you donât sheepishly follow their crowd
Then youâre considered scum, a nigger loving, commie good for nothing bastard

This disgraceful way of thought is here
And is very real if itâs allowed to thrive
Who knows where it will end
Peopleâs everyday lives can become a dangerous nightmare
Because of the color of their skin
But poor excuses of nationalist pride to us are wearing thin

The persecution of people who donât fit their mold
Is constructed out of their xenophobic reactions to innocent men, women and children who in reality they have no real argument

Whatâs needed is education not alienation
As racism cuts both ways, but thatâs only caused by ignorance on both sides
This could be stopped by people actually using their minds
And having more tolerance for others, their cultures &amp; also their ways of life
Cultures must be united in love, equality and need of each other
Not hatred of the skin color
So letâs discard our systematically imposed conditioning of hate and ignorance â and learn respect
