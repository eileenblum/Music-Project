Jesus on my side
Heaven turns to hell
The god preaches hate
Sent alone to kill

Love kills the demon
But the demon kills us all

Fear is stimulations
Heaven fades to black
Suns rise on the underside
God of hate is back

Love kills the demon
But the demon kills us all

When suns rise on the underside
Existence is divine
Deity will come from pain
With Jesus on my side
On my side
On my side

Voices, torment, inside
Bagging unbeliever genocide

Jesus on my side
Heaven turns to hell
The god preaches hate
Sent alone to kill

Love kills the demon
But the demon kills us all
