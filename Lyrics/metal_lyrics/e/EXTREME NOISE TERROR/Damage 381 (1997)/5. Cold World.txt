Enslaved, to poison trade
Existence of borrowed time
Depraved, noxious state
Corrupt exaction insane

Down on your knees!
Down on your knees!

Withdrawal, despair, depravity, no restriction
Insertions satisfied by chemical destruction

Down on your knees!
Down on your knees!

[Verse missing lyrics]

Down on your knees!
[Repeat]
