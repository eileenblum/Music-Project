Bound by denial
Crucified by guilt
A sacrosanct shroud
Of masturbation divine

Down on your knees
Consecration so perverse
In temptation you drown
In deliverance you burn

You burn, veiled in a shroud devout
You drown; drown in a sea of guilt

You beat a crown of thorns
In prayer your conscience burns
A sacrosanct shroud of masturbation divine

You drown; drown in a sea of guilt
You drown; drown in a sea of guilt

You burn, veiled in a shroud devout
You drown; drown in a sea of guilt

You drown in a sea of guilt
You drown in a sea of guilt

Down on your knees
Consecration so perverse
In temptation you drown
In deliverance you burn

Drown in guilt!
Drown in guilt!
