In the visions of utopia, eyes burn with retinal decay
Safety with all we know, takes you nowhere

A treatment to the visions, of a bleeding paradise
Feed the fire. Too much pleasure takes you higher

A dead end decline to dispassionate decay
Feed the fire. Complacency reigns,
A tenebrous view, serene in your cage

In the visions of utopia, eyes burn with retinal decay
Safety with all we know, takes you nowhere

A dead end decline to dispassionate decay
Feed the fire. Complacency reigns,
A tenebrous view, serene in your cage

As utopia burns, paradise decays
Aspirations unborn, are laid to rest
Laid to rest!

A treatment to the visions, of a bleeding paradise
Feed the fire. Too much pleasure takes you higher

A dead end decline to dispassionate decay
Feed the fire. Complacency reigns,
A tenebrous view, serene in your cage

Utopia burns! Utopia burns!
