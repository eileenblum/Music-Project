An empty world
Buried deep in misery
Confined for life
Never see what lies
Beyond downside

There's no way out
You built the walls too high
You have no plans, no purpose-
You're sentenced for life

And you're conditioned to live
In this concrete tomb
You scream alone
Imprisoned in this poison vacuum

Downside! Downside!

You have no unison just bricks before your eyes
You'll never see what lies beyond the downside

And you're conditioned to live
In this concrete tomb
You scream alone
Imprisoned in this poison vacuum

Downside! Downside!

An empty world
Buried deepâ¦ in misery
Confined for life
Never see what lies
Beyond downside

There's no way out
You built the walls too high
You have no plans, no purpose-
You're sentenced for life

And you're conditioned to live
In this concrete tomb
You scream alone
Imprisoned in this poison vacuum

Downside! Downside!
