Subconscious is your shallow existence
Crucified by your insecurities
Convulsing to your stagnant remains,
Turned inside out,
Sucking onâ¦ the emptiness of one another

Calculated interaction,
Molding a shallow expression
Faking a picture on contest,
Not seeing past the barriers you create,
Inside yourself

It's dark in your mind
And your aim is blind
Eternality devoid

Subconscious is your shallow existence
Crucified by your insecurities
Convulsing to your stagnant remains,
Turned inside out,
Sucking onâ¦ the emptiness of one another

It's dark in your mind
And your aim is blind
Eternality devoid

It's dark in your mind
And your aim is blind
Your aim is blind!

Subconscious is your shallow existence
Crucified by your insecurities
Convulsing to your stagnant remains,
Turned inside out,
Sucking onâ¦ the emptiness of one another

It's dark in your mind
And your aim is blind
Eternality devoid
