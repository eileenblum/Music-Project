Enslaved by fear, its free thoughts demise
Reason left ignored, replaced by the stench of lies
Force-fed corruption, swallowed by closed minds
Selfish greed clouding, thoughts not seen

All is dead, in the land of living hell

Enslaved by fear, its free thoughts demise
Reason left ignored, replaced by the stench of lies
Force-fed corruption, swallowed by closed minds
Selfish greed clouding, thoughts not seen

All is dead, in the land of living hell

Collective mind breeds fear, consumes a hate disease
A sense of past, empty void overspilling greed
Making war on those you donât understand
Tyrant in the name of peace

All is dead, in the land of living hell
All is dead, in the land of living hell
