Always despised now thereâs no turning back
From school into society were stabbed in the back

Against the grain, in a world thatâs gone insane
Against the grain, in a world thatâs gone insane

Canât condition me always too strong for you
Itâs the law of retaliation fight back, fuck you
Against the grain, in a world thatâs gone insane
Against the grain, in a world thatâs gone insane
