Show me the right way and I might follow
But a life built on lies I find hard to swallow

Believe what I say, or be damned
Is living your life just a waste of time

Christian or Islam I stick the cross in my arse
Exploiting the weak, your gods are farce

Believe what I say, or be damned
Is living your life just a waste of time

In the name of god youâre sent to your death
Show me the right way and I might follow
But a life built on lies I find hard to swallow
Believe what is say, or be damned
