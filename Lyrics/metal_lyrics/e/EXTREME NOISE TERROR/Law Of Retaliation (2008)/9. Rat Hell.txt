You, you can win the rat race, but still become a rat
Some will get a head start; some just have to strike back

Some give up, some regret, some fight

If, if youâre one of the unloved, the hated and the hunted
Donât let them bring you to your knees, stand up and fight

Some give up, some regret, some fight

[Solo]

Some give up, some regret, some fight
Some give up, some regret, some fight

Theyâre the true vermin
Donât let them bring you to your knees
Theyâre the true vermin
Donât let them bring you to your knees
