A social acceptance masking real life
Sycophantic ways
This force of habit a fate worse than death
Living within the fear

Hollow lives of misery
Suck desires &amp; hereditary lies
A celebration of discontent
The blind lead the blind

The building of walls protecting the prize
Imprisoned by a greed
Paralyzed in a world of regret
What have you become?

Hollow lives of misery
Suck desires &amp; hereditary lies
A celebration of discontent
The blind lead the blind

Blind lead the blind
With hereditary lies
[4x]

[Solo]

Hollow lives of misery
Suck desires &amp; hereditary lies
A celebration of discontent
The blind lead the blind
