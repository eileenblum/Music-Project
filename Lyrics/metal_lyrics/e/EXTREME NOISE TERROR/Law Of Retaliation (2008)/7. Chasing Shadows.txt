Blackened eyes conceal unhealed scars
The scars of a thousand empty words
Forgive and forget itâs always the same
Chasing shadows, time for revenge

Behind false smiles lay broken vows
And the guilt of conquests dead inside
Behind false smiles lay broken vows
And the guilt of conquests dead inside

Standing alone awaiting idols to fall
Unsettles scores never laid to rest
Choking on the stench of our deceit
And living the wreckage of these regrets

Behind false smiles lay broken vows
And the guilt of conquests dead inside
Behind false smiles lay broken vows
And the guilt of conquests dead inside

[Solo]

Behind false smiles lay broken vows
And the guilt of conquests dead inside
Behind false smiles lay broken vows
And the guilt of conquests dead inside
