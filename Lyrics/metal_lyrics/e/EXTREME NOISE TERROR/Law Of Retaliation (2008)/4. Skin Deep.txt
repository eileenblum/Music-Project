Take your white pride and find another life
Lost in society you need a place to hide

No place for you here
Punk owes you nothing
No place for you here
Punk owes you fuck

Foundations built on ignorance and hate
But hatred is more than just skin deep

No place for you here
Punk owes you nothing
No place for you here
Punk owes you fuck

Oi! What a farce!
What a fucking joke
Working class heroes, Ha!
Puppets to the system more like

Take your white pride and find another life
Lost in society you need a place to hide

No place for you here
Punk owes you nothing
No place for you here
Punk owes you fuck
