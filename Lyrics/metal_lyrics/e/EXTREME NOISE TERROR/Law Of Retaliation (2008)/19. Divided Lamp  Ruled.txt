Thoughts controlled from birth a life on your knees
Oblivion of the mind within their normality

Restricted, confined, mentally chained
Divided, ruled, dictated the norm
Restricted, confined, mentally chained
Divided, ruled, dictated the norm

Rotting in blind dreams content in despair
A cycle of deprivation is all you deserve

Restricted, confined, mentally chained
Divided, ruled, dictated the norm
Restricted, confined, mentally chained
Divided, ruled, dictated the norm
