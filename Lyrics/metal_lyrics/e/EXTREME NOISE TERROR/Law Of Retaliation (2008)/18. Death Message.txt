You! You and your fucking system
Based on fucking lies and indoctrination
For your own selfish gains

You! You who live in luxury and hunt down the underprivileged
By trying to ensure we canât be happy unless we follow your rules
You! You who try and enforce your fuck-up up self-opinionated rules, of do as youâre told or live a life of misery
Expecting us to work for fuck all, all to fund your extravagant all consuming lifestyles
Creating culture of knife and gun wielding backward, lowlife kids, patrolling our streets
You fucking scum, it has gone too far

You! And your society of greed that youâve created will, will always pick on the ones who never get a fair chance of a start in life, and anyone you find as easy meat
You! And your fucking shit system spending all our nationsâ resources on war and forcing us all into a life of crime and suicides
Let all those deaths be on your conscience
Fuck you all and see you in hell

Iâll live and die by my rules, not yours
Not fucking yours!!!
