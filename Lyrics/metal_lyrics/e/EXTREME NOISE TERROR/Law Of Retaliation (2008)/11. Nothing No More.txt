Like a rope around my neck
Hanging on every word
On my knees I chose to crawl
Bleeding myself dry

Tasting tears of pain
As skies begin to fall
Blind inside canât find a way
Lost and incomplete

Youâre nothing no more
Fallen from your grace
Youâre nothing no more
Fallen from your grace

Sedated on sweet lies
Naked and confused
How long should we tolerate, the destruction of our souls?

Youâre nothing no more
Fallen from your grace
Youâre nothing no more
Fallen from your grace
