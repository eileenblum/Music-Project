This anger burns deep, deep inside
Born of frustration, contempt &amp; disgust

The nature of your oppression
Is the aesthetic of our anger
The nature of your oppression
Is the aesthetic of our hate

Trapped in an existence you seal your own fate
You lifeâs an illusion, fuck up wage slaves

The nature of your oppression
Is the aesthetic of our anger
The nature of your oppression
Is the aesthetic of our hate

This anger burns deep, deep inside
Born of frustration, contempt &amp; disgust

The nature of your oppression
Is the aesthetic of our anger
The nature of your oppression
Is the aesthetic of our hate
