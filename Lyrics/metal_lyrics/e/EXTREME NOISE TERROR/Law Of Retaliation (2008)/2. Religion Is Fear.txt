Your hands drip with blood
Ferocity and despair
Your eternal war
How many more will die

Religion is fear
Chains and cages their game

How many people dead
In the shadow of the cross
You spew out your rules
I puke in your face

Religion is fear
Chains and cages their game

Stab the virgin
Virus of deprivation
In the order of Christ
The minister of death

Religion is fear
Chains and cages their game
