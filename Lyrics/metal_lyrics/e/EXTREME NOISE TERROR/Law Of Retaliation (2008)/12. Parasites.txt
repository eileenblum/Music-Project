Blindly hedonistic
With no thought of consequence
Like parasites we feed
A carnival of desires

Self obsessed with consumption
Feeding your corporate lies
Ravaging all resources
This world of genocide

A universe of discourse destroying what we create
A reckless arrogance, weâre living on borrowed time

Self obsessed with consumption
Feeding your corporate lies
Ravaging all resources
This world of genocide

Self obsessed with consumption
Feeding your corporate lies
Ravaging all resources
