[performed by Extreme Noise Terror]Grew up with punk, meant so much then
A way of life but you changed your mind again

Are you in this for life or just for today?
Are you in this for life or just to pose?

Hawkwind and acid, a new way of life at last
Fuck the present lets live in the past

Well weÂ´re just people looking for a way to end the hardships, the problems of today.
WeÂ´re still thinking the way we did then and we wonÂ´t sit back and watch it happen again
Our movement starts to splinter. Our dreams go out of range. Become another false product which can never bring change.

Reliving the past wonÂ´t right the wrongs
Instant relief at the toke of a bong.
