[performed by Extreme Noise Terror]Pulsating man made growths infest the bodies of laboratory animals
Force fed pain from birth til death, animals dying to be dead

Cruelty to carnivores
Not to animals
Fur ripped from the backs of baby seal, nerves and veins left hanging in shreds, skulls cracked open, brains exposed, left to rot but still alive.
Sick to death of lies, excuses and dumb pretence
If youÂ´re still eating meat now youÂ´re nothing more than a selfish, ignorant, uncaring shit.

Animals hung from rusty meat hooks. Thrown into cazed, chaotic fits, eyes gaping wide in total terror, as its guts spill out on to the floor
