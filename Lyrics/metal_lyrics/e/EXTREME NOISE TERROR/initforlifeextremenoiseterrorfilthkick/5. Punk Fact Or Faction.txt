[performed by Extreme Noise Terror]In the scene of so many factions and different outlooks on life
YouÂ´ll always get people who will stab you in the back

It doesnÂ´t matter who you are, what you say or what you do
YouÂ´ll always get people who will criticise you

Forget the backstabbing, build on the things that we agree
Lets work together for a more united scene
