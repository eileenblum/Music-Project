Your hands drip with blood ferocity and despair
Your eternal war
How many more will die
Religion is fear
Chains and cages their game
How many people dead in the shadow of the cross
You spew out your rules 
I puke in your face
Stab the virgin
Virus of deprivation
In the order of Christ the minister of death
