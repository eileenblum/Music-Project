Mentally imprisoned by our own moral walls
Built so high thereâs no way out
No allowance for other peopleâs thoughts and speech
So much we can learn and so much to teach

Moralâ¦ bondage!!!

Too many lifestyles, opinion and views
Itâs so hard to understand the complexities of life
If we could rid ourselves of our moral bondage
Then perhaps we could start to hope for a change

Moralâ¦ bondage!!!

Mentally imprisoned by our own moral walls
Built so high thereâs no way out
No allowance for other peopleâs thoughts and speech
So much we can learn and so much to teach

Moralâ¦ bondage!!!
