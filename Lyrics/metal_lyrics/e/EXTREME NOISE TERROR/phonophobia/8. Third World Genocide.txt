People are starving when thereâs no need 
Food is wasted yet thereâs mouths to feed 
Spend more money on third world nations 
And end all world starvation. 

Redirect the finances and feed the poor 
Stop spending money on weapons of war. 

We could clothe and house those in need 
People not profit end all the greed.
