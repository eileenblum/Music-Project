Grain is needed to feed the starving
But used to make meat for those who can afford to pay

The world is running out of land and water
But the production of meat is a more important cause

It is a fact that one calorie of beef demands ten calories of grain.
From the one hundred &amp; forty five million tons of grain &amp; soy
Fed to livestock only twenty one million tons of meat &amp; by products are used.
The waste is one hundred &amp; twenty four million tons per year &amp;
With a value of twenty billion US dollars it has been estimated
That this sum could feed, clothe &amp; house the whole worldâs population for one year!
Just you think about it now!

All this waste, pain and suffering
For the greedy majority who just donât care
