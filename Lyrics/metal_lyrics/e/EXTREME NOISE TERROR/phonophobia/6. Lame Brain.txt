My eyes can see but my mind wonât believe
This continuous changing in order to deceive

Lame brain, wandering sheep
So scared of being alone

My eyes can see but my mind wonât believe
This continuous changing in order to deceive
An uncontrollable urge to follow the trend
To blend in with the in-crowd donât want to offend

Lame brain, wandering sheep
So scared of being alone
