You hide your feelings as you deceive yourself
In the game of competition you must add to your wealth

Competition, ambition, money and greed
Is this what you really want?

Greedy morals have changed you now you fit
A mortgage, responsibilities, youâre knee deep in shit

Competition, ambition, money and greed
Is this what you really want?

Youâll work yourself to death to gain success
Getting deeper and deeper no way out of this mess

Competition, ambition, money and greed
Is this what you really want?
