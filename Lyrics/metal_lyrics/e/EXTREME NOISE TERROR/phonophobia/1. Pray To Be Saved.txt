Brainwashed madmen, thoughts of afterlife
Brandishing words of a false paradise

Pray to, pray to be saved
See the light get off your knees

Closet minded morals, naivety, deceit
Putting down others for their disbelief

Pray to, pray to be saved
See the light get off your knees

[Solo]

Crusading for God, conjured up scam
Religious con-men bible in hand

Pray to, pray to be saved
See the light get off your knees
