Your life is a stagnant pool of shit 
And if you don't want to drown 
Then you have to eat it... 
From birth to death 
You're conned through life 
Is living your life a waste of time? (No) 
And if you chose to swallow their shit 
It will poison you so much 
You'll wish you had drowned at birth
