Refuse admission of defeat
A constant grind to find the truth
In vast deceit
Dogma burns like acid in mouth
With a non belief for insipid creed

Contort against a world of deceit
Values based on immutable falsity
Bleed, confusion bleeding, you dry
Breeding hatred inside

With agony, realisation tears at me
Contempt, contempt for a wretched life
Desolate place uncertain, unblessed
Where you burn

Awake, drag yourself off your knees
Stand your ground
Find the truth you fail to see
Predate your thoughts of the past
Cant regain, the fabrication crashes down

Reborn shed your skin
Cast it to the flames and not a qualm
It served you well
Carnage, the prophecy, it will come come
And with sweeping change it must precede
