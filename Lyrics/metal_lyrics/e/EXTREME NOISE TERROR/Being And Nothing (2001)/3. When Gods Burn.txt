Run before me, with terror in your eyes
Cowering in your corner, pathetic waste of life

Run...

For I am the violence, you alone despise
And I will be the sword that cleaves
The flesh of lies

You stand alone
Innocence laid to waste
You will burn with me
Left in your disgrace

Poisoned by hate there's an axe to grind
Twisted you burn as the anger returns
