You die, by my hand and nothing else
Nothing left to say

Ferociously I tear at you
Flowing blood
No mercy as you cry and beg
No remorse
And I'd like to read your thoughts
As you draw your last breath
To feel that truth with pain and fear

Erase all memories of your life
You will have never been

I'll blind you to your deity
Crush your faith and hope
For it is all you have

Pleasure in such foul torture
Searing flesh
Violate the ones you love
Before your eyes
Take a knife and gouge them out
Nerves incised
Revenge is all that's driving me as its all I have
