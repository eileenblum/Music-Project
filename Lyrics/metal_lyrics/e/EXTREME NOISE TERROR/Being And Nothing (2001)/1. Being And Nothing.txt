A dead end void, puerile existence
Killing time, ambitions now just a vacant urge

Soul desecration
Content to just dream
Lost aspirations
Buried in the past

Empty inside, devoid reality
Staid to stagnate
Sinking fast in the sands of time

Unborn, aims, buried in the
Sands of time

Forsaken, the existence of mind
Malevolent thoughts bring demise

Can you feel it turn to hate

Life defiled with convulsing rage
Nightmare scenes still breed inside

Mind over mayhem
Beneath a mask you hollow inside
Mind over mayhem
Racked with guilt you view this life
