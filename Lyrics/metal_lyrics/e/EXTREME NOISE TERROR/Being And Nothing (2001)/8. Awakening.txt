Working your fingers to the bone
For what rewards
What have I ever received
Watching worthless fools
Clinging to my wake
But not for long

Far too many years of this life
You have been the cancerous side
For now is time to cut you out
To sever these bonds my only thought

Reborn-renamed

Pale existence built on lies
Realisation, routine torn from me
Becoming the fury through what I see
More and more, we're told when to breathe
Told how we've failed in our lives
Never known a life without rules
So now do you realise
Can you see the truth

Nameless - They gain
Heartless - They gain
Faceless - They gain
Unstoppable, unleashed violence

The systems machines crusing you down
The future is yours
How long has it been since freedom
So many promises broken
Smothered from within by these rules
Join me in hell
