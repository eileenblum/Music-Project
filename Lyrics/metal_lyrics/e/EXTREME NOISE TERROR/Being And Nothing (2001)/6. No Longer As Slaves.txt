We stand, against all odds we thrive
The time has come for change
For nows the time we take whats ours

No longer apathy

Year of believing, in this web of lies
Betrayed by the power that we gave
Our loyalty

Force fed, broken glass of hate
Exact the pain on weaker sides

Brainwashed, beaten into moulds
Become what I always have despised

Generations no longer born as slaves

The scars of years we bear run deep
We cast our future to its fate
If forsaken, we shall burn with pride
