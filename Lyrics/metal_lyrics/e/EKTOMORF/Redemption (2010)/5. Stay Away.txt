wake up this morning and I feel like shit
it's all because of you so thanks for that
yesterday night I saw your real face
yeah you got the right to leave
and its better that way

so fuck you go away
never come back again
I don't wanna see your face
stay away

you have your way
to fuck me up
you drive me insane
you make me numb
I can't do anything
what the fuck do you want
I changed my whole life
but it wasn't enough

so fuck you go away
never come back again
I don't wanna see your face
stay away

love and hate you know
I feel both for you
this was your chance
but you missed it so fuck you

that was it now it's really the end
it's hard to believe but there is nothing left
I can't live anymore in this fucked up shit
no love, no hate, no fucking regret

so fuck you go away
never come back again
I don't wanna see your face
stay away
