[feat. Danko Jones]

[Danko Jones]
You wanna bring down
Storm me and take it all
[ZoltÃ¡n Farkas]
I don't care for you fucking lies
Leave me alone! Live your life!
[Danko Jones]
Get the fuck outta my way
Show some respect and stay away
[ZoltÃ¡n Farkas]
Don't pretend I know your face
Leave me alone before it's too late

[Chorus]
[Danko Jones]
You can hate me but you'll never break me
I'm the fire, I'm the one
This is my life, this is my way
You can't break me. I'm the one.
[Danko Jones &amp; ZoltÃ¡n Farkas]
You can hate me but you'll never break me
I'm the fire, I'm the one
This is my life, this is my way
You can't break me. I'm the one.
[ZoltÃ¡n Farkas]
I'm the one! Take it or leave it! Fuck off.
I'm the one! Take it or leave it! Fuck off!

[Danko Jones]
You can trust me
I always get what I want
[ZoltÃ¡n Farkas]
You cannot stop me
I believe no matter what
[Danko Jones]
I'm the number one enemy
I'm the top of your jelousy
[ZoltÃ¡n Farkas]
Here I am. What you gonna do?
You're just a piece shit. Fuck you!

[Chorus]
[Danko Jones]
You can hate me but you'll never break me
I'm the fire, I'm the one
This is my life, this is my way
You can't break me. I'm the one.
[Danko Jones &amp; ZoltÃ¡n Farkas]
You can hate me but you'll never break me
I'm the fire, I'm the one
This is my life, this is my way
You can't break me. I'm the one.
[ZoltÃ¡n Farkas]
I'm the one! Take it or leave it! Fuck off.
I'm the one! Take it or leave it! Fuck off!

[Danko Jones]
'Cause I live my life the way I want to
Truth and lies - There's a lot I've been thru.
Sacrifice - Too many things in my life.
So 'cmon muthafucka - Bring it!
Arrrgggg!

[ZoltÃ¡n Farkas]
You can't bring me down
You can't break my spirit
You can't bring me down
You can't break my spiri.. Arrrgggg!
No!

[Chorus]
[Danko Jones]
You can hate me but you'll never break me
I'm the fire, I'm the one
This is my life, this is my way
You can't break me. I'm the one.
[Danko Jones &amp; ZoltÃ¡n Farkas]
You can hate me but you'll never break me
I'm the fire, I'm the one
This is my life, this is my way
You can't break me. I'm the one.
[ZoltÃ¡n Farkas]
I'm the one. Take it or leave it.
I'm the one. Take it or leave it.
I'm the one! Fuck off!
