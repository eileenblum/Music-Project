what if I take you
tonight to a place
I show you some shadows
unreal fucking fear

there is a haunted house
touched by the hand of death
I'm living a nightmare
it's all in my head

never should, never should...
I never should have set it off

come on open the door
breathe in what you feel
be one with the fog
and you will see what I see

welcome to my prison
do you wanna stay?
well I'm sick of this shit hole
help me to escape

I never should, Never should...

burn the house
burn this fucking house down
