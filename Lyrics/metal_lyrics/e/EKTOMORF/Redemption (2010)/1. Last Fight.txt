I am ... you make me sick
My life is a nightmare,
This is my turn and I will win
My fuel my hate
I'm strong enough to face you
I know who you are
You took to much of my life
I kill you
last fight

I Was alone my whole life
but I always made it
Now I'm tired of all your lies,
fuck you I will not take it
I'm strong enough to face you
I know who you are
You took to much of my life

I kill you
last fight

I was week and I let you
lead me to a world, a world where I don't belong
No i'm not your slave and I know you fake, so fuck off
It's been along fucking time that ruined my life now it's enough
You won all my hate there's no escape, I bring you down
