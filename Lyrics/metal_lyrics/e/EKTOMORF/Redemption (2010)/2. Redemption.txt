REDEMPTION
REDEMPTION
REDEMPTION
REDEMPTION

for all those who gose through the pain
the pain makes you a hopeless slave
those who get close to lost everyday
in their heart nothing else
only hate

REDEMPTION
REDEMPTION
REDEMPTION
REDEMPTION

stuck in the swamp addiction and fear
suffocate from all to hear and see
it drags you down it makes you numb
take you to the edge
makes you fuck up

REDEMPTION
REDEMPTION

its time for change
its time for life
leave all the self destructive shit behind
take the chance before its to late

REDEMPTION
REDEMPTION
REDEMPTION
REDEMPTION

FREE YOURSELF
