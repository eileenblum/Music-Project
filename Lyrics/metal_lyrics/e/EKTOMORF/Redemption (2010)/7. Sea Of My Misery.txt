[Verse:]
You drive me crazy
You kill me solemn

[Chorus:]
I find myself,
In this Hell,
I can't stop Bleeding
Im drowning in the sea of my misery

[Verse:]
You Lead me to heaven
You let me fall, Make me Suffer

[Chorus:]
I find myself,
In this Hell,
I can't stop Bleeding
Im drowning in the sea of my misery

I Hate your Lies
You took my life
I can't stop bleeding
Im Drowning in the sea of my misery
