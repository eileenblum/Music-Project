I
Don`t need the word
Don`t need the writing
Don`t need the advice
`Cos there`s no friend behind it

I
Don`t need your money
Don`t need you either
You are dead to me
Get out you worm

I
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Fuck yourself

I
Don`t need understanding
Don`t need to be pitted
Don`t need t he lawning
And I don`t need forgiveness

You don`t have to beg me
You don`t have to threaten me
I don`t fear you
I know you already

I
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need

Don`t need
Don`t need
Fuck yourself

I
Don`t need, from you I don`t need
Don`t need from you I don`t need
Don`t need, from you I don`t need
I don`t need anything from you

I
Don`t need the sanctuary
Don`t need your lies
Don`t need your lights
You will be succumbed

I
Don`t need the light
Don`t need the money
Don`t need the fame
Don`t need the hope

No
No
No
Not from you
No
No
No
Not from you

I
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Don`t need
Fuck yourself
