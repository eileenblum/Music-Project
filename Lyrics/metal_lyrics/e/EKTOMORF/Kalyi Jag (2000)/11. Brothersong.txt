I don`t care
What the trend is, what is in fashion
But I listen to music and watch you

Feel the power what I give you
Let it be your blood and scream it with me
Listen this is the brother song

The brother song
The brother song
The brother song

Step among us
So you belong to us and if you hear this song
You won`t be alone, where ever you are

We accept you, it doesn`t matter who you are
There are no borders and no fucking rules
Listen this is the brother song

The brother song
The brother song
The brother song

We break up the barbed wire
The guitar the drums destroy together
We smash the filth to pieces

Enough of them, patience is gone
Listen ans scream
Here we, are playing really loud
We want so see you are with us too
We defeat everything, no obstacles
Just pure strength this is the only rule

Listen
And scream
Listen this is the brother song

The brother song
The brother song
The brother song
Listen this is the brother song
