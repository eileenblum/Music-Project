look at my eyes, look at my skin
in which I was born, in which I'm livin'
look at my soul, look at my blood
they make me survive 'cause life is hard

Rise!
Blood in blood

look at me, look at yourself
the shame of every nation os
the world's segregation
I look at the sky, I look at myself
My father's and my mother's blood
United in me!

Never deny yourself
My mind is my mind, only mine, 
my soul is my soul, only mine, 
no enemy could take it, 'cause it's mine!
