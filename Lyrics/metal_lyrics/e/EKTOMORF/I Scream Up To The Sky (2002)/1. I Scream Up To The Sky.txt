I scream up to the sky
that I've not cracked under
I have a pure mind
with hate and rage in my blood

I scream up to the sky
let me know what's coming now
Why is this sentence?
You killed someone innocent

Devla, listen to the sinner's prayer!

I scream up to the sky
listen to my prayer
My prayer is my fate
I want you to listen and suffer

I scream up to the sky
Don't punish him for my sin!
I scream up to the sky
I want to suffer for my sin!

Do you hear me?
