This things around me
Makes me sick
Fizikly -- mentally
I'm going down inside
It feels like I always end up here
No matter what I do
It's never good enough
So I just want to

Escape
From this fucking place
Escape
I don't wanna see your face
Escape
I fucking hate this now
There is nothing and no one can make me stay
They say
Time heals everything
But my scars won't bleeding
The only thing l feel is hate

I changed
I never be the same again
My heart went to black
No matter want they do
I just want to

Escape
From this fucking place
Escape
I don't wanna see your face
Escape
I fucking hate this now
There is nothing and no one can make me stay

I don't belong in this place
I don't belong to no one
I'm free

Escape
From this fucking place
Escape
I don't wanna see your face
Escape
I fucking hate this now
There is nothing and no one can make me stay
