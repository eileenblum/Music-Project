My lines are blurry and you're gone
Your words still ringing in my head, on and on
Every day I'm closer, closer to the end
I need somebody to hold my hand

You said you're never gonna leave me
You said you'd always be there for me
And I scream for you to help me
Can you hear me?
Save me [x4]

I feel so empty, no one cares for me
Life endless and suffering, that's all I see
How could you leave me, leave me in this hell?
To be with me now, that's all I ask

You said you're never gonna leave me
You said you'd always be there for me
And I scream for you to help me
Can you hear me?
Save me [x4]
