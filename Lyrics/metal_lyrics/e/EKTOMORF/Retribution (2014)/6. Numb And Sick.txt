Beg for this, and my head for lies.
I got weak from your fucking lies.
It's the same thing, it's the same way, nothing every change.
I am free, I will break my chains.

Can't you stay away from me?
How can you steal the air I breathe?
Don't let you back, still want it to be.
You're making me always sick.

No love, no trust, no weakness anymore. [2x]

I can't hold, you rape me now.
I can't fight, my strength is gone.
I don't want you, I don't need you.
Leave me the fuck alone.
I don't belong to you no more.

Can't you stay away from me?
How can you steal the air I breathe?
Don't let you back, still want it to be.
You're making me always sick.

No love, no trust, no weakness anymore. [2x]
I know your face, you make me hate you. [4x]
I hate you. [3x]
I FUCKING HATE YOU !!!

Can't you stay away from me?
How can you steal the air I breathe?
Don't let you back, still want it to be.
You're making me always sick.

No love, no trust, no weakness anymore. [2x]
