Get up from your knees and stand up for your life
They want to bring you down get up and fight

Face
Your fear

You feel your weakness and it makes you paralyzed
You are lost and hope less I can see it in your eyes

Face
Your fear

There is no one but yourself who can make this end
There is no other way, there is no help

Face
Your fear

Open your eyes and see
It's all in your mind they are not real
Look them straight in the eyes
You are stronger -- kill'em all
Now
Kill'em all now

Face
Your fear
