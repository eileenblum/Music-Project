This life without you
We had no time
You where too early gone

The love I feel for you
Is stuck inside in my heart
And I fade away

When you left me I could not cry
Now I'm here and you on the other side
I can't fly on broken wings
I can't walk through
When you left me I could not cry
Now I'm here and you on the other side
I can't fly on broken wings
I can't walk through on this collapsed bridge

I miss you so much
I hear the angels cry
Through the night

I never forgive myself
That I lost you
And that I could not say goodbye

When you left me I could not cry
Now I'm here and you on the other side
I can't fly on broken wings
I can't walk through
When you left me I could not cry
Now I'm here and you on the other side
I can't fly on broken wings
I can't walk through on this collapsed bridge

I can't walk through on this collapsed bridge

When you left me I could not cry
Now I'm here and you on the other side
I can't fly on broken wings
I can't walk through
When you left me I could not cry
Now I'm here and you on the other side
I can't fly on broken wings
I can't walk through on this collapsed bridge
