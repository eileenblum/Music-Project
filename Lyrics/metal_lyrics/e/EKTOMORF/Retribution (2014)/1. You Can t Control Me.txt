When I see your face when I see your face
My rage start to burn
Now is then time, the time
For you to learn
I'm free from you
And all my hate breaks out

You can't control me

You took what is mine
And I take it back
The way you lie
It's so fucking bad
I'm free from you
And all my hate breaks out

You can't control me

I
Won't
Do
What you
Tell me

You can't control me
When I see your face when I see your face
My rage start to burn
Now is then time, the time
For you to learn
I'm free from you
And all my hate breaks out

You can't control me

You took what is mine
And I take it back
The way you lie
It's so fucking bad
I'm free from you
And all my hate breaks out

You can't control me

I
Won't
Do
What you
Tell me

You can't control me
