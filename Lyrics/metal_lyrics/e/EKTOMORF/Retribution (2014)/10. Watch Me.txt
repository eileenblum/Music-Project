You are so jealous
You are so weak
You can't stand that
What I have

You talk so much shit
But you never do anything
This is your way to live

Get the fuck out
Back the fuck up
Get the fuck out

Frustration you feel
Decision you make
Fuck yourself

Watch me

I don't need you
I know my way
I know how to live
You don't know nothing
About life
You are a fucking dick

Get the fuck out
Back the fuck up
Get the fuck out

Frustration you feel
Decision you make
Fuck your self

Watch me

Why don't you get a life
Of your own
In stead of criticizing
It's not my fault
That you are miserable
And always lost
But you
Never sacrificed
And that's your cross
