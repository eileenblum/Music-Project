We are the voice of the voiceless
The fire of your soul
We burn in hell and in heaven
But we won't take anymore

It's burning
It's glowing
Souls of fire
Souls of fire

This is the way that we live
The way that we fight forever
We have faith and strength
And they cant stop us no never

It's burning
It's glowing
Souls of fire
Souls of fire

Start the fire
Now
Souls of Fire
