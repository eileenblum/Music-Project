This time I don't need your answer
This time I don't want you to stay
Something's lost
Something died to day

I don't know why I had to meet you
Why I met somebody like you
I was there for you
But I won't be there again

You can pretend to be strong
But I know that you're not
Take a look in the mirror
That's you
Lost and destroyed

You keep saying I can trust you
But I see in your eyes you lie
I don't want
I don't need this in my life

Your weakness comes before your clear mind
You can't stand up when you fall
I give no more
I leave you behind

You can pretend to be strong
But I know that you're not
Take a look in the mirror
That's you
Lost and destroyed

Don't ask me to give you strength from my soul
When you are too weak to fight

Don't ask me to ever stand up for you
When you let me down

Don't ask me to trust and believe in you
When you are fake and you lie

Don't ask me to follow you and your dreams
Cause you don't follow mine

You can pretend to be strong
But I know that you're not
Take a look in the mirror
That's you
Lost and destroyed
