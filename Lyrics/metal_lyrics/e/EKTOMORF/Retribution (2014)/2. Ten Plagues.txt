Ten plagues
This is the time to die
Ten plagues

See the ocean it turns red
The sky bleeds death we all go straight to hell
Why can't we change
Why can I we change

Ten plagues
This is the time to die
Ten plagues

The sun is gone darkness fall
We sweat the fear of our selfish heart
Bleed from your eyes
Bleed from your eyes

Ten plagues
This is the time to die
Ten plagues

The end is near and the world is blind
Ten plagues will come and we will die

The smell of death is every where
Mud rain will kill us and no one can help
Pray for your life
Pray for your life

Ten plagues
This is the time to die
Ten plagues
