I look back on my life
The pain won't go away
I fight it but it is so strong
And you can't help me
No
My scars won't stop bleeding
I need to find my way
Break down those walls around me
To be my self again

Tell me if this is real
Tell me what you feel
My soul wait and burns
Whisper me the word

My trust was los I
And buried in their lies
They killed the better me
I have nothing left inside

Tell me if this is real
Tell me what you feel
My soul wait and burns
Whisper me the word

Whisper the word
That I can believe in
I will believe in you
Whisper the word
And I will believe forever
Forever and ever

Don't lie

Tell me if this is real
Tell me what you feel
My soul wait and burns
Whisper me the word
