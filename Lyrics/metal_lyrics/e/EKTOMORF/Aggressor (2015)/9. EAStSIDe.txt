Live in the future less future
This life taste bitter
The politics promise
But nothing gets better
The rich get more
The poor get nothing got no life
Corruption â criminals
There's no place to hide

It's hopeless

This family
Lost everything they had
The father saw no way out
So he killed them and himself
The banks are Nazis
They don't give a fuck
They're worse than a leech
They take everything you got

Children cry
The devil smile
What a fucked up life
Live on the eastside

She's begging on the street
For money to get something to eat
She lost her kids her life
She lost the will to fight
Now she lives on the street
She has no family
The system doesn't care
This life is just isn't fair

Children cry
The devil smile
What a fucked up life
Live on the eastside
