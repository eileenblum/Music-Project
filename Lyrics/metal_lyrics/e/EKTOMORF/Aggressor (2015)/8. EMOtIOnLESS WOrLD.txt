I see the world and the people burning out
Faith sold for money and money becomes god
Nobody cares if the other lives or dies
Sadness falling from the empty grey sky

I can feel the pain is real
You could try how it feels
Time just passing
In this emotionless world

One man got everything but never have enough
The other got nothing and already gave up
And in meantime the leaders play the game
Don't matter who wins cause it will always be the same

I can feel the pain is real
You could try how it feels
Time just passing
In this emotionless world
