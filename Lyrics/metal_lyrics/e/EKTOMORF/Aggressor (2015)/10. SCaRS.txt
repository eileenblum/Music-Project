No one told me how
How to live this through
The plague after the storm
The dreams were never true

Scars bleeding on my soul
Amplifying my hate
I will never be the same again

I changed to something else
I know I'm not myself
I become a monster
It's all because of them

Scars bleeding on my soul
Amplifying my hate
I will never be the same again

Take my scars up
I will like it
Feel my anger
I won't stop it

Scars bleeding on my soul
Amplifying my hate
I will never be the same again
