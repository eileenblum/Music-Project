No you never were the one for me
You enjoyed when I was suffering
No you never were the one for me
You wanted to control me
No you never were the one for me
You never believed in me
No you never were the one for me
You denied and betrayed me

No you're not for me
I'm not for you
No you're not for me
I'm not for you

No you never were the one for me
When I needed you you were not there for me
No you never were the one for me
I trusted you and you stole from me
No you never were the one for me
I followed you and you left me
No you never were the one for me
You won't be spoiled by destiny

No you're not for me
I'm not for you
No you're not for me
I'm not for you

No you never was the one for you
I know you do so I lied to you too
No you never was the one for you
You could never see me through
No you never was the one for you
I fucked you up I destroyed you
No you never was the one for you
You watch me rise and it will kill you

No you're not for me
I'm not for you
No you're not for me
I'm not for you
