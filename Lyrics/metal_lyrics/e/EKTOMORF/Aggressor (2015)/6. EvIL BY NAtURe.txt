[feat. George "Corpsegrinder" Fisher]Hate runs through your veins
Insanity in the unspoken word
Deaf from the screams of the devil
Hungry for blood, hungry for death

Darkness growing in your heart
Passion and agony tears you apart
Watch the shadows dancing
Ready to kill, ready to kill

Devoted to your lord
Breathe the world he says
The signs are in the wall
On your knees you pray

Evil by nature

Follow the path of death
Violent instinct drives you mad
Drunk from the taste of blood
You take her life, you take her life

With a knife you start the horror
Cold, wicked like never before
Leave this world behind
No way back, no way back

Devoted to your lord
Breathe the world he says
The signs are in the wall
On your knees you pray

Evil by nature

Suicide is your shelter
The way you want to hide
Weakness is stronger than you
You're just too weak to die
Her blood is your body
Her heart is in your hand
Evil is in your nature
Stays forever in your head
