No you can't get more
Fuck you
No you can't get more

With all your energy
You just think about me
I know you go crazy
From your jealousy
I drives you mad
That you can have what I have
Your soul is empty
You have nothing left

No you can't get more
Fuck you
No you can't get more

Deep down inside
I know you're proud of me
But your fucked up pride
Makes you so clod and weak
All this bullshit you do
I don't understand
Why can't you just be happy
With the life that you have

You take but never give, shame on you
It makes me sick all this shit you do

This is life you can't be more
Stop this contention you lose this way

You're a clown a piece of shit
Fuck you go to hell
I can't stand your face
Your words fuel my hate

No you can't get more
Fuck you
No you can't get more
