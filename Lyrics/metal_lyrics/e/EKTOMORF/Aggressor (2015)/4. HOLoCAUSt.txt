It was the time hell on earth blood and fire
They segregated all of them with barbed wire
Racist domination, humiliation, deportation
Raised the flag of hate unleash the horror to kill a nation

Never forget, never forgive
That was the holocaust

Extermination the camps of death six million victims
A uniformed monster the angel of death the apocalypse
Gas chambers of Auschwitz cremation mass murder
Fear factory they killed the people with desire

Never forget, never forgive
That was the holocaust
