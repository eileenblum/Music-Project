No I will not change
Why would I change
This is my life the way I want to live
I don't need rules
I don't need chains
No one owns me

I'm strong
I'm true
I know my way
I don't need you

No

No no compromise
No fucking lies
I don't care what they think about me
My life is hard
My life is war
Endless fighting

I'm strong
I'm true
I know my way
I don't need you

No

I believe in God and me
I'm what I want to be
My life is wild and free
I destroy my enemies

No I say no
I don't care
What's gonna happen
When I tell you no
I don't feel shame
Who hates my name
I face you all

I'm strong
I'm true
I know my way
I don't need you

No
