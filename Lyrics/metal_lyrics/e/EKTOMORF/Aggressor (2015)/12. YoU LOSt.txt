Yeah you criticize everything and everyone
You are perfect you are the one
You try to play your fucking games
And you blame me when you fall
Yeah you wish you could be strong like me
You are useless you are weak
There was the time I trusted you
You took it to granted fuck you

I don't need you in my life
I don't need your fucking lies
Regret it all this is your cross
Fuck your games I win you lost

Yeah I was wrong that you were true
I believed and followed you
Your fake emotions tricked me well
You stabbed me in my back
I was stupid to do your work
You used me you fucking jerk
Now we are here in the end
You want to ask me to forgive

I don't need you in my life
I don't need your fucking lies
Regret it all this is your cross
Fuck your games I win you lost

I'm not your friend
I don't forget

I don't need you in my life
I don't need your fucking lies
Regret it all this is your cross
Fuck your games I win you lost
