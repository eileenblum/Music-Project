I feel the pressure and I tell you
We are repressed there are too many rules
Open your eyes and see what's going on
They want to control us there's no freedom

Damned nation

I know the people lose their patience
They have nothing left no future no shelter
Criminal violence and chaos is rising
No one helps the world is dying

Damned nation

Don't let them take away your life
Raise your fist don't give up the fight

Damned nation
