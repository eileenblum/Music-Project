What i feel is pain
So much fucked up fear
And i know it's not real

I will stand on my ground
Nothing, no one brings me down
I fight for what i believe
I will love and live

I will stand on my ground
Nothing, no one brings me down
I fight for what i believe
I will love and live

There is so much
Motherfuckin' thoughts
They wanna make my
Make my head explode
But love will win this war

I will stand on my ground
Nothing, no one brings me down
I fight for what i believe
I will love and live

I will stand on my ground
Nothing, no one brings me down
I fight for what i believe
I will love and live

There is so much inside
I give you all
There is so much inside
I give you all
