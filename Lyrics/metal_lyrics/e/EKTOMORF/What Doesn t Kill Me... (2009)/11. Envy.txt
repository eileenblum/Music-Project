You give me physical pain
With the words you say
Just to see your face
Why don't you fuck of and leave

See all this ruined
What the fuck are you doing?
Is this all what you get!
Destroy &amp; regret ...

I don't want another conversation
Had enough of your fucking competition
No more- you reach the edge
Go-Go fuck yourself

Envy
Envy
Envy
Envy

You have no life
So you wanna take mine
But you never will be
What you cannot be

Look at me now you fuckin looser
Feel the anger feel the power
You were always fake
You make me hate

Envy
Envy
Envy
Envy
