It's all about your life
It's all about your lies
It's all about the pain
It's time
Now you are gonna pay
Fuck you

It's all about the time
The time you stole from my life
The hate you built up in me
Here it comes now you gonna feel it

I told you everything
Nothing left
I gave you everything
Nothing left

Nothing left
Nothing left
Nothing left
Nothing left

It's all about your life
It's all about your lies
It's all about the game
No more you can't fuckin' play

I told you everything
Nothing left
I gave you everything
Nothing left
