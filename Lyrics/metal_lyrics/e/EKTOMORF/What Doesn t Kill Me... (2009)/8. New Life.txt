I feel no fear and I see
Beautiful life and it's all mine
Pain and past I forget that
Open my heart and I live

Feel no guilt no more tears
I paid the price had enough now
The sun it rises bright up the dark
I got the strength for a new life

New Life
New Life

All around same and dust
I breathe in pain and sorrow
Slowly kills me through my skin
Swim in my blood makes me hollow

No I don't I won't get stuck
In the trap of my pride
I take the chance I take your hand
And I live my new life

New Life
New Life

No fear
No hate
No suffering
No pain
