The flame to set the fire on
The strength for change to go on
To kill the hate turn in to love
Believe, head up, never go down

With you on my side
I found sweet life
and in don't ask for anything more

Cause
I got it all
All
All
I got it all
Cause
I got it all
All
All
I got it all

Walk the line no fear no more
No pride no past no fucked up thoughts
I feel the change it takes me high
I feel so good i feel alive

With you on my side
I found sweet life
and in don't ask for anything more

Cause
I got it all
All
All
I got it all
Cause
I got it all
All
All
I got it all
