In this fucked up world
To stay alive
I have to stand up
For my life
There come the motherfuckers
All around
There come the motherfuckers
I Beat them down

I breed the fire
I breed - i breed the fire

In this fucked up world
I know what's right!
I know i just got
I just got one life
There come the motherfuckers
All around
There come the motherfuckers
I Beat them down

I breed the fire
I breed - i breed the fire

Set the world on fire
