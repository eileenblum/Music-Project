Can't take it anymore
Can't take no more
Feel stucked
Feel the same
Agony torture and hate
Fucked up deep down
Feels like there is not way out

Pain in the soul
Pain in the mind
Bitter taste in the mouth
Bitter taste of the life
They give
You take
Never ending fucked up game
They leave
You stay
All is left but nothing's the same

You
just go ahead and do
Never ever be the fool
Don't be their tool
You follow your heart
And be free
No matter what they do
It's up to you!

They always find you
When you alone
Hopeless
Helpless
You are the perfect target
Breath in
Breath out
They're here to take you down

You
just go ahead and do
Never ever be the fool
Don't be their tool
You follow your heart
And be free
No matter what they do
It's up to you!

Why you believe what they say
Look they want to see you fail
Who said you can never be free
Fight live your life with no fear

You
just go ahead and do
Never ever be the fool
Don't be their tool
You follow your heart
And be free
No matter what they do
It's up to you!
