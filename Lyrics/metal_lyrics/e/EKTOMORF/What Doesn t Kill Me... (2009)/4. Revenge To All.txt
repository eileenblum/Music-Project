Just when i thought it was over
Then it's back again
Hits me much more stronger
Punch me in my face
Fuck

From those i thought they never could
No way for that they never would
It's fucked up hurts more than anything
That whom the most i trusted
They're my worst enemy

No more trust
Time will come
Revenge to all

They don't know what i lived through
There is nothing more that i can do
I leave behind all the parasites
They see me rise
I watch them cry

No more trust
Time will come
Revenge to all

Revenge to all
Revenge with fall
To all
On all
