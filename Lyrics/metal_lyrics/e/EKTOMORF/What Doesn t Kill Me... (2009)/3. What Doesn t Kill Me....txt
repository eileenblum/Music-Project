Jealousy, envy, hypocrisy
Weak motherfucker
Why don't you face me
Lies, hate, pretend
Fucked up pride
You're going down
And i rise

What doesn't kill me
Makes me stronger

Depression, pain, agony
This is what you breathe
This is what you give
Delusion, anger, emptiness
You want to see me fail
You want to see me bleed

What doesn't kill me
Makes me stronger

That's right

Disgrace, suffer, loneliness
What goes around
Comes around
Faith, love, fire
Always go ahead
I believe in that
This is what I'm

Stronger than all
Stronger than all

What doesn't kill me
Makes me stronger
