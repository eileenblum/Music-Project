It was the first
I truly trusted in
Now it's the worst that I
Really hate
I can't understand why
People are so fake
But I know they will never
Change

Too many lies so much pain
I face reality
My rage is rising I can't
Deny it.

I scream it out
I scream it out

Who can I trust
Who can I trust
Who can I trust
Oh god
Who can I trust

I suffer it's a part of the
World it's a part of my life

But what I can't expect is
Suffer from the hate what
I feel inside

Time is short burning fast
I try to find some forgiveness
My hate is rising I can't deny it

I scream it out
I scream it out

Who can I trust
Who can I trust
Who can I trust
Oh god
Who can I trust
