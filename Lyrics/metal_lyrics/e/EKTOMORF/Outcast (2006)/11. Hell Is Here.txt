Frustration all around
Fear is marching on
Religions kill the fate
Diseases take victims
Soldiers on the street
They come to destroy
The peace
Racism in the air
We're breathing pure hate
Pride -- prejudice
Hypocrite politics
Suicide terrorists
Police -- violence
Killing innocents
Nuclear warfare
Chaos -- disorder

In god
We trust
Look around
Hell is here
Hell is here

The rich get more money
The poor in poverty
Humans create a war
Water comes and kills us all
Fake leaders -- blind believers
The end is near
Armageddon is here
Pride -- prejudice
Hypocrite politics
Suicide terrorists
Police -- violence
Killing innocents
Nuclear warfare
Chaos -- disorder

In god
We trust
Look around
Hell is here

Hell is here
