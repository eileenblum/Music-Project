They want me to fall
And give up
I feel no pain
I had enough
They can't come close to me
Not anymore
They cannot defeat me
Not anymore

I confront my enemy
I confront my enemy
I confront my enemy
I confront my enemy

The want me to make me
Feel like shit
I face them all cause I can't
Take this...
They cannot defeat me
Not anymore

I confront my enemy
I confront my enemy
I confront my enemy
I confront my enemy

Destroy them all
