Now is the time to make a
Revolution
Go ahead together unite in
One young nation
God gives the power the
Power to hold on
Our heart is burning in
Flames of freedom

Rise
We rise
We rise
We rise

Now we are together
Through all kind of trouble
We are together and
Stronger than ever
Our enemy is ignorance and envy
But we'll fight till
Our victory

Rise
We rise
We rise
We rise

Fuck disrespect, fuck racism
Fuck jealousy, fuck ignorance
Fuck prejudice, fuck envy
Fuck disrespect, fuck racism
Fuck jealousy, fuck ignorance
Fuck prejudice, fuck envy

Fuck

Rise
We rise
We rise
We rise

And for those who never
Believed in us
And for those who always
Want to keep us down
We're gonna show them the
Fire of the gypsy blood
And it burns
Rise like the sun
