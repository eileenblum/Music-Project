I feel the power of the rage
You cannot close me in your cage

You cannot hurt me anymore
I'm ready for the war

I know I'm not alone
Everyday I feel your soul
I know you feel the same

When they speak our name

My life it's only mine
You call me outcast

You even give me power
Your hate will make me stronger

Outcast I'm outcast
Outcast I'm outcast

I feel the power of the rage
You cannot close me in your cage

You cannot hurt me anymore
I'm ready for the war

I know I'm not alone
Everyday I feel your soul
I know you feel the same
When they speak our name
