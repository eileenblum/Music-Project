Two thousand soldiers
Hate and anger
Violent -- brutality
Racist shit

Segregation
Discrimination
Is not a life
They wanna survive

Ambush in the night
Ambush in the night

Woman cries
Her child has died
Revenge and rage
Endless pain

Rebel
Hunger
One hopeless nation
Lives in the ghettos of poverty

Ambush in the night
Ambush in the night
Ambush in the night
Ambush in the night

They gonna rise
They gonna rise
They gonna rise

From the pain
