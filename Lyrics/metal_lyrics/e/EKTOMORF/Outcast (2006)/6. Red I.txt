I grew up in the world that
Does not give a fuck about me

I grew up in the full of
Prejudice and ignorance

Hate all around based on the
Color of the human skin

Red I
Red I
Red I
Red I

I grew up in the world that
Does not give a fuck about
Peace

I grew up in the world that is
Evil and self-destructive

This world only wanna see
Colors black and white

This world don't wanna look
Inside only outside

Red I
Red I
Red I
Red I

One world see the freedom
Flame

No hate -- no prejudice
We're all the same
