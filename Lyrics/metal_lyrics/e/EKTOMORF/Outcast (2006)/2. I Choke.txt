I feel so fucked up here...
I feel I cannot breath

Poisoned society
Will kill me legally

Inside my lungs my heart
Infected from this life

I choke
I choke
I cannot breath
I choke
I choke

Disgrace and poverty
All around surround me

Disgusting empty life
Makes me an outcast

Inside my lungs my heart
Infected from this life

I choke
I choke
I cannot breath
I choke
I choke

Breath
Breath
Breath
Breath

I want to breathe
I want to breathe
I want to breathe
I choke

I choke
I choke
I cannot breath
I choke
I choke
I choke from this life
