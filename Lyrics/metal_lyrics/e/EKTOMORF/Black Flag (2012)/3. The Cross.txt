This is my cross
And I can't change it this mine
I got strength
To live with
All my mistakes and demons
I try so hard to reÂ­fuse and avoid
The chance to fall
I hate this now my weakness
It takes me to the edge

It multiplies in my blood
I can't control it anymore

I
I stay alive
I will be stronÂ­ger
Bring me the torture
I
I stay alive
When I bare the cross
I
I stay alive
I will be stronÂ­ger
I
I stay alive
When I bare the cross

I take it back
This is mine and I won't sacrifice
All my life for something to someone
Who lives on lies
I have my cross to bear to bear through my life
This is the dark side the unknown the curse I have inside

It mulÂ­tiplies in my blood
I can't control it anyÂ­more

Sweet darkness
TemptaÂ­tion
I can't refuse
The Cross
Can't you realize it?
That I'm suffocating from you
You made my life a fucking hell
