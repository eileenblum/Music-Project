Black flag
We raise the black flag
Black flag
We raise our black flag
Black flag
We raise the black flag
Black flag

We are we are the oppressed
We ask you questions but no one answers
Our bitterness it turns to hatred
Cause we can't take it... we won't take it
AnyÂ­more

Mystification that will not help us
We under pressure to much pressure
Humilation on your nation
Our sorrow brings revolution

You gotta stay alert
You gotta stay alert

You put the rope around your neck
You shoot poison in our existence
Why won't you hear us
Why won't help us
Why you deny us
Why you refuse us
