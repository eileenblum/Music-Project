I see faces
Faces of my past life
I dig in my soul to let my hatred arise
The sky turns to grey
God is show me the way
And I
Follow
War is my way

I hear voices
Echoes of my everÂ­lasting strife
The sound of
War was always a part of my life
The sun is burning red
It lights up my war path
And I
Follow
War is my way

Loose it all and save your soul
Hear my voice and fight for your hope
You not alone
You not alone

This is the time to make them suffer
This is the time to make them suffer
War is survival
War is reÂ­demption
War is my answer
War is my way

The sky turns to grey
God is show me the way
And I
Follow
War is my way
