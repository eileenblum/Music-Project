Live a life like this
Is not so much fun
I told you more than a thousand times
To slow down cause you just fuck it up

But I make my own decision
And I know how and what I want
I don't need you to stick around
Leave me the fuck alone

You
Just
Make me feel like this

You really can't understand... do you?
You make so much trouble
Be your toy I'm not that kind
And if you think that way you're very wrong

Cause I make my own decision
And I know how and what I want
I don't need you to stick around
Leave me the fuck alone

I feel like this
Feel like me

The sun goes down
I feel cold
Silence comes
Now it's done

You make me feel like this
