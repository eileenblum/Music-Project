Rape and shaming
Abuse and torture
Bloodthirsty anger
Mayhem and murder

Who do you think you are
You have the right to kill some
Useless law and human rights
That's no justice you must die

Kill you
Kill you and burn your body
Kill you and burn

Court and jail
Is that all you get?
I just can't be â live it
This makes me mad

You killed that girl you took her life
How can you live with this in your mind
Her family is in endless grief
That's no justice you must die

You can say you sick
That' no excuse you must die
Face her family
You took their Life you must die
Die!
