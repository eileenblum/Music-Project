I know your kind leave me alone
Your smile is infected by your rotten thoughts
Don't you feed me with your two faced lies
I'm the shade of your fear and I kill you toÂ­night

Enemy
Enemy
Enemy
You are my enemy

Your miserable life will never be free
You'll be dragged down by our own joulesy
This is my life you won't take it from me
You come around you are my worst enemy

Enemy
Enemy
EneÂ­my

Here comes the pain
