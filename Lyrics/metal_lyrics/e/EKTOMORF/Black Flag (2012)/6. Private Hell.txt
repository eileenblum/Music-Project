I'm cold and empty
I feel it under my skin
My heart beats faster
On the rhytm of hate

I can't see and hear you
I can't underÂ­stand you
Nothing really matters
Any more

I'm there
In my private hell
And no way back
You can't save me from that
All my trust and love burns in this hell
I can't save it
All my life will burn in this fire

I'm unaffected
By your love and tenderness
Irritation burÂ­ning rage
Is what I feel
Don't try to change me
This is a big part of me
My hell is
Created by this world

I can't stop this
I won't stop this
