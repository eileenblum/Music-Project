You black mail your own blood
You're scared but you're proud
You force them to sacrifice
On the altar of love

And you are
Really
Satisfied
When they
Throw away their life

You destroy everything no matter what
You are the enemy of your own blood
Sick love

You cry for their empathy
To make them feel guilty
To give up their whole life
To love you eternally

You drug them
With your lies
They can't see
You lock them
In your cage
They can't leave

Sick love
Is your redemption
Sick love
Is their damnation
