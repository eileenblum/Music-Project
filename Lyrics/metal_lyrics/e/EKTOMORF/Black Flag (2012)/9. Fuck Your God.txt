So I'm your friend
I'm your best buddy
That's what you say

But through your god eyes
I'm just piece of fucking
Shit

Is that really you
So what you want
You changed so much
Fuck your god

You say I'm evil
And I bring shame
On the holy ghost

Before you criticize
Just take a look
In the mirror

What did you say
What did you say
Liar
What did you say

What did you say
Fucker
