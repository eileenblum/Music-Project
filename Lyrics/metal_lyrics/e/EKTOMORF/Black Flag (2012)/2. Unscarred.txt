I still feel a lot of pain
And it's eats me up every day
How did I trust how did I believe
In every word you said in everything you faked
Go and fuck yourself you mother fucker looser
I wanna see you cry, struggling and suffer
All your intrigues worked very fucking good
This is the end I win and you loose

You can't ignore me
You can't forget me
The more you try the more you get hurt
You can't despise me
You can't' deny me
The more you try the more you GET hurt

No you can't win this fight
I'm unscarred
No you will
Never win this fight no never I'm unscarred

I was search for peace of mind
Instead of that pure I found
All the tears I shed all the blood I sweat
Is just a waste of time and I just realize
You just don't give a fuck about my life
You never cared that I always was on your side
Why should I give when you just take
Trust in you was a big fucking mistake

I'm your endless pain
You are your own decay

And I see you going down
Everything you had is lost

No you can't win this fight
I'm unscarred
No you will never win this fight
No never I'm unscarred
Unscarred
UnscarÂ­red
