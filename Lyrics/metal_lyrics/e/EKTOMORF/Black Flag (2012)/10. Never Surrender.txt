My heart
My blood
My fist
My soul

Look into my eyes
I'm ready for the war
I will make you feel the pain I feel
This is the fight you can't escape
You can't win

All my hate is flowing trough my veins
I break you down
You can't hide
You better realize

No I never surrender
Adrenalin rise it makes me high
You can't hold me back let's start the fight
I wanna liberate all my fucking rage
I look into your eyes
And I can taste your fear

I close my eyes and I breath slow
Make you feel the pain I feel
This is the fight you can't escape
You can't win

All my hate is flowing trough my veins
I break you down
You can't hide
You better realize

No I never surrender
Adrenalin rise it makes me high
You can't hold me back let's start the fight
I wanna liberate all my fucking rage
I look into your eyes
And I can taste your fear

I close my eyes and I breath slow
I have no far I control it all
I need no weapons I have my fists
My mind is clear I'm ready to kill

Concentration
Comfrontation

No I never surrender
