[Soundgarden Cover]

You wired me awake
And hit me with a hand of broken nails
You tied my lead and pulled my chain
To watch my blood begin to boil

But I'm gonna breakâ
I'm gonna break myâ
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run

Too cold to start a fire
I'm burning diesel, burning dinosaurs' bones
I'll take the river down to still water
And ride a pack of dogs

I'm gonna breakâ
I'm gonna break myâ
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run

When the forest burns along the road
Like God's eyes in my headlights
When the dogs are looking
For their bones
And it's raining ice picks
On your steel shore

I'm gonna breakâ
I'm gonna break myâ
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
