You're born like this
You live like this
Raise your voice
And show your fists

You're born like this
You live like this
Stand up for your right
Go, fight for your life

You're born like this
You live like this
Feel the power
Get stronger

You're born like this
You live like this
Raise your voice
And show your fists

Show your fists
You're born like this
You live like this
Freedom fighter
With primal instinct

You're born like this
You live like this
Without brains
Without fear

You're born like this
You live like this
No matter what they do
No matter what they say

You're born like this
You live like this
No one can stand anymore
In your way
