All in my life I walked on my own way
I never followed rules or trends
I left behind all the hypocrites
I as never pretending

Look at me
I am free

No one can tell me
What is good for me
Couse only I know what I fell inside
I believe in my dream
I know my destination
I don't need promises

Look at me
I am free

Go ahead
Don't look back
Fuck the rest
Go ahead

I follow my heart until the end
Survive this world
This is the only way
I believe in my dreams
I believe in god
I walk on my own way, follow my heart
