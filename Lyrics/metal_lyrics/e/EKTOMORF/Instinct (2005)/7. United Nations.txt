Skin colour, racism and prejudice
This world will never change
The roots of the hate to deep in our lives
And we have to much pain

I see it

I was born for what I was born
And you can't bring me down
I don't believe in your society
I only believe in god

I feel it

I see discrimination in the United Nations
