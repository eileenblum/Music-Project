It's the land of the hate
The frustration is growing
I loose control, no hope
Our father in heaven look at me
See the pain, see the suffer
I can't take this anymore

Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free

Human race it's a disgrace
Arrogant, fucking fake
No respect, no regret, no shame
Our father in heaven
Look at me, see my pain
Don't let me feel this hate

Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
