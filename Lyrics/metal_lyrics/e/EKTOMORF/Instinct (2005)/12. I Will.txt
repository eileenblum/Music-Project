I will break the walls
I will move the rocks
I am here to stay
Till my dying day

In every way you try to stop me
Explain me where I have to stay of go
But my life is something what you
Will never take away or control

Blame me, hate me
Tell me what the fuck you want from me
Hate me, chain me
Do what you ever want
I am free

I will break the walls
I will move the rocks
I am here to stay
Till my dying day

Many years with so much pain
I fight, I don't give up
The fire burning in my vains
And pumping in my heart

Blame me, hate me
Tell me what the fuck you want from me
Hate me, chain me
Do what you ever want
I am free

I will break walls
I will move rocks
I am here to stay
Till my dying day
