It's always the same
You will never change
You come around
And you take what you want
I'm sick of you
I show you my fire

I'll burn you

You promise this
You promise that
You lie to everyone
Motherfucker hypocrite
I'm sick of you
I show you my fire

I'll burn you

Now listen to me
And look straight in my eyes
Stay away from me
Get out of my life
I'm sick of you
I show you my fire

I'll burn you

Burn!!
