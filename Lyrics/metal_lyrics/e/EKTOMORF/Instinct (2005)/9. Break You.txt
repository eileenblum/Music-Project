Don't fuck with me
I'm sick of all your shit
You make me mad and it is all your fault

You say you are my friend
And now you leave me in shit
What the fuck you thing
Who the fuck are you

I bring the pain
I make you bleed
I destroy it all
I break you down

You talk shit about me
You talk behind my back
Here I am, tell me face to face

Why don't you go away
Never come back again
I'm sick of you
I hate you

I bring the pain
I make you bleed
I destroy it all
I break you down

Not anymore you can lie to me
My eyes are open I can see
My anger is rising I am full of hate
This felling is too much I can't take
I ï¿½ break ï¿½ you

You cut my vains with all your lies
My respect for you it dies
You motherfucker you are not a man
I spit in your eyes when I see you again

I ï¿½ break ï¿½ you
