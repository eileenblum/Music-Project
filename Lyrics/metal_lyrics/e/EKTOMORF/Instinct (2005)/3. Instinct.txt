I am who I am
Walk on my own way
Follow my instinct

I am the target of your jealousy
I am the one who you just wanna be
Look, look in the mirror, what you see
You full of shit why can't you see

I am the target of your anger
I am the one who you call danger
I am the one who believe in destiny
You motherfucker I am your enemy
Your worse enemy

I am who I am
Walk on my own way
Follow my instinct

I am the target of your jealousy
I am the one who you just wanna be
I am the one who believe in destiny
You motherfucker I am your enemy

I am who I am
Walk on my own way
Follow my instinct

You just wanna be
You're full of shit
You just wanna be
You're fucking envy

You just wanna be
