I watch the sky and it's turning to grey
My emotions are like a storm deep inside me
I don't want to feel, but it's so fucking real
This shit is back again and it's killing me

I want to tell you, but I can not explain
In my words selfish, uncontrollable rage
I feel the fear, I feel the hate
And I feel I am going insane

Look at me, I hit the bottom
I'm out of my mind, I lose the control
Give me something, the pain is killing me
You are my shelter, you are my shelter

I'm going through changes, I don't understand
It came from nothing and now I feel it everywhere
I'm in secure, I'm going down
I feel so lonely in this deep and dark hole

Give me your hand, I need your help
Even if I hurt you, please try to forgive me
Now I'm not myself, now I'm someone else
Show me the way, I want to come back

Look at me, I hit the bottom
I'm out of my mind, I lose control
Give me something, the pain is killing me
You are my shelter, you are my shelter
