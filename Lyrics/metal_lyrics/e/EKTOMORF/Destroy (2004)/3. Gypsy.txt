When I was a child
I still did not know
Why they looked at me like I'm shit

When I was a kid
I started to recognize
Why they made faces
Like I'm disgusting

When I was in love
They said to me so much bullshit
But they never said the right

When I was a worker
They want to see me broken
And it made me so hard

It's me
Gypsy

When I was a friend
Than I got fake smiles
'cause they were never honest

When I was in trouble
There were no more brothers
Yeah they leave me in shit

Now I am a man
I don't deny myself
No I don't feel shame

I am on the stage
Now I show you my rage
Now I show you my fists!

It's me
Gypsy
HERE I GO MOTHERFUCKERS
