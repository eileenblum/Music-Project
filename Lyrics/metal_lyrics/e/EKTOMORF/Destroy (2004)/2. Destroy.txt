Nice, very nice
That's what I see outside
I can smell this shit
I smell the life
It's rotten inside

Lie, fucking lie
There's no respect, there's no life
They want me to be a fake
On their fake way
They want me to buy

I have my right, I have my life
I have a strength for the fight
I'm sick of them, I don't want more
Destroy!

Why, I ask why?
The people don't care the people so blind
Most of them want just money
Hypocrite world
The future is dark

Now, here and now
I destroy the walls, watch me, I'm free
They can fuck all their shit
I'm free, this is my life

I have my right, I have my life
I have a strength for the fight
I'm sick of them, I don't want more
Destroy!
