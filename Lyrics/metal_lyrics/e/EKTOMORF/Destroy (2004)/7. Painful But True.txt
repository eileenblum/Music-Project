I say no true friendship
I say no
'cause everybody want just the fucking money
I hate this world

Painful but true
Painful but true
Painful but true
Painful but true

Here comes the pain!
Here comes my rage!

I say no true friendship
I say no
'cause everybody want just the fucking money
I hate this world

I say no more trust
No anymore
I'm sick and tired from the disappointment
So I say no more

Painful but true
Painful but true
Painful but true
Painful but true

Here comes the pain!
Here comes my rage!
