Now I'm far from everything
Now I'm far from nothing
Now I'm far from me
Now I'm far from you

Now I don't feel hate
Now I only blame
I only blame myself
'cause I followed you everywhere

You're a piece of shit
You don't know the shame
But one day motherfucker you will get back everything

You exploited my helplessness
You exploited my weekness
You exploited my love
You exploited my trust

Now we are in the end
Now we are face to face
In your eyes so much hate
Because you fucking afraid

You're piece of shit
You don't know the shame
But one day motherfucker
You will get back everything
