Blood
Filth
Corruption

Poverty
No solution

Can you see?
Can you see?

It comes around

Stress
Depression

Rage
Pain
Self-destruction

Can you see?
Can you see?

It comes around

Hard work every day for nothing
Other people get easily everything
I'm not envy, I'm just angry
I am angry
I am fucking angry!

Tear apart
Tear apart

Hard work every day for nothing
Other people get easily everything
I'm not envy, I'm just angry
I am angry
I am fucking angry

Tear apart
Tear apart
Inside
