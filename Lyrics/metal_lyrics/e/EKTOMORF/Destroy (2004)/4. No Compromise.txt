Here I am
With thousand bleeding wounds
From the life

Here I am
You never believed in me
But now this is my time

I don't play your game
I know my way
This is my life
No compromise

Here comes the time
The hurricane of my fate

With strength and anger
Break down all the negative shit

I don't play your game
I know my way
This is my life
NO COMPROMISE
