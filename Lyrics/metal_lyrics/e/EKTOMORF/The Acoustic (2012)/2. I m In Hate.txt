it's getting hard to breath
my blood runs cold
the air I breathe is you when I choke
destroy everything see you fucking bleed
it's all I want
you killed my fate

I'm in Hate
I'm in Hate

I know I will not stop
you know I can't
it's burning in my heart
it tears me apart
you don't understand
you don't understand
what I feel
cause I'm lost
lost in my head

I'm in Hate
I'm in Hate
