I been down this road
Not so long ago
But now I'm weak and down
I can't do this anymore

Time is passing but nothing
And no one change
I was really hoping for the better
But every one just stay the same

But the pain get stronger
The tears are getting bitter
How can I believe in something
When it always makes me hurt
When it always makes me hurt...

[Refrain:]
Look in to my eyes
I know who I'm
Even if it takes a thousand years
I will find my home again
Just look in to my eyes
You know who I'm
Cause even if it takes forever
I'll find my home again
I'll find my home again
I'll find it again...

Life is a storm
And love is supposed to be the shelter
I felt I found my safe place
But it was just a mistake
And now here I am
Lost my faith in all...
There is not so much left inside
And I don't care at all...

It feels like forever
It's incurable pain
Why it happened to me
Maybe is has to be this way
It just has to be this way

[Refrain]
