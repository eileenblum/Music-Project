Today I just realized
All I believed was based on lies
Yes it hurts to know its true
I know it hurts you too
But now it's done
Yes it's done

There was a time when I would do
I would do anything for you
Give the best all I have
Follow a dream until the end
But it was lies
Full of lies

[Refrain:]
Let my heart to be free
And I'll touch the sky
And leave this all behind
And be free

My heart was captured by your shine
I was so blind I don't know why
It's too late to blame you
And I wish it was not true
But it's true
Yes it's you

I learned my lesson after all
Never trust never fall
I live my life this way
Cause I don't want more pain
No more pain
No more pain

[Refrain]
