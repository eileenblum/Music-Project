I remember the first day I saw you
Girl you stole my heart that day
And I remember that day I whispered
I whispered in your ear that you are an Angel
There was a storm
A wild summer storm
And you were standing there alone
I brought a drink you were so sweet
I never forget that day
It was fate

I remember the first kiss we had
The sweet taste of your cherry lips
And I remember your shiny brown eyes
We watched the stars and you were crying
I had you and you had me
There was nothing to miss
We chose a star we called it love star
I never forget that day
It was fate
