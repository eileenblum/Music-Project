This is my darkest hour now
I never did this before
But I..I Face All my demons here
Will I make it through the night

I can feel the pain it grows
and I lose the will to fight
no one cares IÂ´m so alone
will make it through the night

Give me more pain I take it
Give me more hate I make it
IÂ´m Stigmatized
IÂ´m Stigmatized

I just want to fall asleep
and dream
That everything is all right
But my through the night

I donÂ´t wanna feel anymore
This is time to say Good bye
Ishould leave this all behind
will I make it throuth the night

Give me more pain I take it
Give me more hate I make it
IÂ´m Stigmatized
IÂ´m Stigmatized

IÂ´m your pain
You are my faults
IÂ´m Regret
You are my god
IÂ´m tears
You are my fears
IÂ´m your eyes

You always blame me start to hate me
You canÂ´t stop fucking around
Why donÂ´t you talk to me
And tell me waht you feel inside
I lost my trust in you
Because you lied to me
Waht do you want from me
Waht do you want from me

IÂ´m Stigmatized
IÂ´m Stigmatized
IÂ´m Stigmatized
IÂ´m Stigmatized

EverythingÂ´s so fucked up now
And the mess you left behind
But I will make you hurt
And IÂ´ll make it through the night
