Like Sunset you're coming down
and you're takin' my light away
Like a Prayer
your name is gonna be the last
I say before I sleep
like the strongest pain
you flowing through my veins
And I just
Lay and lay
My scars bleed and burn
To smoulder

Like the fog you're coming down
And you blind me with your lies
Like a believer I followed you to your temple
To sacrifice
Like the strongest hate
you flowing through my veins
And I just
Lay and lay
My scars bleed and burn
To smoulder

I let you go and I am free
I let you go and I am free
I let you go and I am free

Lay and lay
My scars bleed and burn
To smoulder
