Everlasting the love and strength you give
Unscared the faith and power you have
I never saw you down, I never saw you weak
That's how you are
It can be anything, it can be anyone
You face it all

I see the world through your eyes
I see the world through your eyes

You grew up on the way you had to fight for all
But you always stand your ground and break through all the walls
Respect and endless faith fight for what you believe
That's what you are
There is so much pain, suffering, hate and blame
You face it all

I see the world through your eyes
I see the world through your eyes

When life get hard I think of you
No matter what you guide me through
Your blood, your soul, your love, your words
Give me the strength to face the world
To face the world

I see the world through your eyes
I see the world through your eyes
