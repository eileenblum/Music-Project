I see the world and it's full of hate
Around me hypocrites and I know them
They want to take away my emotions
But I resist
I will destroy them

I know them

Great future, safe life, money, abundance
They promise everything but it's bullshit
I'm not a motherfucker ignorant
I will strike
I will fight

They cannot take my life
The cannot stop me
The cannot take my rights
NEVER!

The cannot control me
The cannot change me
The cannot repress me
NO!
NEVER!

I know them

I go ahead never never turn back
Live your fucking life and give me respect
I have my life and it's only mine
I will strike
I will fight

I know them
