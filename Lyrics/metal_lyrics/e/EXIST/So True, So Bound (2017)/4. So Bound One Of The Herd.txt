Gold
Imitation's flattery
Blinds you
Know my purity and be set free
Judge me as my uniform is
Back home, in the trash
Lit that shit on fire I was sick of your
Bullshit
Combat boots and camo pants
Hipster plaid, fashion headphones
All the same intent

So don't forget to
Sound like that bold archetype
That paved your path
Stray and risk the slap of rejection's cold wrath
Another clone to bask
In the shadow of something greater
Than you could ever be
Because the game is comprised by rules
Of another's hand

Here in the crimson wars
So apathetic I'm no longer bleeding
Tonight I'll hold the sapphire
High above the crowd in red
I'll test their eyes
And wonder, will the world just pass me by?
Twenty neck-beard test
The strength of steel while I
Cut ore in half with my diamond, redefine
The language in spirit of icon's minds
Whose rituals I defy

Defiant
Your archetype's sources hide below

A light across the line
Sure sign of what's harnessed inside
A soul's infinite tide

I fall in other's eyes
Against the grain that hopes to bind
A heart's true song with question and doubt

Defiant
My archetype's sources hide below
When they carved their own paths
Today's clichÃ©s were their own stamps
Bitch about it
Denounce those as they dare to fly
'Cause you've catalogued "true"
"True" is what's comfortable to you

A light across the line
Sure sign of what's harnessed inside
A soul's infinite tide
Out of sight and mind

A fall in other's eyes
Now ask yourself, should I just lie?
Step on my heart's song?
Just play it safe this time?

Imitate
Bold statue high up in our hive
Poster child's inception began before time
Like never did they chance
Hostile looks
From malleable dipshit's first glance
Keep your cult membership first rate
Miss the point of what made your icon great

Here in the crimson wars
So apathetic I'm no longer bleeding
Tonight I'll hold the sapphire
High above the crowd in red
I'll test their eyes
And wonder, will the world just pass me by?
Twenty neck-beard test
The strength of steel while I
Cut ore in half with my diamond, redefine
The language in spirit of icon's minds
Whose rituals I defy
