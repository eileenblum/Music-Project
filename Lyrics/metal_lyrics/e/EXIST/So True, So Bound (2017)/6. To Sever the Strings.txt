Worn
Fake
Hollow
Allure withers away
Facade recedes
Brace for reality
Guilt's seize

Echoes afar reach my ear
Painting pictures
Clearing the haze around me
Too clear, too vivid
Their whispers reveal suggestions
To face the life I've ignored
Hidden enlightened signals
Expose the stage
And strings by which I'm played
So cold, so bitter
To see circumstance's rigor
Is what binds me

Grip
My
Chains
Tow
Until the hands
Let go

Having thought that my stake rested
On the will of those who found
Picked me up and put me to work
See the fault in my own cynicism's guise

A day's work breaking stone
And hauling dirt for the worth of merits
None my own
That each statue that I raise
Comes with an ominous price
As the hand playing strings that bind me
Were the hands dictating all the moves of my life

In this void
Empty space takes my view
As I sculpt and carve each day's output
Same old things made anew

The memories of doorways missed
I thought it wasn't my time
Do the hands playing strings that bind me
Only dictate my own free will
As they're mine?

No masters
Free from the hold
My will determines my strings
Take control

Echoes nigh pass as I'm
Feigning pictures
Leaving the haze around me
To yield to my
Strings the universe assigned
Warm inside, victimized
Hindered enlightened signals
Pleading, beckoning to be heard, I see
The sun gives way
Tonight, strings still attached, I say
"Tomorrow's a new day to cut them off"
As I said I would today

Worn
Fake
Hollow
Allure withering away
Facade decayed
Release
Grieve and replace
Clear the field
Erase
Tear the roots
Burn the dead earth
And sever my strings

When the surface is stripped clean
Once all the filth is gone
And we see that the reigns are in our own hands
Does the life that's left really change?
Or flourish?
Or stagnate at the base below fault's peaks?
Do we truly cut our strings?
Or hand them back for safety's ease?
