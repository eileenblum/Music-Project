(Oh icon divine, let your words be my guide so I need not my own)

Voyager of the earth and mind
Your love created mine
Never mind how you came to be
Your rules are all I need

It's true
So true
That I do
I intend to mirror you

Archetype, statue in our hive
You help us to define
Wrong and right
Black and white simplified
To cope, categorize

It's true
So true
That the world is much easier
When you sharpen the blurred lines
And you
Yes you
Show me where to stand when I'm confused
Your sounds are my truth
What's new?
More you
For me to replicate every day
Sharpen the blurred lines
Because this life is too three-dimensional to me
I know what I like and I need not dig deep
I denounce those who do 'cause I've catalogued "true"
'Cause I've catalogued "true"
