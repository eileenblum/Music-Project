We all play the game
Get ahead if you can
Heroes we praise
Shining armor, unstained
But here in the sky
You see me at an angle where my
Diamonds cover my guile

Shoot my face
Shoot my face
While I stand before places
And things you and I've never seen
My life story's my dream

While the world is my backdrop
Time stops
And my sketch is complete
Of the places I went
Just to show you I went there
Take my picture again

All the light in the world
All the wisdom and insight can't feed
My sick intrinsic need to become god

Should it matter if I lie?
If no one ever sees
The cost is only known to me

All the things that I've said
Be they noble and healing words
Elevate me to be loved, be revered
Take my picture again

Should it matter who I stab?
If I should cure disease
It justifies my friends as my own casualties

Selling all the truth I spit at the cost of living it
Selling flowers that I've picked
All the ones I've never sniffed
Should I tell the audience that the Earth was flat
They'd believe
'Cause here in the sky
Only I can see

Shoot my face
Shoot my face
Shoot my picture the way I direct you
To help me be free from reality

Here in the sky
We project to you
Strong abdomens while we suck it all in

Up where the clouds
Obscure things I don't want you to see
My life story you read is my dream
Save or fuck the whole world just to win
Take my picture again
