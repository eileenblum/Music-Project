Awake the next day
Replaying words that were said in vain
Bold is to night as shame to day
You understood
And for the eve I was banter king

So now in the light
Preconceived visions of what I'd like
My perfect form resides in mind
Things so innate in myself hinder survival

Rise and shine
I can't see your fault's peaks
Far too high

Just two inches too short
Life given to training
Still pales next to someone strong
Withering and dull in daytime
Intention aside we were born as we are
Withering and dull in daytime
Sun sets
No soul watch as I fly

I am covered in ice
A ceiling, which for my life
I've tried to breach the surface
Yet just scaled its horizon

I fight a struggle like
A circle expanding wide
Its radius is perfect
And though it spreads so certain
It won't become a sphere

Awake the next day
Replaying words that were said in vain
Bold is to night as shame to day
Now in the light
Preconceived visions show what I'd like
My perfect form resides in mind
Mind only

Tread lightly, subconsciously, carefully
Things innate in me hinder survival
Pretend I can
Rise and shine
Blinders block faults sky high
My shade, forever

Withering and dull in daytime
Sun sets
No soul watch as I fly

Rise and shine
I can't see my fault's peaks
Too high to climb
I'll lament myself instead
And pray one day maybe I can change
Although I won't
