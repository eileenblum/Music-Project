Window wide open
Breeze touches my shoulder
Should I climb through it and see what's awaiting me?
Oh, what's awaiting me now?
Some distracted life
Where my pain subsides
You and I forever free from time to float and wander

Feeling these feelings of life on a treadmill
If just to turn it off
See what's awaiting me
Leave what's frustrating me now
Places I've not seen
Faces from my dreams
Happiness in possibility
Unwritten, free

Oh, I'm so tired of this race
See the height of the walls of my cage
Bars that I built so I'd feel safe
To protect this tired life that I hate
Maybe one day the truth that I fear
Will unmask itself and I will be
In some careless life
Where my pain subsides
You and I forever free from need and time
We'll run to find
Shade from my fire
