Veracity
My feelings launch logic missiles
Wage war on peers
Dig for fault in those of my own blood
You see things that you see and express to thee
Hang your paintings up
I'll find transparency
The world's what you make of it
I made you an enemy
Too close for comfort, too similar
My jealousy prevails

Branch of my father tree
How I loathe your leaves' prosperity
And I confess, should they die?
Condolences, but I might not mind

Veracity
Indifference ain't enough for me
Peek in your window and I don't like things I see
Judge integrity, when I could just look away
Create your weakness so my ego rules supreme
You know things
That you know from the walk you've walked
But your shoes don't fit me
I don't want to hear you talk

Branch of my father tree
How I loathe your leaves' prosperity
And I confess, should they die?
Condolences, but I might not mind
And though I see that they've grown big and strong
I can't help but notice
Their colors appear slightly wrong
They don't encroach me
Your well-being is just my misery

For every time I've watched you spitefully I pray
You could tell me "touchÃ©"
Take me seriously

"TouchÃ©"
Walk by and look my way
Can I be your threat?
Maybe your envy?
See me

Lynch that kid
Look at how he holds his pick
It's weird I don't like it
So noose on neck
Rip him to pieces on the Internet
Or at least just behind his back

All of the people in the distance
Doing things that I love in their own unique way
And I've got nothing now
So I'll make something of nothing now
My righteousness, my own veracity

As above
My supposed truth brands thee false
Rules I made ever-changing
So below
Watch where you stand as I might step on you
In fact, just hide because I'll try

All of the people in the distance
Doing things that I love in their own unique way
Branch of a common tree
Our similarities piss me off, oh so royally
Branch of my father tree
You like what I like
But you don't know how it's done right
My own veracity
Brother and enemy
Your presence is my misfortune
No matter the miles between us

Branch of a common tree
Brother and enemy
Branch of my father tree
Brother and enemy
