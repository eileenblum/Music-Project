Today my stake rests on my tomorrow's fate
All work, no play
Remember time is money

Get that cash and then what
Happily ever after for a week or so

Today my stake rests on my tomorrow's fate
All work, no play
Reveal my true ball and chain

Save the bitch and then what
Happily ever after for a week or so

I'm livid and living a life I despise
But if I start to prosper
Then I could be loving my time
Save the princess
Cross the finish line

Each journey's a means to an end
Reach each destination to find
There's no end in sight

Time is money, time I trade
And with time, time and time again I will gain
Satisfied the pain in my back
But now there's an itch on my leg
Oh, the universe such a horrible place
You can never win
I can't wait 'til I go to heaven
So I can be bored as fuck
And reminisce life's journeys that I loved
The highs propelled by lows so low, I rose above
I reared my head for every time I fell
Unknowingly

And there goes my life and my stake
Tomorrow, it never came
So all work, no play
Time's price is a mystery
And you have less every new next day

I'm livid and living a life I despise
As I prosper, more problems arise
More gold, less time
Princess is nagging
Grass less green than advertised
It's hell past the finish line
