The memory lingers, the melody haunting.
Sweetened caress, your body flaunted.
Only my dreams, only my flawed mind.
Will bring you to me. I gazed upon wonder.
I tasted your fruit, nectar of the purest form.
Divinioty absolute. I am here desolate.
You were to be mine... etrenally mine.
Your love torn from me. I am deceased.
No barriers to this worldy pain I suffer again and again.
Your beauty, wisdom, love... extingushed as am I.
Destroyed... deserted. Carried on unsure tides.
I have all time stretched before me. With no gods above.
Won't you hear my lament to a love lost.
A lament to my life soon to be lost.
