Each morn I sit and watch the waters, as your waves drift gently inwards.
The gentle breeze that brings your smile will caress my wayward spirit.
I hear your voice as you drift away on an everlasting tide.
The passing skies that reflect in shadows become distant lies.
Know me, see me as I am.
Hole me, embrace me in your arms.
Let me feel as the water raises higher...
Let me see as I understand at last.
Pull me down into the depths of your love...
And now I know as I understand at last.

I bring you my pain, again and again.
I see you now through glass made of rose.
I I bring you my pain, again and again.
I see you now through glass made of rose.

Your dreadful whispers I cannot hear, I cannot hear any longer.
I feel the dark engulfing tide as you sweep me away.
I hate your lies, your stinking heart...
I hate you with every breath.
My final clutch, my final gasp.
I'll leave you forever.

I bring you my pain again and again.
I see you now through glass made of rose.
I bring you my pain again and again.
I see you now through glass made of rose.

I hate your lies, your stinking heart...
I hate you with every breath.
My final clutch, my final gasp...
I'll leave you forever...
