Another beat of my dead heart
With no-one else to hear
Consume indifferent breath
My anger killed by hate
Life pushed open now
Far too blind to feel

Time can wait for me
Silent words that seem to hear
Time can wait for me
Promises complicity

Time can wait for me
In my complicity

As we fall so far together
Torn by what we've been
Will you pray forever
For your divinity
We cried in tune together
With lies from yesterday

Time can wait for me
Silent words that seem to hear
Time can wait for me
Promises complicity
