Seamless as it lingers
In a fractured lie
If it ends without pain
Will I feel deprived

Lie in wait for me
Keep it where it's safe
Lie in wait for me
End it all again

Tip of the box to suffer
Open nothing new
Tip of the box to suffer
Tell me to

Tip of the box to suffer
Open nothing new
Tip of the box to suffer
When you tell me to

Made it night together
Seemed more right that way
Sat there dreaming yet again
To see what you'd say

Lie in wait for me
Keep it where it's safe
Lie in wait for me
End it all again
