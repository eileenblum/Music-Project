As I turn away
From fragmented lives
I can feel an answer
In the clutch of lies
As I search so blindly
For what you call truth
I can feel an answer
Even though it's you

Silence me, needlessly
As I fall again
Silence me, needlessly
As I fall again
And we forget how I lied for you
What you promised me
And we forget how we came so close
When we lied so well
