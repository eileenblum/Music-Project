As I cradle what you told me to
Still defined by wounds that grow in you
Opened ashes bleeding as you die
I never felt besides, I only lied

Have I forgiven you, I forgiven you
Am I becoming you, I becoming you
Will I grieve for you, will I die for you
Have I forgiven, am I becoming you

Create a focus for my decline
...your drifting fine
I cannot bleed for you, I cannot cut your lines
Another... to push deeper as we die

Have I forgiven you, I forgiven you
Am I becoming you, I becoming you
Will I grieve for you, will I die for you
Have I forgiven, am I becoming you

You cannot touch me now
I cannot hurt you
Do you bleed with me
Do I grieve for you

Have I forgiven you, I forgiven you
Am I becoming you, I becoming you
Will I grieve for you, will I die for you
Have I forgiven, am I becoming you
