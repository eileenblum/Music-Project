Worship the corpse of a crucifix
Embrace the blood of your god
Enduring pain of an effigy
Inspired by our love

If I fall at your feet
Would you heal my wounds
If I saw you suffer
Would you die for me

Naked saviour promise solace
Take refuge in your flesh
Tragic king will you bleed with me
Forgiven your righteousness

If I fall at your feet
Would you heal my wounds
If I saw you suffer
Would you die for me
