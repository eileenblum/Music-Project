Speak again
Kill me even more
Will I hear you
When you're dead
As you move
So uncertainly
Need to feel
That you know
Still inside my head
Love that bleeds instead
Cut the words away
Still inside my head
Killing hate again
Cut the love away

If I seem to find the way
Belief enduring pain
Still beleive it's you
If I need the pain too long
Will I think it's really me
Start to die again
As I crumble at your voice
Will you finally beleive it
You nearly killed me
If I showed you my belief
Will you finally forgive it
You nearly killed me
