Suffer like you told me to
This blood sells well
Draped beneath a useless shroud
The misery pays well

Too many reasons to pretend
This pain is real
Too many words repeating words
Lines of lies again

Tear the face and eat the flesh that burns
Feel dead suffering
Tear the face and eat the flesh that burns
Feel dead suffering

Like kills the hate of innocence
That seemed so safe
Strips away the precious words
Destroys naieve despair

Suffer like you told me to
This blood sells well
Draped beneath a useless shroud
The misry pays well

Tear the face and eat the flesh that burns
Feel dead suffering
Tear the face and eat the flesh that burns
Feel dead suffering
