My conception
My life beginning as I bleed
Breathe in anger
Breathe the hatred as you need
Feel so empty
I watch another world collapse
As the other, it seems so real

The victim eternal with no other feelings
You wear your filth well as it drips
With your bleeding
Spilling your life and your filth
On your hands
Wash it away with the love your pretend
Tearing at meaning corrupting with healing
Drifting decline as it clutches for feeling
Spilling the life and your skin on your hands
Wash it away with the love you pretend

Bleeding the words as they crave for denial
You are holding my words
As they crave for denial
I am bleeding the words as they crave for denial
You are holding my words
As they bleed
They bleed for you
Spilling the blood I have made
And have shown for you
What does it mean if I offer my sins to you
Innocent to the end of this imposed tragedy
Broken wounds caught in my dreams
I gave up dying for my sins
Broken wounds caught in my dreams
I gave up dying for my sins
