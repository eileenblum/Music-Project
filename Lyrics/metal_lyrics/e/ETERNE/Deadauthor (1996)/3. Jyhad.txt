Watch with fascination
We slice old scars again
Bleached by love that dreams
Of passion
Of afterlife

Tear the flesh
Steal the scent of innocence
Conceive a lust
That betrays its ignorance
Make me die with you

If I die would it make you love me
If I live would it make you kill me
Make me die with you

And we stagger in our pain
Love and death and slagging jesus
But nothing said

Seems neverending
Feigning ignorance
Neverending
Eternal tedium
