Blinded eyes, like something you've never seen. The people have lost their vision. It seems as
though they are dead. Trapped by sin like chains that bind their souls. Their minds have lost
control. World of sin!
Take my hate away, replace it with the love of Christ, eat away at my anger. Take away my pain,
God forgive my iniquities, give me peace of mind.
They have lost direction. People of deception. Lost in cheap philosophies, tradition, and
demise. Cursed beast of Hell who controls the world, you will lose your grip on the unsaved.
Take my hate away, replace it with the love of Christ, eat away at my anger. Take away my pain.
God forgive my iniquities. Give me peace of mind.
Blinded eyes, like something you've never seen. The people have lost their vision. It seems as
though they are dead. It seems they are dead.
