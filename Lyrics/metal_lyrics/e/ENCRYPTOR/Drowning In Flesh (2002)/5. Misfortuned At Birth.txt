Death! Torture!
I have searched the ends of the World, trying to find my rewards. I cannot find what belongs to
me. It tears me apart from the inside. All my life I have dreamed of a great existence. Takes me
time to realize that this is just a wive's tale. 
No reassurance or revelation. Apathy takes my soul.
I return as a newborn soul. Wishes made, I have all I want. I will take all I deserve, sing my
praise to God. Misfortuned at Birth!
Misfortuned!
But I wake up and realize that this was a dream. I had forgotten my God. Now I must suffer. Oh,
suffering! Oh, more suffering! When will it end? When will I win? You don't understand me.
