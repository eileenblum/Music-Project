Drown in ignorance of sorrow. Fall in pits of disgrace. Crying in the darkness, desperate for a
savior. Cry out to the Son, open up your eyes, Mercy is yours, stop the lies.
Scholars worshipping the stars in the sky. Answering questions with lies.
Plagued by a false antichrist full of lies and deception. You will be undermined. News full of
death, choose the worst, show the world, and you'll see a broken promise.
Drowning. Drowning in Ignorance!
