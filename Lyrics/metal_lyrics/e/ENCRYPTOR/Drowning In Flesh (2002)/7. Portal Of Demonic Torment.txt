Feed the Spirit, fight the flesh. Worldly lust and worldly hate is here, Christ will conquer
all, he controls my mind. I am weak and feeling faint, burdens showing in my tired face. Christ
will make me rest, he guides my way.
There is a whole in my faith. Demons come in to torment. Spreading the message of hate,
burdening me with despair. Cutting me away from all that brings mel ife. Threatening to take
what I love. From this there will be no gain.
There is terror every day. Tearing, breaking in every way. This behavior spawns no life. I
opened the portal of demonic torment. Here I stay on my knees. Holding with me all this hate.
Holding with me all this pain, portal of demonic torment.
Portal, of, Demonic, Torment. Portal, of, Demonic, Death!
It's the door where demons come in to torment. Spreading the message of hate, burdening me with
despair. Until I call to my God, there will be sin. There is no escape. Until I call to my God,
there will be urge to sin. It is the portal's end. There is no escape!
