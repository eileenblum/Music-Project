YOU HAVE ARRIVED, AT LAST 
SO LONG I'VE BEEN WAITING 
FOR YOU 
MY COLD BLOOD BEGINS 
TO HEAT 
YOU HAVE ARRIVED, AT LAST 
SO LONG I'VE BEEN WAITING 
FOR YOU 
MY COLD BLOOD BEGINS 
TO HEAT 
MY DEEPEST DREAMS TO 
CARRY OUT 
DAYLIGHT REACHED THE END... 
DAYLIGHT REACHED THE END... 
YOU HAVE ARRIVED... 
YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT LAST 
SO LONG I'VE BEEN WAITING 
FOR YOU 
MY COLD BLOOD, MY COLD BLOOD, 
BEGINS TO HEAT, BEGINS TO HEAT... 
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE IS 
NEVER AN END, ALL YOUR LIFE 
DRIFTS BEFORE YOU, YOU KNOW 
YOUR TIME IS CLOSE AT HAND 
IT'S IN YOUR DREAMS 
THAT EVIL FACE THAT BRINGS 
YOU TO DESPAIR 
MOVE IN, TO THE FIRE 
SACRIFICE IS GOING ON 
AS EVENFALL STRIKES THE SKY
