TIME IS PASSING BY HOUR BY HOUR, 
BUT FAINTED SHE LIES NAKES ON THE 
FLOOR, COVERED WITH A BLACK 
SHROUD AND A CUP OF BLOOD 
ON THE LEFT, ON THE LEFT... 
FALLING PICTURES MOVING 
BETWEEN THE MEMORIES OF ALL 
THE MOMENTS WHERE WE FIND 
OURSELVES LOST INTO DARKNESS, DARKNESS... 
COLD BLOWS THE WIND ON 
WINGS OF DEATH FOR HER 
LAST BREATH OF LIFE 
LAST BREATH OF LIFE... 
I'M THE WATERSIDE, I BREAK 
THE STORM THROUGH THE CLOUDS 
AND I FROST YOUR EYES FOREVER 
TIME IS PASSING BY HOUR BY HOUR, 
BUT FAINTED SHE LIES NAKES ON THE 
FLOOR, COVERED WITH A BLACK 
SHROUD AND A CUP OF BLOOD 
ON THE LEFT, ON THE LEFT... 
FALLING PICTURES MOVING 
BETWEEN THE MEMORIES OF ALL 
THE MOMENTS WHERE WE FIND 
OURSELVES LOST INTO DARKNESS, 
OURSELVES LOST INTO DARKNESS... 
COLD BLOWS THE WIND ON 
WINGS OF DEATH FOR HER 
LAST BREATH OF LIFE 
LAST BREATH OF LIFE... 
I'M THE WATERSIDE, I BREAK 
THE STORM THROUGH THE CLOUDS... 
I'M THE WATERSIDE, I BREAK 
THE STORM THROUGH THE CLOUDS... 
COLD BLOWS THE WIND ON 
WINGS OF DEATH FOR HER... 
COLD BLOWS THE WIND ON 
WINGS OF DEATH FOR HER... 
I'M THE WATERSIDE, I BREAK 
THE STORM THROUGH THE CLOUDS 
COLD BLOWS THE WIND ON 
WINGS OF DEATH FOR HER... 
LAST BREATH OF LIFE
