LISTEN TO THIS VOICE 
TAKES ME TO THE DEEPEST 
INNERSELF OF INNOCENCE 
LET ME FLY AS HIGH AS THE 
SUN LET ME FALL AS DEEP 
AS HELL 
LET ME FALL AS DEEP 
AS HELL 
THE BRIGHTNESS OF THIS 
WORD DESTROYED MY HEARING 
THE FEELING OF HEAT BURNS 
INSIDE OF ME, I'M ON MY LIMITS 
I'M LOST 
MY CREED BELONGS TO THIS VOICE 
OF TRUTH, FULL OF HATE AND LOVE 
CHAOS, ILLUSION, REALITY, 
NO WORDS ENOUGH......... 
ALL AROUND ME THE DARKNESS, 
SO BLACK, ONLY MY SOUL 
SHINES NOW ON EVERITHING 
AND AVERYONE 
WITHOUT ME NO LIFE 
WITHOUT ME NO FAITH 
WITHOUT ME NO LIFE 
WITHOUT ME NO FAITH 
LISTEN TO THIS VOICE 
TAKES ME TO THE DEEPEST 
INNERSELF OF INNOCENCE 
MY CREED BELONGS TO THIS VOICE 
OF TRUTH, FULL OF HATE AND LOVE 
CHAOS, ILLUSION, REALITY, 
NO WORDS 
NO WORDS ENOUGH, ENOUGH 
NO WORDS ENOUGH, ENOUGH 
CONJURO ET CONTESTOR... 
LISTEN TO THIS VOICE 
TAKES ME TO HE DEEPEST 
INNERSELF...
