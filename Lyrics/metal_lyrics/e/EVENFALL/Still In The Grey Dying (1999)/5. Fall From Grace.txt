FAR AWAY DAYLIGHT 
HAS GONE, BEHIND 
ENDLESS NIGHTS, UNSACRED CREATURES 
ARE WAITING IN DISGUISE 
INHALE THE SMELL 
OF BLOOD AS A CURSE 
LAID UPON US 
TOOK YOUR FAITH 
IN HANDS OF FIRE 
DESIRE OF FOREIGN 
PLACES BUT YET SO 
KNOWN 
GARDENS OF CHANTING 
WHORES AND SINS, 
YOU ARE DEVIL'S OWN 
YOU ARE DEVIL'S OWN 
RIVER OF TEARS 
IN YOUR SOUL 
RIVER OF TEARS 
FROM YOUR EYES 
RIVER OF TEARS 
IN YOUR SOUL 
RIVER OF TEARS 
FROM YOUR EYES 
YOU ARE DEVIL'S OWN... 
DEVIL'S... DEVIL'S... OWN... 
FAR AWAY DAYLIGHT 
HAS GONE, BEHIND

YOU ARE DEVIL'S OWN 
RIVER OF TEARS IN YOUR SOUL 
RIVER OF TEARS FROM YOUR EYES 
RIVER OF TEARS IN YOUR SOUL
