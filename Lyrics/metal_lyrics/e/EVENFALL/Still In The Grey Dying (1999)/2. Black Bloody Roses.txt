WHEN THE MOONLIGHT 
TAKES THE SKY 
WHEN THE MOONLIGHT 
TAKES THE SKY 
TO FEEL MY DARK ROMANCE. 
TIME IS RIGHT TO LET BLOOD 
RUNNING HOT 
RUNNING HOT 
I'LL BE YOUR TEARS 
WHEN YOUR SOUL CRIES 
IN THE NIGHT 
I'LL BE A KISS OS DEATH 
WHEN BLACK ROSES 
FALL DOWN FROM YOUR HAND 
FOR A SIGNED DESTINY 
I CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU 
IT'S IN YOUR DREAMS 
HOLD ME. FEEL ME. HEAR THE 
CALL OF FALLING ANGELS 
I CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU 
I CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU 
IT'S IN YOUR DREAMS 
HOLD ME. FEEL ME. HEAR THE 
CALL OF FALLING ANGELS 
YOU'LL SLEEP ETERNAL 
FOREVER YOUNG 
WITCH OF ALL WITCHES 
EVIL OF EVIL
