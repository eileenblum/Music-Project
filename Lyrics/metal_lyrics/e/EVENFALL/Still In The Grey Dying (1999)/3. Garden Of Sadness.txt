LOST SOMEWHERE 
IN EMPTY SPACES 
YOU FALL DOWN 
LIKE LEAVES IN SAD 
AUTUMN DAYS 
FOLLOW THE STEPS 
OF A NEW DAY 
WE ARE SAINT AND SINNERS 
CRUCIFIED BY HUMAN 
WEAKNESS 
WE WALK THROUGH 
THE GARDEN OF SADNESS 
IN WHICH DARK WATERS 
SILENT DREAMS 
REVEAL TO ME 
YOUR FALLEN PRAY 
REVEAL TO ME 
THE OTHER SIDE... SIDE... SIDE 
REVEAL TO ME 
THE OTHER SIDE 
WE WALK THROUGH 
THE GARDEN OF SADNESS 
IN WHICH DARK WATERS 
FLOW FREE THROUGH 
SILENT DREAMS... 
SILENT DREAMS... 
SILENT DREAMS... 
WE WALK THROUGH 
THE GARDEN OF SADNESS 
IN WHICH DARK WATERS 
FLOW FREE THROUGH 
SILENT DREAMS... 
SILENT DREAMS... 
SILENT DREAMS... 
REVEAL TO ME 
YOUR FALLEN PRAY 
REVEAL TO ME 
THE OTHER SIDE. THE OTHER SIDE 
THE OTHER SIDE. THE OTHER SIDE...
