THE MOON IS FULL 
AND WHITE...... 
I'M STANDING AT THE DOOR 
OT TIME...... SOMEONE IS 
WAITING FOR YOU...... 
THE LAST TEAR HAS ROLLED 
DOWN MY FACE, DOWN MY FACE... 
THERE IS NO PLACE IN 
YOUR RELIGION FOR ME, 
FOR ME...... 
THE SEASOMN HAS BEGAN 
TO RISE AGAIN IN THE 
DARK WE WEEP...... 
IN THE DARK WE WEEP... 
TO RISE AGAIN...... 
BUT I CAN WAIT NO LONGER 
DON'T LOOK BACK 
THERE'S NO PROMISED LAND 
THIS IS THE SAIL OF CHARON 
I CAN SEE DEEP INSIDE 
ALL THE CHILDHOOD 
REFLECTIONS OF YOU 
WALKING THROUGH 
YOUR MEMORY, 
WALKING THROUGH 
YOUR MEMORY, 
I CAN SEE DEEP INSIDE...... 
BUT I CAN WAIT NO LONGER 
DON'T LOOK BACK 
THERE'S NO PROMISED LAND 
THIS SI THE SAIL OF CHARON 
I'M STANDING AT THE DOOR 
OF TIME...... SOMEONE IS 
WAITING FOR YOU...... 
THE LAST TEAR HAS ROLLED 
DOWN MY FACE, DOWN MY FACE... 
THIS IS THE SAIL OF CHARON 
THIS IS THE SAIL OF CHARON 
THIS IS THE SAIL OF CHARON 
BUT I CAN WAIT NO LONGER 
DON'T LOOK BACK 
THERE'S NO PROMISED LAND 
THIS IS THE SAIL OF CHARON...
