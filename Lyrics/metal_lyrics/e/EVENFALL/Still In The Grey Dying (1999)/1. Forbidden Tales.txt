SILENCE IS BREAKING 
THE DAWN OF A NEW DAY 
LISTEN TO THE CALL 
OF THE BEAST 
SOMEWHERE YOU LOST 
THE DREAM 
SOMETIMES YOU WONDER 
WHERE'S THE END 
OPEN THE GATES OF SAVAGERY 
FEEL THE WALLS BECOME SAND 
BENEATH YOUR FEET 
THERE'S BEEN NO ESCAPE... 
THERE'S BEEN NO ESCAPE 
FROM THE POWER OF SATAN 
IN HOC... 
CAN YOU FEEL THE EVIL? 
THE SKY IS BEGINNING TO SILVER... 
I BELIEVE NO GOD MAY SAVE 
US NOW... US NOW... 
SILENCE IS BREAKING 
THE DAWN OF A NEW DAY 
LISTEN TO THE CALL 
OF THE BEAST 
OPEN THE GATES OF SAVAGERY 
FEEL THE WALLS BECOME SAND 
BENEATH YOUR FEET 
THERE'S BEEN NO ESCAPE... 
THERE'S BEEN NO ESCAPE... 
FROM THE POWER OF SATAN...
