You Still Believe No Matter
What You Say, No Matter

What You See - Dark Eyes
What You See - Midnight Chimes
What You See - Shadows Grim
What You See Can Never Be

Look Into My Mirror
Are You The Only One
Look Into My Mirror
Are You The One

Though The Years Have Passed
And Chances Have Slipped Away
Fill The Night With The Stench Of Evil
Though The Years Have Passed
And Chances Have Slipped Away
Fill The Night With The Stench Of Evil

What You See - Dark Eyes
What You See - Midnight Chimes
What You See - Shadows Grim
What You See Can Never Be
Look Into My Mirror
Are You The Only One
Look Into My Mirror
Are You The One
