The Legend Says
All The Ghosts Will Rise
If You Do The Sign To Turn
Your Life Into Heaven Or Hell

You Are The Innocent
You Are The Damned
I'll Bring You Beauty
I'll Teach You Sin

But Daylight Shines
Blinds Your Eyes

Pains Of A Thousand Years
Cast From Faceless Beings
Lost For Centuries
The Dawn Of Autumn
Plays Behind The Iron Doors
Of The Darkest Dungeon
And Time, An Imaginary Line...
An Imaginary Line...

But Daylight Shines
Blinds Your Eyes

Mirror Of Fate Let Me Fall
Into This Room Of Ice
Mirror Of Fate Let Me Fall
But Save Me From Bitter Lies
