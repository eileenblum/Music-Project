I'm Free...
It Hardly Matters 
Watching What's Happening, 
What's Failing,
Even If...

It Hardly Matters 
Watching What's Happening

There Is A Spot Upon This Accursed Earth 
Which Thou Hast Never Yet Beheld 
And If By Chance Thou Hast Beheld It, 
It Must Have Been In One Of Those 
Vigorous Dreams

It Does Not Matter To Me, 
This Great Weight 
Is Off My Mind
It Does Not Matter To Me, 
'Cause "He" Placed A Hand 
Upon My Head

I'm Free... 
From All These Lies
And This World
Full Of Shit

Even If...

It Hardly Matters 
Watching What's Happening

Which Comes Like The Simoom
Upon The Brain Of The Sleeper
Who Hath Lain Down To Sleep
Among The Forbidden Sunbeams ...

It Does Not Matter To Me, 
This Great Weight 
Is Off My Mind
It Does Not Matter To Me, 
?Cause "He" Placed A Hand 
Upon My Head

I'm Free...
