I Glanced Up At The Moon
As A Dark Brooding Cloud
Crossed Over It
And An Old Man
Knelt Before
A Burning Cross

On This Starving Midnight
Darkness Shades The Land,
Corpses Dance
In The Glades Of Gloom

Drag Me Down To
Splendid Capture
And Bury Me
In A Cold Wet Place

The Ghouls Break In
Surrounding Your Bed
The Demons
Tear You Apart...

On This Starving Midnight
Darkness Shades The Land,
Corpses Dance
In The Glades Of Gloom

Drag Me Down
To Splendid Capture
And Bury Me
In A Cold Wet Place

The Right Time
That Brought Out
The Beast
In Time

Drag Me Down
To Splendid Capture
And Bury Me
In A Cold Wet Place

Drag Me Down
To Splendid Capture
And Bury Me
In A Cold Wet Place
