I'm Walking On Your Left Side
Like A Shadow In The Rain
I Look Into The Mirror
Of Eternal Devastation

Pray For The Nightfall 
You Feared
Touch The Dark 
Where The Silence Reigns
For The Nightfall 
You Feared
Touch The Dark 
Where The Silence Reigns

I'm Walking On Your Left Side
Like A Shadow In The Rain
I Look At The Future
Without Tomorrow

Pray For The Nightfall 
You Feared
Touch The Dark 
Where The Silence Reigns
For The Nightfall 
You Feared
Touch The Dark 
Where The Silence Reigns

Pray For The Nightfall 
You Feared
Touch The Dark
Where The Silence Reigns
It's Midnight 
And The Darkest Hour
Will Kiss Your Soul Again
It's Midnight 
And The Darkest Hour
Will Kiss Your Soul Again
