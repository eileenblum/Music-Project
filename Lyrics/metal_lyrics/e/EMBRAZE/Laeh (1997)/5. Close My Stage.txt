This is day for something new 
I have changed more than you 
And my hands haven't hurt 
Anyone like you 

It takes a long time to forget 
What you wanna leave behind 
You found me but I found nothing 

I'm waiting for the day 
And I'm waiting for the night 

It makes you cry 
It takes long time to see 
What is behind all this 
And after all you have to leave all this 
It makes you cry 

You hold me all the time when you should cry 
I'm so close but my thoughts are so far away 
Take off my mask and close my stage 
When I'm too weary of all this
