Are they vagabonds in your phrases
Drowned voices in the edge of time 
Amid peals of laughter 
In stillness and my beast goes rapidly and hides 

My wild thoughts of you 
Do they feel this time 
See it through to the end 

Part is wasted and part stille goes 
I won't heed your call 
I have left myself here and 
I won't let you go 
(I may lost myself but your scenes still goes) 

My wild thoughts (of you) 
Do they know (if I'm guilty) 
(Make me wear) this time 
See it through to the end
