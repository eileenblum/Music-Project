Only a breath of air when a man is dying 
You look at me and wish the hand is helping 
You follow the stream of emptiness with your eyes 
I dry away your tears and fly to the kingdom of bitter memories 

You are so divine 
You are so pure 
Don't let those words to hurt 

Silence is depressing when you dread to say a word 
Scornful laughter echoes on its stage 
What about the lies? I didn't believe a word 

You are so divine 
You are so pure 
Don't let those words to hurt
