Mother is escorting her child into the grave 
Her eyes are filled with tears 
She needs neither consolation nor sympathy 
Her child has been disgraced 

Fragments of life are tearing 
Are tearing my legs apart 

Life didn't give you what you expected 
Time has left you on the moonshine of loneliness 
And the way to home is too long 

Fragments of life are tearing 
Are tearing my legs apart 

Durga, God of revenge 
Hate, humiliation, shame 

Tell my story 
Sing about my battles and forgive me what I've done 

I don't need this love 
I feel only hate and pain 

Fragments of life are tearing 
Are tearing my legs apart 

So you can kill me 
Please kill me
