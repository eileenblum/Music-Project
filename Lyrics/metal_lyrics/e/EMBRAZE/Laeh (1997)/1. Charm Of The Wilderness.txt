I feel that I can't spread my wings today 
Passing bells they are disturbing my mind 
I feel that I do something wrong 
It feels like pressing me again 

I wanna sleep when my eyes are closed 
Shades of colors are getting black 

I flow free, I flow proud 
I turned my eyes to the free winds 
Still I lost everything I had 

You grasped my nature 
Years in your authority 
Years go by, go by 
No-one can do anything 
I only keep my silence 
Although you fuck my nature 

I flow free, I flow proud 
I turned my eyes to the free winds 
Still I lost everything I had 

And today nature won't wake up 
It's asleep today 
Like a light of life has burned to the end 

I flow free, I flow proud 
I turned my eyes to the free winds 
Still I lost everything I had
