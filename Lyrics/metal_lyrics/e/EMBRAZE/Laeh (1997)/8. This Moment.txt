I'd like to be in your life 
I'd like to be in you 
Only life, no love 
Only longing 

Loneliness frightens you 
You have to handle it alone 
It's no use to flee from yourself 

Me, sorrow, emotions, eternity 
Mourning lasts the whole life 
In myself 

My life is no more 
I've been seeking, tempting myself 
The most horrible thing is longing 

Do you feel this moment 
Do you feel me so close 
Do you hear my voice filled with life 
Morning dew
