I want to see the brighter moon 
Where the stars are the bridge 
Between the mountains and the sky 
Away from the low windows 
Veiling the sky 

You touch nothing with your hand 
You can only feel the sun in your soul 
Touch me, touch me 
Cause I wanna sense the freedom 

I want to walk without concrete walls 
Without a knife in my back 
Here only tears flow with me 
Away from the dump of the double-faced
