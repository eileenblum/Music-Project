It's getting cold and I feel it coming 
There is some hope 
For you and for me 

God is coming close 
God's dark autumn nights 
The end of innocence 
Breeding the autumn child 

He cries in the trees 
?? everywhere 
The child, he cries in the trees 
Hiding behind the dark clouds 

Dark sky darkens the trees 
Snow joins the moonlight to light your way 
Your freezing hands dig the grave 
Your freezing hands dig the grave 
For your dreams, for your dreams 

A soul stuffed with wait 
Bitternes filss the golden memories 
A tiny child seeking himself 
You feel your heavy load better than ever 

You are the autmun child
