The world is not ment for us 
It's place for people who believe in fairy tales 
But we don't even listen to the voice 
Of mother earth she's not feeling very well 

Think yourself 

We are not the only ones who had killed the earth 
The master, the blame 

Who are the leaders, who are  trusted ones 
They will never hurt you 
They just want your soul 
Life is not going to end 
They'll put the right spirit to mother earth 
That will be the victory of this clan 

We want it, we need it 
So do you know what you must do? 
The world will be a better place for love 
Who knows maybe even hate 
But no-one knows how to love 
We are so evil 
Hate is so sweet, oh as sweet as your heart 

The earth will turn black, it will burn 
No life just us, we will rock there 
Until we die, we are not able to do 

Cause you know 
They will never hurt you 
They just want your soul 
Life is not going to end 
They'll put right spirit to mother earth 
That will be the victory of this clan 

If you believe in these words 
Not that kind of the world
