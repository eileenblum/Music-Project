One moon, one star
I feel myself so tiny
Problems seem so huge
In this world

One sky, one man
I feel your heartbeat
Thousand sins
But one breath
It beats for me

Where are you
I think I miss you
Come closer to me

It's time to forgive
See the star and leave

One moon, one star
I feel myself so tiny
Problems seem so huge
In this world

One sky, one man
I feel your heartbeat
Thousand sins
But one breath
It beats for me

When I'm alone
I bleed deep inside
I feel myself so tiny
