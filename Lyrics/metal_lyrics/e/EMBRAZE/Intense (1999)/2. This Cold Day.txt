This cold day
You're the only one I need
You're the only one I make cry
You're the only one I miss

I want to die with you
Die with you
Today

I don't want to die for you
I want to die with you, die with you
Today

This cold day
I hurt you deep
Love me to sleep
Hold back your tears for me

This cold day
I want to die with you
