Shame, my only feeling
Shame, of dirty memories
We hide and the words hurt more
Like a slap on my face

Pain takes over my mind
When shame fills up the room
Where is your love when devil is in your heart

Shame, do you feel this shame
Shame, of dirty memories
We hide and the words hurt more
Like a slap on my face

Pain takes over my mind
When shame fills up the room
Where is your love when devil is in your heart

We hide and shame fills up our hearts
No room for love anymore

Pain takes over my mind
When shame fills up the room
Where is your love when devil is in your heart
