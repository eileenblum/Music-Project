My soul flies to you
My rain and my moon
But I am here somewhere
I miss you and I love but I don't feel

Many tears for me
Too many wicked lies
But if you could love me still
It is the only thing I need

I love you my rain and my moon
My soul flies to you

What I said is what I meant
And said because I loved
The rain carries away
All the tears we cry here now
