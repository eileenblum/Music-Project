Rain beats me down
I cry for my sins and love
My blood runs to the ground
In the sky the moon feels pity for me

I look deep into the eyes
You're ashamed of the lust
You feel for my naked body

Sin, love and the devil

I run till I throw up
I cry and repent my sins
Rain beats me down
I cry for my, my sins and love

I want to take you into my arms
But I'm too weak and tear apart

Sin, love and the devil

(My own lies in my ears and your love in my soul)
