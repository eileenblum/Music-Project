It's a dark day and the sun won't shine
Only the dark moon above the sky
Flower of lust, deceiver of trust you are
Leave your body and you will be free
This is beautiful death
Eternal sleep in the ocean floor
Cold waters feel so warm
Hate kills your dreams
Love gives you eternal sleep
Hate tears you apart and
Love won't melt your lonely heart
This is beautiful death
Eternal sleep in the ocean floor
Cold waters feel so warm
Leave your body and you will be free!
