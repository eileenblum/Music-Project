If I cried nobody would hear
If I cried nobody would care
I have nothing but memories
Don't leave me alone
I am afraid of death, it will come very soon
Mother, I am so confused
Mother, I am so alone
Do you remember me when you see a lone swan?
Do you remember me when you are alone?
Do you light a candle like we used to do?
Do you remember?
I am freezing but nobody warms
I am tired but I can not drown
Hide my feelings, hope for death
I cry quietly and alone
I am afraid of death it will come very soon
Mother, I am so confused
Mother, I am so alone
Do you remember me when you see a lone swan?
Do you remember me when you are alone?
Do you light a candle like we used to do?
Do you remember?
