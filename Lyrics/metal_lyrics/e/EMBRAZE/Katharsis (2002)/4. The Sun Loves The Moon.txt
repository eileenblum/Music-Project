She is cold like water
She is dark like night
She fears love and
Looks for pain
I cry with the trees
I sing with the wing
I am the child of moonlight
I am the child of doom
She loves the moon
Like I used to do
She loves the moon
Like the day loves the night
Like the sun loves the moon and
The call of the wild fills her heart
I can't live without my life
I can't live without my soul and
I am looking for you every autumn night
My life didn't begin untill I saw your face
Why have you not come back to me?
She loves the moon
Like I sed to do
She loves the moon
Like the day loves the night
Like the sun loves the moon and
The call of the wild fills her heart
