I crawl and hide away
I am the snake beneath you
I am the fly on the dunghill
I am nothing good for you
I deceive and destroy
I am evil and full of lust
I am useless, I am air, I am the
Sinmaker today
I am bitching mother fucker
But I am too weak to regret
Please wait for me my life
I am eager but too afraid to fly
I am the snake in your frame
I am the devil in your dreams
