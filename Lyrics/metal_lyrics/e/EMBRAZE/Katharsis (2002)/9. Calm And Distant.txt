Let me be weak
I want to cry quietly
Be like calm see
At least this little moment
And you are the wind
So calm and peaceful
You are the morning
So beautiful and distant
Love me to sleep
Close my eyes from fears
Don't let me fly away
Cause you know I am scared
This restless soul
Maybe finds peace someday
It rages for a time
Untill it burns out and will not be reborn
And you are the wind
So calm and peaceful
You are the morning
So beautiful and distant
Love me to sleep
Close my eyes from fears
Don't let me fly away
Cause you know I am scared
I sing my songs
Stories from deep in me
I tell my thoughts that
I can't say loud
Without playing
A storyteller
