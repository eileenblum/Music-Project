Build me a beautiful home
Where I can live and hide
From this scary world
Bring me a beautiful day
'Cause the endless night
Hits me down
I wish I could fly so high
That I could see your lovely face
I know I should try to live my life
But now it seems that I won't try
Fear of life
I wanna hide and fade away
Fear of life
I wanna cry my endless sorrow away
Only you can feel my fears
Only you can wipe my tears
Save me from myself
