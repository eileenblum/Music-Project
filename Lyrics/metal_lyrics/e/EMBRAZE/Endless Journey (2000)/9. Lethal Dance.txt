I'm only happy when I'm unhappy
I am only happy when we sink in the stream
Happy when we drown out
When we flow away
Look at me
Tell me I fly
Lie to me
As always
I'm only happy when I'm unhappy
I'm only happy when she dances
She tells me little lies
She dances only for me
I'm only happy when I'm unhappy
I am only happy when we sink in the stream
Happy when we drown out
When we flow away
Look at me
Tell me I fly
Lie to me
As always
We make love
And we fly
And she dances
