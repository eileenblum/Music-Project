I am lost, lost in my life
In the dead end
I roam alone again
Will you be with me when sun never shines
Will you be with me even if I miss another
I am lost, lost in my dreams
Illusions crash down
What you lose, you never regain
What you gain, you just can't name
Will you be with me when sun never shines
Will you be with me even if I miss another
I am lost, lost in my dreams
Illusions crash down
