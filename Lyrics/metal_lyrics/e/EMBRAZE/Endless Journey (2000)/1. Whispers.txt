The sun sets and we sit down
The night is filled with whispers
I remeber all what was said
And what was done
If you miss me on your way
Bring me another moon
The sun sets and we lie daoen
The night is filled with hope
I remember how I feared
I remember how I escaped
If you miss me on your way
Bring me another moon
