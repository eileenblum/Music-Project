Shallow light, too weak to cast my shadow
Small hours for a small soul
This moment is not our own
Hear the words beyond control
Wandering without goal

All this I give to you
All I made, broken too soon

Some things should stay hidden
Too cruel to read, too dreadful to be written
Words for feelings forbidden
All my feelings overridden

All this I give to you
All I made, broken too soon

Morning light, casting our shadows
This path getting so narrow
Still we have to go on
To the gallows
Nothing else this love allows

All this I give to you
All I made, broken too soon
