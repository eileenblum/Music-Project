Two letter word
Three times in a row
Little whispers in the dark
For no-one to know

Liquid fire inside these veins
Revealing the pleasures your body contains
Oh how my soul devours my flesh
This burning within afresh

Taste of absinthe on your lips
Serpent's tongue in angel's kiss
One intoxicating lie
Will be my last wish

Liquid fire inside these veins
Revealing the pleasures your body contains
Oh how my soul devours my flesh
This burning within afresh
