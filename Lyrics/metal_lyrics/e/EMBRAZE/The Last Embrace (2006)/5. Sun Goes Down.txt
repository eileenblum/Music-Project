Things are not so easy anymore
We have to lose them all
After all the lies we've been through
The hardest part is stand behind the truth
Who's it gonna be? You or me?
Are you gonna end up your misery?

Watching the sun go down
When I'm crawling on the ground
Searching for a place to hide
I killed the love and all the good things died
It's time for me to walk away
Fade to black, fall in misery
Your form is light, my way goes down
Close to the darkness and emptiness

My poison is running from me to you
This is the way the sun loves the moon
So take this gift and close it into your heart
After the long night it will tear you apart
We both suffer from this pain
And this whole thing is making us insane
