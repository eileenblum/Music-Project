All the things you said to him
They came deep from your heart
The land was frozen and the cold wind was so hard
You still remember the last touch

It was the most beautiful time
The most beautiful time in your life
If you won't ever see him again
He still got the place for you
In his heart

All the beautiful dies when time passes by
If you won't close your heart
Time will heal your every scar

I had dreams when I was child
But they never came true
Where is the child I used to be
Where is the hope and my dreams

It is time when all flowers are dead
Eternal longing fills my heart
She reminds me of the autumn nights
When stars are the bridge in the sky

She walks alone on this empty street
Along this street of dead leaves
Dead roses in her hand
They remind me that nothing lasts forever
