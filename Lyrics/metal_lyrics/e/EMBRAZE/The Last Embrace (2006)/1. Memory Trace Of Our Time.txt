Like the autumn leaves I fall down with my sun
I see a beautiful dream of you and me
As we go together on street of autumn leaves

I woke up wet clothes on
Frozen swan I am
The doors are closed, no-one there
They don't see, that someone is missing

And the cold wind blows so hard
Loneliness tears me apart
I walk alone like I used to do
I was made only for you

Black bird flies over me
I'm lying on the cold ground and
I'm watching the clouds go by
The autumn brings everything that I...

They say you gave up
When you made your choice
But I was the only one you woke up
When you got your freedom
Wanna get mine too

It is always so windy here
Cold wind blows so hard, through my heart
Children are flying against stonewalls making holes
The holes are the memory trace of our time

And the cold wind blows so hard
Loneliness tears me apart
I walk alone like I used to do
I was made only for you
