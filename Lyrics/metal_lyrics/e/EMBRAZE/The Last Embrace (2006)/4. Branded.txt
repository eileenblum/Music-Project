Clenching my fists, sinking nails to the flesh
Giving up all I possess
Phantom pain in whirling mist
In this void nothing exists

So easy to sell your soul away
So easy to set your goals yet astray

Sold truth for the meek
Religious and weak
Can't find myself within your faith so bleak
So easy for me to hate
Shackles so fragile made

I recognize this branding
Marked for life and beyond
Where were you before
Wandering on this same lane
Can't recognize you anymore
Obscure and vain
