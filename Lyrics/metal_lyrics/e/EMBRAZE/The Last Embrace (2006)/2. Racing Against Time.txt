I hide from myself
I close my eyes to be free
I always take care of others
But who will take care of me

Mentally raped by loved ones
Used and thrown away

Racing against time
How can I set free my mind
Or is my life just a lie?

This load has become too heavy
There's just too much to see
Life turns into a broken ship
This time it's drowning me

Racing against time
How can I set free my mind
Or is my life just a lie?

Senses blinded long gone
Completely dull today

Racing against time
How will I ease my mind
Is this life just a lie
