I run alone in the dark
Through childhood dreams
I still remember the gentle touch

Timidity is a gift
I have learned on my way here
Thousand faces, one is the right
The one is not here

I'm sitting alone
Missing you but you are not the one I love

Are you alone?
Are you missing me?
The love you never reached

The moon reflects your light on me
My sun you shine only for me
Without you I wonder alone in the dark
Without seeing the light of a day

I'm sitting alone
Missing you but you are not the one I love
