Last echoes of your voice revert
I'm paralyzed and inert
On my knees here in desert
Dead from inside, still I hurt

Last echoes of your voice revert
I'm paralyzed and inert

Moralizing, I face your scowl
Deep within, foul my soul
No rest for the wicked, must crawl on
Save your scorn, I will be gone by the dawn

Dead but walking, no haven in sight
Breathless yet breathing just malice and spite
She grimaced when heard my sobbing cries
No solace from you, just plain despise

Last echoes of your voice revert
I'm paralyzed and inert

Moralizing, I face your scowl
Deep within, foul my soul
No rest for the wicked, must crawl on
Save your scorn, I will be gone by the dawn
