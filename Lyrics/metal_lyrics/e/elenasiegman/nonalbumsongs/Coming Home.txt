I need you
To sacrifice the vermin martyr
To
Bring me back, where I saw you
Die
I will make your lasts words come
True
Now I know what I must
Do...

Now in death, bring me life
All that I am will be coming home now
(I did it all for you)
I'm becoming real now with all I am (All I am)

Oh I how tried to separate reality from
Truth
Now you'll see what I can
Do

Bring me life
All that I am will be coming home
(I did it all for you)
I'm becoming real now with all I am (All I am)

With all I am
I swear to you, I'll kill them all
I'll make them suffer
And now in death, bring me life

All that I am will be coming home now
(I did it all for you)
I'm becoming real now with all I am (All I...)

I'm coming home now [x9]

I'm coming... Home!
