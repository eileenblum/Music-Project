[from "Call of Duty: Black Ops III Zombies"][with Malukah and Clark S. Nova]In disguise in the skies
Burns a fire in my eyes
And I'm holding the world in my hand
So contorted and twisted
Condemned and submissive
When they kneel they'll know where I stay
Yeah

Rise again
On my own
Now we are
Coming home
It all ends
Painfully and slow
I'll bring them down on my own

First to go
Last to know
Aways the only one I control
Lashing out
Giving in
Then letting go to begin again

Letting go, letting go now
Letting go, my mind's corrupt
Our souls corrode, it's how we'll all end up

Burning down
Caving in
Die by fire and begin again
What breaks my pride
Will break your skull
I bring the end
Just like an archangel

All the ruptured existence
Disdain life persistence
The wheel won't be turning for long
No

And I need
Carrion
Now I am
Coming home
Running from
I'm becoming one
I'll bring you down on my own

Letting go, letting go now
Letting go, now pain erupts
And time is slowed, it's how we'll all end up

Burning down
Caving in
Die by fire and begin again
What breaks my pride
Will break your skull
I bring the end
Just like an archangel

Why do we end up here
Live in fire and feel so cold
We burn together forever
Waiting for the one

Letting go, letting go now
Letting go, our time is up
Dust from our bones, this time we don't wake up

Finding out
Where you've been
Wait in silence and begin again
I'll take my time
To make you fall
Pass through your head
At just the right angle

Falling down
Giving in
Burn the liar and begin again
What fills your pride will make you fall
I am the and
A fucking archangel
