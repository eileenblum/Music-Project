All my atrocities
Come by way of reciprocity
I'm chewing the bones of my own reprieve

Death be my dignity
Execute hemlock philosophy
Poison fills the cup of the carpenter

NO!
Love lost on me
MORE!
Life so costly

No reason
For grieving

No
LOVE LOST ON ME
More
LIFE SO COSTLY

Bring me down with
SEVEN POINT SIX TWO HIGH VELOCITY

I can see them everywhere they're
All around me they're
Waiting for me.

Descending un-
Relenting.

Beauty of annihilation.

Your curiosity
Feeding off my animosity

And reason
Is treason

DOWN! With all that's good and clean and you can't f***ing annihilate me!

Bring you down with
SEVEN POINT NINE TWO AND NO IMPUNITY!

Same as previous choruses

Death so beautiful
Looks so beautifu-ul
Death so beautiful
Looks so beautiful on me

I can see them everywhere
I can see them everywhere I go-o
I can see them everywhere they're
All around me they're waiting for me

I can see them everywhere
I can see them everywhere I go
I can see them everywhere they're
All around me they're waiting for me

Descending un-
Relenting

Beauty of annihilation looks
Like your prophet was mistaken Is
Life really gone or just been wasted
Doom so close that I can taste it.
