[from "Call of Duty: Black Ops III Zombies"]A wolf is at my door, I feel it
I see it in my dreams, a world of my design
A forced enlightening revels it
I found a life trat I malign and I feel it

I feel so strange...
Like I'm everywhere, and that no one was there

We only want to live forever
Repeat serial suicide you can't find you and hide

Am I dead
Is it all over
There is no pain here
You lead and I'll follow
My tree of life is hollow
The tide has turned into rain

Beneath a waning light, I see it
A creeping shadow spire will bleed into the sky
Carotid tightening conceals this..mortality
These moments freeze and fall away from duality

I hear my name
In a voice like mine
That I hear in my mind

The time has come to leave for never
I peel the fabric back and see me hide
I can't hide from I and hide from me

Am I dead
Is it all over
Where is my pain now
In my head it draws me closer
Will it know my name
I feel it again and again I feel it
I feel it when it's closing my eyes I feel it
I see it again and again in my mind
I see it when I look at the sky and I am
Alive again

I'm alive
I feel the pain now
I'm really here
I'm alive now
I'm alive now
I'm alive I'm alive
Now I die again yeah

Are we dead
Is it all over
Again yeah
Where is my pain now
You lead and we'll follow
Our tree of life is hollow
The tide has turned into rain

Are we dead
Did we cross over
What is our name now
Are we dead now
Are we dead now
Are we dead again
