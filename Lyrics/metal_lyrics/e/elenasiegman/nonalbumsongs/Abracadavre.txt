[Verse 1]

I can fly like a bird not in the sky
which can always swim and always dry
I say goodbye at night and morning hi
I'm part of you what am I

I follow and lead as you pass
dress yourself in black my darkness lasts
I flee the light but without the sun
Your view of me would be gone and

I can see the damage that
I am causing you is so benign
You want me to be gone
but I have just be-

[Pre-chorus]

Gun
I am the only one undone
I'm a broken miracle now
In your head

[Chorus]

I don't feel
Like I am real
But I know it's all imaginary

Are they real
And do they feel
Is all the pain
Just inside my head

[Verse 2]

I am what men love more than life
Fear more than death or mortal strife
What dead men have and rich require
I'm what contented men desire

you want me to be gone
but I have just be-

[Pre-chorus 2]

gun
you will never know how far I've come
what goes up must never come back down

[Chorus 2]

I don't feel
Like I am real
But I know it's all imaginary

Are they real
And do they feel
Is all the pain
Just inside my head

it's all inside my head
it's just inside my
it's all inside my
they're all inside my

I see them always but they're
all inside my head
all inside my head
they're all inside my

[Bridge]

head It's killing me
to see I'm killing you
death is magic say
Abra Cadavre now

you see me now you
don't cry when I am
gone

these shackles they come
with certain opportunities
they won't let me get away
but they show me we're the same

we're the same
we're the same
they show me we are the same

I can't give in
I won't give in
It's not a state of mind
I'm wretched but I'm powerful and

[Chorus 3]

I don't feel
Like I am real
But I know it's all imaginary

Are they real
And do they feel
Is all the pain
Just inside my head

it's all inside my head
it's just inside my
it's all inside my
they're all inside my

I see them always but they're
all inside my head
all inside my head
they're all inside my head
