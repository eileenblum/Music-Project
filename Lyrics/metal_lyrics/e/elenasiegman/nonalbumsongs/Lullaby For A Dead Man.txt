Life is still spinning
Your end, my beginning
And everything I hope for has been strangely set aside
Breathing for living
My mind is forgiving
And destiny is proving to be absent from my life

I know it, I feel it
I know when you're sleeping
I know the things you're dreaming
And I know you will never give up and die

Conscious fulfilling, the darkness revealing
All faults and insecurities are shining like the sun
Eyes are decieving
Your mind will stop breathing and
All that you are made of will now rightly become mine

You know it, you feel it
I know when you're sleeping
I know the things you're dreaming
I love it when you're weeping
Even death can't stop this feeling
And I know you won't give up and die

Father, why have you forsaken me?
My life is gone
Father, know how long it's taken me?
I live again

I know when you're sleeping
I know the things you're dreaming
I know when you're sleeping
I know the things you're dreaming
I love when you're weeping
Even death can't stop this feeling

I know when you're sleeping
I know the things you're dreaming
I love when you're weeping
Even death can't stop this feeling
And I know you will never give up
No, you will never give up...
You will never give up... and die
