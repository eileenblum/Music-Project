[Verse 1]
No one can see me and
I've lost all feeling and
I know I won't die alone
I'll stop you from breathing and
all your deceiving and
this house is not my home

[Pre chorus 1]
No
More forgiveness
No
and the reason is
I know I wont die alone

I have returned

[Chorus 1]
and everyone dies and
everyone lies
They're waiting for the second coming again

Everyone tries to hold onto their lives
When no one's alive
Bring me 115

[Verse 2]
You stand for nothing and
overlooked something
I'll bring you down all on my own

I'm the end I can taste it
I'll justify hatred
I am the chosen one
left hand of all that's sacred

[Pre Chorus 2]
No
More forgiveness
No
I'll bring you death and pestilence
I'll bring you down on my own.

I have returned

[Chorus 2]
and everything dies
look to the skies
to see the end of all creation again

See with your eyes
my army of flies
when no one's alive
bring me 115

[Bridge]
I've lost all form and unity
where has my life gone
I'll bring you doom that you can see
and bring you down to see you bleed.

[Outro Chorus]
and everyone dies and
everyone lies
They're waiting for the second coming again

Everyone tries to hold onto their lives
When no one's alive
Bring me 115

and everything dies
look to the skies
to see the end of all creation again

See with your eyes
my army of flies
when no one's alive
bring me 115

and nobody cries
when everyone dies
and no one's alive
bring me 115
