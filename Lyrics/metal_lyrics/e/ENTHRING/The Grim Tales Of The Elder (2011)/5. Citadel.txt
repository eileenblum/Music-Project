And I fly!

I guess...
I exist to rise and fall like dawn and dusk.
A child of day and night, golden and white,
And my light is fading by the cycles of beheading me.

The groaning earth, freezing cold.
Bleeding lakes, tormented soil.
Hear my child, there are no more lies!
Like a man I was born and I'll die.

By the nine gods of men,
I'm astonished at what you've done.
For gold you have sundered,
All the bonds to your home.

By the eight graves of men,
Who once were the symbols of war.
May they sentence you like
We mortals never could have.

And like the seventh cursed lord
Of the argent seas,
I'm forged by the fires in the damp dark deeps
And hardened by the snow and frost so grim.
But still I suffer from undead dreams.

My downfall!

Icy is the touch of fingers creeping on my skin.
Whispering to my ear 'Only death makes us free.'
(Delusions break to shivers.)
And through the gateways the foretold truth I see!

The groaning earth, freezing cold.
Bleeding lakes, tormented soil.
Hear my child, there are no more lies!
Like a man I was born and I'll die.

By the nine gods of men,
I'm astonished at what you've done.
For gold you have sundered,
All the bonds to your home.

By the eight graves of men,
Who once were the symbols of war.
May they sentence you like
We mortals never could have.

And like the seventh cursed lord
Of the argent seas,
I'm forged by the fires in the damp dark deeps
And hardened by the snow and frost so grim.
But still I suffer from undead dreams.

And I fly!
My downfall!
My downfall!
