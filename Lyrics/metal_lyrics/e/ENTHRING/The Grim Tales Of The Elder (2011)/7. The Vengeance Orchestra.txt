Through the thousand gates of death I fought and gained my freedom.
Rancorous is my heart, envenomed by the poison from my abysmal wounds.
Vindictive I am...

Those who bring back the light, upon my people they weaved the night.
The malicious, cunning consequence of the hell-bent wish to heal the heartless.
And those who return to darkness are blinded by their own godliness.
Brothers and sisters, undress that harness and follow my lead, escape from this Hades!

So this is the land,
Our sanctuary after captivity!
A beautiful place, a peaceful dream.
Not for my soul, so young yet so old.

Silence is vast, in enchanting ways,
Chanting words decreasing the pain.
With calming words you pray
'My torment shall last for eternity.'
Like it takes forever for a pool
Of blood red tears to dry under the suns,
But may it not be in vain.
Take your own destiny, for your own victory.
You, my brethren, I desire to join.

Never forget who did this to us!
Embrace your hate, achieve vengeance for us.
Can you hear their chant, the vengeance orchestra?
Float in fear, a tear in the grievous ocean.

Through the thousand gates of delusion I fought and gained my freedom.
Relieved is my heart, for the poison is cured from my abysmal wounds.

Narrow is the path I'm walking on.
I cradle death on my open palm.
All becomes clear soon my mourning is over.
The day when I die I'll be more than alive.

Silence is vast, in enchanting ways,
Chanting words decreasing the pain.
With calming words you pray
'My torment shall last for eternity.'
Like it takes forever for a pool
Of blood red tears to dry under the suns,
But may it not be in vain.
Take your own destiny, for your own victory.
You, my brethren, I desire to join.

Never forget who did this to us!
Embrace your hate, achieve vengeance for us.
Can you hear their chant, the vengeance orchestra?
Float in fear, a tear in the grievous ocean.
