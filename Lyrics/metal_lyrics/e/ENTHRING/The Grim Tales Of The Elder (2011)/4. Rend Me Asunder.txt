My hands are tied.
I can only sit and watch all the pain.
The fear is my lust (my fear).
The reflection, the figure, it's me.
These are the times of great evil.

Shadow of a man, like broken steel,
My only wish was to have a heart
Mourning the things that I wanted to be.
Tomorrow it all might be gone!

Left all alone, to the mercy of light,
Sanity is far and gone
Soared to the skies with the warming winds.
Follow my mark, rend me asunder!

Flying to the skies, the highest high.
Diving down, from my pride, until I die.
With broken wings, oh my bride, we cannot fly high.

Bound to the earth until we die.
Eternity, for gods, do you feel alive?
Like a frozen flower, we wither and die.
Like my grave, the citadel, where I will end.

Flying to the skies, the highest high.
Diving down, from my pride, until I die.
With broken wings, oh my bride, we cannot fly high.

It hurts so much,
I burn in the fiery flames.
And I get no rest
For this is the birth
Of my reign of nightmares.

Shadow of a man, like broken steel,
My only wish was to have a heart
Mourning the things that I wanted to be.
Tomorrow it all might be gone!

Left all alone, to the mercy of light,
Sanity is far and gone
Soared to the skies with the warming winds.
Follow my mark, rend me asunder!

Flying to the skies, the highest high.
Diving down, from my pride, until I die.
With broken wings, oh my bride, we cannot fly high
