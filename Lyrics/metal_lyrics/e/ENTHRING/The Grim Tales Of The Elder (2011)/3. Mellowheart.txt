Your lifestyle brings me so much pain
For my morale is heartfelt, angelic and hallowed.
Yet the decisions I am forced to make
Rend apart the rules I was to follow.

Good riddance, mellowheart,
In this world there's no place for you!
Mellowheart, burning the passion inside,
Mellowheart, soon the skies will come to claim it's
Own mellowheart, now's the last time to stay brave.

What you do, that's a double-edged sword
With no hilt and you don't even feel pain or guilt
And it leaves your poor soul to the grip of such sorrow
That even an angel's touch won't follow and I fear...

If my life is just a sin tainted stagger in blindness
Where a gilded iron fist forces you to silence.
An unguarded trail on the edge of a mountain
Where one crooked step starts your decent into darkness.

And I fear! If one day I am too weak
To fight! And I lose my hope.

That life isn't just a sin tainted stagger in blindness
Where a gilded iron fist forces you to silence.
An unguarded trail on the edge of a mountain
Where one crooked step starts your decent into darkness.

Come on, coward, hunt my precious,
Chokehold, the heart and leave it to bleed.
Come on, coward, hunt my precious,
Chokehold, the heart and leave it to bleed.

Come on, coward, hunt my precious,
Chokehold, the heart and leave it to bleed.
Come on, coward, hunt my precious,
Chokehold, the heart and leave it to bleed.

Good riddance, mellowheart,
In this world there's no place for you!
Mellowheart, burning the passion inside,
Mellowheart, soon the skies will come to claim it's
Own mellowheart, now's the last time to stay brave.

And petrify, do what this world wants you to do.
Rape and kill and hurt and burn
And justify, we smell like a lie,
No silver lining on our clouds at all.
The time, becoming your new self,
Extinguished the last of your kind.
Red is my soul, painted by the blood I bleed,
Drowned the trust I need
