Barriers you cannot deal with,
Hard like forging a sword from ice-cold steel.
Try stopping all those blows with a decayed shield.
Strikes, when they hit, your flesh won't feel.

Dream forever like a child,
Dream for the things that are lost for a lifetime,
Dream for a life that's not tainted with lust.
Dreamers are meant to stay alive.

Listen to the song of the wind!
A tale where the winds blow strong.
The silent chanter of the tales
Wanders back on strange roads.
Lay your dreams on the song of the wild,
A tale where the wolves are howling strong.
The silent chanter of the tales
Wanders back to home.

If there is...

A home.
Is that what you want?
Is that what you dream of?
Is that what you would pay for
With you life?

Listen to the song of the wind!
A tale where the winds blow strong.
The silent chanter of the tales
Wanders back on strange roads.
Lay your dreams on the song of the wild,
A tale where the wolves are howling strong.
The silent chanter of the tales
Wanders back to home.
