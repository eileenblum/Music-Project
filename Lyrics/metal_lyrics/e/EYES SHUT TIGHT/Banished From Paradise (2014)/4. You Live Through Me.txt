I tried to be a best friend
For every one for every one
I tried to be a lover for every on for every one
I work so hard every day you lose your self any way
I count the days loosing friends again so any way

I stay alone so any way 
I die alone so any way

I tried to give my faith
To every one to every one
I tried to be a good boy for every one for every one
The passion is lost my love is gone any way counting days
Now it's time, the passion is lost at last so any way....

I stay alone, no any way 
I die alone, no any way

No body feels me [3x]
No body knows me

I stay alone no any way
I die alone no any way

I am giving in no more trying for every one
I've realized I am gonna say good bye to every one
No body knows me no one 
No body see's me
I am so done
Counting days the passion is lost
My love is gone, so any way

I stay alone, no any way 
I die alone, so any way 
Nobody feels me [3x]
No body knows me
I stay alone so any way
I die alone.......
