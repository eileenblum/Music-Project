We believe in many things
But our lives fall apart
Some people try to escape
Suicide, suicide

Destroy our childhood
Are misunderstood
We're losing more and more
Ourselves, self-control

[2x]
We are born in the underworld
Never see the light
Inside
We are banished from paradise
Born to fall
Never rise

It's the world destiny
Play games to survive
Some people try to escape
Suicide, suicide

They teach us "be helpful" (no!)
Pray for a better life
Destroy our living space
More and more, our minds

[2x]
We are born in the underworld
Never see the light
Inside
We are banished from paradise
Born to fall
Never rise

We are born in the underworld [3x]
Never see the light
Inside

We are born in the underworld [2x]
We are born

[2x]
We are born in the underworld
Never see the light
Inside
We are banished from paradise
Born to fall
Never rise

We are born in the underworld
We are banished from paradise
We are born in the underworld
