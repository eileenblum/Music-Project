Now that I'm done wasting the days
I'll make them fade away

Serene tides lead my sight

I'll keep a part of myself from your little lie
Still, I can't go away, till the end of play

Turn and see what I made when you left here
You might find downward tides carry your song
Summer eyes, freely falling, now lead into the earth

Waiting for me, let the story end here
So many things leave me
Too resigned my life unfolds
And I play the nobody, someone I don't know

I'm still afraid to stare into your eyes
I'll start believing, see me in a different light

I'll keep a part of myself from your little lie
Still, I can't break away till the end

Turn and see what I made when you left here
You might find downward tides carry your song
Summer eyes, freely falling, now lead into the earth
