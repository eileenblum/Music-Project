Father, you know why and still you deny
You tried to own the world and make each day paradise

Though all the years lead us far from the path
We have time, We have all we need

Searching the pages that you left me
Many times I've tried to see through the night
Casual eyes and fragile sighs beat down
Down on me, cursing every memory

Though all the years lead us far from the path
Find your way, find me now

Will you embrace the promise of spring?
So I can live the scene
You cannot relive those forgotten years
So join me now my father

Paradise, I could see, when I looked too far
I know you understand, please forgive me lonely man

Will you embrace the promise of spring?
So I can live the scene
You cannot relive those forgotten years
So join me now my father

Peaceful night, fallen leaves
Birth of a song so shapeless and free
Honesty opens me to the past
To you

Will you embrace the promise of spring?
So I can live the scene
You cannot relive those forgotten years
So join me now my father
