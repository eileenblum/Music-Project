Born in sin, hailed too late
In the shade of a dying tree we heard her voice

Now we wish to turn away
And leave this burden for another day

Secret places no one else can see
Built to save us, they forgave us
Heirs of this broken land
Show us our kingdom now

As we walk the streets that we've known
Fear hides the dreams in every eye

Not a soul will speak our name
Have we lost our people's trust and innocence?

Secret places no one else can see
Built to save us, they forgave us
Heirs of this broken land
Seek our home

Sacred faces from the endless sea
They will save us, smiles forgave us
Heirs of this woken land
Show us our kingdom now

Blood of their blood
Who will be the chosen one?

Find me, flawlessly
Clear and open breeze

Side by side we creep
Fleeing from the deep

Secret places no one else can see
Built to save us, they forgave us
Heirs of this broken land
Seek our home

Sacred faces from the endless sea
They will save us, smiles forgave us
Heirs of this woken land
Show us our kingdom now

Blood of their blood
Who will be the chosen one?
