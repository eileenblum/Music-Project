Ever after tonight
Softly walking through ready-made streets

Red light flies seizing my eyeline

Sleep is all that I need right now
But the lights won't let me go
Standing by, standing by

Red light flies diseased for all time

Sell me, sell you
Make readers new

Sell me, sell you
Believe it through and  through

One more time you'll hear me cry
And then I'm done

Stand by
