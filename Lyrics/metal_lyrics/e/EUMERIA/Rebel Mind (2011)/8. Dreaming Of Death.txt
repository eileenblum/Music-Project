The empty stage where dreams were made
Calls the dead to pay their debt

Dreaming of death I followed the rest
And joined the silver stream
Leaving this life unseen

Will you break my senseless flight with a lullaby?
Sulfurous river, can you deliver burns
To my sacred trust?

Ochre window pane, take me to the place
I've surrendered to the teacher's nightly call

It's not my time, the show is done
I welcome back the life that's mine

"Fragile tide, show me what is mine"

Ochre window pane, take me to the place
I've surrendered to the teacher's nightly call
