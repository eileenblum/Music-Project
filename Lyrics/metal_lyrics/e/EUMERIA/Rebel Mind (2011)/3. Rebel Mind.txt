I never wanted memories
Now I'm forced to fear everlasting songs

"Fill the lines with emotion
Heal one more wound
Never stop this devotion
Wait for the sign
Pass the time with the hope
That freedom will become a friend
You've waited so long."

The rebel mind created madness
And through the years, twisted time
Uneven sides made a good a promise
And sealed the fate of faith

Bear the cost so unseen
I'd wear the smile cos I'd been
A thousand miles from the darkest dream
Now I'm forced to stand and believe I'll feel again

"Fill the lines with emotion
Heal one more wound
Never stop this devotion
Wait for the sign
Pass the time with the hope
That freedom will become a friend
You've waited so long."

The rebel mind created madness
And through the years, twisted time
Uneven sides made a good a promise
And sealed the fate of faith

"Fill the lines with emotion
Never stop this devotion
Side by side."

Filled the lines with emotion
Never stopped this devotion
Passed the time with the hope that it won't be long

Black and white in all ways
I'll be fine the way I am
Age and time won't heal the burden of this life

I never wanted these memories

"Fill the lines with emotion
Heal one more wound
Never stop this devotion
Wait for the sign
Pass the time with the hope
That freedom will become a friend
You've waited so long."

The rebel mind created madness
And through the years, twisted time
Uneven sides made a good a promise
And sealed the fate of faith
