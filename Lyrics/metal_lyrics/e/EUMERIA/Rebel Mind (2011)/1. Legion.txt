Sunlight burns colder than I've ever known
Far from reason, the first-born legion
How can I kill and return to the ones I love?
I'd trade anything

Green eyes show me your mercy
Please I beg you, spare me

Scarring walls with their blackened glory
Praising men who brought us here
Tears flow faster than all the seas far from home

Green eyes show me your mercy
Please I beg you, spare me

Streets in mourning
Hearts have fallen
Silent dawn you tell no lies
Lost forever past the desert
Seeds together in the sand

Premature...the scent of death
Creeps through my lungs like a plague
Summer of weakness will you ever, ever end?

Streets in mourning
Hearts have fallen
Silent dawn you tell no lies
Lost forever past the desert
Seeds together in the sand

Green eyes I'm waiting for you
Just pull the pin and end me

Streets in mourning
Hearts have fallen
Silent dawn you tell no lies
Lost forever past the desert
Bleed together in the sand
