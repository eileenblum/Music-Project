(You're so) paralysed by your ego trips
Throwing stones until something sticks
What kind of mind views the world this way?
The time is right to make you pay

Face it, It's your life
You're just another man
Millions of people around the world
Don't give a damn about you

I know that your life's been hard
But you really were so screwed from the start

Why don't you spare us your misery
Don't you think you've got it good?
Over and  over, the story always bends

Nothing to show for it
Open the other hand
Millions of people around the world
Don't give a damn about you

I know that your life's been hard
But you really were so screwed from the start

You smiling, rabid slave to the not so grand design
Show me just how you conjure deluded paradigms

Millilons of people around the world
Don't give a damn about you

I know that your life's been hard
But you really were so screwed from the start
