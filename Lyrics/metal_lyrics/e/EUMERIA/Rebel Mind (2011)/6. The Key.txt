Inside the heart of everyone
There's lies a truth to be revealed
Crush the shell with perfect circles
It's time to break the ageless dream

Bring me a man who longs for his freedom
Bring him the key that will open the gates to the sky

Now they're alive what will you cling to?
We'll tell tales of elegance
Here are the words you have to read them
Can't you see that there's no other way?

Turn away from shame, never look back again

Bring me a man who longs for his freedom
Is this the answer?

Do our minds ever open wide?
When the light has won
There'll be nowhere left to run

Out of the circle I walk alone
Drive this fiction from every home
If I arrive in this cherished place
Time will fall, close to grace
burning effigies

One day we'll cry the same tears for our loss
Until that day, we'll keep this song
Near to the wrongs of you and I

Do our minds ever open wide?
When the light has won
There'll be nowhere left to run

Do our minds ever open wide?
When the key is found
There'll be nowhere left to hide
