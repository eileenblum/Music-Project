Expelled by the slaves of faith
Victims of their thoughts and doubts
Self determination for those that will not followâ¦
Faith and hope which cannot make them submissive ones
Smudge their path with a legacy of brutalized corpses
Condemnation for those refuses the âonly truthâ
Blood spills on the hereticâs fork
Receive this deadly divine kindness
Suffocating bless
Â 
Banished to the land of bastard traitors
They must suffer that longer and accept the imposed truth
Â 
Theyâre as Immortals as your beliefs
As immortalâs as your path of sins
The ghost of your defiled souls
Rest inside the poison of your prays
Â 
Until it bleeds your neck
Sorrow screams from shadows
Suffocating bless
Â 
Face the blackened eyes
Beyond the cloak of death
Before the blood invade the throat
And the blood spillsâ¦
Â 
This is the choice of a non believer
Become an offering
The last breath
Before the blood invades the throat
Face the blackened eyes
Beyond the cloak of death
Until it completes the fulfillment of their wrath
Relieved for your hypocrisy
Â
