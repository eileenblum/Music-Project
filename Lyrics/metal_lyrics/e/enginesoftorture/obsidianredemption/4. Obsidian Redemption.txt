Â 
Entwined in graves are the figures of beasts that we never could disgorge
Sealed in an obsidian night
Black redemption
Dead skin lies scorched
Among the anvil of liars and bastard saints
In that silent coffin of torment
Damnation
Â 
Distorted screams we still hear
Entangled in woe and forfeit
Tasting the madness on a aching unspoken and growing decay
Â 
Scourge of a unworthy faithful
Walk upon our graves afire
Self based with dogmatic thoughts
Â 
Overhead strings with corpses exposes their fucking truth
Servants of faith
With profane devicesÂ 
Until the ashes of our burning souls spread among our graves
Seal us in that unchaste ground
Obsidian redemption
Haunted by hatred
Chasten the source of chaos
"In articulo mortis
Accipere umbrae de profundis"
Â 
Among the anvil of liars and bastard saints
In that silent coffin of torment
Damnation
Â 
Scourge of an unworthy faithful
Walk upon our graves afire
(Your) corruption make us reborn
Where dead skin lies scorched
Rising with your feared horns
Suffocating you with scorn
Â 
Overhead strings with corpses expose our fucking Aeon
Hold your faith
With you profane devicesÂ 
Until the ashes, your burning souls spreads among your graves
Sealed in that unchaste ground
Obsidian redemption
Â 
Distorted screams you still hear
Entangled in woe and forfeit
Try taste the aching, unspoken and growing decay
Â
