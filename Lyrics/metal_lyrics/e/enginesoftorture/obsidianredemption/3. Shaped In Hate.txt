Can you hear the whisper, unhallowed seeking blood and flesh?
See these ghouls among the origin of the damned races
Hatred legion comes and brings damnation to mankind
Bastard spawns sodomizing lacerated corpses
Â 
Amputation reveals the path for full carnage
Dissolution among the shredding of burning heads
See the anger rising from the anvil of the scourge
Dust of bones adorn the rest of smashed faces
Â 
Unleashed from the chains of misery
The apocalyptic call spreads wrath
To the damned mankind
Â 
Dissolution among the
shredding of burning heads
Amputation
Shaped in Hate
Â 
Pestilence, damnation
Crimson fucking deaths
Immolate the human race
Torture, submission
Poisoned sunrise
Calling up the black plague
Â 
Taste the torment of a thousand cuts
Again they suffer this demise
Â 
Can you feel your brain, unhallowed seeking blood and flesh?
See these ghouls among the origin of the damned races
Hatred legion comes and brings damnation to mankind
Bastard spawns sodomizing lacerated corpses
Through thou mind violent throes of agony and scorn
Part of us you were now shaped in hate
Â
