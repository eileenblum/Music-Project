We're your farthest nightmare
Your fallacies, make us terrorize your soul until
The last whisper, shatter on a thousand shards
Of darkness
Fields of putrefaction cry my words where the dirt
Of our sins rests
Where your souls shed the fear when stare our dark eyes
Â 
Drowned in dead lands
Blackened
Unearthly risen corpses
With Spectral wounds made your
Ornaments of god
Â 
Blaze the minds possessed in holy sacrifices
Peel the enemies' skin
Share the abyss of our blasphemical rites
Praise the shroud of our sins
Â 
We transcends thy (un)holy rites
With worms feeding on your ornaments "and prays within"
Embalmed on a cliff of feeble minds
Taken by hatred, bounded to taste your sadist lullaby
Drowned in madness and torture
And stunned by this the intent of your lies
Â 
Drowned in dead lands
Unearthly risen corpses
Spectral wounds made your
Ornaments of god
Â 
Your fallacies make us terrorize your soul until
The last whisper, shatter on a thousand shards
Of darkness
Fields of putrefaction cry my words where the dirt
Of our sins rests
Where your souls shed the fear when stare our dark eyes
Â 
Among the cried words of our demised world
We take you turning your crosses rot
Â 
Blaze the minds possessed in holy sacrifices
Peel the enemies' skin
Share the abyss of our blasphemical rites
Praise the shroud of our hate
Die
Â 
With our torment you desecrate the own beliefs
Joining to the "shadows of scorn"
Among the cried words of our demised world
We take you turning your crosses rot
