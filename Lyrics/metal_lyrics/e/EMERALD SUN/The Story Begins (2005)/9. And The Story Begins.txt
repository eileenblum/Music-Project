The flame of the candle is fadding away
The moon gives its place to the new rising day
My scrollpaper's writting my gratefull dreams
So now my quest starts and the story begins

I'm ridding the oceans I'm reaching the hills
And crossing the forests from west to the east
I'm singing my stories were ever i go
My biggest andventures the hole world to know

But as the day is fadding and moonlight appears
I'm lighting the candles again
I stand in the forest rewriting my dreams
Until my next journey begins
