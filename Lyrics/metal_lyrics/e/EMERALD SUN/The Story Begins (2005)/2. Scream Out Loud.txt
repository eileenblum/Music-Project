We are the future
The youth crying with tears in their eyes
We're screaming for freedom
No more promises they're all lies

Help us find our way

The battles of life
Are becoming straighter every day
The walls of our nations
Will fall in a minute today

Help us find our way
Now it's time to say...

That we're here to scream out loud
We don't need to ask for mercy
Feel the anger, feel the power, feel the pain
We will fight until the end
We will earn the right for living
In the future
We'll be breathing free again

So try to fit yourself into a paradise

We're trying to pull out
The venom that tears off our spine
We don't wanna put
Ourselves into a stream
That's no crime

Never hesitate
Now it's not too late

'Cause we're here to scream out loud
We don't need to ask for mercy

Feel the anger, feel the power, feel the pain
We will fight until the end
We will earn the right for living
In the future
We'll be breathing free again

So try to fit yourself in your hell

We will fight until the end
We will earn the right for living
In the future
We'll be breathing free again
