For many years I travel
To a land that 's miles away
And now the time has come
To find a place for me to stay
But before that time arrive
I have many things to say
Come along and stay behind
We are traveling today...

Many miles away
From the land we step today
There 's a place
Beyond your dreams
And far away
There my father was the ruler
Faced his fate because he signed
For the power
That the world had never seen

A myth comes from the past
Says that death is coming fast
If you use the blade
But that is not the last
So he used the sword of dragons
Took the power in his hands
Made himself a king
-You 're waiting for the end?

[Bridge:]
Filled with dragon tears...
There 's the lake of fears...

[Chorus:]
The guardians of the lake
Show the path you have to take
The night is long, you have to stay awake
Don't you start the fight
You will break the curse tonight
To the lake you 'll throw the sword...
Of the light

I have seen the flame
Coming hot out of his eyes
As he told me what to do
Before he die
Now I say the same thing to you
You must hear me my good friend
'Cause I 'm tired and tonight
Our trip will end

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Final words of mine
Cause my life runs out of time
You must take the sword
But don't you cross the line
As my father crossed before you
And he carried the last curse
You must throw it or else
You will face the worst

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
