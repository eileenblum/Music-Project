Lost,
Into the night, under the moonlight
Darkness falling
You, you're searching the path
That leads to the light

I'll
Be there by your side
To show you the right way
Don't deny it
Raise your hands watch the sky
I am passing by

Aaa?

[Bridge:]
You know I am the one
That I always spread the rays of fire
You I am the one
To show you how

Try
And you'll find the way
That will lead you to the
Tomb of glory
Don't, do not give it up
There's no turning back

Hear
The wind's passing by
Just listen the whisper
Someone's calling
Oh! The savior will come
You know I'm the one

[Bridge:]
That I'll always walk
By your side towards
The daily light yeah
Raise your head and watch me
I'll be there

[Chorus:]
...In the sky
I am flying so high
I will always spread fire
For eternal life
...In the sky
You all know I won't die
And you 'll see my rays falling
Crossing the night
...In the sky

As I hear the wind
That blows right by my ear
I know there 's no one just like me
'Cause I feel alive
As I rise above the mountains
And I fly high in the sky

[Bridge]
You know I am the one
That I always spread the rays of fire
You I am the one
To show you how
That I'll always walk
By your side towards
The daily light yeah
Raise your head and watch me
I'll be there

[Chorus]
