Now that my time has come to go
Please stand by my side
Hold the tears and say goodbye
Fill my heart with hopeful dreams
Let them be my guide to where I go

Touch your heart and close your eyes
I'll always be there, I will be the shiny star
The wind in your hair, whisper on!

You're not alone...

I must walk my path today
To the landscape of light
Though my thoughts will hold you tight
Now there's nothing left to say
Please wish me fair way
I'm not coming back

Touch your heart and close your eyes
I'll always be there, I will be the shiny star
The wind in your hair, whisper on!

You're not alone...

I'll be there when moonlight fills the night
When crystal rain will fall down from the sky
And my hands will be wiping off your tears
I will be there

Touch your heart and close your eyes
I'll always be there, I will be the shiny star
The wind in your hair, whisper on!

Touch your heart and close your eyes
I'll always be there, I will be the shiny star
The wind in your hair, whisper on!

You're not alone...
Say you're not alone
...Whisper on!
You're not alone...
