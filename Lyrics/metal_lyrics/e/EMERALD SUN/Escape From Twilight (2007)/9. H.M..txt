From the time that you appeared
And for over thirty years
We've been riding the sound with guitars

From the time we've touched the strings
And felt the lightning coming out
There's nothing but metal to think

There's power in us all
A lot of strength inside us
Feel it in our hearts
And our souls are still devoted to

Heavy metal
Once you will hear it
There's no turning back
Heavy metal
This is a gift that God gave to us
Heavy metal
Once you will hear it
There's no turning back
Heavy metal
This is a gift that God gave to us

And it will sound for eternity

All the hard arpeggio solos
And the power on the stage
Are like a whiplash
That's whipping our minds

All those years live and loud
With all the metal-heads on our side
There's nothing to fear at all

There's power in us all
A lot of strength inside us
Feel it in our hearts
And our souls are still devoted to

Heavy metal
Once you will hear it
There's no turning back
Heavy metal
This is a gift that God gave to us
Heavy metal
Once you will hear it
There's no turning back
Heavy metal
This is a gift that God gave to us

And it will sound for eternity

There's power in us all
A lot of strength inside us
Feel it in our hearts
And our souls are still devoted to

Heavy metal
Once you will hear it
There's no turning back
Heavy metal
This is a gift that God gave to us
Heavy metal
Once you will hear it
There's no turning back
Heavy metal
This is a gift that God gave to us

And it will sound for eternity
