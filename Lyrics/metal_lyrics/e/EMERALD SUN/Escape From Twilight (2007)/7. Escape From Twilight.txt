Thousands and thousands
Of moments will pass
And your life will come to an end
You'll be wondering
How many things you have lost
So stand up and live on again

See your life from another point of view
Walk on with your head up high
Don't you think what you're giving
But what you can get
And reach for the glory of life

For once in your life make some noise
Do something, try, help yourself to survive
For once in your life raise your voice

I am alive

Escape from twilight
Escape...rise from the ashes
Of your burning soul
Escape from twilight
For once in your life try to escape

Live for the moment
Don't you waste your time
And don't say that nothing's for free
Life is full of surprises
You'll see what I mean
Open your wings in the sky

For once in your life make some noise...
Do something, try to escape to survive
For once in your life raise your voice

I am alive

Escape from twilight
Escape from twilight
Rise from the ashes
Of your burning soul
Escape from twilight
For once in your life try to escape
Escape

...Twilight...
...Twilight...
...Twilight...

Life...
Marches on...
The years will fly...
Don't waste your time...
Live before it's too late...

Escape from twilight
Escape...
Rise from the ashes of your burning soul
Escape from twilight

For once in your life try to escape
...Escape
