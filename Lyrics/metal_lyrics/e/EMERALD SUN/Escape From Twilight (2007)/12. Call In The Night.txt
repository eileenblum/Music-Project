[Japanese bonus track]

Stranger...
My thoughts are crawling in the night
Sorrow...
The sky is falling, agony

[Bridge:]
I wait in front the mirror for an answer
I really don't know why and for what
My flame is fading, I 'll survive this terror
I 'm screaming, can't you hear me call the night?

Terror...
My eyes are blind, can't look your face
Nightmares...
Have stole my dreams and took your place

[Bridge]

How many days have fell into my suffer
How many tears have filled my nights with pain
I'm still alive but deep inside I'm dying
I'm screaming can't you hear me call the night?

[Chorus:]
The creepy silence
I 'm laughing loud
Fire is burning
My soul

Stranger...
My thoughts are crawling in the night
Sorrow...
Can't you hear me calling...?
in the night
