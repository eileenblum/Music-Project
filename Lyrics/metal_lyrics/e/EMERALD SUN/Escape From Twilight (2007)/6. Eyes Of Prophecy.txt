Long,
Is the path that takes you in
To meet your secret dream
That you're keeping in your fantasy

Sleep,
In the night on a magical tree
Close your eyes and you will see
That your dream will become reality

Search,
In your unborn seven dreams
To find dragons and kings
The empty nights of the oldest world

Sleep,
In a landscape drawn by the sun
Your dream it shall be done
'Cause you have the eyes of prophecy

"I see the horizon,
I see the stars in the sky
I see birds around the sun,
I wish I could fly
To see the paradise,
Where there's no cry
But this is only a dream,
I wish I could die..."

The eyes of prophecy
The eyes of prophecy
The eyes of prophecy
The eyes of prophecy
