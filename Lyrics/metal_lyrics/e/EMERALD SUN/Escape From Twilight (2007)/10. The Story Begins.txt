The flame of the candle
Is fading away
The moon gives its place
To the new rising day
My scroll paper's writing
My grateful dreams
So now my quest starts
And the story begins

I'm riding the oceans
I'm reaching the hills
And crossing the forests
From west to the east
I'm singing my stories
Where ever I go
My biggest adventures
The whole world to know

But as the day's fading
And moonlight appears
I'm lighting the candles again
I stand in the forest
Rewriting my dream
Until my next journey begins

...Begins

But as the day's fading
And moonlight appears
I'm lighting the candles again
I stand in the forest
Rewriting my dream
Until my next journey begins

The flame of the candle
Is fading away
The moon gives its place
To the new rising day
My scroll paper's writing
My grateful dreams
So now my quest starts
And the story begins

I'm riding the oceans
I'm reaching the hills
And crossing the forests
From west to the east
I'm singing my stories
Where ever I go
My biggest adventures
The whole world to know
