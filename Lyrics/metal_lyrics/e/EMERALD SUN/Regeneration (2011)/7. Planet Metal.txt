Far into the universe a million light-years away
There is a secret planet
There're some unknown forms of life

This planet is a paradise for every Gabian metalhead
I've checked it on my monitor
My antennas never lie

All set... All the crew must take their places
Countdown... we're leaving planet Gabe
(3,2,1, ignition)

We're all leaving for p.m.
Long trip beyond the stars
Excitement of a new world's straight ahead
Ten seconds after Mars
Just set the speed of light
We've found ourselves a place like paradise

I hope we are the only ones
Who made this trip from outerspace
But damn... if there are metalheads
This is the meeting place

I just canât hold my 20 feet
I'm anxious make it faster please
Stop it or I'll radiate you
You won't leave a trace

Touch down... behave yourselfs we're out of the spaceship
Hot flush... at last we're down on earth

We're all leaving for p.m.
Long trip beyond the stars
Excitement of a new world's straight ahead
Ten seconds after Mars
Just set the speed of light
We've found ourselves a place like paradise

(One small step from a Gabian
One huge step for gabianity)

Oh dear!!! The mean Galacto is right behind us
Oh shit!!! We're crushing planet Gabe
(aaaahhhhh!!!)

We're all leaving for p.m.
Long trip beyond the stars
Excitement of a new world's straight ahead
Ten seconds after Mars
Just set the speed of light
We've found ourselves a place like paradise

(Damn spaceship, it's always broken)
