It's your idea - we need to be mistaken
You always got to be misunderstood
You thought we weren't good enough to face you
Who made you judge to say what's right or wrong

But the lightning always strikes twice
Be prepared to face the truth

Now
We won't fall
The gods are on our side
We are the youth - we are the future
Now
We won't fall
The power is in our hands
We have our dreams - we claim the future

We're on to you - wake up we're not that stupid
Stop lying is it so hard for you to see
We've had enough of all those accusations
Just take your lies and shove them up your ass

But the lightning always strikes twice
Be prepared to the truth

Now
We won't fall
The gods are on our side
We are the youth - we are the future
Now
We won't fall
The power is in our hands
We have our dreams - we claim the future

Who made you judge to say
What's right or wrong
Only two words coming to
My mind now... Fuck "yeah"

But the lightning always strikes twice
Be prepared to the truth

Now
We won't fall
The gods are on our side
We are the youth - we are the future
Now
We won't fall
The power is in our hands
We have our dreams - we claim the future
