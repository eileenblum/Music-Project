Hell's rising from
Within your soul
Your eyes are blazing fire
Your tweaking mind
Is dying in your head

You always walk the wicked way
And acting like a fool
Your poison's in your veins
So shut your mouth I'm done with you
Walk away

Speak of the devil
You're loosing sense - I'm hell-sent for you
Speak of the devil
You can't walk away your soul belongs to me
Speak of the devil

There's a one way ride for you my boy
And turning back is not an option
Say goodbye to all the ones you love
The midnight train is already in motion

Purgatory waits for you my friend
And there's a seat with your name on it
You're passing through the gates of hell

Speak of the devil
You're loosing sense - I'm hell-sent for you
Speak of the devil
You can't walk away your soul belongs to me
Speak of the devil

You will be punished for your sins
These sins been done by you
Your sands of time are running fast
Your flesh and blood will turn to dust

Speak of the devil
You're loosing sense - I'm hell-sent for you
Speak of the devil
You can't walk away your soul belongs to me
Speak of the devil
You've lost your sense - now hell awaits for you
Speak of the devil
In vain you pray, your soul is here to stay
Speak of the devil
