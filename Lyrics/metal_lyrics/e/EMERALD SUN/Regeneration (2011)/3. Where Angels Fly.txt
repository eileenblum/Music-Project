Always pushed the dark
Not the last in line, someday
We'll be sharing our
Thoughts in heaven

Always forced to do this
Always tricked to do that
Patience without limitations

Hold all your strength
Until one day
The time will come...
We'll find the way

We'll be there together
Where angels fly
Where all desires
Are coming to life
Where our dreams can be alive
And stuck in our hearts
Forever

Now society is blind saying
It doesn't worth a dime
Let you rot in your rusty cages
Time to open our eyes
Time to open our souls
Receive what we
Deserved for ages

Release your strength
Today is the day
The time has come
Now walk your way

We'll be there together
Where angels fly
Where all desires
Are coming to life
Where our dreams can be alive
And stuck in our hearts
Forever
