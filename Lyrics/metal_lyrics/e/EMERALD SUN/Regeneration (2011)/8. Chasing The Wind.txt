Every time I look back into my life
I feel my pain growing in my heart
Nobody has ever cared for me

But I know this is my chance
I'm spreading my wings
To reach for the sky

I am chasing the wind
Seems like it blows
Where my heart beats
Riding on the clouds
I'm falling back into my life
I am chasing the wind
Seems like it blows
Where my heart beats
Every breath I take I feel I'm free
Chasing the wind

I won't regret fort things
I'll do tomorrow
Only those I missed the chance to do
The day will come to justify my anger

There's a way I seize the day
This is my right to reach for the sky

I am chasing the wind
Seems like it blows
Where my heart beats
Riding on the clouds
I'm falling back into my life
I am chasing the wind
Seems like it blows
Where my heart beats
Every breath I take I feel I'm free
Chasing the wind

I seize the day this is my right
I'm leaving my worries behind
This is my chance - I'm spreading my wings
To reach for the sky

I am chasing the wind
Seems like it blows
Where my heart beats
Riding on the clouds
I'm falling back into my life
I am chasing the wind
Seems like it blows
Where my heart beats
Every breath I take I feel I'm free
Chasing the wind
