What do you see when you look in my eyes
A brand new future
How came you havenât yet figure that out
It's like a picture

Is it so hard for you to understand
I'm no messiah heaven sent
Full of arrogance and lies
Your life before my eyes

Welcome to the other side
You will see two worlds collide

In the theatre of pain
The demon smiles - your hands are shaking
We're the monsters you've created
We're here to take your soul

Starting the show
Watch it reflecting your life gone wasted
The curtain falls, the lights are out
And the crowd is gone

Now face the truth - fame is just fading away
Nobody liked your crappy play
Open eyes and realize
No time to compromise

Take the script back in your hand
You will change the bitter end

In the theatre of pain
The demon smiles - your hands are shaking
We're the monsters you've created
We're here to take your soul

Welcome to your show - your life is set on stage
Ready or not - you must perform
Where desire lies behind in the theatre of pain

In the theatre of pain
The demon smiles - your hands are shaking
We're the monsters you've created
We're here to take your soul
