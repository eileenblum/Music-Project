Welcome to a polluting nation
To a mindcontrol
Where we gain our own salvation
On another fall

Do not seek the mighty justice
It's been gone away
All you find's some frightened faces
That's the world today

Don't lose your faith just believe in yourself
New chance arrives move your way
Forget the past a new day will last
Your wish granted by falling stars

I am a starchild from the sky above
I'm on my way to bring you light
Now it's the time for regeneration
Forever shine in your eyes

Don't you try to misconcept us
With a bunch of lies
All we want is a better future
Nobody denies

Heading for the end of days
The message has been sent
Punishment will be objective
No time to regret

Prepare yourself to stand at the edge of time
Witness the new life begins
Erase the lie, the tear from your eye
I'll take your soul up to the sky

I am a starchild from the sky above
I'm on my way to bring you light
Now it's the time for regeneration
Forever shine in your eyes
