For me
You would walk through fire to see my devise
Would betray your god no matter what's the price
Where there's justice still my breath is in the air
I can vanquish all the sorrow and despair

But I
I am just a word if you will loose your aim
"Serve no masters" is the meaning of my name
For all destiny and love I am the key
If you got the strength look what they've done to me

Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

Shame!
We've lost our values look what we became
The flame in our hearts isnât the same
Fight!
Noone can tell you if it's wrong or right
Ignite!
The spark forgotten inside

Head up high - be the dissenter
In our code there's no surrender

Freedom call
Strikes a lightning in us all
We can sail across the oceans, cause a wave that breaks the wall
Freedom call
Strikes a lightning in us all
Just one step into the circle, and the rock begins to roll
Insane
Is how we turned all the sunlight to ra
Arraign
All those who poisoned your brain
Ally!
Join forces, be a needle in their eye
Retry!
We don't have to live this lie

Head up high - be the dissenter
In our code there's no surrender
