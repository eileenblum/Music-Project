There was a star in the sky
Lonely and brighter than all
That bright star was mine
A long time ago

There is a light in our heart
Enlighting our warrior soul
To help us restart
Achieving our goal

Stars, legacy of night, from another world
Travellers, servants of the light, let the truth unfold

Can you feel it all in your veins?
Can you hear the golden age call?
It's breaking the chains
For once and for all

Stars, legacy of night, from another world
Travellers, servants of the light, let the truth unfold

Just leave all the sorrows behind
Escape all your fears and start leading the blind
With servants of light by our side
We are saving our kind

Stars, legacy of night, from another world
Travellers, servants of the light, let the truth unfold
Stars, legacy of night, from another world
Travellers, servants of the light, let the truth unfold
