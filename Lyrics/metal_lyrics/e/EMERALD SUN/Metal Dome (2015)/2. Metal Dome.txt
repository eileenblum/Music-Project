"A long time ago...as the powers of universe united...
They created a sound that was meant to stay forever
A unity of rebels was born
As decades past by, this unity grew stronger and until today,
Wherever this people meet, they turn the place...
...into a metal dome"

Far away on holy ground
Miles away you hear the sound
There's a church one of a kind
Enter and free your mind

A place full of inspiration
Under no one's obligation
Starting there where others end
This is what we demand

In this majesty and might
We're baptized in strength and pride

Praising choirs fill the air
Tunes of thunder everywhere
That's the place I call my home
Skin of leather - blazing chrome
A common bound - no segregation
One sound - one united nation
This is where I'm feeling home
Welcome to the metal dome

It's the temple of creation
Only here you'll find salvation
Freedom at its purest sense
Honor and deliverance

A mass of eternal pleasure
Come on in and share the treasure
Feel the power of the gods
We stand against all odds

In this majesty and might
We're baptized in strength and pride

Praising choirs fill the air
Tunes of thunder everywhere
That's the place I call my home
Skin of leather - blazing chrome
A common bound - no segregation
One sound - one united nation
This is where I'm feeling home
Welcome to the metal dome
