Don't try to convince me to stay, I won't
My life is a journey away from home
I'm never rewinding the time
But I know where I come from
As old vision is past its prime
I'm just passing through this world

Tomorrow's the shine of today, no lie
We live and we die all the same, we fly

I've seen old things turning to dust
It has changed my point of view
Delusions belong to the past it's being
A failure or be true?

Life is dust and bones
Life is dust and bones

There's some things about which I care
And some things that I beware
I'm part of the eternal birth
Pass the spirit around the earth

Life is dust and bones
Life is dust and bones
