Your life is in danger
You're tired of barriers
Your friend's a stranger
Your last chance disappears

No coexistence
Just prey for shark
No last resistance
To the dark

Don't rely on their word
It's all so absurd
Just try to reveal
What they try to conceal

Never follow the world's rules
Like a sheep among the wolves
Set yourself free day by day
Be no part of this decay
Be a screamer in the storm
Tear down and reform

All cursed in stillness
To live by the chain
Drowned in the sadness
Of our brain

Don't rely on their word
It's all so absurd
Just try to reveal
What they try to conceal

Never follow the world's rules
Like a sheep among the wolves
Set yourself free day by day
Be no part of this decay
Be a screamer in the storm
Tear down and reform

Encircled blackness everywhere
No command! No man's land!
Voices screaming in the air

Never follow the world's rules
Like a sheep among the wolves
Set yourself free day by day
Be no part of this decay
Be a screamer in the storm
Tear down and reform
