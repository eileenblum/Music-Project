Cuts like a knife
I lie here dreaming for a while
About all the things that matter in my life and I...
I awaited the day for the price I had to pay
Just to see them come alive
Being born but then they die

So I realize
All dreams can turn to ashes when they're gone
And a new beginning is at dawn

Deal of joy unsigned, once again
Leave the past behind, I wish I can
It was a mere reflection of a false perfection
And a change of plans

Woke up today
With sadness marked right in my face
But behind this mask I'm strong, I have to keep the pace
A new initiation as the sun shines so bright
And the dark is wasted by the gleam and the light
So I realize dreams are born when I'm losing my aim
Like a phoenix rising from the flames

Deal of joy unsigned, once again
Leave the past behind, I wish I can
It was a mere reflection of a false perfection
And a change of plans

How can I turn my back to fate
And then rely on something fake
Asking myself if this could be
And why it's happening to me

Don't try to preach what you ignore
I've heard these words of yours before
I know the mirror never lies
If you see truth with your own eyes

Deal of joy unsigned, once again
Leave the past behind, I wish I can
It was a mere reflection of a false perfection
And a change of plans

Plans so strong that bound me into this web of lies
But now I'm free - the inner drive never dies
