We've been led to live in segregation
Only torture and tears in our eyes
Left alone amongst this devastation
Watching the human flame as it slowly dies

Providence points to our destination
Can't you see you've got to search to find
Vanish the haze of intoxication
Clear your sight and you'll see what lies behind

So let us all sing along
As we are racing with destiny
Discover where we belong
Cause unity sets free
We are a crowd millions strong
When we are racing with destiny
So many hearts can't be wrong
Our unity at last will set us free...

Raise your hands search out for revelation
The golden key is at the end of the chain
Unlock the gateways for the infestation
Where there will be no pain, ever again

So let us all sing along
As we are racing with destiny
Discover where we belong
Cause unity sets free
We are a crowd millions strong
When we are racing with destiny
So many hearts can't be wrong
Our unity at last will set us free...

...and now we're forced together, stand side by side
This bound will last forever till our worlds collide

Raise your hands search out for revelation
The golden key is at the end of the chain
Unlock the gateways for the infestation
Where there will be no pain, ever again

So let us all sing along
As we are racing with destiny
Discover where we belong
Cause unity sets free
We are a crowd millions strong
When we are racing with destiny
So many hearts can't be wrong
Our unity at last will set us free...
