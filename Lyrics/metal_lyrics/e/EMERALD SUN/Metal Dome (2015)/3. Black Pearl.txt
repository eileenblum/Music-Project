Near dark
And the wind is howling
Black mark
Branded in his mind
His mission is to save mankind

Grey skies
Over red horizons
Strength dies
In the pouring rain
But in his eyes no signs of strain

Sent by spirits from above
To find a pearl with secret powers
Takes his chances to hang tough
With the urge kept deep inside

Now he found his way for a better day
Over seas and through the highest mountains
Ready to fulfil with his iron will
To succeed and to find the black pearl

War cries
Against death and darkness
Strange eyes
Etched in every stone
Await the warrior unknown

Last fight
Between good and evil
First sight
Of a helping hand
His legend's heard across the land

Sent by spirits from above
To find a pearl with secret powers
Takes his chances to hang tough
With the urge kept deep inside

Now he found his way for a better day
Over seas and through the highest mountains
Ready to fulfil with his iron will
To succeed and to find the black pearl
