With lies and suits they try to rule our lives
To all of them we seem so plain
But only truth and honesty survives
It's time to brand it in their brains

Try to hypnotize me with your lies
Burn me! - From the ashes I'll arise
Hate and fear become allies

All these years standing in line
Your shade was over my shine
Was a prisoner but I don't feel the same
All these years m roar was rough
Think I suffered long enough
I became a beast you will never tame
Blood on your name

Raised us all - gave us fake hopes and dreams
It's over now - bid you farewell
Our turn now to listen to your screams
And send your ashes straight to hell

Try to hypnotize me with your lies
Burn me! - From the ashes I'll arise
Hate and fear become allies
