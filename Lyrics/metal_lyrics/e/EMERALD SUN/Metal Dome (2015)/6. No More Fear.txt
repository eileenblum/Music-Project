Treating us like fools - spreading all the fear
Breaking all the rules - while our rights disappear
Pain, grief, suffering but I ain't gonna take anymore

A new disease around - they've already got the cure
Like prophets they may sound - but I am not so sure
How much more time will it take to realize what we ignore?

We've got the power
Transform darkness to light
Let's change this world
Starting tonight

No more fear
They frighten us to take our life's control
No more fear
All we need is hidden in our soul

Make up your own mind - read between the lines
See what lies behind - recognize the signs
Heading straight to a godless place of no return

Time to make some noise - it is them or me
Time to make a choice - I will disagree
Listen to your inner voice and give the handle another turn

We've got the power
Transform darkness to light
Let's change this world
Starting tonight

No more fear
They frighten us to take our life's control
No more fear
All we need is hidden in our soul
