Saw the devine
The source of time
Witnessing how life started
From the first dawn
Till all is gone
Everything carved in stone

Erase the grey
Wipe tears away
Paint the ceiling with kindness
Delight is near
It's crystal clear
Nature's call will appear

Secrets only a few realize
Spirits bound to the nature
The voice within your soul gets in disguise
And you feel the call of nature arise

The unions entry has opened the doors
Universe is awaiting
The edge of darkness, the ending of wars
Guides us to heaven's shores

Love is the key of what will be
Recover ancient donations
Along the trace
Left to replace
To end this inhuman race
