Your hopes were high, but I'm down below.
You thought I was your light you couldn't see through the smoke.
Forget me.
Don't play with fire or you will get burned.
The pain runs deep but you still never learn.
For every scar on your conscience, another scar undeserved.
Separate yourself from me. I don't want you to hurt.
You lost yourself in the wake of my ways.
In my self destructive emotional state.
I hope one day you forget my face.
And live your life with nothing but the brightest of days.
Don't wait for me to change, just know I'm trying.
Our connection was profound but now it's fucking dying.
I know my flaws have left you worn out and bitter.
What we had was beautiful. Now it's exhausted and weathered because of me.
Don't wait up for me I will weigh you down.
Don't think of me now that I'm not around.
Just ease your pain and go away.
You're better off without me in your way.
Don't play with fire or you will get burned.
The pain runs deep but you still never learn.
For every scar on your conscience, another scar undeserved.
Separate yourself from me. I don't want you to hurt.
I wish for nothing but to be a ghost of someone that you used to know.
And you will move on, so forget me.
Forget me.
