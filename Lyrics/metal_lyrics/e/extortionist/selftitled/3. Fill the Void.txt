Hear them singing softly.
My demons dance in sunless light.
Come and take my body.
Submit your worries to the night.
Vices holding tightly.
Won't you stay for a while?
Troubled soul tread lightly.
Submit your worries to the night.
Temptation burns when presented with debauchery.
I find myself head first into all these awful things.
Anything not to feel alone.
Anything not to feel so fucking empty.
Another night crawling home and waking up to another sight I don't want to
see.
When I'm inside there's only one face I see.
I can't get you off my mind, settle for bad company.
And you might be what I want, but you're not what I need.
Yeah it's been so long since I have felt something.
We lay our hearts to waste when our tongues are tied.
Another dance in the sheets, another year goes by.
The emptiness it will never subside.
Anything to fill the void for a night.
I find no comfort in silence.
This weary heart will roam.
I got no one to confide in.
I'll sink to the bottom and sleep alone.
Temptation burns when presented with debauchery.
I find myself head first into all these awful things.
Anything not to feel alone.
Anything not to feel so fucking empty.
Another night crawling home and waking up to another sight I don't want to see.
We lay our hearts to waste when our tongues are tied.
Another dance in the sheets, another year goes by.
The emptiness it will never subside.
Anything to fill the void for a night.
Drink the bottle down while we gather around in this time of sin.
I know these games that you play.
See through the lies you portray.
But I still let you win.
As long as I don't stay alone for the night.
Distract me from this darkness that has been clouding my mind.
And I don't care if you're not here when the sun starts to rise.
Anything to fill the void for a night.
Anything to fill the void.
Anything to fill this fucking void.
