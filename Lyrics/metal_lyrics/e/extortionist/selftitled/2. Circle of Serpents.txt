Circle of serpents, yeah.
Slither your way through life with manipulation and lies.
Constricting me of spending my time on the brighter side.
Drained me of my light and I watched you smile.
Feeding of my pain, make it go away.
Trapped inside your game.
Free me from this fucking torment that you put me through.
I can't wait 'til I can rid myself of you.
It wasn't enough that my soul was left tattered and bruised.
You let your circle of serpents tear me in two.
Cut out my tongue so I can't fucking speak.
You find your way back to me through every person that I meet.
So stay the fuck away. Yeah
Is this what gets you off?
Do you find peace with yourself while you put me through hell?
It's people like you that are miserable inside.
One day you will be exposed of all your lies.
Cut out my tongue so I can't fucking speak.
You find your way back to me through every person that I meet.
For who I thought was a stranger, just a pawn of your deceit.
I can't wait 'til your grasp on me finally sets me free.
Just let me fucking be, bitch.
I will charm the snakes no fucking longer.
No.
