Bound by poison.
Stacking bodies, I watched them fall one by one.
Connections bound by the poison.
None of my friends really give a fuck.
Spend your years breaking your back trying to make the connection last.
Only to realize the ones you love will leave.
Save your words. Rid me of the shit that falls from your teeth.
Keep drowning yourself in your dirty pool of dishonesty.
I've played the game and you will never, ever fucking fool me.
Stacking bodies, I watched them fall one by one.
Connections bound by the poison.
None of my friends really give a fuck.
Spend your years breaking your back trying to make the connection last.
I played a part is my own misfortune.
Buried myself in my own destruction.
Burnt every bridge that lead me out of the darkness.
At the end of the day all you have is yourself.
All you have is your fucking self. No cries for help.
Motherfucker what?
No cries for help.
Stacking bodies, I watched them fall one by one.
Connections bound by the poison.
None of my friends really give a fuck.
Spend your years breaking your back trying to make the connection last.
They wear masks and hide knives behind their backs.
They fake love and fake trust and it's all bound by poison.
Bound by poison.
