Running from ourselves.
We can't change what we've done.
Tried to get away.
This pain has gone too long.
Save my troubled soul.
I'm not the man you used to know.
Save my soul.
Forget the past and hit the road.
When you leave I hear your sigh of relief.
Scratch my face of every picture and memory you see.
Cut my clothes and burn the notes.
Leave nothing left of me.
And let the ashes blow away in the breeze.
We're free.
Save my troubled soul.
I'm not the man you used to know.
Save my soul.
Forget the past and hit the road
Cut your hands on every piece that you find of me.
Take you too the water, wash your hands of me.
Shine ourselves under new light and find we don't like the sight.
I know it's hard but it's time that we say goodbye.
Spend years sifting through the dirt searching for my teeth.
I've lost all hope and I've been questioning.
Will I ever find my smile again?
I say we put this to rest. So long old friend.
I've come to terms with the fact the ones you love will fucking leave.
The ones you love will fucking leave.
It's time to wash those dirty hands.
