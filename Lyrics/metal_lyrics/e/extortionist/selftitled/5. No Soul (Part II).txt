No soul must enter. Shut every helping hand in the door.
Lose myself in thought. I don't want to be this way anymore.
Every hand holds a knife and their pointed at me.
My lack of trust is what caused them to fucking leave.
Paranoid your intentions are unclean.
Tell me what it is that you want from me.
Take what you want, I don't care, I don't care anymore.
Tear me apart if it's what you desire.
Hang me up high so you can watch me bleed.
Suspend me by my impurities.
Take what you want, I don't care, I don't care anymore.
Tear me apart if it's what you desire.
So you can cut me open to take what you need.
And watch my mistakes bleed out for the world to see.
They say it's all just in my head but I can't help to shake the thought.
A desire for connection spoiled by the fucking love that's been lost.
I stare at my reflection, the repulsive display projected on the wall.
I'll stay alone forever.
I'll stay alone in the fucking dark.
