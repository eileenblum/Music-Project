[feat. Bryan Of King Conquer]No closure
No fucking sleep
My negative thoughts
Always get the best of me

Days go by, sleepless nights
Living like this is a constant fight
Every breath, every step
Every step I come close to death
Wishing that I already had been laid to rest

I am so lost in this world
I feel so fucking alone
Bitter thoughts &amp; an angry mindset
I try to pull myself through

You left my eyes wide open
When you put me in the dirt
You exposed me to the world
Then exposed me to the worms
&amp; you let them feast upon my soul

You exposed me to the worms
&amp; let them feast on my soul

[Bryan]
You left me asking myself why
Why the fuck did you abandon me?
All I wanted was for you to see
That I cared &amp; that I wanted to be
Standing by your side [5x]
