[feat. Dan Of Infant Annihilator]I'm so sick of it all sick of taking the fall for your actions
Fall for your actions
So you just leave me for the dogs
You left me for the dogs

You kicked me aside just like a stone on this fucking empty road
Where will you go?
You chose this road
Soon enough death is all you'll ever know
Now there's no where left to hide
&amp; I'm leaving this all behind
But I'm taking you down with me
Where you can burn with your kind

[Dan]
I have materialized
To collect what lies within your flesh
I'll release you from your shell
To drag you to Hell
I drag you to Hell
