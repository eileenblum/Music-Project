[feat. Tyler Of Traitors]There was no love
There was no hope
The things I've tried to make myself cope
I'm better off hanging from this rope
[2x]

You're just a fucking snake
Fuck your worth
&amp; fuck your time on this Earth
I can't wait until you are nothing more
Than 6 feet under the dirt
Fuck your worth
&amp; fuck your time on this Earth

These fucked up memories,
They've lead me to my end
Leaving me with nothing but disgust
&amp; a sanity that is condemned
My mind will never fucking mend

Look at the blood that's on your hands
Please tell me was it worth it?
Look at the blood that's on your fucking hands
Was it worth it to you? [2x]

You spread your legs &amp; share your fucking disease
Just like the vile lies you spread to end
Your suffering
To end your suffering

[Tyler]
I'll never forgive you for the pain you've caused me
You're just a used up worn out waste of space
Just know that I'll be the first one to spit on your grave
While you're too involved in those substances you take
