These thoughts are taking over me
They never stop I still can't fucking sleep

So let me walk with the deceased
It's not like you'd care anyway

Running around
Spreading your lies
You're still the man I despise
Empty eyes &amp; words that don't mean shit
Contradicting yourself you fucking hypocrite

I want to watch you suffer
i want to watch you fucking burn
How does it feel now that the tables have turned?

Don't say that you didn't
Feel the same
[2x]

I can't wait until the day
Until your eyes don't open

&amp; I will never forget
The words that were spoken
You shattered my heart
You left me broken

&amp; now all I see in front of me
Is what I'll never fucking be
&amp; you're too blind to see
That your actions got the best of me
