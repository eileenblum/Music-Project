No soul must enter, take what you want I don't care.
Shut every helping hand in the door. Losing myself in thought.
I don't want to be this way anymore.
Every hand holds a knife. And they're pointed at me.
My lack of fucking trust is what caused them to fucking leave.
Paranoid your intentions are unclean.
Take what you want, I don't care anymore. Tear me apart if it's what you desire.
Hang me up high and watch me bleed. Suspend me by my impurities.
You can cut me open. Take what you need.
