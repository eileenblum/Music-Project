You will leave them, they will leave you too.
A pain you cannot bare. There's nothing you can do.
Death is inevitable. Life will be rid of you.
Roots will be torn from the family tree.
Sacred bonds you wished forever are now splitting at the seams.
There will become a day where there will be no you and me.
It doesn't matter how and when. It's all within our destiny.
The ones you thought were true will be the "friends" that are never there
for you.
The hardest pill to swallow, is the one that's labeled "Truth".
Pain bleeds in different shades. No one reacts the same.
They wear a different face. Fingers pointing aimless blame. Go.
Some will make mistakes that they carry to the grave.
Some will act maliciously and spend their days ashamed.
None of this means anything at the end of all our days.
Accepting loss is the burden we are forced to face.
The ones you're holding close will go their separate ways.
Damage will be done and you will do the same. It doesn't matter how and when.
They will all go away. Regret will take it's fucking place. There is nothing to say.
The ones you love will leave and you could be the one to blame.
They'll rob you of your spirit. You'll strip them of their fucking will.
An endless cycle of grief. The holes we leave will never fill.
Free yourself from all the pain. Stay inside and hide your face.
Very few will be around to walk this life until the grave.
