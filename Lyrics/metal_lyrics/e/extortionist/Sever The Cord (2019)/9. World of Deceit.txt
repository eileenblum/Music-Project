Stuck in a world of deceit.
I'm ridding myself of your world of deceit. I hear the rats singing as I leave.
Keep drowning yourself in your pool of dishonesty. I've played the game, you will never fucking fool me.
Now I feel nothing. Nothing. Now I feel fucking nothing.
Stacking bodies, I watched them fall one by one. Connections bound by poison.
None of my friends give a fuck. Yeah, it numbs the pain but it's never enough.
(Never enough)
No it's never enough. Yeah we drink just because.
They all wear their masks hiding knives behind their backs.
They all fake their love and it's all fake trust.
I won't break my back for this connection to last.
I've played a part of my own misfortune. Buried myself in my own destruction.
Burnt every bridge that lead me out of the darkness. At the end of the day, all you have is yourself.
I'm ridding myself of your world of deceit. I hear the rats singing as I leave.
Keep drowning yourself in your pool of dishonesty. I've played the game, you will never fucking fool me.
Yeah it numbs the pain but it's never enough (never enough)
No it's never enough. Yeah we drink just because.
