You came baring hollow intentions.
Carried darkness from where you came.
False connection bound by filthy habits.
Can't say I haven't done the same.
Is this what we've become over this product of pain?
Bad vibrations loom with your dark spirit.
You haven't been the same.
Free fall into shadows where you dwell.
I'd be lying if I said that I've been doing well.
When I look in your eyes, I don't know what I see.
I think it's time that we say farewell.
It's taken over your mind.
It's taking over me.
I think it's time that we say farewell.
No more affinity between you and me.
From foul history, we are relieved.
Lost between the lines under fluorescent lights.
Dance with our demons into the night.
Life seen through haze enveloped bedroom eyes.
We are what we despise.
Separation holds the key.
I need to be set free.
This is not what we're meant to be.
I cannot live my life this way.
Anxiety takes place every time I wake.
These drugs we take aren't worth the pain.
When I look in your eyes, I don't know what I see.
I think it's time that we say farewell.
It's taken over your mind.
It's taking over me.
I think it's time that we say farewell.
Succumb to sleep, my anxious little hell.
I'd be lying if I said that I've been doing well.
Free me from the endless disconnect.
We were one in the same, now you wear a different face.
Who the fuck are you now?
Bad vibes
