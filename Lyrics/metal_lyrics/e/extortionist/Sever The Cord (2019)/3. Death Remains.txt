I was supposed to be something. Not what you painted of me.
I was supposed to be someone. You lie through your teeth.
How does it feel to be so selfish? Does it bring you peace?
Manipulation is your game. You never listen to what they say.
The world would be a better place if you just went the fuck away.
I'll sit and watch as your life decays. How does it feel?
No one remembers your name. No love to salvage. Forgotten, a waste.
No path or future. Only death remains.
You let your mistakes bleed over me.
The hatred stings.
Push the blame on everyone else but yourself.
You've created your own personal hell.
I'll sit and watch as your life decays. How does it feel?
No one remembers your name. No love to salvage. Forgotten, a waste.
No path or future. Only death remains.
Forgotten, a waste. Only death remains.
You're just the shit scraped off the shoes of every fucking person you've used, motherfucker.
You deserve nothing, and will fucking die with nothing.
There's a reason why your mother never fucking loved you.
