Uncertainty drives my fear.
(The panic sets in)
Panic setting in.
The noise inside my ears will never silence.
The room is spinning, I'm losing composure.
Anxiety driven, it throws me over.
Am I unwanted? Yeah, am I unwanted?
The voice inside my head it tells me that my mind is haunted.
Another day in this life. Another day living life with a broken conscience.
How can I ease this pain?
The dark never seems to fade.
Beaten, abused, and unloved. Feels like I'm all of the above.
But you'd never understand while you're barking those commands with a silver spoon in your hand.
So shut the fuck up.
Am I unwanted? Yeah, am I unwanted?
The voice inside my head it tells me that my mind is haunted.
Another day in this life. Another day living life with a broken conscience.
How can I ease this pain?
Take a step back. Think before you speak.
I can't control this panic. That occurs at times.
Yeah sometimes I might lose my mind.
You'll never know what this feels like.
You'll never know the torment that's been eating me alive.
My worst enemy is the voice inside my mind.
You left me out in the cold when I needed you most.
Stray dogs get put down. I'm stuck with nowhere to go.
