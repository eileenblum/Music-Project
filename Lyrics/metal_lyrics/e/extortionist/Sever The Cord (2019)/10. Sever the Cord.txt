Bleed yourself dry. Let them wear your skin.
Always staying quiet. Spread yourself thin.
It doesn't matter how hard you try. You'll never fucking win.
Cut the fucking cord. You will feel my pain.
Sleep in broken glass, tell me what do you see in the reflection?
Do you feel at peace with yourself? Do you feel nothing?
They're vultures, they feed when favors are due.
No where to be found when succumbed to the blue.
Yeah.
No longer will I bow to the fakes. Freed myself of your selfish ways.
No sympathy. No forgiveness.
Extortionist 2019 motherfuckers.
Sever the fucking cord.
