Gouge these memories from my brain. Haven't seen you around. I haven't been the same.
Nostalgia holds me hostage, don't walk my way.
'Cause I can't take another second. I can't take this pain, no.
Nothing left to lose. I'm through with you.
What will you do when no one's there for you?
Losing my grip, I try to keep it together.
I haven't been so well. Yeah, I've been under the weather.
Swimming deep to the bottom of the seven.
The whiskey helps me sleep. Loneliness I surrender.
Bite your tongue, cease me from your bullshit.
Don't say another word, this is what you wanted.
You know me and yeah I know you too. We both played the game.
I know the things that you do.
Yeah, I know the things that you do.
I'm not perfect but I'll never sink as low as you.
Where did you get your sense of entitlement?
(It's all bullshit)
The world doesn't owe you shit. Brace for a cold day in hell when reality hits.
I've tried so many times to get through to you.
But you're too far gone. One day you'll realize you were wrong all along.
You're just another lost cause. And I knew that this day would come.
Yeah, that's right. I told you motherfucker.
Keep talking your shit you punk ass bitch.
You're too wrapped up inside that ego that you feed.
Your social web of lies has you tangled in deceit.
Don't want any part of it, keep that shit away from me.
I'd rather walk this life alone. I'd rather walk to my own beat.
Can't tell you how many times.
Offered hands, just to wrap around my throat.
You preach about respect but why am I still hanging from your rope?
Gave you places to stay when you had no where else to go.
But now it's your turn, it's time you finally learn.
Respect is earned motherfucker.
I might be low. But I'll never sink as low as you motherfucker.
