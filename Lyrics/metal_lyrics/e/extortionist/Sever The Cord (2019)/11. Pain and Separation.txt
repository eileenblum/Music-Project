Pain and separation.
This pain lies in separation. My heart has learned to love again.
The fear of loss takes a miserable toll. I know eventually I will lose it all.
Experience gained but it's such a shame that connection is not eternal.
I know eventually it's bound to end.
Stripped of feeling, burnt out and anxious. We learn to live in pain.
No happiness, no peace. Fight the dark another day.
Curse this mind of mine.
Experience gained but it's such a shame tat connection is not eternal.
Why do the things we love get taken away? Why do our hearts get frozen over?
Stripped of feeling, burnt out and anxious. We learn to live in pain.
No happiness, no peace. Fight the dark another day.
Stripped of feeling, burnt out and anxious. We learn to live in pain.
