Exposed of false imperfections. They try to ruin me.
I've lost all sight of my ambitions. There's nothing here for me.
I've lost myself in all directions. No one can hear my plea.
What is the point of all this pressure? There's nothing here for me.
This life I lived used to be everything. But I've been killing myself for a dying dream.
Beaten and broken down constantly. There's no benefit. Just anxiety.
Cast aside when I ask for help. Burnt out and bitter.
I guess I'll just go fuck myself. This is not the way it's supposed to be.
Always bending backwards, I can barely breathe. I've lost myself in all directions.
I've lost myself in all directions. No one can hear my plea.
What is the point of all this pressure? There's nothing here for me.
Motivation grows harder to reach when my whole world implodes every time I leave.
I have no fall back, I have no peace. Feels like I've lost my purpose.
All I have is me. You motherfuckers.
I've lost myself in all directions. No one can hear my plea.
What is the point of all this pressure? There's nothing here for me.
