Don't tell me baby, where did you go? Lately that shoulder of yours has been so cold.
Stomach turning, sense of panic shakes throughout my bones. Intuition knows our love has decomposed.
Don't tell me where you sleep, baby. I know what you've been doing.
If you see my face, don't walk my way. Save your words 'cause I can't bare the pain.
Once a Christian girl, now look at your horns. Can't tell which version of you that I like more.
If you got a thing for dancing with the devil. She'll sure as hell leave your heart on the floor.
Peel back my skin, take a look at what you left me. See that I suffer the pain of feeling empty.
Take everything, leave nothing. If I said I don't deserve it I'd be lying.
Don't tell me where you sleep, baby. I know what you've been doing.
If you see my face, don't walk my way. Save your words 'cause I can't bare the pain.
Feels like the vultures picked apart our love. I'm not sure if that's what you wanted.
And yeah sometimes I fucking hate you. 'Cause the way it all went down, it was fucking awful.
You got me wrapped around your finger baby. Won't you set me free?
It's been 3 years and I still die inside when I hear your name.
Don't tell me where you sleep, baby. I know what you've been doing.
If you see my face, don't walk my way. Save your words 'cause I can't bare the pain.
You didn't realize what it did to me when you'd tell me that you loved me while your body was between those fucking sheets. In the end I promised we'd be friends. But I just couldn't accept.
And I'm sorry for the mess I made. My conscience is forever stained in regret.
The darkest side of me resurfaced the moment you left.
Maybe one day we will reconnect. But if not I understand.
Feel free to forget me.
