The future is scary but it doesn't scare me from sharing all my emotions
Yet I'm swimming in this ocean of fake people

They seek attention without the realization of what is equal

You're just a sequel to every fucking lie that's beneath you [3x]

It was me too, I was so wrapped in myself I couldn't see through.[4x]

All the shit you said to me
You left me broken without a fucking breath to breath
Death is all that's left for me [2x]
