[lyrics: Lior Seker]

Pouring waters over the sea
The skies are so dark today
Tidal waves form strange melodies
That words can't begin to say

Heavy winds displaces the trees
The sun has turned cold and grey
Thunder sounds are echoing near
Reality seems so frail

Wasting most of your worthless days
Squandering all we have
Will it stop before we all see?
There's nothing left to save

And the world keeps turning
(Business is going well)
And our end keeps forming
No one could stop this show

Waters covering us
As Far as the eye can see
Not a shred of land left
Within this enormous sea

Wheels of money turning (too late)
No one to stop the spin (too late)
All goes on in circles
Our chances are growing thin

And the world keeps turning
(Business is going well)
And our end keeps forming
No one could stop this show

And the clock keeps ticking
(Business just seem to grow)
