[lyrics: Omer Ephrat &amp; Petronella Netermalm]

Things haven't been easy
Not since you walked away
Why things won't stay the same
I ask -- no one's there
Home started seeming
So far away from here
Well that's how it always ends,
No remorse, no stare

[Chorus:]
Things can't be easy
Maybe I'll start to look for one
Why things can't stay the same
Maybe I'll run away from here

Tease me
Please me
Don't preach me

Ask why
Tell lies
Don't go

No wonder what happened next
You could just smell the fear
Like ancient tales from old
Just victims no one to blame

Come play with me
Come play with me

If you were one of them
You wouldn't do that to me
If you were one of us
None of this would happen to you

Come play with me
Come play with me

[Chorus]

Let haze roll in
And bless me in my dreams
No company
I'm lost in memories

Let darkness come
Release me from my pain
I wait in vain
As silence comes around

I live our life
Rewind it in my head
It's still the same
Though you are far from here

This world of mine
Is where I want to stay?
I will be fine
If things will stay the same

[Last chorus:]
Things won't be easy
Maybe I'll start to look for one
If things can't stay the same
I guess I'll run away from here
