[lyrics: Lior Seker]

Down Here
Standing on the brink
Of not knowing anything
Not even me

And still
Fading memories
Reminding me everything
That I couldn't see

I know there must be a reason
For treason there must

And all the words they just falter
Can't alter this mess

I know there must be a reason
It isn't enough

And all the tears they just falter
Can't alter this fate

Who could have thought I'd have to give you up
Put a stop here

You wouldn't dream I'd have to leave you here
Would you dear now

Down Here
Standing on the brink
It's better than anything
Feeling so free

Few tears
Fewer memories
(And it's) Better then anything
Then I'll ever see
