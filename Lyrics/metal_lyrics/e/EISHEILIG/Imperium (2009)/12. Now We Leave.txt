No might can bring us down
We will destroy any corruption
We will erase the killers of the poor
There is no way to bring us down
There is no way to bring us down

Now we leave
Now we leave this place
Follow us
And your fear will be erased
Now we leave
Now we leave this place
Follow us
And your fear will be erased

We wait behind the sun
Behind the eternal space
We live again in every slave
Of all inhuman states

We will not sleep
We will not sleep

Now we leave
Now we leave this place
Follow us
And your fear will be erased
Now we leave
Now we leave this place
Follow us
And your fear will be erased

We will not sleep
We will not sleep
