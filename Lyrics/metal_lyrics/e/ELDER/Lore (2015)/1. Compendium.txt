born upon the cusp of revelation 
a consciousness awakened by the dawn 
a primitive undying fascination 
moved the hand that carved into the stone 

faces change, thought returns to dust 
ashen countenance, holy rust 
I am compendium 

trapped inside the cultish hall of mirrors 
taught to worship self-destructing flaws 
running now, the ravens getting nearer 
fighting off the gnashing of the claws 

this is the weight of heartbreak 
this is the weight of life 
a thunder at the temple 
silencing endless strife
