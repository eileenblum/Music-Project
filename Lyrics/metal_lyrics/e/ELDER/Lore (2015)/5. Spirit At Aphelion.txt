a temple and a labyrinth 
beckoning across the void 
resentment for the tragedy 
in the face of what's destroyed 

a journeyer on the wayward path 
spirit at aphelion 
denizens of wood and plain 
gather at the setting sun 

reign of mist bearing down 
fateless and degenerate 
enraptured by the olden words 
futility regenerates
