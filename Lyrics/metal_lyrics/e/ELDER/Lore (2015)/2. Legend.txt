the whispering night 
tracks in the snow 
crossing the threshold 
of what we all know 

crimson immortal 
elysian fields 
stems of good fortunes 
they've been reaping for years 

seek words of wisdom 
spurning the lore 
weavers of fate 
have cast on the shore 

we seek lives of holiness 
and finding nothing in its place 

the grace of the gods 
a fire gone out 
on the banks of the lands 
once so firmly devout 

a wringing of hands 
facing the dark 
hollow and dead 
what we know in our hearts
