You are the great betrayers
The wretches of the earth
Hailing with the torches
As you watch the bridges burn

Perched upon the spires
Towers built of filth
Insipid your desires
Unbearable your guilt

Rise!
I herald the coming of the age
When masters of the earth
Become their captor's slaves

We fed your weakened bodies
We kept you from the cold
Now you curse and spit upon me
Now your treacheries unfold

Empty path unwinding
A frozen deadened star
Closing of the circle
Returning what is ours

Rise!
You masters of the earth
The ones who gave you life
Will watch your temples burn
