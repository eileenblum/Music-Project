Sense the embers dying
Asleep beneath the skies
Awakened from the frost setting in
As the planets realign

Cast into the open
We'll find our way
As leaves upon the water
Only the tide can rearrange

Returning to the winter
No shelter for the sworn
Erecting wooden crosses to the judged
Awaiting the arrival of the storm

There's a writing at the scepter
Bloody serpents at the throne
When the wicked are the chosen
We must break all of our oaths
