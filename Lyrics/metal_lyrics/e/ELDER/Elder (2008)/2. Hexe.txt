I am the witch
Who controls your movements
Makes time stand still
Pinned upon the crucifix

I am the witch
Who foresees your movements
Fell from the sky
Pinned upon my crucifix

Rolled off the tongue
So light it grew prophetic
Centuries of change
Replaced by static rhetoric

Allegiance sworn
To a realm of sonic substance
Silent phoenix rise
And fly towards the covenant
