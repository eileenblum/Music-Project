Sudden liberation
Of war-molded mind
Antediluvian spirit
Freed for the first time

Foretold by the sages
Ancient wizards of plains
Son of Crom-built kingdom
From the ashes of chains

Captors of the sun
And priestess of the high seas
Fathers of the mountains
And the holy commune of the trees

Spirit of the rider
With the will of the land
He will carve his kingdom
With his own two hands

The Riddle of Steel
In the halls of the mighty
A sword unsheathed
And an arrow of lightning
