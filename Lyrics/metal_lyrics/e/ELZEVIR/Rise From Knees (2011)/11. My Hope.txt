Among hundreads we are the ones
Man who decided to fight for freedom
Man who decided to fight - not to run
This is the rebellion of victims

Give me the antidote for Death
To heal decaying spirit
Help me to make another breath
Help me to kill my fear
I hope to see again
Sunset in fairy Dreamland
Please wipe my eyes, oh mighty Wind
I know the End is near....

I know there you are
Sitting home waiting for me
I wish to hear your heart
Is throbbing faster when you see
My last return from lands of woe
My dreams came true, my fears are gone and
I fulfilled my prophesy
My deeds are done and I am Free
