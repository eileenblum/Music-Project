[Verse 1:]
Walk alone between the crowd
Watching empty bodies instead of men
Cold has made them grey and dried-up
They are now just earthly beings

Now we are just playing sole
This world is training ground
For those who know their place in game
See, you have a will to change
All roads are opened for you
You only need to make a step to dream

[Chorus:]
Rain! It will wash out dirt and sadness
Cleaning temporary madness
And it will be not today
After rain of that day
You will die or rise like sun
Among people you are one
And no matter what they say
After rain of that day

[Verse 2:]
No, no, you don't need to teach them all
Think about them like about experience
They are not worse neither better
They just other type of humankind

Watch the tears from the sky
That renovate your mind
And then clouds parted to let in the light
Which will evoke the life
Put in the spark of hope
And wind will take your fears away

[Chorus:]
Rain! It will wash out dirt and sadness
Cleaning temporary madness
And it will be not today
After rain of that day
You will die or rise like sun
Among people you are one
And no matter what they say
After rain of that day

(Rejoice! all beings above and under ground
The land is washed.
Sigh of relief will be spread by the wind
From one edge of world to another
And silent gratitude will rush high above)

[Chorus:]
Rain! It will wash out dirt and sadness
Cleaning temporary madness
And it will be not today
After rain of that day
You will die or rise like sun
Among people you are one
And no matter what they say
