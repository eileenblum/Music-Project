[Verse 1:]
Going through the snow...
Like an arrow falling from the sky...
Now You can control
Your emotional rush - go Fight and Die!

[Chorus:]
Dragon Catcher, Firemonger
Drink with us before You'll go
Tame the beast with magic potion
Win this Battle... Win this War!

[Verse 2:]
Watch this little flames
That are whirling when You close your Eyes
Their Pure Grace...
This is Magic....

Is it worth to
Cry
Lie
Fight and
Die
When I Don't
Want
To Kill
To Fight...

No i don't want waste my time
I will do my Fucking Duty
Rather than to Hide for Years
Tame the Dragon! I Will Do It!!!
