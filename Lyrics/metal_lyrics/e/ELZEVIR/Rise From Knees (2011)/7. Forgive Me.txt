Awaiting - time wasting
Stop now yourself heartbreaking
Destroying illusions
Please don't make more allusion
I know that i shall feel
Regret for all this actions
But now just set me free
We went in wrong directions

I can't deny your feelings
I say "No" so please forgive me
now...
Forgive me now
Forgive me now

Betrayal... I'm guilty
Soon you will just stop thinking
About us. About me.
I want my heart will be free...

I want
I wish to be free
From now on
I feel my heart is free

I can't deny your feelings
I say "No" so please forgive me
