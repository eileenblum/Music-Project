[1.] I know that everything lies in my hands
Just go forth to the future. Such is our simple plan.

[Chorus]
Our simple plan - to break the chains of ordinary
Your own dreamland - your own angels sanctuary
So run don't walk - you only need to meet condition
Do what you want - and no one can do convictions

[2.] When you think about others achievements
Don't fall into despair. Never don't stop. You need to continue.

[3.] Don't fall down! Just fight to
Win in any case...
Fuck all rules! You must know
Loosers lifes is a time waste!
