It happend again.. I'm sitting in corner
My body is a prison for my wild soul
It's like mind eclipse when i crushed the border
I don't know what is it - my win or my fault

So how do you see this? Betrayal of friendship
Or just an expression of my boiling love
Temptation is so high... Heart armor is so weak...
It happend again... And this all lies above

My Mind
You captured my mind
I don't know
What's wrong what is right
This is like an eclipse
I don't understand this
My Mind
You captured my mind

I'm sitting in corner. Just thinking about you
Fading of my dreams one by (the) one
So when will this time come and i'll hear your voice
I shall understand that you're not gone

When you get close
I wan't you to show
That you didn't lie
To me everytime
Cause i was a friend
So let's put an end
Mutuall confess
Without regrets
