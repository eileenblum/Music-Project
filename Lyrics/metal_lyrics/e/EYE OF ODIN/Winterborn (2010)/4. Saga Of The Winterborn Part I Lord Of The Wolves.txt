[Music by Eye of Odin, Lyrics by Cody Scott]

My cousin was the lord
Of these islands of the sun
The farthest south that we had come
And there we met our fiercest foe

The Christians, they were called,
Denied our gods and our heroes
Denied our legends and our history
They denied Baldur, Odinâs son
We could not bear it, could not allow
The south to rise up and thrust us out
Weâll send them back to their homes
To the city of Rome

My cousin, Lord of the Wolves
Went to the south to face his enemy
But they betrayed him with an army
The biggest one Iâve ever seen!

He sent me to the North
To the lands of our fathers
To represent our southern homeland
To the Kingdom of dragonâs fire
For fifteen years we have sought you
The Winterborn, Iâve heard you called
The fiercest of warriors
In these islands, youâll rule them all

And boldly they went across the sea
To the place they knew they would find the Winterborn
For fifteen years they had sought the boy
And when at last they found him
They raised their blades up to Odin

You see your father was a hero
He was a king amongst his men
And he was slaughtered by the Christians
You must avenge him my cousinâs son.
For fifteen years we have sought you
Just awaiting for this day
We will not back down, cannot allow
The tale to end this way

As I continue my quest
I am confident that I will find you
You are the Son of the North
And the King of my people
Yes I have rallied from the North
Ten thousand men to drive them out
Yes, we will burn all the churches
In these islands of the sun

You see your father was a hero
He was a king amongst his men
And he was slaughtered by the Christians
You must avenge him my cousinâs son.
For fifteen years we have sought you
Just awaiting for this day
We will not back down, cannot allow
The tale of Winterborn to end this way
