[Music by Eye of Odin, Lyrics by Cody Scott, Additional guitar by David Khan of Scythia]

What it means to be a warrior
To sail the seas and conquer foes
Hold your head high, blades pointed to the sky
It is within you to drive them out

I will not back down
I cannot allow
The south to rise up
And thrust us out

To be a hero, you must know
The eye of Odin will not touch your foes
So do not back down from any foe you face
Leave none behind you that stand in your way

I will not back down
I cannot allow
The south to rise up
And thrust us out

Come with me across the sea, me boy
Adventure awaits!

The viking warriors
In the islands of the south
With bloody weapons and angry eyes
We drive the enemy out
With confidence in out hearts
Blades pointed to the sky
No one can defeat us, my lad
Though many of us may die
To be a warrior
Takes everything youâve got
Our hearts cry out for victory
Our rage is burning hot!
Valhalla calls to us!
Odin waits on high!
Praise to Mjolnr, never stop!
Leave no one left alive!

What does it mean to be a warrior?
Come with me to the land of our foes
Your fatherâs gone, your mother, she is dead
The Son of the North will have revenge

My cousin, Lord of the Wolves
Come to the south and face our enemy
We will betray them with an army
The biggest one theyâve ever seen!

You see you see your father was a hero
He was a king amongst his men
And he was slaughtered by the Christians
You must avenge him my cousinâs son
Fifteen long years we have sought you
Just awaiting for this day
We sail for days across the ocean
To land in this hidden bay
