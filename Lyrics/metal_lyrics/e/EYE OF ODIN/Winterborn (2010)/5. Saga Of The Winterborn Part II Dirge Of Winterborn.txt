[Music by Eye of Odin, Lyrics by Cody Scott, Additional violin by Kytami of Delhi2Dublin]

Been many days since he departed from this shore
That snow white smile, those ice blue eyes
His child is in me, a mother I may be
To a child of winter, born to sail the sea

Been many weeks now, he left on a Drekkar
With a loathsome dragon, on its prow
Heâs called a hero, a king amongst his men
From mortal foes by his blade or life heâll defend

And I wonder where he may be
And I wonder when heâll come home to me

Been many months now since Iâve seen his gentle face
That snow white smile, those ice blue eyes
And when I see him, a raging I will be
âWhere have you been, did you care that you worried me?â

Itâs been so long now since Iâve heard his gentle voice
He used to sing me lullabies
His sonâs delivered from my wombâs clutching embrace
Will he ever see him? will he ever know his face?

I begin to believe I never will again
I begin to understand he is gone

Winterborn, I know I canât go on
My heart is broken and I will surely die!
Winterborn, I give you to the night
And now youâll either learn to fight or die alone!

Winterborn, there is no turning back
Your fatherâs gone and I have died
Winterborn, I give you to the North,
Youâll become the best of us or die aloneâ¦

And I wonder where you may goâ¦
