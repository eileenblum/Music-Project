[Music by Eye of Odin, Lyrics by Cody Scott]

After the journey is over
And the trails have all come to an end
At the end of years, thereâll be no more fears
Only a ship sailing off into the clear

After this life is over
In a hall at the end of the earth
They will serve to you the finest brew
A mead twice as cool as morning dew

Long have I sought in search of respite,
For the hall at the end of the earth
I first heard the tale on the darkest of nights
When my fears denied my worth.
In a crashing thunderstorm,
I thrashed upon the rocks.
I sank into the water, then
I thought that I was lost,
Alone on the sea
My heart was in doubt
I saw the kings of warriors
I heard them singing out!

I sailed for a year and a day with those men
The price I had paid for my life.
Iâd all but forgotten the song I had heard
In the blackest of my darkest nights.
Then there came a day,
The wandârer came my way
He wore a cloak and an ashen beard
And these words I heard him say
âKindly show the way,
To an old man in decay,
Your life is all but over now,
You and I must not delay!â

Do you know the way to the hidden valley?
Long is the way that we must go!
Over the waves and the watârey alleys,
There they brew the finest mead I know!

And on the third day we set out from port,
The old man disappeared
That night, the sun went down beyond the edge of the sea
Never to rise up again.
For nine long weary nights
We tumbled without day
Until one morn we saw the light
Of the glittering Bifrost way
Standing on the rocks
As we could plainly see
Was Heimdall, lord of the sky-mountain
Staring down at me!

The figure rose out of the mist
With eyes that burned like fire
He raised his blade to the sky
And this is what he said:

âYou must go over the great rainbow bridge, my new friends, into the city of Asgard! There you will find the golden hall you seek, and Odin, king of the Aesir!â

We had come to our final destination!
To the great walled city of the Gods!
We raised our blades up to Odin, the king!
To Asgard, and the great Valhalla!

But at the end of the day,
The wanderer came our way
And said, âDon these holy instruments
And let these bastards here you play!
For there will come a day
When everything will die
The Fenris Wolf and the World Serpent
Will hear this joyous cry!â

Do you know the way to the hidden valley?
Long is the way that we must go!
Over the waves and the watârey alleys,
There they brew the finest mead I know!
