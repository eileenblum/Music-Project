[Music by Eye of Odin, Lyrics by Cody Scott, Additional Guitar by Sho Murray]

We had always known them
The southern cult of the white one
Who came with swords
Under a banner of peace
My cousin, lord of the wolves,
Welcomed them into our lands
In the spirit of prosperity
We watched as our temples were enshackled
Imprisoned behind cathedral walls
Until we could bear their prattle no longer
We would protect our temples,
Our very way of life,
With a pact: an oath of law
And so we crossed the wave-road
To meet with them in peace
But they betrayed us
And as my lord ran into battle
I heard him speak his final words:
âSurrounded, outnumbered, five hundred to one
Tonight, I will see the gates of Valhalla!â
