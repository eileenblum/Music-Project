[inspired by "The Book of Coming Forth by Night"]

My opposite self is strange and fitful
It rights the imbalance of fire
Forming a void in which true creation can take place

I am ageless
I am the seed of all thought
I alone am not of earth

My opposite self endures while I endure
I cannot destroy it save to take its place

I spread the black flame into the night
The seven stars shone in the dawn of man
Drawn forward by the mystery of mysteries
To knowledge of the spheres and strange music from within

Those of the archon show the way
Through infinite facets unique to each BA
