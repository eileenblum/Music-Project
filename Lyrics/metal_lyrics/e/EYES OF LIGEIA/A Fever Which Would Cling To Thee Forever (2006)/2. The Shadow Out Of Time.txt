My knowledge comes from the shadow self
Unbound by time and opening the way
The darkness draws me into the abyss
Where eternity awaits beyond

Time only has the order we give it
The mind reaches across all eternity
Though I pass free of the bounds
Memory of the future cannot exist

Dreams open the way to the shadow
Some barriers can only open at night
The starry sky forms an entrance
And the shadow radiates from within

The black towers hold the key
To the melding of heaven and earth
The spires are the razor's edge
That open the worlds to the shadow

The shadow will not be abandoned
Even when the stars come right again
