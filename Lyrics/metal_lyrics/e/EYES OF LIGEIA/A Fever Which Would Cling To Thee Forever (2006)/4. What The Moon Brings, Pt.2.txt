The moon turns my words against me
Its light shows my lies
To this sunken place the dead all come
But for my oath I would join them

The ravens descend from the tower
To place on my heart the fire
Black as dead night they watch
As the words find their purpose

The tide draws out under the sinking moon
The spires of the dead city gleam
One last gaze upon the towers of home
After death I have no need of this place

The ravens have done their task
They carry the oath to the wind
The bond will be fulfilled
When the moon comes right again
