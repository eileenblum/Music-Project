When the silence rules lost souls
and cold is falling to raze mortals
the Winter is coming

Hearing the breath of nightfall
I prepare myself
Illuminated by frozen moon
I set out

And the Winter cold arrives
a gruesome dance
draws me to the forest
colors of a painful death
skip maliciously
I feel the softness of pain

Running
I break off the withred arms
Blind for obscurity
I can hear painful wailing

Consumed by grief
I admit the magnificence of winter
Black emperor burns everything
he draws the distressing fate
of anyone who clashes with him
And when the shadow embraces moon
and also light will die
only a shining mist I see
like a cursed chillness shrouds life

A low sorrow of rebirth
a crysalisis grows an obscure evil
Master your cape gazes ancient nature

Take me and let me see your dreadful face
I will escort you in the inexorable ride

And the winter...

Frost lacerates the sky
The black appearance like a shadow
descends to the melancholy of forest
Now I can prostrate myself to your magnifience

And you rage breaks loose
a warm numbness embraces me
I become drowsy
now the winter is in me
