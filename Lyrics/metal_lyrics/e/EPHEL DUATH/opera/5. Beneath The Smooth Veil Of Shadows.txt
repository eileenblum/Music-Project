I am a dark river
inside your veins I flow
from pain and sorrow I grow

Look at your dark side
break chains wich have tied your mind for centuries...

Let your spirit rise
Time to fight is coming
Come to see the last twilight of the earth

Land of sorrow
let me enter your realm
where flowers caress my face
consumed by flames
The fire of evil burns my human flesh

Beneath the smooth veil of shadows
my spirit at last is awake
once again the majesty of nocturnal sky
urges my thoughts to skim over depths of space

And I fly beyond stars
learning sense of existence

And I fly beyond stars
learning sense of existence
now life and death are same

Vain races where fools subjected by ignorance
follow precepts against nature
missing the ancient essence of purity
they curse my name but what will they become?
Only dust

I am a dark rive

Tonight I will make my solemn oath
I will take my strength
from the fire of the sun
and the water of the deepest abyss

I will raise my eyes upon this world
hearing the silent wall
of trees caressed by nocturnal winds

Beneath the smooth veil of shadows
my spirit at last is awake
once again the majority of nocturnal sky
urges my thoughts to skim over depths of space
