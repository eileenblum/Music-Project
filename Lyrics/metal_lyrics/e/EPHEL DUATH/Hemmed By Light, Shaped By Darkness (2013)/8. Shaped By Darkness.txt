The crystal skull I wear protects that door right behind my eyes
A passage to a better self I can walk through
Carrying all the tears I can fill my hands with
I crawl my way to that deep silence I fill with thoughts

I crawl my way to that deep silence I fill with thoughts

In there hundreds of brick towers hold a tender sky together
A gold path rolls within electric bundles of feelings buzz around
Amniotic fields lie on raw flesh hills
Clouds of minor notes rumble

There's a liquid spot in every mirror
There's a point of distortion in every imaage
There's a piercing truth in each lie

Here I shut down my double self
And I let my real voice resonate low deep, low deep, low deep,
In a state of altered awareness
And I let my real voice resonate low deep, low deep, low deep,

My shelter is a shutdown theatre made of bones
I sit on the border of a black stage
Spiderwebs caress my breath
Dust takes the shape of a ghostly crowd

Entertained while I play my guts
Like cello strings

A whirl of bones generates from the ceiling above
In twisting symbiosis with my mute dying chant

The crystal skull I wear protects that door right behind my eyes
A passage to a better self I can walk through
Carrying all the tears I can fill my hands with

The more I dismember the bigger the pearl cage gets
But my aura overcomes it spreading wide like angel's wings
An ovation celebrates my lethal performance
While exhaling what is left of me
I smile at the crowd and collapsing buildings
Protected by my same death march
I keep the music going
And when life will call back
I'll promise to escape it tomorrow again.
And when life will call back
I'll promise to escape it tomorrow again.
