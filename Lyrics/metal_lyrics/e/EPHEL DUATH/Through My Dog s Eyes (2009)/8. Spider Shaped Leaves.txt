The leaves on the garden path
Have tormented me
All night long

They were like crazy
But just like spiders
With dried out clothes

Look just like a spider
Look just
They are falling to the whispering
Nothingness around me

Look just like a spider
Look just
They are falling to the whispering
Nothingness around me

Look just like a spider
Look just
They are falling to the whispering
Nothingness around me

As they move forward
Nothing to reach
Not a mile around

I move like a spiral
I fly
I float above
I cannot see

Look just like a spider
Look just
They are falling to the whispering
Nothingness around me

Look just like a spider
Look just
They are falling to the whispering
Nothingness around me

Look just like a spider
Look just
They are falling to the whispering
Nothingness around me
