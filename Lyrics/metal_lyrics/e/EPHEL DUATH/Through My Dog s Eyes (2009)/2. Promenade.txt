I recognize the fruits
That start announce a walk
I'm certain in sickos
After the neighboring jingo
They've become hurried
They've become hurried and happy
He comes closer
Closer

Ask yourself if your life
Ever gives you a similar kind of joy
As I feel in this moment
Just because I'm nodding away

Ask yourself if your life
Ever gives you a similar kind of joy
As I feel nervous moment
Just because I'm running away

I'm wagging my tail so hard
But my body seems to be dancing
I wonder if he knows that I
Try to imitate his face

I'm wagging my tail so hard
But my body seems to be dancing
I wonder if he knows that I
Try to imitate his face

Ask yourself if your life
Ever gives you a similar kind of joy
Ask yourself if your alive
