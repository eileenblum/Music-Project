The last decision to make
The last breath to take

He stopped making me play
Since I became old
We could have kept doing it

It made in my pain
I would've done my best
But I can roll like I use to
I chose, don't have to try
Threading fore

I know something has changed forever
I'm just letting myself die
I know something has changed forever
The last decision to make
The last breath to take

The last decision to make
The last breath to take now

I know something has changed forever
I'm just letting myself die
I know something has changed forever
I'm just letting myself die
I know something has changed forever
I'm just letting myself die
I know something has changed
