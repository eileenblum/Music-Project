I am the guardian of these walls
I'm not moving from here
I am your last
Obstacle

I am the moves that don't respect
I am the eyelid closing
I am the joke that kills
Kills

I am the silence the flyest
I'm the mistake
Death's fate down

I am the world
The world that stops
I am the god
The god that gazed into this

I am the hidden eye
I am the heart of fires

I am the eyelid closing
I am the joke that kills
I am the world that stops
I am the cloud that burst
Into my tears
Into my tears
I am the eyelid closing
I am the joke that kills

I am the guardian of these walls
And I'm your last
I'm your last obstacle
The highest one
I am the guardian of these walls
And I'm your last obstacle

I am the hidden eye
I am the heart of fires
I am the hidden eye
I am the heart of fires
I am the hidden eye
I am the heart of fires

I am the guardian of these walls
I'm not moving from here
I am your last obstacle
