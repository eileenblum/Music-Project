Missed stops
Ripped from
Out the park
But she doesn't care about a bus
Here all night
Here all day

We got more friendly
She has a nice voice
Your friendly
We got more friendly

I know that soon
Like an elastic
My last shake
She will
She will be back
In the same place

We got more friendly
She has a nice voice
Your friendly
We got more friendly
She is not of my race

We got more friendly
She has a nice voice
Your friendly
We got more friendly
She is not of my race

With the first night's trouble
She brings me presents
Biscuits of meat

I know that soon
Like an elastic
She will
She will be back
In the same place

She will be back
Like an elastic
I know that soon
She will be back
Like an elastic
She will be back

She will be back
She will be back
Like an elastic
She is not of my race
