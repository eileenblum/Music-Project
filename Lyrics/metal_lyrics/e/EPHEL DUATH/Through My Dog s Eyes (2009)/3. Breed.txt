I feel my eyes
Become frightening
The attack instinct
Comes from afar
Comes from within
A lesion homage
Dazzling to the jugular

I feel my eyes
Lies become frightening
The smell of fear
Fear intoxicates me

I redress the steps
Of my fathers
They do have knowledge
My sense of belonging

If you don't attack first they will
Says a voice like a nail inside my skull
I sink my teeth into the pulsing glide
My teeth left a mark on my name

I feel my eyes
Lies become frightening
The smell of fear
Fear intoxicates me
