The door closes
And I've become taken
In my art I wish I could
Close it like a book
Lay it down pick it up
Again on the way back

Loneliness is
Like a fire that fuels itself
Give it a roar
A final explosion of a dinner host
We'll all do
With all due

It slowly places up
Then crushes everything it finds
It slowly places up
Then crushes everything it finds

Please go back home
Please go back
Please go back home

It slowly places up
Then crushes everything it finds
It slowly places up
Then crushes everything it finds

Please go back home
Please go back
Please go back home

I wish I could
Close it like a book
Lay it down pick it up
Again on the way back

Loneliness is
Like a fire that fuels itself
Give it a roar
A final explosion of a dinner host
We'll all do
With all due
