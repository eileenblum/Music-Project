A never ending Painting,
No subject defined,
Not a precise style,
Confused traits poor colours.

Are you really able to find a message?

I,
Defeated,
Grow dim again,
To not graze this lying vision,
To not admire the banal.

Distantly,
Glittering sides try to illude, [elude?]
Disturbing,
No results...Again....

I rove hearing the noise...of false moves.

Skimming transparent figures,
Observing a pale
And sober, Painting....
I will deface it,
Enjoy the cut.
