Impossible to save the balance with this bigot.
Still profiles bond with seaweed rope to the wreck that will be.

My dive will end this circus parade.

The sweet proceeds through undistinguishable lanes
Caresses with a poisoned claw.
Zeal.

Warlike Drowsiness is the enemy.
I was fightining it with my rusty blade,
Now I'm defended only by a crystalline armor.
There are a lot of blinding reflections around my body.
Do you think it will be enough?
Do you think it will be enough?
