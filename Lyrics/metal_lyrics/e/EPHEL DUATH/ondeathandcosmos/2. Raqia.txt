I see you rising
Where spheres collide
Up to the highest of all
And here I stare
This shining nightmare again

You
The humming voice
I keep hearing the whisper
Parasitic mind getting closer and closer
A second and third layer of skin
Begging for some life and warmth

You are the firmament
I wander in
There
When my sight loses hope
And I fail myself again
I'm just nerves
Tired bones
A scared heart

You are that shadow filling my eyes
My guard is down again
There's still no will
Desire or strength
To fight that back

You may be as lonely as I feel
But the emptiness around you is cosmic
Immense
While mine tastes just like flesh

I slip further
Faster
And I keep looking there
At that grinning void
That ate you

All what I'm gaining
Is a self feeding rage
Stealing my traits

Long liquefied echoes
Shape my memories
And I wonder
If nine stars blinking
Are those nine fingers of yours
Ready to grab me
And this blind run
That is my life.
