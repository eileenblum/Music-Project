Through crusades the priests did come
Forcing their god on everyone
Burning non believers on stakes on fire
Preaching love as the flames grow higher
Raping pagan faith in the lies they tell
They turned Hel into Hell
Turning pagan gods into the devil

They build their churches on sacred land
Now they wonder why only burnt timbers are left to stand

We march beside our kin
In the midst of the horde
To die with honor with blood on our sword

We walk the path though lands of old
Through violence unseen and suffering untold
We shall see the wraiths of our ancestors raise their swords up high
To salute our return as the sound of trumpets fill the sky

Our enemies shall cower before us
As above us a black cloud approaches
A thousand thousand ravenâs wings shall beat a war drum
Letting all know that we come

A thousand grey wolves shall lead the charge
And our years of pain shall be heard in their cries!
May your churches burn and your temples crumble
We are the future, the past reborn in flame!
