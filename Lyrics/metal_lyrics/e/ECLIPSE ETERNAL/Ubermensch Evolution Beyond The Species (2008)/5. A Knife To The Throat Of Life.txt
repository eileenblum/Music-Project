Through the fog of this reality we march 
With only the strength of insanity as a guide 
But what to the inquiring eyes does appear 
No reason or truths it is as we feared 
They never existed in circles weâve been led 
So what do you do when find out youâre already dead 
Put gun to the temple and a bullet in the head 

A knife to every throat is what this world needs 
Chaos reversal the universe unravels at its seams 
To this blackened abyss the river of matter now feeds 
To this final end the future of existence now leads 

Drop the bomb cure the disease! 

Only through extinction can the universe return to the purity from whence it came 
Slit every throat and bleed every vein 

From out of the abyss hell shall arise pure hatred no disguise 

Napalm  the earth there will be no rebirth 
Explosions abound tearing open the ground 
An exit from hell  the dragon has found 
Vessels of his hate insanity come its to late 
Festering like a open sore it grows to take in more 
This is the end the final outcome of the final war 
May the future be drowned in blood till its last dying gasp fades into the nothingness of eternity 
Now put a knife to the throat of life and bleed it dry, dry , dry 

How do kill the species thatâs already dead 
Put a gun to your temple and a bullet in your head 
How do you destroy the whole of mankind 
A knife to the throat works best I find 
A knife to every throat works best I find 

Whoâs face does life wear this time!! This timeâ¦ this timeâ¦.
