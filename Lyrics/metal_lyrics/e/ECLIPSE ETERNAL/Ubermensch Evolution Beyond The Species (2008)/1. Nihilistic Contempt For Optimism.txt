You don't exist
You live only in my head
And some day soon
To the fires of ambition you'll be feed
You will burn and fuel the flame
that turns all the hate, where, as a memory
you will remain. You will remain
I have no remorse for that which is dead, 
for all that has lived was born in my head
I gave you substance, the will to be
When I take it back it just returns to me,
it just returns to me
This illusion of being is just a facade,
reality just a word, truth just a lie
There iis no reason, no answer, to any question why
Your past never existed
but the future is clear
When I am gone 
You will all disappear
Back to the emptiness from whence you came,
beyond existance
for existance is but a name
The reality and the illusion
are one and the same
You are all just thoughts
caught in my mind for a time
You are just pieces,
the whole is mine.
Mine
