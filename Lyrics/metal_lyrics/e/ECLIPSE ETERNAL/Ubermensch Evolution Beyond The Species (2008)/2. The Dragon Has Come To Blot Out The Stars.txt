Dark ages have come to pass
Bring us the black flame to light our way
We shall follow we shall obey 
The ways of chaos 
Return universe to abyss 
Extermination of existence 
Dark eons have come once again
Old gods return from black abyss 
From void to void 
The beginning reversed, 
The ending come to pass
We the strong the elite 
our will to power to non existence, 
Back to the past were time is nothing
Where matter is irrelevant 
The old gods have come, 
The seventh seal is opened, 
We hold the keys 
The blackest hate unleashed, 
Reign on the infernal 
Eclipse now eternal, eclipse now eternal 
In the darkest abyss of space, 
the fabric of time and matter,
unfold and come apart 
Our cities shall lie in ruins, 
our great civilizations fallen to disgrace, 
life has no meaning to the cosmic disorder, 
chaos beyond imagining, 
beyond human comprehension, 
exploding from the beyond 
the end become the beginning, 
reversal of the order, 
unmaking of creation, 
the dragon has come to blot out the stars! 
To reverse the beginning!  
The orbits decay 
drawing together dust and rock, 
matter colliding, 
black hole rising, 
draw in a breath of cosmic debris,
beyond space and time, 
removal of reality, 
the dragon has come to reverse the beginning 
A wave of colors across the sky 
brilliant explosions great us as we die 
there is no remorse no pain left to feel 
the beauty beyond imaging grasps our minds entirely 
the sounds of destruction blow our hearing completely 
the sights are blinding yet burnt in our minds
the last thought of mankind 
is to die with this sight is to die fulfilled 
The dragon has come and blotted out the stars
