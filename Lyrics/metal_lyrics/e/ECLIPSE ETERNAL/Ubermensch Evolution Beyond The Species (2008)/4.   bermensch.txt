What was once one species now two divide
Left in the wake a river of blood, ages wide
The wounds we have left shall never heal
The mark of our rising shall forever your fate seal
Our birth is the catalyst of renewal
Our strength is equal to our hate
Our voice is the sound of thunder

As we proclaim your fate
The is the birth of a new age
This is the future of mankind
We are coming
A black dawn
Stand with us, proud beside us
