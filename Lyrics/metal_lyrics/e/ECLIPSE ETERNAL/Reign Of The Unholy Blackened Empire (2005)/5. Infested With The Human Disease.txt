Growing inside it is alive festering inside it has survived
I was given a human name but inside the demon remains
I watch the world go by through this human eye I watch the world go by and I wish it all to die
Misanthropic impulses screaching there will misanthropic imuplses screaming there will
Out of this human mouth they scream kill
I've shed my skin peeled away the layer taken myself apart ripped out this human heart
Your murdered children live in my chest screaming and crying they will never rest
Your dead children live in my chest they will never rest
In the darkest of shadows in the darkest of night
My eyes now burn with hells fiery light
Humanity cannot escape centuries of hate their stupidity caused this fate now now it too fucking late
No more morality no more christianity as I rape your faith you cry blashpemy your tears are as fake as your sincerety end of your life we consumate with a knive
We consumate with this here Knife!!!! [repeat]
The world is infested with the human disease the only cure is DEATH
A thousand rasorblades all cutting you apart
A million maggots all eating your heart
A million needles all piercing the eye
All your children just grow up to die!
Forever in pain you will remain
Forever insane and in blood we will reign!
