Upon this battlefield earth I stand sword upraised in defiance of all that was all that is and all that shall be
Chaos has a voice and I am it
Behold as I walk through the valley as the shadow of death you shall learn to fear evil for your lord is not with thee he cannot guide thee he cannot save thee I am coming for thee
The road to heaven shall be paved in the blood of the innocent
Behold I cometh with clouds of flies and every eye shall see me followed by those honoured enough to have pierced him and the earth shall wail beneath our reign
I am the Alpha I am the Omega the beginning and the ending which was and which is I am forever
Come with us let us lay in wait for blood let us lurk privaly for the innocent with cause let us swallow up alive as the grave and whole as those that go into the abyss let us laugh at humanities calamity mock when there fear cometh as desolation and destruction cometh as a whirlwind
And when they call upon christ for salvation he shall not answer for he is dead and we have killed him they shall kneel before us but we shall show them no mercy for they hated knowledge and did not fear their true lord they shall eat the fruit of there own devices for the turning away of the truth shall slay and the beliefs of fools shall destroy them!
And the rivers shall run red with their blood
Drink till your heart is content to kill the world we have been sent
Only weak fools do repent for we are all hellbent
Burn their churchs torch their temples kill their priests sacrifice their disicples
Tonight we shall eat of their flesh and drink of their blood
Marching over the corpses of the people we've killed straight to hells gates with bloodlust we're filled from out of the flames a starcase doth arrise spiralling upwards it pierces the skies
We have declared Armeggedon upon heaven!
Behold as I walk through the heavens as the shadow of their death they shall learn to fear evil for there lord is not with them he shall not guide them he cannot save them for he is dead and we have killed him
Your Lord Is DEAD!
Forever live in fear of the Unholy Blackened Empire
