Father awaken from your long slumber the world is in bloom it is ready for deflowering
The night is calling whisperering her sweet hate for life
The icey winds numb our minds as we feel the cold hands of death grasp our hearts and squeeze
The moon will soon eclipse the sun and darkness will once again cover the earth
Blood will flow through the streets as all the suns of light are slaughtered
Once again the preditors will rule the night
My lips ache for the taste of her poisoness kiss my loving lier Oh Medusa my love bless me with thy deadly stare I wish to look upon your beauty for eternity
Lady Macbeth hark my pleas grant me thy wisdom cowardice traded for strength and purpose

Blood quench my thirst for death [2x]

He getting close I hear him in my dreams whispering his disires
Awaken the dead he says Awaken the Fallen
Awake the demons within rise its time for the war to begin [repeat many times]

As I speak the sacred hyms I feel the power rushing through me In the darkest of shadows I shall forever be

I call upon thee my brethren
Awaken Set
Awaken Cain
Awaken Liaviation King of the Night
Awaken Shive destroyer of the light
Awaken Belial Beezelbub lord of the flies
Awaken Damian Prince of Darkness and lies
Awaken Hecate Goddess of the Underworld
Awaken SATAN lord of them all
I call upon thee
Gods Of The Dark
Awaken
It has been to long since we walked the earth together and reaped what god hath sown
The future belongs to us
Come forth and let us take what is rightfully ours
It is time for this world to end and ours to BEGIN!
AWAKEN Ye Lords Of The Dark!
It is time for there world to end and ours to BEGIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
