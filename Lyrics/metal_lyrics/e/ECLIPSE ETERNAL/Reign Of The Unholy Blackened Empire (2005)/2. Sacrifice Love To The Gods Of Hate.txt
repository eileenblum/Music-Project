Accipio Mei Lustratio
Accipio Mei Porricio Minua Vita
Accipio Mei cruentus contemno, diablo
Mei provis exercistus hostis immolo maligo
The moon now arrisses ans eclipses the sun
The sky goes red like christs wrists as they bled
Nocturnal awakening the beasts come to live
Preditor or prey
Life or death
Fog covers the ground whispering all around
A new king has been crowned and the unholy blackened empire found
Tonight the dark mistress has sent her minions out
Death stalks the night tonight
Consuming her flesh drinking her blood bathing in her tears I am all your darkest fears
She cometh to me my black widow mistress and tells me as king I will reign
Kiss these parched lips let me drink from your vein
With one hand on my chest and a look in her eyes
She tears out my heart despite my cries
With a kiss of her lips and a grinding of her thighs
I moan in release as my souls it dies
Hell I am coming open your doors stand aside cerberus I've earned my keep
Hark I hear the dark angels sing of blood and lust and ther new overlord king
The fog ckings to my skin as if to hide my slowly decomposing body
My blood goes cold as the final drop of blood hits the ground
In the silence of the forest my dying screams are the only sound
Oh lords of the dark except this sacrifice of my blood and of my life
Allow my tormented sould into your kingdom of everlasting fire
Oh lords of the dark why am I still alive
Without a heart or soul from the bloodied ground I do arrise
Oh lords of the dark why have you left me here in this world I despise why am I still alive in this world I despise cause my hate never dies!
From the ashes of my death I arise.
