Onward to WAR!!!!!
Let the darkness be forevermore
Start the third world war!
Let chaos reign forevermore
Every human dead with a bullet in there head
Paint the whole world red cry with tears of lead
Hate thy neighbour Kill thy son
Raise your swords for the unholy one
For him we rule these lands with weapons in our hands
Mercy is for the weak no redemption shall we seek
You will learn to serve or you'll get what you deserve
[repeat above lines]

There can be only one end to this war... everyone dead!

Thus for the crime of life do I proclaim the punishment of death
Let the weak be banished from the earth... permenantly
Thus I have spoken so shall it be done

As the last rays of light leaves the skies
As all your hope dies
The Eternal King from below doth arrise
As bombs now scorth the skys
As all that is human dies
The Eternal King from below doth arrise
[repeat]
Death to the weak no redemption shall we seek
We were born to fight they shall feel our might
Kill everything that liveth in the light
Forever we will dwell in thee eternal night!
