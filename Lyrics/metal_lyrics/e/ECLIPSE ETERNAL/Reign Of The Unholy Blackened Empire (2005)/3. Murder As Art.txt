Fear me when you see me as well you should plead all you want it will do you no good
I will find you no matter where you hide no longer am I a man my humanity has died
Run as fast as you can it will never be fast enought living out my darkest fantasies I create snuff
Each bitch I find I cut off her face crawling on the floor they never leave this place
I pull out my knife and cut her a new hole make it real big and fuck her soul
Tear out her heart look at this blood now this is art
What a magnificent cacophony of screams cutting thier flesh till the blood streams
Ripping them apart drinking thier life right out've thier heart stabbed and strangled now this is art
With every sun that does rise by my hand another bitch dies sacrificed thier lives to the maggots and the flies bury thier bodies six feet under the ground hidden away where they'll never be found
With blood on my hands and a body on the floor I stalk through the streets always looking for more cause murder is art, my knife is my brush your body my canvas!
"Until the end of time I will always hunt you for that is my nature and like nature I will always find a way whether it in ten year or later today I will see you dead!
The only reason you're still alive is cause I haven't killed you yet!
Murder as Art murder as art spit in her face and tear out her heart
Murder is art murder is art cut off her face and tear out her heart
What a magnificent cacophony of screams cutting their flesh till the blood streams ripping them apart draining their life right out of their heart stabbed and strangled now this is art!
Each bitch I find I cut off her face crawling on the floor they never leave this place I pull out a knife and cut her a new hole make it real big and fuck her soul tear out her heart stabbed and beaten now this is art!
Now this is art. A man can do alot with a knife in the right place
With every son that does rise by my hand another one dies!
Sacrifice their lives to the maggots and the flies bury their bodies six feet under the ground hidden away where they'll never be found with blood on my hands and a body on the floor I search through the streets always looking for more cause Murder is Art My knife is my brush Your body my canvas!
In my eyes your already dead!!!
