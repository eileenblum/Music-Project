Born to smother your hope born to strangle your will
Every word that I say, a thousand shades grey
Wrapping you in despair, a steady rot and decay
Know that there is an exit, Know that I am the noose
Hanging always near
Know that I am the noose
Speaking not in tongues but in truth
In a world of concrete and worthless people
Know that I am the noose
Never judging always waiting
Know that I am the noose
In a world of shit as you drown in piss
Know that I am the noose, Know that I am the noose
No light in my darkness, No future, No hope
I did not ask for this but this is who I am
My presence like disease and you an open wound
I did not ask for this but this is what I am
A darkness without light
An end always in sight
Know that there is an exit Know that I am the noose
Born to smother your hope
Born to strangle your will
Every word that I say, a thousand shades of grey
Wrapping you in despair, a steady rot and decay
Know that there is an exit Know that I am the noose
My presence like disease
And you an open wound
I did not ask for this but this is what I am
A darkness in the light An end always in sight
Know that there is an exit
Know that there is a noose
As you life slowly fades and you swing to and fro know that I feel nothing
Nothing. NOTHING!
