I'm standing here, I'm right here beside you
You're not alone, just look in the mirror
Come hold my hand, and do what you have to
I know you hear me, I am you

So alone, fighting forever
On my own, it's now or never
Try to see, try to remember
Why you're here, make me surrender
You're always seen corrupting my mind
Blinding me inside
Had enough, now I remember
So tonight, I'm leaving you behind

I am the one, the one to rely on
Look what I've done, and what you've become
So take my hand, and do what you have to
I know you hear me, I am you

So alone, fighting forever
On my own, it's now or never
Try to see, try to remember
Why you're here, make me surrender
You're always seen corrupting my mind
Blinding me inside
Had enough, now I remember
So tonight, I'm leaving you behind

So alone, fighting forever
On my own, it's now or never
Try to see, try to remember
Why you're here, make me surrender
You're always seen corrupting my mind
Blinding me inside
Had enough, now I remember
So tonight, I'm leaving you behind
