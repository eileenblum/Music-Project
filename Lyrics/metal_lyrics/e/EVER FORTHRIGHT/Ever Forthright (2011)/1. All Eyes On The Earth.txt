fortune 
I've figured out 
the perfect plan to build 
in their hours of laughing 
minutes shall rewrite the course 
of their lives 
forever 

shade (shade) 
for years (for years) 
we'd watch you grow 
and be ok 
we'd wait 
for years (for years) 
to watch you grow 
and see you fade (we'll see you fade) 

but now you see what i mean 
(but now you see what i mean) 
cause when i told you 
that this was the end 
you didn't believe me 
(you didn't believe me) 

that i could strike city lights 
and scaling homes 
and tear your civilization down 
(to the ground) 
precious moments turn to dust 
a failing bloodline approaches 
countdown 

time was, time is 
time is over 

they charm their way with promise 
with words appealing to 
your honesty 
your beliefs 

shade (shade) 
for years (for years) 
we'd watch you grow 
and be ok 
we'd wait 
for years (for years) 
to watch you grow 
and see you fade (we'll see you fade) 

only the greater world 
will see its own 
(passengers of akin mind) 
only the greater world 
will see its own 
(waves aglow, surround) 

(the sound it ignites love and fire) 
running for the gate 
never gonna make it out alive 
and I see your eyes 
and feel their life 
(the sound it ignites love and fire) 
holding on to faith 
that we're gonna make it out alive 
and see the skies 

(the grand outline comes down) 
I didn't give permission 
(please let us go) 
I didn't give permission now 
(please let us live) 

your bloodline is 
no longer 

no escape 
bound to drift eternally 
true to space 
forever moving towards the barren waste 
drawn unto the vacant edge 
finally 
all of my thoughts 
are made to manifest 
bound to drift eternally 
true to space 
forever moving towards the barren waste 
drawn unto the vacant edge
