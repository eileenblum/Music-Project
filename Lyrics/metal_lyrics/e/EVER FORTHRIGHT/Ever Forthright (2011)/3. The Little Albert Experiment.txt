(I am) 

masses content with placement 
subjection's shadow 
living out some bizarre existence 
foreign to me 

rage breaks self control 

violent by nature 
amended for social thralldom 

through imagery 
I now foresee this world 
lost and fading out 
conditioned by the fear 
turning on ourselves 

dreaming I'll be 
awake and free 

question yourself 
mimic the words of god 

they would rather leave me 
severed or tame 
wake up tonight 
let the dead reclaim 
all that's been taken 
they would rather leave me 
in divide 
so follow and wake up 
tonight, it's time to walk again 

resonance, resonance built 
blood, innocence spilled 

war, what if it came to pass 
socially conditioned 
violently alone 

slowly we breathe 
once more to be 

slowly we see 
slowly we can breathe 
not with our eyes 
not with the lungs sold 
ash of the bone 
ash of the torn earth 
once more to live 
once more we shall be 

they would rather leave me 
severed or tame 
wake up tonight 
let the dead reclaim 
all that's been taken 
they would rather leave me 
in divide 
so follow and wake up 
tonight, it's time to walk again 

mind over my life over mind 

no reaction to the call 
form my own path, made to walk 
a reminder for us all 
this procedure, bares no truth at all
