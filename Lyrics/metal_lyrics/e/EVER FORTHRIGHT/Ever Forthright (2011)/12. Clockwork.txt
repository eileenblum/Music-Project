roads aligning 
distant memories come forth 
bound by perception 
senses, and obscure direction 

the mind, assured 
by evidence 
designed, result 
no matter, either way 
experience moves forth 

chains withholding me, jade 
we know by now 
our discerning is relative 
to all that we see 
through an idea 
we're assured, however 

to survive 
we'll survive 
by the clock 
I'll find a way out 

change or grown 
despite my doubt 
of whether I'm alone 
or not 
the world knows 
its source is growing old 
and thin 
bitter over the fact 
that I'm still here 
I'm over being alive 
(over being alive) 
being alive
