reaction delayed 
build the shape when the time is right 
douse the flame 
cast the voices 
step beyond the lines 

they isolate 
the damaged ones for all their quandaries 
devastate 

rest, rest, no rest 

please detach from the past 
it's all the same to me 
don't ask 
free at last 
my escape into the black 

destruction, decay 
realities of a lost cause 
bow in your loss 
counter the cross 
fade away 

we reanimate 
by the laws of variance 
bow in your loss 
counter the cross 
for redemption 

we are lost 
waiting for 
the perfect moment 
to kill you 

loss, set, rein 

the reflections of 
visceral tendencies 
generating the act forward 

recall the flame 
cast the voices 
step beyond the lines 

they isolate 
the damaged ones for all their quandaries 
devastate 

rest, rest, no rest 

please detach from the past 
it's all the same to me 
just don't ask 
free at last 
my escape into the black 

don't follow me 
in my escape
