I never meant to make 
you feel a life of bother 
so many miles apart 
and out of sight 
show me a way beyond this lonely ocean 
we'll make the sky ignite 
then just sail away 
gonna go away 

you were never meant to see 
the soloist in me 

always and forever 
i will give you 
all my love and my heart 
for the day, all the way 

we can't remember 
just what it is to vibe and be ourselves 
we can't remember 
the feeling of being right here 

we are the world 
united 
we are the world 

wake up my sleeping child 
follow in majesty 
you'll never get to see 
the soloist imagined in your dreaming 

always and forever 
i will give you 
all my love and my heart 
for the day, all the way 

no delay 
every night 
seems bright 
sings goodbye 
we can take off 
and fly 

always and forever 
i will give you 
all my love and my heart 
for the day, all the way 

gonna give you all my love world 
gonna give it to you now 
all for the day 
gonna give it to you all the way 
always and forever 
all for the day 
gonna give it to you all the way you know 
see where your heart has gone, gone for now 
you're never meant to see 
you'll never ever be what you love 
give into me now 
gonna make my heart sing 
you'll never get to see 
you'll never ever be what you love 
for the world 
you'll never get to see where you are now
