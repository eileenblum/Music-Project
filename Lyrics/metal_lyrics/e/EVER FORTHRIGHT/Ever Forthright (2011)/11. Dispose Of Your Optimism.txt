this nebulous acquiescence 
transposes my song, 
subtle modes of separation 
becoming, multiplying 
ascending upward 
stemming from roots, within 

recapture me 
long before surrender 
(deny, I will give) 
optimism paves our disconnect 

shattered, this wave of expectance 
divided eyes 
subtle thoughts of separation 
elevating, magnifying 
ever 
stemming from roots, within 

recapture me 
long before surrender 
(deny, I will give) 
optimism paves the the disconnect 

so just stay with me 
we lose control 
stay with me 
we've lost control 
through vacant promise 

and in the wake of my transmission 
the only thought that comes to mind 
are we alone? 
heads out the gate 
all my life I've been waiting to feel this love 

wait for the call 

I'm waiting 
I'm holding on 
to notions of a former belief 
I redeemed 
fade out behind 
the quiet release of the reins 
sadly, I just let it die 

no, my time has not decayed 
sustaining reasons for my salvation 
forgiveness is not impossible 

dispose of this sense 
another innocent motion 
suffers the consequences 

lost in pain 
resound 
descending 

senseless 
come detached 
into the modern 
cycle of existence, forever 
powerless 
come detached 
into the modern 
interval of existence, forever 

ailing me 
nothing can be replaced 
separate 

repugnance and disdain 
rooted deep within 

I try to gain control 
I'm lost within this mental labyrinth 
with all the things we know 
I ask myself this question 
are we alone? 
in this whole wide universe 
are we alone? 
I don't know 

are we alone? 
heads out the gate 
all my life I've been waiting to feel this love
