failing to put in genuine effort 
for the time, the end is official 
perilous, the cost is way too high 
and only in the way 
steel frame, distant sight 
and so unbreakable 
the pattern by which you will now decide 
and learn to let someone else be free 

there is no escape from the past this time 
fuck the bed that you're making 
wake up in a burning grave 
never mind all the times that we would fly 
cut the chord, bend the fabric's essence 
and moderate the lies 

(oh god) 
(oh my god) 
they're coming out 
bound for generations 
the shadows of a fallen kind 
back out, back out again 
the bleeding souls 
infected 
draining the life of everything 

we the ones who redefine the light 
still we walk alone 
because of all the things in life 
the curse is in the knowledge 
we the ones who redefine the light 
still we walk alone 
before waking up 
close your eyes 

we are the prototypes of the universe 
We are alone 

only believe the silence in your heart 
cross the tragedy 

failing to put in genuine effort 
for the time, the end is official 
perilous, the cost is way too high 
and far beyond the pay 
steel frame, distant sight 
and so unbreakable 
the pattern by which you will now decide 
and learn to let someone else be free 

blood, faith, christ, lies, blood 
there is no god
