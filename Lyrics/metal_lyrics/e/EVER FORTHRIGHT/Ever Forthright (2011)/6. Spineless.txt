violence, relentless 
fuck it, show me blood 
this is what we came for 
the violence, relentless 
fuck it, show me blood 
this is what i want from you 

blood 

let's rip the fucking world apart 
come on 

burn with the path you chose 
you will know fear alone 
reaping what you have sewn 
follow me 

(and) rip this world apart 

so when you got the signs 
that you were in charge 
you were wrong 

coward 
take your place 
you coward 
fuck with me 

speak from shadows 
infect your circle 

laughing 
as you spit hatred 
from your sheltered room 
you're fucking pathetic 
come get a taste of violence 
fuck it, show me blood 
this is what I came to see 

die 

forces now descending 
greater than this world 
favor me 
with fortune you'll 
get sick 
you'll get sick 
fuck it 
you'll get sick and waste away 
this is why i came here 
to return what was given to me 
now we'll see 
who is here to stay 

sweet, the taste of vengeance 
followed by your downfall 

rip this world apart
