eyes 
it's always in the eyes 
below the lights 
we're in trouble 
play 
laugh it all away 
below the night 
shit is always on 

(haunted, drawn to the melody) 
fashion holds you 
to a different world 
(feeling one with the energy) 
so watch my love 
undress your perfect style 

(no we can't) 
wait so long 
can't take anymore 
lost in our escape 
passion precedes the smile 

(haunted, drawn to the melody) 
fashion holds you 
to a different world 
(feeling one with the energy) 
so watch my love 
undress your perfect style 

feel the wave 
come with me 
we both explode 

the walls come down 
we stand revealed 
to move in sync as one 

resist me now 
you've figured me out 
resist me now 
you can't let me down 

no matter the street or side 
we live out in the night 
bridge the space 
between our ways 

lines 
we always cross the line 
below the lights 
we're so beautiful 
play 
laugh it all away 
below the night 
shit is always on 

(haunted, drawn to the melody) 
fashion holds you 
to a different world 
(feeling one with the energy) 
so watch my love 
undress your perfect style 

(no we can't) 
wait so long 
can't take anymore 
lost in our escape 
passion precedes the smile
