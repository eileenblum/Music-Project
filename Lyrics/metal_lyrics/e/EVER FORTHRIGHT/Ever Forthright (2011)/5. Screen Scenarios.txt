places, the camera feeds the role 
rig the lights 
the stage set one more time 
for giant stars asleep 

breath, refrain 
disbelief, you've come for me 
lift the screen 
disbelief, you've come for me 
hold the present frame 

between the energy 
look on the bright side 
play the honoree 
every second of the way 
disguised inside 
the pattern makes it out alive 

unforeseen 
the unlikely prospect 
of my heart igniting 
patient learning 
a reflection of the love we lost 

its all what you make it 
but how come it's so different now 
over, in rapid time 
every view rendering hope defied 

all my life 
holding on inside 
to the light 
in your eyes 

(all my life) 
if only life could be designed 
for just a moment to unfold 

(all your life) 
we'd see beyond the weight of the world 
and forever put the past aside 

(all our life) 
see beyond the open road 
whatever makes your body fly 
cause you've got to let it go 
and carry on 

rig the lights 
the stage set one more time 
for giant stars asleep 

breath, refrain 
disbelief, you've come for me 
lift the screen 
disbelief, you've come for me 
hold the present frame 

between the energy 
look on the bright side 
play the honoree 
every second of the way 
disguised inside 
the pattern makes it out alive 

Senses caressed 
Is all we need on screen 

Senses caressed 
Is all I need on screen
