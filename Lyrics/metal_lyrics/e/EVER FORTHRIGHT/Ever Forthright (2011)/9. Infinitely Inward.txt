My eyes open 
but i can't feel anything 
broken and confused 
tell me how do i escape this dream? 
didn't ask to be here 
but i feel like it's too late to leave 
trapped inside this world 
or trapped inside of me? 
so cold and alone it's clear to me 
struggle is futile and my future's bleak 
in a place where time collides 
forsaking the world 
crossing the divide 

of belief 
memories 
deceiving 
in this place 
i feel real 

dreams are made 
to find the shore 
someway I've recognized 
my image has gone awry 

don't wake up 

dreams are made 
to find the shore 
someway implied 
it's going to be alright 

(I will fall to meaning, I will fall beneath) 
from it all, the magic fades 
withering beneath the world 
way beyond the reach of the water 
forgive me all, I'm leaving 

like all things sound 
they later move on 
likewise 
my life has gone 
patient, waiting for change 
to reach me 
trade 

taken from the dream 
endlessly 
just let me be 
let me sleep 

wait and see 
this consciousness 
will soon break 
don't wake up 

dreams are made 
to find the shore 
someway implied 
it's going to be alright 

(I will fall to meaning, I will fall beneath) 
from it all, the magic fades 
withering beneath the world 
way beyond the reach of the water 
forgive me all, I'm leaving 

won't somebody come pinch me? 
wake me up from this bad, bad dream 
I'm getting lost in this world between 
stuck in purgatory 
oh this must be heaven 
how spining round 
don't know which way is up or down 
somewhow i'm standing with my hands to the ground 
and i'm trying to reach for some air 
don't know how i'm going to breathe 
and i'm trying to reach for some air 
don't know how i'm going to breathe 

reach for some air 
I can't breathe
