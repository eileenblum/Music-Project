[Lyrics &amp; music by Byrd]

It all began at the day of birth
The choice of life that can last for eternity
To choose the path of the beast
Is the life of fire

Exceeding heat of 1000 degrees
Flesh starts to melt like an incurable disease

Liquid flesh
Liquid flesh
Liquid flesh
Liquid flesh

The smell of stench is all around
Flesh dripping corpses lying on the ground

Exceeding heat of 1000 degrees
Flesh starts to melt like an incurable disease

Liquid flesh
