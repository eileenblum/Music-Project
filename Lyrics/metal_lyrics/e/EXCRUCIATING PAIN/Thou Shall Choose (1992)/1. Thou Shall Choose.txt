[Lyrics by Oliveri &amp; Byrd, Music by Murray &amp; Byrd]

Purified from evil defects
Free from the curses

Hell is of fire
Walls of serpents
Whose ground is a stream
There for you to drown

If you donât believe
If you donât believe

If you donât believe
If you donât believe

I will not commit a sin
I will not commit violence
I will not take your life
I will not utter lies

Let me not fall under your knives
Slaughter only the weak
Bring yeâ not forward your wickedness
Or you shall be punished
Do no curse God

Let not evil come upon you
I speak the truth

Born to choose your God
The choice is up to you

Thou shall choose
Thou shall choose
Thou shall choose
Thou shall choose

I will not commit a sin
I will not commit violence
I will not take your life
I will not utter lies

Thou shall choose!
