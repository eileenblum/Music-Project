[Lyrics &amp; music by Byrd]

A tormented soul trying to take your life
Haunting the earth till the end of time

Hatred lives in the life of many
Excruciating agony is living

Evil is upon us
What shall we do?

Fight with force
And destroy those who are cruel

Foresee the future
The path lies before thee

Take control before everyone believes

He will trick the mind of every human life
To make you believe he is God

Therefore reach deep into the soul
And follow your heart
And you will know who is your God
