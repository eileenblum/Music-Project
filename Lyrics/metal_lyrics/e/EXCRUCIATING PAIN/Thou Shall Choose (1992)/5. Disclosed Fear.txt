[Lyrics by Lappin, Music by Byrd]

Panic without help
Youâve forgotten the world
Open the door to your brand new destiny

You left behind the greatness that once ruled
Youâve lost your power
Forever forgotten

Hypothetical dream that was believed
Now gone to welcome the changes

That you brought on yourself
You control the underground

Too many opposing forces working against and not
Flowing together making things hard for the deep
Thought that keeps this dwelling place together

Exploding episodes of misanthropy
Cold construction, freezing destruction
Introduction to mass induction
A life assumption

Itâs strange how history repeat itself but with less distinction
And more negative inner thoughts of the forgotten world
