[Lyrics by Lappin, Music by Byrd]

From the mouth of the sea
I come for thee

Unbound for eternity
Regressive form

I am born
Your cries mean nothing to me
Iâll kill
Those that steal

Unto life I bring you death
Ungodly horror needs no rest
As the days drag through and through
My claws and fangs sink into you

Have hatred in their minds
I am sworn over again
To rid them of mankind

Iâm one with man
I need no friends
I will live while your life ends
Deconstruction is my path
You will scream while I will laugh

Unto life I bring you death
Ungodly horror needs no rest
As the days drag through and through
My claws and fangs sink into you

Itâs too late
I cannot wait
Youâll see
When I come for you
