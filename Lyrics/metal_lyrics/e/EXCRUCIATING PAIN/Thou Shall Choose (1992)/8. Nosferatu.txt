[Lyrics by Lappin, Music by Byrd]

Awaken when the sun goes down
Pure virgin blood is what must be bound
With sharpened teeth it continues to slay
Youthful maidens until the light of day
As the creature creeps from its grave
A slow painful death is all that it craves
No garlic and crucifix to obviate death
A useless gold talisman is all you have left

Once bitten lifeâs drained from your neck
Hemorrhage of veins
Transforming to the world of shadows
As morbid mental changes begin

Your will to love is suffocating
Your life seduces the breast as the sun rises
The undead is gone
Not forgetting his desire to feast

Twice bitten the pain is intense
You feel your blood starting to freeze
Eyes are burnt by the sunâs rays
Gradually brings you to your knees

As you crawl to the safety of home
A wave of terror overcomes you
Standing up looking at your reflection
All you see is a phantasmic image

Third time, the one that you dread
Welcomes you to the world of the undead
A lustful thought, you race to the village
Devour the lives of the mortal and innocent

As you wake up your mind is blank
Thereâs blood on your clothes, you breath is rank
You stare in silence, inquire what happened
Blackness destroys the light of the evening
A wise man feels the forces of evil
In his mind a door is opened

His hand grasps a wooden stake
Will not rest until Nosferatu is dead
Unknown forces a will or fate
Finds the parasite that is not awake
With the strength that is not only his
Guides the vampire to another dimension

Awaken when the sun goes down
Pure virgin blood is what must be bound
With sharpened teeth it continues to slay
Youthful maidens until the light of day
As the creature creeps from its grave
A slow painful death is all that it craves
No garlic and crucifix to obviate death
A useless gold talisman is all you have left
