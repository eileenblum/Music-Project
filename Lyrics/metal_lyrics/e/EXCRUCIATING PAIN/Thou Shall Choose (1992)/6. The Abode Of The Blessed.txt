[Lyrics by Nash &amp; Byrd, Music by Byrd]

After death the souls of those who have spoken the truth
Upon earth who had committed no act of fraud or deceit
Made their way to the sky and took up their abode with the blessed

Unseen dark and gloomy there were pits of fire
And it formed the home of ghouls and those of the damned

It was a place sacred to the gods
A region of mystery unsuitable for the dead
At the entrance an unbearable heat of fumes
And vapors which destroyed any that passed

Unseen dark and gloomy there were pits of fire
And it formed the home of ghouls and those of the damned

Great sorrow came over their souls
For they wished to drink and quench their
Thirst they were unable to do anything
For the fear of the fire had enslaved them

The light from which wakes the dead
Those of life enable them to live again
Every being that ministers to God
And every spirit must abide by the command
