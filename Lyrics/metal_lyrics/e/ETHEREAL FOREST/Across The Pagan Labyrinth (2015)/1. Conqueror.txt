[Music is by Ethereal Forest. Lyrics are by Tybalt, Azrael]

Black clouds obscure the moon,
And with darkness comes death.
The coldest winds rape my soul,
As night spreads her wings.
Serpent tongues speak to me,
Whispering my name upon the wind.
With the fire of hate in my heart,
I travel across this plain.

Enshrouded by mist and sulphur fog,
I walk through the valley of death.
Harken the shrieks of dying men,
Sworn to take their last breath.
Heretics of the bible despair,
One by one they are swept away.
Confined to eternal sleep,
Among them I set my throne.

Death walks upon the earth this night,
Glory commanded by my will.
Steadfast brothers of mine,
The conquered now lie still.
Moonlight breaks upon the land,
Revealing faces of the fallen few.
Your empire lies in ruins,
As mine is built anew.
