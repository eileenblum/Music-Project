[Music is by Ethereal Forest. Lyrics are by Tybalt]

War!

The sun climbs over battlefields,
We make the journey with haste.
With full clan attire,
We walk the road to war.
To take the enemy by sword and force,
And full patriotic pride.
Only the strong will survive,
So stand together my brothers and fight with pride.

Alright!

As we march with strength in our hearts,
We must have the will to fight.
In honour, we praise our elders,
Upon this path to war.
With the legacy of our forefathers,
We shall give them hell.
And to show our strength on their own soil,
They will perish, die die die die die!

Within our hearts,
Within our blood,
We shall defend our legacy of old.
Upon this soil,
Upon this land,
We take your life to regain our glory once more.

Alright!
