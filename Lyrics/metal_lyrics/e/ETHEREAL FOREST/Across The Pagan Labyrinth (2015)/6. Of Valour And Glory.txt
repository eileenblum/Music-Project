[Music is by Ethereal Forest. Lyrics are by Tybalt]

As we march on,
Tension grips and our blood begins to boil.
Getting forever closer to war,
To crush our enemies with all of our might.
On our way to glory,
In life or death we will find honour.
Upon this day our hearts will guide us,
Through rock and stone we have found our way.

My kin and I,
Stand now on this fateful day.
Staring at death with a glint in our eyes,
With blade and shield by our side.
We now begin our charge,
With gods by our side.
Singing our ancient song,
The clash of steel against steel.

Death is all around us,
We will fight until the end.
We must press on like legends of old,
All I hear are screams of fallen warriors.
My fallen brothers are now in great company.

Death!

We fight on and on,
We've killed many men.
With valour and pride,
This last struggle on heathen soil.
As the sun dies,
On this field of death and decay.
When we leave this world,
A new dawn shall await us all.
