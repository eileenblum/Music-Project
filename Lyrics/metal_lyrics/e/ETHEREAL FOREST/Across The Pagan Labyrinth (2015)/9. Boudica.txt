[Music is by Ethereal Forest. Lyrics are by Azrael]

Her unyielding chariot tears across the horizon,
Boudica, Queen of the Britannia shores.
Scorned and betrayed by invaders from the east,
A bloodline defiled and a kingdom left to ruin.

The august Icenian lands shall rise and have its rightful vengeance,
Heed the words for they are forged in hatred and fire.

Trinovantes march with us, a time of strife is here,
Retribution for the annexation of our sovereign lands
To extinguish the usurper's reign, to bathe in their pain,
Camulodunum is blighted, Londinium's fate now awaits!

Fire rains from the sky, onward chariots storm,
Swords raised to the sky for our Icenian queen.
Charge!

Lest we forget our fallen lands, certitude of victory nears.
Into the fray where destiny lies, for we know no fear.

Begat the slaughter of life,
With sword and spear, blood runs red.
Fire begins to rise,
The scythe of death reaps the land.
Legions fall in their droves,
Destiny graved upon their flesh.
Unrelenting rage to the last,
This is Iceni pride.

Together we marched to die, or capture our victory,
Swords were raised to the sky for our Icenian queen.

Across the waves of time, her legacy still lives on,
For she walked upon a relentless path and met with victory.
Her unyielding chariot still thunders across the sacred sky,
Her ancient crusade immortal, true legends never die.
Never die...
