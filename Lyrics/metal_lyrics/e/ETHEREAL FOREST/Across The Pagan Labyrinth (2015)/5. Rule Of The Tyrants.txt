[Music is by Ethereal Forest. Lyrics are by Tybalt, Azrael]

As the pale moon gracefully rises,
As all nocturnal beasts awake.
An indescribable hunger,
Ravishes the land.
Abounding coldness, full of hate
Rotten flesh, rotten dreams
Desolation lands in its beauty
To enter and never return to this world

Would you ever want to?
I think not.
With the rule of the tyrants,
We must move onward...

Forward.
Forward march!
Forward.
Forward march!


The sound of a gathering storm,
We raise a sword to the archaic ones.
A legacy to be carved in flesh,
A treachery that is bathed in blood.
Into eternal damnation we tread,
Into chaos, we know no fear.
For our will is greater than death.
Lightening cracks the sky.


Can we taste defeat?
I think not.
With the rule of the tyrants,
We must move Onward....


Carving this world anew,
They wield their cross of lies like a scythe.
A thousand deaths my eyes have seen,
Blessed are we with the truth..

Forward.
Forward march!
Forward.
Forward march!


We are the true essence of the earth,
Heathen brothers bonded by blood.
In the darkest places I see death,
In the darkest places I hear lies.
Retribution for the holy men,
Their putrid blood upon our steel.
To destroy altars of betrayal,
Upon heathen soil they shall yield again!
