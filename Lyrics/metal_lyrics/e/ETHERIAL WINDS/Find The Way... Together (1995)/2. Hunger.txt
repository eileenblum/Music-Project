In a state of thinking dark
A hunger for the sudden
Blessed are those
Who touched these celestial pains
Appearance of the numb I felt
Reveal to me and watch me creep
And blessed I am
As I touched these etherial pains
Cross my heart
Stigmatize
A memory forever
A trembling heart
A sweating skin
It's flowing; adrenalin
And I hunger! Hunger
I hunger! Hunger
Accept the way I plead for
Accept my stay I need for
The hunger
And desire shall be my empire
And a throne shall be my home
Still my hunger!
Cross my heart
Stigmatize
A memory forever
A trembling heart
A sweating skin
It's flowing; adrenalin
And I hunger! Hunger
I hunger! Hunger
