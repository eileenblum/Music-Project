A wish of peace
Or is that too much to ask
Clear my mind from anger
Can't throw away this masque
A wish of harmony
Or hate is the first priority
A shrouded reality
No vision no dream
A world of hate and disharmony
Wish
Wish, my own abide is what I wish
Wish, it's I for I and I know it's selfish
Wish, my life in a dream is what I wish
Wish, and smell the breath of pure happiness.
