Entrance is blocked
The choice was yours
Your choice, the mind is shocked
These mistakes closed all doors
Entrance is blocked
There's no key to open
This secret, your voice just mock
You fool can't hope for:
Entrance
Entrance
Step away from fiction
Live this reality, mind preparation
Slide into these hands
Hand in hand with trust, escaping the
Trance
The believer is me
In me I believe
The trust in yourself
From hate relieved
Enter.
