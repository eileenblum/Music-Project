Daylight
The sun bleeds
Beams burst as thunder
Nature seeds
Withers under swampy mud
Night
The moon weeps
Isn't glad with existance
All life sleeps
Stunned through natures inheritance
I look in the eyes of the sun
It's samed and turns it's back
On me
I hear the cry of the moon
It suffers and wants to be
Free
It's a tragedy
Tragedy.
