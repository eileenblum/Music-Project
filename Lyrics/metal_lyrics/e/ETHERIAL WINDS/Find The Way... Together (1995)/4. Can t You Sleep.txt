The earth a sick abide
Immune towards the healing
On a virus death will ride
Has life no other meaning?
Eternal fear for coming sickness
Before the cure there are fears of hell
The future build on human weakness
The common question; do you sleep
Well?
The mind total blanc
Human existance is falling deep
I can't sleep
Sick! Emergency by all things in
Life
And I strive:
Healtly! Suddenly a dream calls and I
Fall deep
In my sleep
Join my sleep
What I've yearned for
Is coming true
Sandman whispers:
