For me
For the pain I've seen
Tears, the lust of grief
I reveal myself
This means
There's no hope for me
Elements of sorrow
Life's none!
The mind seems calm
Body starts to harm
Weep, a good ability
Lachrimatory
Lost in numb
No sorry for my pain
Pain a fatal injection
Of my history
Sad is my memory, me and grief float in ebony
Sad is my memory, my destiny lies in ebony
Sad is my melody, but it's meant to be a threnody.
