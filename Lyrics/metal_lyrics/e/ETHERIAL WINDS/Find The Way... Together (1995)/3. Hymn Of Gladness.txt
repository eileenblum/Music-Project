Pour all happiness over me
Draining the weakness out of my mind
Can you imagine the pain I've bared
I'm glad you've dared to take a flight
And taking me out of my night-mare
Please ease, and do not tease, please ease (my pain)
Don't burn my wings
Don't make me cry
If I try to fly
A reaction of happiness
Find time, do not play mime, find time (for me)
Strenght is growing in me
My painfull life I'll burn
In bliss my life will be
Your joy, from you I learn
The mirror's reflecting a smile to me
It winks and haunts the sad I'm free
You
Never take me back
To the life I've led
Never take me back
Send joy in me instead
Solitude exiled, your tenderness caress my feelings
See the problems through eyes of human beings
My thoughts under control, a hymn of gladness
A pledge I took to live, the way of happiness.
