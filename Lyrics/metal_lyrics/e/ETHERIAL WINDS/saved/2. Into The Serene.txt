Laying silent in the shade
Search the sky for stars
I have counted them all

Silent
Laying silent in a glade
Picture dreams of clouds afar
Serene now my call

An escape from this truth
An escape from this earth
Leave me be

I cherish a dream
Travel beyond what I imagine
I know it could be real
To find the key that make this happen

An escape into the serene

Silent
Laying silent in the shade
Weave fantasy to reality
A save abide I will find

Silent
Laying silent in a glade
And haunt the bitterness which lives in me
Serene is my mind
