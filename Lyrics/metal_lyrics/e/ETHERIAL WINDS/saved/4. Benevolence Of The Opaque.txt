When I see a glimpse of the dark
My deepest desire will carry it's mark
Concentrate the attractive face staring stark
Subconscious stretches in opaque it parks

In sublime place I'll stay
Benevolence of the opaque
Nothing in my way
Benevolence of the opaque

Soul pass out
Exultant shout
Away........
Float away all doubts

I weep my mind in ecstacy
Ejaculation dark I come to thee

When I see a glimpse of the dark
My deepest desire will carry it's mark
Concentrate the attractive face staring stark
Subconscious stretches in opaque it parks

In sublime place I stay
Benevolence of the opaque
Nothing in my way
Benevolence of the opaque
