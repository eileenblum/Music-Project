The eclipse of the sun
Throws a shadow on this planet
Cold winds rushing over land
Frost is reigning
All warmth is vanished

Winter

No romantic nights
Stare at the blue cold moon
Feel the earth becomes colder
Brain it's slowly freezing it slowly... dies

Nature a mass of ice

No romantic nights
Stare at the blue cold moon
Feel the earth becomes colder
Brain it's slowly freezing it slowly... dies

Nature a mass of ice

Frost I'm yours
Winter forever
