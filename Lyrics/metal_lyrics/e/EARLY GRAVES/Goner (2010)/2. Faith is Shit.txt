you said it would be best if we left it up to god
I said you see this glass, this empty heart, they'll never be thawed
all hell is is all right now and Ive never felt more at home
so fill this up my lonely cup that has never or will be good enough
dont save me
you said that you could be saved if you let him in your heart
I shrugged and said I could never tell heaven and hell apart
you asked what happens at the end of our life
I said hell is a hangover and heaven is an endless black night
dont save me
so save your worthless prayer
for yourself
for yourself
for yourself
dont save me
your faith in faith is shit
you'd rather spend your whole life down on your knees
Id rather spend it forgetting it all
Its all the same to me
