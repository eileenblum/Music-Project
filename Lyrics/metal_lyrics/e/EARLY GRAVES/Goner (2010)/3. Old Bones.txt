Ive ground them down to dust and scattered them to the wind
Ill keep burying them so that I can pretend that
I wont come home to find them screaming in my closet of how much Ive sinned
goddamn these old bones
goddamn these old bones
feelings of regret, piling up too much debt waiting for death like a blessed sunset
Ive said this time Im prepared for hell
Ive said this time I want no farewells
Ive said this time Ive already resign
Im out of time
goddamn these old bones
goddamn these old bones
feelings of regret, piling up too much debt waiting for a death like a blessed sunset
time is at our heels collecting those debts of what we learn to accept and what to never forget
Ive wasted my whole life trying to forgive myself so heres to you,
my crown of shit
we claw and tear for another breath but its hard to breath when theres nothing left
Ive spent my whole life trying to forgive myself so heres to you,
my crown of shit
