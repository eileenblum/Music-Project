Ive hit rock bottom again and I dont wanna call for help
Ive been clawing at these walls, with nooses around my neck
Ive folded all my cards
may day
Im burning wicks at both ends
may day
Its true Im coming undone
may day
you know Ive been calling for help
may day
I need these shovel wings to get me to that coffin
red night terrors and god, I smile at this all too often
Im crashing down bursting in flames
may day
I need a touch of mercy you say
may day
Im checking out
may day
