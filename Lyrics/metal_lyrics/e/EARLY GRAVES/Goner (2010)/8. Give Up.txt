in your loneliest night where you crawled and screamed and you ran out of friends to blame
where you drank yourself through those sorry years
and being dead by thirty was your only aim
in your loneliest night where you already knew you were meant to lose
where those easy words?
you threw in the towel and were finally through
I give up. I give up.
Im tired of fighting wars I just cant win
I give up. I give up.
Im tired of fighting wars I just cant win
in your loneliest night when your father died and how the thought still breaks your heart
where you tried to forgive the world but you knew your knives, they would never starve
in your loneliest night when you realized that, that your heart was finally hung
where were those easy words?
when you closed your eyes and we're finally done
I give up. I give up.
Im tired of fighting wars I just cant win
I give up. I give up.
Im tired of fighting wars I just cant win
you just cant fucking win
I give up.
