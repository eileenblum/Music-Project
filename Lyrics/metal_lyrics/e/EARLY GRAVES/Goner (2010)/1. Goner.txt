let me die
let me die and be done with this before I change my mind
and Im sorry, I cant wait
Id rather just spray the walls at the back of my head
and no, I dont care
Id rather you just forget me now. dont waste your memories
I just cant be here anymore
everyone that Ive ever loved Ive failed
everything I touch just turns to shit
I never could change a thing I swear
what I mean to say is that Im a gone gone goner
I hear the sirens call my name
too many tears that I had to make
just leave me where I lay
Id rather burn out than fade away
too many hellhounds on my trail
just let me die
just let me go
let me die
let me die and be done with this before I change my mind
and Im sorry
I cant wait
Id rather just spray the walls at the back of my head
IdontfuckingcareIdontfuckingcareIdontfuckingcareIdontfuckingcare
dear anyone that Ive ever loved,
Ive let you down
dear anyone who ever needed me,
Ive let you down
dear anyone whoever though I could change,
Ive let you down
dear anyone who'll ever read this note,
Ive always let you down
