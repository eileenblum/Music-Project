Im on the run again
from myself and an avalanche making for the hills from a surrendered past
A haunted face looking in the mirror waking from heartache and a familiar fear of
borrowed time being paid by fools, where I keep my eyes closed no matter how cruel
our lives crashing down all around our ears
life the dreams and hopes that seemed so near
I think I might be dreaming again
waiting to fade away, waiting for the end
I think Im always drinking too much
when what I hold against everyone is a cowards grudge
Im on the run
from all the love that Ill never know
so Ill stay here in heaven below
Im on the run
