Ill bear it all
I dont believe in much of anything anymore
Ill bear it all
not that there is much anymore to believe in anyways
its always worse after midnight
no rest in sleep, no rest in life
lets end this
before it ends us all
hopeless hands reaching for the sky 
before going 
head first into a stillborn sea 
like the rest of you, like the rest of me
I dont believe in much of anything anymore
Ill bear it all
not that there is much anymore to believe in anyways
Its always worse come daylight
no hands to hold so alone we get old
lets end this
before it ends us all
Ill bear it all
to dream of bleak grey shores, endless rolling waves. 
crashing.
silently.
with nothing else to hear or see or know
grief upon grief
my cup runneth over
