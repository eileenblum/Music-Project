Its best you know about all this now
Its best you know why I couldnt tell you
Its best you know why Im so cold
Its best you know...
Why? I dont know
ready to rot
ready to rot
ready to rot inside the fucking ground
Its best you know about all this now
Its best you know why I couldnt tell you
Its best you know why Im so cold
Its best you know..
Why?
I dont know
ready to rot
ready to rot
ready to rot inside the fucking ground
I never cared whether I woke up ever again
I never cared if I meant something to you
to me or anyone else
I should have done it sooner. pulled the trigger this same time last year. at least I wouldnt have been a burden to you, to me or anyone else
