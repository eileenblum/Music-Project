Kneel down
And benighted with sword
I am battle-born Nord
I like Fenrir and fjords
Feed me. The command fireball
Side scroll peons will fall
I make a dent in the thrall
Searching. Here we search in this chest
Look a chain mail vest
This heavy metal is best
I try, the key on the sword
The sword on the door
Key on rope and on door
Jump. Hit. Dodge. Hit
And now that I have bought my horse
I will ride my horse
I ride until I hit the shore
And then I ride some more
His weakness becomes clear to me
I have worked it out
I meet the boss I fight the boss
And then I kill the boss
And when you think he's dead
You realise he's not dead
Again I die this day
God I wished I'd saved
