Against the breeze
Flapping their leathery wings
Razory claws and sharp teeth
Fiery death they will bring
Breathing fire
Spewing hot lavarly heat
Smashing their food against trees
Eliminating enemies
See them fly â the flight of the dragons (Breathing their fire)
See them fly â the flight of the dragons (Nobody likes them)
See them fly â the flight of the dragons (Tearing down castles)
See them fly â the flight of the dragons (Flight of the Dragons)
The dragons flew away
Weâd thought theyâd gone away
They hadnât gone away
They came back yesterday
Miriam
Letâs tie the wench to a tree
Sacrifice virginity
Then maybe they will let us be
Here they fly
Ignoring our sweet offering
Instead crushing us randomly
Perhaps we should have a plan B
