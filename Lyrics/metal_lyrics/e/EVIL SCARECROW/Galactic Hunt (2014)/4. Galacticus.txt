Your praise and Reverence
Lends to me sickness and bile
Your exultant cried
Leave me with nothing left not to revile
My unspoken desire
Is the baking of flesh
Behind innocent eyes
Grins my monster inside
GALACTICUS
Devourer of worlds
Frey Bentos
GALACTICUS
He eats all the world
GALACTICUS
Devourer of worlds
Fat Bastard
GALACTICUS
He eats all the world
The pub landlord calls time
But my purpose is not yet begun
Luring the victim inside
Smother and choke 'til they die
Proudly cut into her flesh
Met with a 7 year old vintage whine
The world it must decide if I AM I
