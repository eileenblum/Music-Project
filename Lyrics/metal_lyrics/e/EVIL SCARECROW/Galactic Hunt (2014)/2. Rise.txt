Is there a reason we're all down here together?
I feel the lowdown is that we're all too low down.
Why us? Why here? Why everything?
Mayhap, we should thrive a little higher.
So let's take a step...
One that's going up...
So we can ask the question...
Is it time to rise?
Maybe we should rise!
Who else will rise?
Should we think about it? Rise!
No let's just
Not ride this wave of apathy
Our peers have left us strict instructions
Why us? Why not? Why anything?
All I know is that it might seem like a good idea!
