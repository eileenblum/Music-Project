[Treguardâs advice:]
âWelcome brave dungeoneers
Many a peril lies beneath
Lord Fear has many spies
Youâd better keep your wits about you
Choose your quest wisely
Don your helm and eye shield
Be valiant, be true, step forwardâ

Weâll don the Helm of Justice
Treguard points the way
Your destiny awaits for you
When you
Enter the Knightmare
Where am I? In a room, with Granitas
(Side step left)
Take the bread, eat the key, grab the knife
(Side step left)
Youâre in a room, thereâs a bomb, quick run!
(Side step left)
Goblin horn, Lillithâs scorn, Pickle cries
SPELLCASTING S-O-L-O
âWarning team. Life force critical!â
Enter the Knightmare
âWarning! Temporal disruption imminent.â
âOoooh. Nastyâ¦â
