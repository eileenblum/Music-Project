"OK Swindon are we good for launch in...
[countdown]"
KAPOW! Launch into the black sky!
Destination the meteorite
Pass the stars 'til the points turn to lines
A voyage. With me, myself and I
This journey could be a lie
Nonsense. We will be fine
I journey alone into space
My quest to find alien race
Ooooooooooh. Space!
No companion to fill this empty place
"I couldn't stand it any longer
I killed him and fed him down the inspection hatch
Now I am stuck. Adrift in space with a dead man
A man I murdered
He can't get at me as long as I stay awake
And I will remain awake!
I defy you! Do you hear me Whitaker? I defy you!"
My sister, I miss her, but she looks a lot like Lister
Computer, reboot her, get a moon gun
And mother-fuckin' shoot her
What's that there? I don't care.
Sat alone, with no cards, playing solitaire
Breathe cold air, fuel's spent yeah
Ich habe space dementia
Collapsed. The inner parts of my mind
The colours start to unwind
A rainbowverse I will climb, eating time
Alone. Cast into the night sky
A mutiny left to die
Freezing I head to the light, to collide
"It's eerily beautiful out here... Swindon?
Are you reading? I'm [coughs]
Wait. What's that?
Over there behind the ship is that?
Is that Galacticu..."
