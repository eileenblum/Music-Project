See the cyclops
See how he dances
And the gypsy
She is a dancing
And the cyclops
He is a dancing
With the gypsy
Dancing to Danzig
Why? Why? Why?
And the cyclops
Looks with his one eye
At the gypsy
She is still dancing
And the gypsy
Looks at the cyclops
He is dancing
With his shirt off
Why? Why? Why?
And the cyclops
Reaches his hand out
For the gypsy
Stumbles and misses
Bad depth perception
He should have tried harder
The gypsies don't care
As they are still dancing
And the gypsies
Dancing to Danzing
He's not there though
He's on the radio
And the cyclops
Dancing with fury
Dancing for cash
Why? Why? Why?
See how they dance?
Dance!
