Bring me the spine, bring me the brain
Fetch me a cubit of subclavian vein
Bring me the arms, bring me some hands
Fetch me a flagon of adrenal glands
Bring me the lungs, stretch me some skin
Fetch me a plan of the hepatic portal system
Bring me some guts, blood to preserve
Begin the pasting of fresh vagus nerve
Bring me the head, before it swells
Glue him intact, injecting the cells
Open the skylight, bring me the lightning
Fetch me the lightning, bring it to life
I am a god, I am his lord
The lightning strikes and he is born
And now Iâll sing this for a change
My genius will pave the way

I watch him drown a baby
This killing makes me stronger
I hear him stab a lady
This killing makes me stronger
I smell him burn a nursery
This killing makes me stronger
I feel him deep inside of me
This killing makes me stronger
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die
This killing makes me stronger
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, die
This killing makes me stronger
Death, die, kill, ow, kill, gore, die
This killing makes me stronger
Aagh, raagh, die
This killing makes me stronger

Iâm still a god, Iâm still his lord
And I will put him to the sword
And now Iâll sing this for a change
My genius has gone astray
Close all the windows, turn off the lighting
Turn down the lighting, turn off his life
Take off the head, itâs starting to smell
Bring me the spork to reharvest the cells
Rip out the guts, blood to preserve
Undo the pasting of fresh vegus nerve
Deflate the lungs, just bin the skin
Tear up the plan of the hepatic portal system
Cut off the arms, letâs eat the hands
Then down the flagon of adrenal glands
Letâs lose the spine but keep the brain
With the subclavian vein, we will try again
