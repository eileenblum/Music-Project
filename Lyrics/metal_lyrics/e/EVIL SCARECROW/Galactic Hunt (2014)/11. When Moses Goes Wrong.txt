10 plagues on you will fall
Life water become blood
In vessels, of stone and them of wood
Then the reptiles will crawl
Abundant upon wall
Dust bleed the gnats and lice to cover all
Raven claw
Weâll rise again
Holy wars
Bow down to the pharaohâs black hand
A billion putrid flies will swarm
Livestock will inherit disease
Warts and boils break forth in hot sun
A sickness born in fire
Then flood and thunder call
Foundations crumble all
And locusts shall cover face of earth
And darkness quilt the land
The first born from each man
Shall see no light, shall breathe no breath again
