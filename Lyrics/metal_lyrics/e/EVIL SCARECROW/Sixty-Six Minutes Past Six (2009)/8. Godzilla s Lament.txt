Born of an egg on a mountain top
Not Biotech nor Man
Hatched alone he breathes in the slime
Arigato, heâs Godzilla

Godzilla, Godzilla

Amphibious monster, unwanted creature
His wife was Kirsten Damned
Spitting Fire, retreat to the sea
Mata ashita, Godbye Godzilla

Godzilla , Godzilla

[Solo: Hell]
[Solo: Pain]

Beneath Chinaâs ocean sits ancient Godzilla
Alone with one friend whose name is despair
Weeping inside for lack of a bride
Lamenting this curse of an immortal life
Godzilla is brave, Godzilla is strong
Heâll fight the good fight, the fight will go on
Battling Mothra and armies of robots
Defending this Earth, defending mankind

His laser eyes can see everything
His teeth as sharp as some razor blades
His massive weight can crush anything
His heart as big as a moon

Godzilla, Godzilla
