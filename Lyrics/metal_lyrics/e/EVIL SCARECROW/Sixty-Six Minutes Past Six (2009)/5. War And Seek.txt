War!

My hatred for you fuels my fire of pursuit
Gas bags with anthrax on my back to aim at you
Entrenched in these trenches black trench-coat and gun
When youâre in my sight youâll take flight but weâll fight
Not run

One down, one million to go...War!

At one with my weapon to split you in two
Machine gun to rupture and bayonet to run you through
My machine of war machine weapon of war
More mighty than sword, pen or shield or terror-tackor

One down, one million to go...War!

Bring me the Napalm!

[Solo: Hell]

War, where are you?
Where are you hiding?
I have been looking for you
You, over there, have you seen her?
War, I am looking for War

1, 2, 3, War!

Is this a protest song? No!
Is this pro-war propaganda? No!
Is this a song about war? Yeah!

War!

One down, one million to go...War!
