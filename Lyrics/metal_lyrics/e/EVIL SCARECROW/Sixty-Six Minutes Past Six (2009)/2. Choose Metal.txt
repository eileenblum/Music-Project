Unleash the burn
Unholy blaze of metal
Cerebral matter combust to dust
Release the thunder
Double bass drum rumbler
Fracturing skulls with metallion rage

Metal is my sage, We are renegade
Heavy metal age, when the leatherâs made
Bang head with metal rage
Twelve on the metal gauge
Come test our metal

War, death, pestilence, (time?)

Raise horns to the sky
Middle horn to the blind
Once more we will lock horns with the wise
In the palaces we burn
Our evil to scorn
We will wait At The Gates of the Paranoid

Metal born again, army of the slain
Kill with no refrain, itâs life not a game
Fire to fuel the flame
Arenât you glad you came?
High five Brother Pain

Metal Lore, hear the call
Metal gods collide
Satan inside, steel in my spine
Metal gods collide

[Solo: Pain]
[Solo: Hell]
