Stumbled I upon a town of cretins
Its crooked gays macabre and grim
This place of Hate is where I met him
Eyes crooked and knees all a-wonk
He smelt bad like fags and everything
Insected shirt and lisping tongue
Waitress did came and cackled her wares
Hair âpon chin and devoid of wit
Todayâs special is spit with eyes in it

He exclaimed, shrieking at me, hypocrisy
This is his town, name lets him down
Blueprint for Hate, revering its state
Falwell he claims, âthis is the endâ

The Governor of hate, Chris Hitchens is irate
âJerry Falwell youâre a fundamentalist...
...That is ridiculous, itâs not the name thatâs wrong
It is your passion for building houses upside downâ

The Architect of Hate, his laughter is fuelled by cries

Battle spilled out into the Hate bleached street
A dispassionate crowd doesnât gather again
The air grows thin with the colour of shame
Again stands Hitchens bold
Again the same fight unfolds
Again Jerry Falwell falls
And thus mine taleâth beâd told
An epic warning tâyoung and tâold
Donât wander far friend unlest you meet...

[Solo: Pain]

The Architect of Hate
He is The Architect of Hate
We are The Architect of Hate
They be The Architect of Hate
Who is The Architect of Hate?
