I take the razor blade, bathing in silent rain
Carve into naked flesh, the word I feel is pain
Replacing vowels with Roman numerals
Feel my pain, feel my pIVIn, feel my sorrow

Blacken the Everything
Blacken my eyes
Blacken my soul to excommunicate my life
Blacken the Everything
Blacken the sky
Blacken the sun and extinguish the light

I wear my scars, the plastic medals of my war
Iâve lived a thousand lives more miserable than yours
My mortal punishment, my choreful chores
My make up runs, my eyes go sore

Blacken the Everything
Blacken my eyes
Blacken my soul to excommunicate my life
Blacken the Everything
Blacken the sky
Blacken the sun and extinguish the light

Blacken, Blacken, Blacken, Blacken the Everything

[Solo: Pain]
[Solo: Hell]

Blacken the Everything
Blacken my eyes
Blacken my soul to excommunicate my life
Blacken the Everything
Blacken the sky
Blacken the sun and extinguish the light

Blacken, Blacken, Blacken, Blacken the Everything

Blacken the sun, Blacken the sky, Blacken my eyes
Blacken the Everything

Blacken my will, Blacken to kill, Blacken my time
Blacken the Everything
