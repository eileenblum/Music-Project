My tale of conquest begins with massacre
My perfect children opressed and pressed
My fragile army beyond your mercy
We kill your flies, repaid with death

We send our small ones to the night
Inside your mind the spiders climb
Controlling thoughts with pressure points
Your vacant mind belongs to us

You will sow what you reap
Spider God, HAIL!

Crushed under foot 8 humans at a time
Iâll make you pay for this
Crushed under foot 8 humans at a time
Iâll make you pay

HAIL! The humans flee before the charging horde
HAIL! Majestic grace of the Spider God
HAIL! Injecting necrotoxin venomous
HAIL! The spider army is victorious

Trapped under foot 8 humans at a time
Iâll make you pay for this
Trapped under foot 8 humans at a time
Iâll make you pay

Enraged with suffering, stay your persecution
My violent campaign of destruction will tear your earth asunder

[Solo: Pain]

Our vengence now unfurls, we lay our silken traps
Ensnare your female-kind and then pregnate
A brutal violent rape of angel innocent
Will bring forth spider spawn avatar spider born
