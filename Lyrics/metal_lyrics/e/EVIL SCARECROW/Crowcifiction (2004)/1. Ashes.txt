I am the bringer pain
I taste the cremated flesh
call the heavens above
"strike mine enemies" bzzzzzz
feel the fury of fire
its firey furiousness
scorch the innocent
sear the flesh from bone!

see how they burn?
smoldering embers
see their eyes begin to melt?
blistering skin encases
boiling human flesh
feel the cosy, warm glow of humanities firey firey fires

burn, i want to
burn, i need to
burn, i love it

vicious epiphany carrot
vigorous firey grating
the previous vocal flame
is senseless like my mind
lightning! "forking hell"
shards of splintered brain
penetrate my profile
with your burning stare

see how they burn?
smoldering embers
see their eyes begin to melt?
blistering skin encases
boiling human flesh
feel the cosy, warm glow of humanities firey firey fires

burn, i want to
burn, i need to
burn, i love it

the earth is a black barren wasteland
I open my eyes, I feel no remorse
I am king of this land laid before
of charcoal and ashes and barbecued corpse
I stand filthy and naked and grinning
My eyes cry new tears from the sulphurous smoke
no life now remains in my kingdom
I cackle my laughter, i begin to choke
