I sit upon my throne of bone and contimplate the battle that must come
our father enters the arena to battle ra the egyptian god of sun
Ra is wearing a golden cloak, a golden hat and wields a golden staff
thor is wearing bearskin hide a horned helmet and a battle ax

Ra likes to eat his camel
Thor likes to taste his mackerel
Ra sings about the dessert
Thor sings about a longbost
Ra shags egyptian boys
Thor he shags busty barmaids
Ra he wears make-up
Thor he thinks that gay

along came ra
wielding sun
our father
had a hammer

RA
the bloody battle of
Thor vs RA
