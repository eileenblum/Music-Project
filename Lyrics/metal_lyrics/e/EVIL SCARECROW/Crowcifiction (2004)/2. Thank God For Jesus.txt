calamity, atrocity, inhumanity, depravity, christianity

think not that i have come to send peace on earth
I have come not to send peace but a sword
I have come to set man against his father
while women and children expire in the ruins
(ooo those pesky ruins)

I can't stand the preacher man
the man who preaches to my face
his sanctimonious lectures
i wish he'd just get off my case
it's all religious politics
hypocrisy within the church
dog-collared hypocrites
jesus lies from his perch

atrocity
inhumanity
depravity
christianity

thank god for Jesus
thank god for Jesus
thank god for Jesus
thank man for God

I cant stand the clergyman
he tells me i am a sinner
I hold the christian faith in horror
i hate the holy trinity
the christian church is full of gold
arc of the covenant
open up see what unfolds
all our faces start to melt

atrocity
inhumanity
depravity
christianity

thank god for Jesus
thank god for Jesus
thank god for Jesus
thank man for God
