I am not an anorak, i am not a maniac
you cannot comprehend, we are children of the night
gothic bloody vampire kiss, van helsing my nemesis
my quest to meet the master, count draculer

vampyre trousers

blood, wolves, moonlight
my black hearts desire

blessed be! I have arrived
howling stars were my guide
blessed be! I have nothing left
but a searing pain in my mind

blessed be! I am here
sunlight is what we fear
blessed be! i will wait for night
when the vampires will appear

I
of carpathian blud
inbred, bloodshed, a family trait
the forest it whispers my name
brian.....
brian.....
and then there was nothing

I am lycanthropian, i am of wolf and man
whittlesea devoid of gore, i kneel screaming by the shore
arms raised my wrists they bleed, why have you forsaken me?
a voice whispers in my ear "i like you trousers by the way"

vampyre trousers

blood, wolves, moonlight
my black hearts desire
