I came home from work recharging batteries is needed now
the death star canteen was awfully busy due to rebel scum
the lunar bus was driven by tweeky "biddy biddy biddy biddy"
the darleks chased me home and but they could not chase me up the stairs
the doorway to my lunar pod was ajar i pushed it walked inside
my wife 'fembototron' suspended by a magnet with our son
kidbototron was dead as well beyond repair oh bloody HAL
I swear upon Uranus to wreak vengance on all human kind

I am Robototron
Exo-skele-titanium
I am cyborg-champion
I am Robototron

I am now a gladiator fighting other robot-kind
entertaining humans at the techno-colosseum 9
undefeated, battle-worn I am hunting Shatner for all time
My battle-dog chiwawa, choose a wah-wah, chews a wawawa
emperor William Shatner and Godzilla asked me who i was
i am husband to a broken fembot, blinking cursor for a son
and i will have my vengence until cylon says the day is done
dismembered him with robot claw, behold i am robototron

I am Robototron
Exo-skele-titanium
I am cyborg-champion
I am Robototron
