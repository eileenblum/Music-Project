Isaac BC religion of Amn,
dislocated, a retarded farm
unholy practice, a roswell old barn

Metallic hieroglyphics are drawn
an unholy glow in the scarer of crows
maggots and worms praise this lord

Macabre Totems speaking in tongues
the church bell beckons the doer of wrongs
emperial powers of which he belongs

the congregations gathers "Behold!
our new lord is born, as was foretold.
kneel before his guarding of corn"

"Is this what is meant to be?
A recipe for my disease?"
"WORRY NOT ISAAC BC, I CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU
I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU ALL"

"Lo! my flock, we're gathered today
to celebrate the god made of hay
weak in his gaze unfaithful will pay"

"I've had our instructions passed unto me
in visions and dreams, the future i see
take heed of mine words, thus spake unto thee"

the puritanical horde listened on
engrossed and enraptured, assembled throng
absorbing new truths from the preachers black tongue

ISAAC I APPLAUD YOUR EFFORTS THUS FAR
WELL DONE TO THEE MORTAL, YOUR REALLY A STAR
TO DELIVER COMMANDMENTS, HERE THEY ARE

"Is this what is meant to be?
A recipe for my disease?"
"WORRY NOT ISAAC BC, I CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU
I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU ALL"

1. KILL ALL YOU DON'T KNOW
2. KILL ALL THAT YOU KNOW
3. BUILD THINE OWN SCARECROW
4. PITCHFORK THINE CHEST AND DIE

Lend him your plastic faith... ISAAC BC

Isaac BC began his duty... murderous
A hitchhikers life he took... murderous
hands clasped around her throat... murderous
snapped her neck and raped her corpse... murderous

Isaac took his families life... murderous
mutilated body parts... murderous
sewn together with human hair... murderous
evil scarecrow effigy born... murderous
