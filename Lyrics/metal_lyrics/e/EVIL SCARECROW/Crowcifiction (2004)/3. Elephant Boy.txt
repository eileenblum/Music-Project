one school with a very odd pupil
one zoo with a very strange attraction
here's a grey tale
of elephant boy

little Tommy Green he was my mate at school
we used to skive off school every thursday afternoon
oh, little Tommy Green, he had black eyes of coal
had a mammoth task integrating with society
me and Tommy Green we were eating peanuts
that was when i noticed that he had the head of an 
elephant AARRGGHH shot with blow dart
captured by scientists and never seen again

elephant boy is bigger than life

part elephant, part human boy, geneticists,
made it go wrong with their science misadventures

I got a job cleaning cages at the zoo
my main responsibility to disinfect the floors
one day i heard a voice, twas my old friend Tommy Green
and much to my surprise he had human head
oh, me and Tommy Green we were eating peanuts
that was when i noticed that he had the body of an
elephant AARRGGHH shot with blow dart
re-captured by scientists and never seen again

elephant boy is covered in jam

part elephant, part human boy, geneticists,
made it go wrong with their science misadventures

one lab with a mighty big bin bag
one graveyard with a very small grave
