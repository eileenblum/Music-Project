I waited till the sun went down
I had to put my mind at ease
I didn't sleep again last night
Heard voices crying on the breeze

I want it I needed
Everything from you
I never succeded
So take it or leave it
What can I do

You love me you leave me
You screw me just to please me
All the time we walk the line
I hate you I'll break you
I love the way I take ya
All the time we walk the line

Stuck inside this box of pain
I cut myself on the broken glass
You suck my blood straight from my veins
I cut these chains to be free at last

The waiting, the wanting
But never wanting me
Now your world is shakin
I'm taking I'm breaking
I'm gonna be free

You love me you leave me
You screw me just to please me
All the time we walk the line
I hate you I'll break you
I love the way I take ya
All the time we walk the line

[Repeat chorus]
