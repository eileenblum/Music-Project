[feat. Gregg Bissonette &amp; Ryan Jones]If You ever find me
Could you untie me

I'm battling my mind
Depression Suicide
Veins bursting in my heart
Are tearing me apart
My face is on the floor
i'm numb from being sore
I need relief for all of my time is spent fixing me

How does it feel
To breath the night
To be alive
How does it feel
To be free to finally believe
To believe To believe

I'm just a filthy tramp
Can't shake what falls in my lap
Inside the troubled mess
The sucker never rested
Seems that every time that I wake
I'm always wearing this miserable mask

How does it feel
To taste the rain
And have no pain
How does it feel
To lose yourself 
To finally believe
To believe, To believe, To believe

Oh there are times of peace
But only for a short reprieve
No No i'm tripping again
No No i'm falling again

How does it feel
To breath the night 
To be alive
How does it feel
To lose yourself
To finally believe

How does it feel
To taste the rain 
And have no pain
How does it feel
To lose yourself 
To finally Believe
To believe To believe To believe
