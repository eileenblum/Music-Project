I'm on the Quest
For the holy grail
At Aldi I will find!
Lonely do I ride through the holy fields of Aldi
I will seek and I'll be lead through the shadows of the shelves
The sword my only fellow tears down GemÃ¼sesortiment, through the dust I see a glare from far
It's been a long ride from Edeka to here,
But true knights like me don't know any fear
Stand and fight, Supermarket knight!
Let the steel of Einkaufswagen shine so bright!
The shadows of the Ladendetektive in my back, at the horizon appears the KÃ¤setheke bearing the grail.
It's a Sonderangebot today
I reach for this old cup between HandkÃ¤se and Edamer - Victory is near!
It's been a long ride from Edeka to here,
But true knights like me don't know any fear
Stand and fight, supermarket knight!
