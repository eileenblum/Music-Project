How to become a millionaire
Without selling my soul to Satan
I do anything, I swear
There must be a way from here
Every record shit goes platinum
Man I got the main idea!
Wow! This is the best we've ever done
Grindcore for the masses and it's here to come!
Mainstream-Grindcore for millions of asses
Grindcore for the masses!
We cash in with every blast
Blast beats pare our way to stardom
Major labels kiss our ass!
We become first grind-sellout
Every idiot buys our album
Even your grandpa screams and shouts
Wow! This is the best we've ever done
Grindcore for the masses and it's here to come!
Mainstream-Grindcore for millions of asses
Grindcore for the masses!
Grindcore for the masses!
