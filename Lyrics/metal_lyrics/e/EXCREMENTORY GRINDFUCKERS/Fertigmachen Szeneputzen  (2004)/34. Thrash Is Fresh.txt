Aaaaaaaargh
We are the Grindfuckers, we destroy all and anything,
You need our shit because ansonsten you're suffering.
We're grinding you to death not caring 'bout intelligence
No use for a message at all
This text is written in my room
Because this song needs lyrics yet
It's about fucking bloody thrash
So it needs brutal speech like this
War!
Rape!
Blod!
Bunnies!
Excrementory is the mould that nestles in your cunt,
The cheesy herpes on your cock that makes it fucking blunt.
The notifiable disease that makes your rosace grow,
We fuck fuck fuck in every fucking hole!
We sound as brutal as your motherfucking mother did
During your birth, when you came out and teared off her clit.
We sound as bestial as your namby-pamby father do
Getting on his cheek a grindfuckers tattoo!
I sit here bored and don't know how
To fill this lines with simple words
But b***** thrash like this needs lyrics,
Also if no-one understands.
I like the sunshine shining soft and warm on my prepuce
I like to move it and explore the liquid I produce
I like such lyrics with whether any sense nor use -
Pampadimpadoo-bidoo-bidoo I've got the blues.
