Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out with this brain
Come on and bring back my mind
Come and take this disease away
I need you god
To help me now
My songs are so unkind
Unholy grindcore,
What has it done to me?
Ungrind my heart,
Make me love me again
Undo this hurt it causes
When it grinds up my ear
And blows away my mind
Ungrind Rob, too
He cried so many nights
Ungrind our heart
