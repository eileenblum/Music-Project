Sitting on my couch, watching TV,
Chilling right next to the Christmas tree
The only smoke goes up my chimney,
Oowhee... where's my weed?

Gotta get me some but it's Xmas-time,
No dealer in place no matter how hard I'm tryin
Damn I'm skull and bones...
Wait! There's some green at my home

Hmmm what a wicked smell I found,
O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum
The Christmas tree has got me some leaves,
That's gotta be my remedy

Stuff that shit up into my bong,
Boy that hit hit me so strong
Tastes so sweet, tastes so strange
A nigga like me is going insane

Merry Christmas, Mary Jane
The Christmas tree that drives me insane
Merry Christmas, Mary Jane
Jingle bells in my brain

Merry Christmas, Mary Jane
The Christmas tree that drives me insane
Merry Christmas, Mary Jane
Jingle bells in my brain

That shit was dope,
The whole damn tree went up in smoke
Got halluzinations, man I'm tripping,
I have no idea what shit I sit in

Gotta clear my head out in the snow
Brain motherfucker worse than my home grown

So high... I'm high... so high...

Putting my jacket, leaving my house
Still baked and supa-dupa-high
First thing I see is Santa Claus
With glock in his hands starting a drive-by

Crazy motherfucker on his reindeer slade,
Killing kids in my hood on a Xmas day
That shit goes loco, time to chill,
Christmas Hill yo
