Christmas here, Christmas there
Christmas people everywhere
You and me, we and all
We keep strong, we stand tall

We are together having fun
Praising Jesus, he's God's son
Don't forget to praise the Lord
From Hanover to New York

Christmas is our party
And our crew is very starty
Move your body, shake your ass
To our happy Christmas

Rob and Mike are gonna make you move
ND und Christus play the groove
Excrementory Grindfuckers
Are celebrating Christmas

We are having a good time and celebrate Christmas

Christmas here, Christmas there
It's the time for love to share
Giving gifts from the heart
Move your feet from the start

Christmas here, Christmas there
Move your body like you just don't care
Get your body to the dancefloor
Feel the blastbeat of the grindcore

Jump in the air, feel the flow
Kiss beneath the mistletoe
Free your mind and feel free
Don't stand around like a Christmas tree

Barely party all night long
Our Christmas is standing strong
Christmas here, Christmas there
It's the time for love to share

We are having a good time and celebrate Christmas
