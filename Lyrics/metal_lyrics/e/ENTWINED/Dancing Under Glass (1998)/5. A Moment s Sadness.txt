I sing this song of tears for you
Distilled emotions passing through
I still remember a last caress
I want to hold you again...

This road goes on
Beside, my heart lies bleeding
But I take the path that leads to you
The savage memory of a heart that
Wants to be
Is tired of the pressures I cling to

One lonely heartbeat that cries
Echoes in the silence of a love I felt for you

I felt for you

These heartstrings played
Echo with a dying feeling
Of a silent chord
Then dies away
The love I felt for you has passed
Since we both cried
Our separate tears

One lonely heartbeat that cries
Echoes in the silence of a love I felt for you

I felt for you

Take my tears from me...

Sear my passionate cry
The love I felt for you
Has passed, rent asunder
Now freed, my torn regret

I once held you
Alone we swam in tears
You left me to drown
Now I dream

If I died for you...?
