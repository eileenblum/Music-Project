Inside me...
You breathe for me...
Take love from me...
Want me...?

Would you cry for me?
Would I die for you?
Will you take my love... away?

We shall as one remain
To be forever lost
This nightward beauty shed
...This love of mine

Inside me...
You breathe for me...
Take love from me...
Want me...?

Still our roses grow
Under starlit skies
A solemn thought...
I would die... for you

We shall as one remain
To be forever lost
This nightward beauty shed
...This love of mine

A love forever...
Through this nightward beauty shed
To die together
...Your soul and mine
