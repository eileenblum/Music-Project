The silence breeds
Into the mind of one
And in denial I twist away

The desire feeds
On the promise of one
And from you I slip away

In solitude
With the power of one
Now that I find a path

I taste 'alone'
I feel it's cold
As I drift away

Take my hand in this
And cross back unto me
For we are the forgotten ones
Revive me once more

My feathers lay tarred
Scattered and broken
Tied to these shattered wings

The feeling of one
With the heart of none
Where do I go from here

I take the fears
All the lies unsaid
Into my sleeping mind

In my world
You are mine
I take you in my arms

Take my hand in this
And cross back unto me
For we are the forgotten ones
Revive me once more
