In cascades we writhe
An ethereal lullaby
To sing of sorrows so sweet
In this time unique

Come claim me
I offer myself to you
Indulge my mystery
I awaken

In birth foundations lie
And in death... sacrifice
Succulence drained away
As we choke on life

Come claim me
I offer myself to you
Indulge my mystery
I awaken

This tormented shadow
Dispelled by pale sunlight
Once lost shall set us free
To taste the buds of life

And as we dance under the glass
Our love shall claim
We sacrifice autumnal childhood
As the memory cries once again

Once again
