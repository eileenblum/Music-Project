A tumbling nightmare
I lay drowning in your arms
Unseeing visions... your release
I dream of you once more

And in this waking hour
She comes again
I dream of your arising
...Once more

I feel my heaven rise
I see my heaven rise
The vision stands alone
Heaven rising high

Treading water
This mire of unknowing
The effervescent sweetness
...Relentless cascades

And in this waking hour
She comes again
I dream of your arising
...Once more

I feel my heaven rise
I see my heaven rise
The vision stands alone
Heaven rising high

Falling down once again
I close my eyes, still this vision ends
I sink beneath your surface
And dream once more
