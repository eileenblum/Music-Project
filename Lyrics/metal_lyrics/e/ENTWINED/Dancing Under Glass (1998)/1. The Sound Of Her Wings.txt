Eternally,
My heart is thine
I yearn for your embrace
To still this wait of mine

To further all our mysteries
To further these dreams on high

We taste the treasures as the savage garden blooms
With spring to flower
You and I shall rise again
This sacred hour
To fly past lands of passion
To swim in seas serene
Alone with the sound of your wings
For all eternity

Silently
Indulge in me
I give you all my love
(And my soul) to thee

Together, my angel of mercy
These tears shall sear no more

We taste the treasures as the savage garden blooms
With spring to flower
You and I shall rise again
This sacred hour
To fly past lands of passion
To swim in seas serene
Alone with the sound of your wings
For all eternity

For all eternity
