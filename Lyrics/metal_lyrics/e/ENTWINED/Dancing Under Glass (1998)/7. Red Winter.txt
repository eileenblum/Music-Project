Winter love
When the sunlight fades away
This autumn light shall turn to grey
Together we'll shine
...A spectral delight

Winter love
As the mirror breaks apart
True love reflects our beauty within
Together we'll shine
Forever...

We come together by the grace of God
With perfect love to embrace on high
In celebration of unscarred delight
Red winter bears it's joys

Winter love
When this bleeding rose shall die
And this barren earth shall lie
I will stay with you
We shall return anew

Winter love
And under crimson skies
Solitude shall crumble away
Let it rain on us
Let us reign... forever

We come together by the grace of God
With perfect love to embrace on high
In celebration of unscarred delight
Red winter bears its joys

You are my eyes when I am blind
My strength when alone
And though the cold shall pierce my shell
With you I heal

I thirst your kiss, the water I crave
I drown in you
As winter chokes the love in us all
You are my rain...
