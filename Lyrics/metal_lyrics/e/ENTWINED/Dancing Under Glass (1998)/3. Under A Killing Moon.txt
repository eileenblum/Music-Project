Will you walk alone with me?
Will you take my hand in this?
Don't turn me away, Don't turn me away
I can't take it, I still want you

You walk away
And leave me to die
Under this killing moon
The wounds that scar the heart

When I cry, it's tears for you
That flow so sweetly, so freely
Far beneath this killing moon
Your words stab deep
Inside of me

You walk away
And leave me to die
Under this killing moon
The wounds that scar the heart

In my mind, still we walk
Together as one
We cling to each other
Share each other's fears
...Alone

Still I want to hold you
Never let you go
...Let your pain be mine

Let me take you
Let me hold you
Protect you
From this killing moon

Let me take you
Let me hold you
Under this killing moon
