Aware this desperate escape, it will not last forever
I feel stronger every minute, stronger every hour
Just need a few things to imitate, I will start again
Keep my eyes wide open, and wait for the moment to become someone else

I'm getting lost like the trace of a line that moves in circles but can't be followed
A vision of a true belief slipping out of sight
I still can hear the music of chance
Searching for my eleven time thieves
And soon I will know what I want to believe

Yearning for myths to feed this fake, and self imposed this cruel hunger
Gather my strengths, paint over dirt, I have set myself a goal
Dead calm by the end of the night, drifting away from reality
No hope no fear no chance, I would have never gone away
