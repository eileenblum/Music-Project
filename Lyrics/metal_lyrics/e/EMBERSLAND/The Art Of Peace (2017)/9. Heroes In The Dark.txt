It's sad to feel my heroes in the dark

I need much more from you
You spoiled my dreams and fun
To enjoy your gift all my life
You made me feel as I could fly
While listening your amazing voice
Reaching my soul making me tremble

What a pity not to be able to enjoy your magic
What a pity not to be able to feel new sensations
What a pity not to be able to listen your voice again

Heroes of my youth and now
Why did you prive me of your art
I can't get your voice out of my head
Heroes in the darkest cave
Get out and show your best again
Don't reject this gift that nature gave to you

The fear of losing you
Your voice falling silent
I can't imagine the emptiness that would remain in me
