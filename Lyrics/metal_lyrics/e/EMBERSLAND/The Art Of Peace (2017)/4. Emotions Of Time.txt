Standing, watching as the world keeps turning, never resting
Another winter meets an end, from dawn to dusk
The days pass by ticking forever away

Seeking a sanctuary, to hoard all emotions
A special place to survive
A fragile planet, time is everything
Must act to ignite my hopes

All thoughts and inspirations entwine with all my dreams
When darkness turns to shining light, another day
Beckons me
Time to create all those dreams, time to create reality
Establish tomorrow's life

The waves crashing to the shore
Echo loud.
Just for a moment silence falls
I catch my breath
Before again
The tide leaves shimmering sands

Sunshine warming up the room casts shadows
Spring and summer turn to autumn
Seasons changing constantly
As leaves fall to the ground
Trees stand haunting above, life carries on
Nature's peace will comfort me
