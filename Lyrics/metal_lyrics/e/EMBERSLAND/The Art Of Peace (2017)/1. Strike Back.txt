Hate, fury and rage inside
Something is breaking my heart again
Screams, cries come out from there
The beast is back one more time tonight

Sea of beats in the shadows
Between tears, screams and blood
Falling down into darkness
We have to fight, this must be stopped

Strong against the weak
Always the same naked truth
Strong against the weak
When is all of this going to end?
Strong against the weak
You just need to raise your head (and prove yourself)
Strong against the weak
Leave your fears behind, you can strike back

I see too many things that I don't like
Too many things that make me cry
Too many people that must disappear
