She blinded my eyes as lightning shines away
But didn't stop at that pure light
As then the thunder shocked my heart, shocked my soul
Enlightening my life like fireflies light my desires
Heavenly voices keep on ringing in my head

Two pure stars dance in the sky
I need your fire, I need your passion
Shadows disappeared

The lady of the snow has shot an arrow straight into my
Heart
My soul replenishing pure energy
It must be an angel coming down to earth from time to time
My love, spread your wings, teach me to fly, show me the
Way to purity

The pleasure that comes over my soul
That's a new dimension for me
The shudder through my body feeling
To feel the sun of summer days
The snow falling out there in a cold winter night
Dancing in the rain
