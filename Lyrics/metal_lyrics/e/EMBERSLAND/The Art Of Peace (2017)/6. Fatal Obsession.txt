I never thought you would come to this point
I never imagined you would lose your head in this way
You never showed me what you really felt
I never knew who you really are
You never valued me enough
Now you're alone and lost, missing me
I just want you to know it
I don't wanna know anything else about you

Forget me now, let me breathe
You'll never control me again

I offered you all and you wanted more
Always was the same
Now it's too late
To make a change
I offered you all and you wanted more
Always inside of your mind
But now you have lost your chance
I won't give it to you again

Overcome, abandon, ask for help
Disappear from my life, leave my world
Close you eyes, giving up, this is finished
Set my spirit free
