When I thought love was not made for me
Like a sending angel you appeared in my life
When I thought that I would never find you
Destiny gave me the present of my life

So far and so near
Wishing to feel your body close to me
Wishing to say how I miss you and give you my heart

I hope I never wake up of this dream
Where you are the muse of inspiration
The star that shines my way
The angel of my best fantasies
Wherever you are, you will always be with me
You took my heart with you, you stole my soul forever
Wait for me in paradise

I can't believe how lucky I was to have you in my life
Sharing with you the deepest secrets of my soul
I never thought you would fill the emptiness of my heart
Making me feel alive again

I can't imagine a future without you
Without your passion, without your tenderness
Without hope to feel you everyday close to me
I won't let you go, you will live forever in me
