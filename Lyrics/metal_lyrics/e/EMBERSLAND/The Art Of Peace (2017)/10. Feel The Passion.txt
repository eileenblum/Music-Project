Illusions that keep us alive
Dreams that make us feel free every night
Tears of rage, pain or happiness
Lasting memories that make us feel good

To love, to hate, to cry, to smile
Feel the passion of
To wish, to laugh, to fuck, to admire
Feel the passion of

Feelings that make us reach our paradise
Feelings that make us burn in bloody hells
The constant search between living or being alive
Feel as if there were no tomorrow

The pleasure to love, the pleasure to hate
This is the only way that make us feel free
The pleasure to touch, the pleasure to share
Don't lose the only chance that life brings to us

Love from the depths of your heart
The drug that will make you daydream
Live the passion every time you can
Feel the fire hitting the ice
Open your eyes, stepping forward
The world may be under your feet again
