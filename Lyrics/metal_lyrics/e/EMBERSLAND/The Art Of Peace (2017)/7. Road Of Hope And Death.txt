Get in a boat
Looking for a chance
To get â some dignity
Get in a floating coffin
Looking for the way
To leave poverty behind
Take a risk
Looking for their dream
To get a better future
A new world of hope and death
It opens in front of them

Promised land, it's the end of their destiny
Promised land, it's the end of their pain and fear

A road of hope and death
Between lies and desperation
The price they have to pay
For a road of hope and death

A road of unknown direction
With tragic ending
Killers without compassion
Send them to hell
This is a homage to brave people
Who fight
To find freedom
This is a song for the people
Who died trying to find justice in life
