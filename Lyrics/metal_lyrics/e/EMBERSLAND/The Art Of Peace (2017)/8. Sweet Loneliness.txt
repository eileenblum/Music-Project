Silence is surrounding me
Nothing disturbs my moment
I can breathe
I can breathe peace in here
I'm a castaway inside of me

Stay here with me
Keep my mind so clear
I've looked for you a long time
Don't leave me now

I've found the light that guides my life
I've seen the will that hides in me
At the end I feel it
I can reach my spirit
I can fix my flaws

Stay here, save me
From the chaos of my mind
I've looked for you a long time
I won't let you flee

Sweet loneliness that gives sense to soul
Sweet loneliness that keeps me out of lies
A wonderful silent and empty haven, great solitude
Sweet loneliness in perfect harmony
A magical place to achieve my dreams
A meditation to vanish my scars
A void that rewires time to my awakening

There is time for everything
There are moments to share
There are things to live together and forever
But you will be there when I need you, you will be thereâ¦
