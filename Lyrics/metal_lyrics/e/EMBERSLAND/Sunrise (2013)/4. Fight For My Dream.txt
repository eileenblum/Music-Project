Everything makes me feel so angry
Sadness takes over my life	

Too many hours, too much time thrown away
It's time for action , it's time to fight for my dream

I need a change
This is the day
I'm gonna try to change my way

I want to live
Another life
This is the moment to begin

It's not too late	

Madness is surrounding me again
This is getting me nowhere

I need a change
This is the day
I'm gonna try to change my way

I want to live
Another life
This is the moment to begin

It's not too late	

Don't be afraid of change 
Give up the wrong way
Forget your old life
Fight for your dream 

Don't be afraid of change
Send your fears away 
Try to enjoy this time
Fight for your dream

[Solo]

[2x]
I need a change
This is the day
I'm gonna try to change my way

[Solo]
