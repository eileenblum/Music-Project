Why am I standing in this room, watching TV
Hating everything I see?
Why am I living in this world of false promises 
Lies and mistakes?

Surrounded by shadows, death and destruction
Surrounded by envy, evil and sorrow
Surrounded by hate, decay and madness
Why don't we try, to change the world?

I hear the screams I see their tears
Looking for another life
I feel the sadness of their souls
Asking for another chance
I see the darkness of their blood
Crying inside of their hearts
They just find pain in their lives
We can only pray for them

Why don't I trust the human race, 
Full of corruption
Feel ashamed being part of it?

Surrounded by shadows, death and destruction
Surrounded by envy, evil and sorrow
Surrounded by hate, decay and madness
Why don't we try, to change the world?

I hear the screams I see their tears
Looking for another life
I feel the sadness of their souls
Asking for another chance
I see the darkness of their blood
Crying inside of their hearts
They just find pain in their lives
We can only pray for them

Suffering souls in an unfair world
Claiming their stolen rights with tears in their eyes

I hear the screams I see their tears
Looking for another life
I feel the sadness of their souls
Asking for another chance
I see the darkness of their blood
Crying inside of their hearts
They just find pain in their lives
We can only pray for them

I hear the screams I see their tears
Looking for another life
I feel the sadness of their souls
Asking for another chance
I see the darkness of their blood
Crying inside of their hearts
They just find pain in their lives
We can only pray for them
