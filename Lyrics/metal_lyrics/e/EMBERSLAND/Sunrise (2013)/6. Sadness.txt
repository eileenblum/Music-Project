There is a moment in life
When everybody meets sadness
A broken dream in a second of reality
And all faint hopes get disappear

Ode for a girl that loves me not
That brings me only silent tears	

What lies beneath you
Some needs that must be satisfied 
What should I do to stand
Your flood

What's struggling within you
A sky forever obscured by clouds
What should I do to stand
Your flood

When you try that hard
To see your wishes come true
You can't even imagine
That you'll see it all ruined again

A feeling of sadness
Is taking over me
Nothing matters
Only the wish to be loved

I know I have to forget you
'Cause this is gonna kill me
But it's so hard to me
The future without you...

[Solo]

Ode for a girl that loves me not
That brings me only silent tears	

[2x]
What lies beneath you
Some needs that must be satisfied 
What should I do to stand
Your flood
