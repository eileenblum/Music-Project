Death, horror, destruction
It's not the way, to come to an understanding
Terror, blood, vengeance
It's not the way, to solve the problems

Try to hear the people's voice 
Try to find a heart inside of you
Why don't you respect us
Why are you still killing now

Violence, murder, pain
It's not the way to get your dreams
Tears, sorrow, power
It's not the way to get your freedom

How can we have peace for all?
Where can we find justice now?
When shall we see the end of the tunnel?

How can we end all this madness?
Where can we find the answer?
When is it going to disappear?

World of fears, we were born in a world of injustice
World of freedom too often stolen
World of terror that I can not understand
World of peace, I want to fight to get this dream

How can we have peace for all?
Where can we find justice now?
When shall we see the end of the tunnel?

How can we end all this madness?
Where can we find the answer?
When is it going to disappear?

World of fears, we were born in a world of injustice
World of freedom too often stolen
World of terror that I can not understand
World of peace, I want to fight to get this dream

[Solo]

How can we have peace for all?
Where can we find justice now?
When shall we see the end of the tunnel?

[2x]
World of fears, we were born in a world of injustice
World of freedom too often stolen
World of terror that I can not understand
World of peace, I want to fight to get this dream
