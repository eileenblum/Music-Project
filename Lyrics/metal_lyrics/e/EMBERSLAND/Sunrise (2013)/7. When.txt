So many times I wonder
What I'm doing wrong
No matter how much I try it
I never get to reach my goal

Probably it's a divine punishment
Or maybe it's hell that laughs at me
Things go worse when I expect them go bad

I feel such a great emptiness inside of me
A search for something that does not come

When the day has come
A distant voice I'm trying to follow
A sign should come
Did anyone ever choose?
When does my life will turn the one
I've always wanted

I have no luck whatever I do
And I wonder if I deserve it
Is it so difficult to get some happiness?
Is it so difficult to find peace inside of me?

I feel such a great emptiness inside of me
A search for something that does not come

[Solo]

I feel such a great emptiness inside of me
A search for something that does not come

[2x]
When the day has come
A distant voice I'm trying to follow
A sign should come
Did anyone ever choose?
When does my life will turn the one
I've always wanted
