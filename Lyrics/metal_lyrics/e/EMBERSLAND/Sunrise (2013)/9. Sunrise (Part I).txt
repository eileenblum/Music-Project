Come, with me, and give me now your life
Take, my hand, and leave this world far away

Death is calling me, with deep and mighty voice
Tell me what, you want to offer to me

It will be better to finish, all this suffering
You will find another place, maybe better or maybe worse

Don't listen to it, you can still be happy
Never look back, you must carry on
Recover your strength, start to live again
Only time can heal, your broken heart

[Solo]

You don't want to carry on, I see it in your eyes
You'll never smile again, rage runs through your veins
Things will never be the same, your soul is almost mine
Only put the gun, inside your mouth
And you will rest in peace in my reign

You're feeling the void, hitting the ground
A never-ending world of fears and lies
Forgotten hopes, a slowing heart
An empty life that comes to an end

[Solo]

Don't listen to it, you can still be happy
Never look back, you must carry on
Recover your strength, start to live again
Only time can heal, your broken heart

I'm trying to find my way
Different thoughts confound my mind
I'm living my own hell
Could you help me in this moment

Life, is something wonderful too
Sure, you will find happiness
