You don't sleep with me, you sleep beside me
You don't ask me, you know what I need
You don't follow me, you walk, you walk behind me
No need to talk to me, a need to lead

I fed up with the sudden silence when you enter
The guilty anger when you leave

It's all in vain
I don't need your reasons
You drove me insane
Now stay away from me

It's all in vain
I don't need your reasons
You drove me insane
Now stay away from me

I fed up with, your fool, fool obsessions
The way you complicate, the simple things

It's all in vain
I don't need your reasons
You drove me insane
Now stay away from me

It's all in vain
I don't need your reasons
You drove me insane
Now stay away from me

[Solo]

I don't care about your reasons
Your explanations are all the same
It's not a war about not love either
When nothing's left it's all in vain [4x]

It's all in vain
I don't need your reasons
You drove me insane
Now stay away from me

It's all in vain
I don't need your reasons
You drove me insane
Now stay away from me

[Solo]
