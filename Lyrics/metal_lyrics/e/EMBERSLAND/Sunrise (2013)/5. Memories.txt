Your empty soul walks, to his own black hole
You are on the brink of abyss, only you can choose where to fall
The complaints don't let you hear, the sound of the river
That would lead you, to the sea of hope

Take control of your life
Take control of your destiny
This is just the beginning of comedy
This is just the end of the tragedy

Memories from the past won't let you carry on
Always looking back
The same old fears until wherever you go
And torture in your dreams
Endless walls that matters in your walks in hell
Making your days so dark
Voices gripping you in your lonely nights
Forget but not to forgive

Vultures flying over your head, waiting for your fall
As your tears fall down, and hit the ground
Only if you open your wings and fly, a tear would be dry
And you will see, a new blind horizon

Take control of your life
Take control of your destiny
This is just the beginning of comedy
This is just the end of the tragedy

Memories from the past won't let you carry on
Always looking back
The same old fears until wherever you go
And torture in your dreams
Endless walls that matters in your walks in hell
Making your days so dark
Voices gripping you in your lonely nights
Forget but not to forgive

[Solo]

Memories from the past won't let you carry on
Always looking back
The same old fears until wherever you go
And torture in your dreams
Endless walls that matters in your walks in hell
Making your days so dark
Voices gripping you in your lonely nights
Forget but not to forgive
