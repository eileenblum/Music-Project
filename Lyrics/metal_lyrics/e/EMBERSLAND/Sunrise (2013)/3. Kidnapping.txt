In a dark and cold place
Someone is crying
Someone is dying
Tears are falling from her eyes
Forming a lake of desperation

She is thinking about suicide
She doesn't know what to do
She wants to break free again

Her life is ending now
We must not allow this
Fight against the people who steal our liberty

Only memories of her family 
Help her to bear the pain

She is thinking about suicide
She doesn't know what to do
She wants to break free again

Light comes after darkness
She gets back her freedom
Happiness is back in her life

[Solo]

Her life is ending now
We must not allow this
Fight against the people who steal our liberty

Her life is ending now
We must not allow this
Fight against the people who steal our liberty

Her life is ending now
We must not allow this
Fight against the people who steal our liberty
