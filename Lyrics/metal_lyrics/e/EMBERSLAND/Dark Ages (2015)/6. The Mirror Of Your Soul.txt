Glances that make you feel good
Smiles that make you doubt
Eyes that make you dream
Gestures that make you distrust

An honest smile
Expressions of hate
That fake complicity
That drives you insane

Trust in me
I'm right this time

Face is the mirror of your soul (is the mirror of your soul)
You cannot hide this truth
Your soul is written on your face

Is the mirror of your soul (is the mirror of your soul)
It's the one that gonna tell you
More than you can imagine (believe)

Expressions that aren't, to believe
Those penetrating eyes, that look at you
They charm you and bewilder you
Like a whispering voice, that you hear

Trust in me
I'm right this time

Face is the mirror of your soul (is the mirror of your soul)
You cannot hide this truth
Your soul is written on your face

[Solo]

Face is the mirror of your soul (is the mirror of your soul)
You cannot hide this truth
Your soul is written on your face
