Digging quickly, layers of clay and mud
For millions of years, I've believed

Soil, flesh, black water
Smells like victory
Feel this heritage on the spine

I'm the runner that seems to crawl
I'm the beast killed everyday
I'm the brain that knows too much

I'm the one wondering
The one wondering
The one wondering again
How much time remains
Much time remains
Much time remains again

A hesitation blocks my way
Standing still, now just scratching
No sky above, too dark to see
Keep going, keep moving
Here and there I'll find it

Now in the crowd
Finally developed and completed
Looking for another hole to dig
Burden or grave
We'll keep going, keep moving

I'm the one wondering
The one wondering
The one wondering again
How much time remains
Much time remains
Much time remains again

I'm the runner that seems to crawl
I'm the beast killed everyday
I'm the brain that knows too much

I'm the one wondering
The one wondering
The one wondering again
How much time remains
Much time remains
Much time remains again
