Through the times he was linked to the earth by you
Saw the world by his eyes, taught by yours
Could bury it all near the surface
To clean the wounds to mask the pain

Your voice ringing in his head
Focused mind over the mire, knowing how to cross the fire
Such a pleasant sound, going round and round again

One day and one step closer to death
His face reflected in the mirror
A silence coming from everywhere
And the need to disappear

Close to you
Close to you
One more day
Dead to you

Through the times he was bounded to the ground by me
Breathing the harsh wind coming
Unspoken words almost whispered
Gone forever with just a sound

Your voice ringing in his head
Focused mind over the mire, knowing how to cross the fire
Such a pleasant sound, going round and round again

One day and one step closer to death
His face reflected in the mirror
A silence coming from everywhere
And the need to disappear

One day and one step closer to death
The sound of a voice fading away
Looks at his hands and wonders
If he was nothing but you and me

Your voice ringing in his head
Focused mind over the mire, knowing how to cross the fire
Such a pleasant sound, going round and round again

One day and one step closer to death
His face reflected in the mirror
A silence coming from everywhere
And the need to disappear

One day and one step closer to death
The sound of a voice fading away
Looks at his hands and wonders
If he was nothing but you and me

You and me
You and me
