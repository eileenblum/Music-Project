This is the end of my old life
I will break out with all the rules
I want to jump into the void

To end with this inner emptiness
I'll leave the herd behind
I wanna be, the black sheep

I don't mind the price
Life is meaningless so far
If you can't live
Inside of me

I dare to daydream
Waking up from this nightmare
I'll find the way to paradise
Fall into the clutches of hell

Devil is calling to me
Angels don't know I'm here
I will walk until I find
The meaning of my life

I need to feel that my life, is not a waste of time
I want to fly even if I end up crashing

I don't mind the price
Life is meaningless so far
If you can't live
Inside of me

I dare to daydream
Waking up from this nightmare
I'll find the way to paradise
Fall into the clutches of hell

I want to risk it all
I want to bet everything I have
I want to die trying to be

[Solo]

I dare to daydream
Waking up from this nightmare
I'll find the way to paradise
Fall into the clutches of hell
