Suddenly everything began, almost without thinking
We wanted to reach the stars together

We want to reach our dream so difficult to get
That we are not going to abandon

Walls on our way that don't allow us to see beyond
They seemed the end of the way
Borders so hard to crossover

The train is in motion and cannot stop it
We must jump inside right now

Don't wanna see how it moves away
Taking away our last hope

We are inside and don't wanna get off
We will crash against the wall

No price matters when see the glory
Never wake up of this fantasy

At this moment destiny, don't allow us to reach our dream
But we will not surrender

We are the thunder in the storm
The lightning in the sky
The only ones non-stop screaming

Walls on our way that don't allow us to see beyond
They seemed the end of the way
Borders so hard to crossover

The train is in motion and cannot stop it
We must jump inside right now

[Solo]

[2x]
The train is in motion and cannot stop it
We must jump inside right now
