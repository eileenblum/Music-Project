I got confused and I was wrong
I felt abused and I was wrong
I was a victim, it wasn't right
Would you stay for me tonight?

I had my truth but I was death
I've been afraid if fear itself
I haven't seen even then
That you've been there for me

[2x]
Trough the self-doubt
Trough the arrogance
Beyond the selfish things I've done
Trough my weakness, fears and attitude
Be somewhere there for me

Would you listen if I'm wrong
Would you forgive if I spoil it all
Would you cry with me tonight
Although it isn't right

Would you smile at what I said
Would you blame me for being mad
Would you understand what I thought
Even if it is my fault

I had my truth but I was death
I've been afraid if fear itself
I haven't seen even then
That you've been there for me

Trough the self-doubt
Trough the arrogance
Beyond the selfish things I've done
Trough my weakness, fears and attitude
Be somewhere there for me

[Solo]

Trough the self-doubt
Trough the arrogance
Beyond the selfish things I've done
Trough my weakness, fears and attitude
Be somewhere there for me
