Walking on the street, I wonder, the reason of my loneliness
I don't know why, why am I alone, in this cold winter night

The shine, of the moon hides its light on my path
I wish, to see the sun again, shinning on me

Where are you
I thought I had already found you
I need to feel alive again

Where are you
I hope to see your face someday
Even if I never wake up

I want to feel your skin
Our sweaty bodies melt into one being
Under the sweet caress of eternity

Darkness falls on me when day begins
Hope fades with each passing day

Where are you
I thought I had already found you
I need to feel alive again

[Solo]
