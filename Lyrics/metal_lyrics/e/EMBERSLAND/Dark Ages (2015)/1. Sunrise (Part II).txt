[Additional vocals by Carlos Torregrosa]

I won't forget you did to me
The contempt that I felt from you
You threw my heart to the edge
After lies that you told me

You were the reason of my life
The center of my universe
A mirage in my desert
My worst nightmare

I stayed surrounded by darkness
Alone, lost, feeling desolate
It was hard to see again and again
How you walked away from me

Don't listen to it, you can still be happy
Never look back, you must carry on
Recover your strength, start to live again
Only time can heal, your broken heart

Interlude
My words were forgotten
My caresses were useless
You taught me to love, you taught me to hate
Hard thinking I couldn't, ever sleep inside of you again
Life won't be the same without you
I hope it will be better 

Wish I'd never known you, never met you
The best mirage, the worst trip in my desert, in my desert

I want to get out, from this spiral of disappointment
When will my life, become something that makes me feel alive

Wish I'd never known you, never met you
The best mirage, the worst trip in my desert

But love turned to hate
And passion turned to competent
A new path of hope, opens in front of me
It's time to spread my wings and fly free again

I dodged the arrows pointing directly to my heart
But an arrow of destiny is nailed again in my heart
I'll try to wait for the right moment to shoot mine
It's time to begin a new life, it's time to see a new sunrise

Don't listen to it, you can still be happy
Never look back, you must carry on
Recover your strength, start to live again
Only time can heal, your broken heart

Don't listen to it, you can still be happy
Never look back, you must carry on
Recover your strength, start to live again
Only time can heal, your broken heart

You will not find me
I'm in your mind, you lost me
I will not be back
It's late, to dream
It's time, to begin, to begin
