[Lead vocals by Carlos Torregrosa]

Someday shadows will come to me
I'll have a date with my destiny
Someday I'll feel its breath behind me
Taking me out from this dark reality

I will breathe out my last sigh (I will breathe)
My body as a gift (body as a gift)
My soul in a song (my soul)
(my soul in a song)

When I die
A new beginning will rise
You and I will be one
I hope to meet you in the afterlife

When I die
A new beginning will rise
You and I will be one
I hope to keep on living
Inside of you

When I die

In that moment my way will find the end
The star of my life won't shine anymore

The end of my life must be just
The beginning of another new hope

I will breathe out my last sigh (I will breathe)
My body as a gift (body as a gift)
My soul in a song (my soul)
(my soul in a song)

When I die
A new beginning will rise
You and I will be one
I hope to meet you in the afterlife

[Solo]

When I die
A new beginning will rise
You and I will be one
I hope to meet you in the afterlife

When I die
