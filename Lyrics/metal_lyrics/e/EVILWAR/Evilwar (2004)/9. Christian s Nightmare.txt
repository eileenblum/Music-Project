We fight for the glory of Evil
Following the serpent's teachings
We live at darkness
The creatures of the night accompany our journey

We envenom the world with our blasphemies
The dark legions grasp the evil flag
The satanic flag is fluttering

We are the nightmare of the christian race
We announce the end of your age
Of an impotent god and his bastard child

Our warriors grasp the weapons
Exhibiting glory of evil
Exhibiting glory of evil

We fight for the glory of Evil
Following the serpent's teaching
We live at darkness

The creatures of the night accompany our journey
We envenom the world with our blasphemies
The battle field is full of legions

There is no way to detain the march
Our warriors are the strongest
We will destroy the enemy

Attacking your weakness
Your ignorance
Your impotence
We will get your life, in the name of Satan

We will capture your soul, for the glory of evil
The strong ones will reign unpunished
