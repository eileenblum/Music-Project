I can fell the fear in your eyes
Silent faceless figure
Making your impotence into kindness
And your fears into forgiveness

Miserable
They don't know the taste of vengeance and hate
Following speechless with their uncertainties
Sufficiently weaks to accept it
Faith sustained by the words
Of a bastard son

Damned be the Christians
The end of your race has been announced
Your impotent god won't do anything when he see you fall
Like he nothing did for his own son

"Father, why you left me"

Follow to the end
With your innocent illusion
Miserable
We'll show no mercy
Only hate and destruction

All the symbols of your faith will be burned
It will remain only ashes in the wind
All the bonds will be broken
It will be the end of your era

I can fell the fear in your eyes
