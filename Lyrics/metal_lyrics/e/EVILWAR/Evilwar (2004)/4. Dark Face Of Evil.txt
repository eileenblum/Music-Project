In the dark side of your mind
I live in and dominate

I torment you burning in flames
Leading you to the unholy sin
Feel the pleasant smell of death
Claming for you

Confounding your thinkings
The insanity reach the top
Realizing the impure desires
Renouncing the everything that's holy
That can't make sense anymore

With the dark mantle I wrapped up you
I bring the darkness to your sight
Transforming the reality
Making it unreal
Little by little I dominate and destroy you

The dark face of Evil
Enchant you and scare you
Pounding you in a labyrinth
Without return
Blasphemy, lust and pleasure
Satisfying your dark desires

Evil eyes hover over you
Watching and leading your desires
Your desires are my wills
I follow my steps inside the darkness
Damning, Damning, Damning

With the dark mantle I wrapped up you
I bring the darkness to your sight
Mixing the real and the unreal
Dominating you, destroying you

The smell and the taste of blood
Dominating your feelings
Giving you uncontrollable pleasure

Follow your instinct
Come on me

Yeahhhhh !!!!!!!!
