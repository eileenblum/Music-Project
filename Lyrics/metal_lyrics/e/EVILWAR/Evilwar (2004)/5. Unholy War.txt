Under the darkness that spreads around quickly
The wolfs howls and lightnings cut the night
Marking what will be the end of everything
Fear and tumult announce the arrival
Of those who bring hate like their weapons

Hell's legions march
To the last battle
Where the domination will be decided
Under evil stare
And blessed by the fire
Make the way of destruction

The earth will open
The fire will raise
The sky will burn
When the angels fall
At unholy war

Heaven burns in flames
Screams and whisperings of pain
That scatters on earth
Grasping the hate
Eliminating everything is opposed

Over the horizon, where heards the battles sound
The smell of death infests the Earth boundaries
The new kingdom will be raised
The horned god's empire
The domination is complete
Where the evil will be eternal
And now hell's legions march
With your raised empire
