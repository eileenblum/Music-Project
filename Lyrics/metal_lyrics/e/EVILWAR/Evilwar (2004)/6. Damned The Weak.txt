Ignorance is the prelude of failure
For those who live from pain
And sustain the image of defeat
Underestimating the vision of reality

Depression is your punishment
Hatred is our ally
Follower of incertitude
Obsessed for forgiveness

There's no mercy
There's no pain
Only hatred
Maintains the power

Fear is announced
In the eyes of the enemy
When underestimating the real power

There's no mercy
There's no pain
Only hatred
Maintains the power

Depression is your punishment
Hatred is our ally
Follower of incertitude
Obsessed for forgiveness

Ignorance is the prelude of failure
For those who live from pain

There's no mercy
There's no pain
Only hatred
Maintains the power

And sustain the image of defeat
Underestimating the vision of reality

We know him
You know who you are
