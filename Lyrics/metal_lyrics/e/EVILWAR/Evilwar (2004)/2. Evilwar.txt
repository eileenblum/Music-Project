Occult voices annouced
Trought the deep abyss
The total destruction's beginning
The religions of fear will de annihilated
The end of the christian's era has been announced
Everything was only histories
The knowledge throwed down the ignorance

With the fear like your weapon
And the weakness like allied
Impotent followers
Followers of fear
Followers of fear

We follow the truth
We go about proudly
We look at reality
We destroy our enemies

We follow the Serpent`s teaching
We are Satanists
We know the truth
Hail Satan Master!!!
Hail Evilwar !!!

The Serpent's power summon us
The dark knights march
The dark throne will be raised
Establishing the true power
Beginning the new supremacy
Wrapped in the spilled blood

We follow the truth
We go about proudly
We look at reality
We destroy our enemies
Following the Serpent's teachings
We are Satanists
We know the truth
Hail Satan Master!!!
Hail Evilwar!!!

We follow the truth
We look at reality
We are Satanists
Hail Satan Master!!!
Hail Evilwar!!!

Occult voices announced
Trought the deep abyss
The total destruction beginning
The religions of fear will be annihilated
