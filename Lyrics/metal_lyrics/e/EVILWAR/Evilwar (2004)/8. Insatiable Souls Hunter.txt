In her dark vestments
By shadows follow the way
Searching for satisfy the impure desire
Her desire can bring the comfort

Insatiable souls hunter
To her victims doesn't reserve choice
Her blade brings the truth
Or deliver the torment

Search the shadows way
Be unaware of the way of life
The death will show the only way

The dark rube will be her refuge
During the long way
To the abyss of death
Where the weaks fall out of mind

Just that who know the truth
Will have your reign
Your choice was made
The time is over
There is no return

Queen of shadows
Make your mission
Get your unholy desire
Life's impalator
Queen of death
Insatiable souls hunter
(Repeat Chorus)

Follow by the way
Accept the reality
Why ???
'Cause You're dead !!!

In her dark vestments
By the shadows follow the way
Searching for satisfy the impure desire
Her desire can bring the comfort
