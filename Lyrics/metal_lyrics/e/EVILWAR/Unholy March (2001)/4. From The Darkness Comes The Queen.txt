I feel your presence
Calling me stressing me
What attaches me to this world
What waits for me at the other side

My soul struggles with death in my body
Silence feeds my pain
The creatures of night call my name
Mist overcomes my view
Cold tears ripping my soul
Feel myself in an endless fall

Them my life
Passes like a thunderbolt
Destroying my mind

What waits for me at the other side
Rage, pain, solitude?

There's only one key
That'll open this gateway
Death, yeah death
Only death will show

What waits for me at the other side
The side of the dead
The dark side

Queen of darkness
Rage of the soul
I feel your smell

Queen of darkness
Come to me
Take me away

The dark side calls
Carrying me to the end
Now there's no return
I'm in the other side

I feel your presence
Calling me stressing me

What attaches me to this world
What waits for me...

Rage, pain, solitude?
Only death will show
