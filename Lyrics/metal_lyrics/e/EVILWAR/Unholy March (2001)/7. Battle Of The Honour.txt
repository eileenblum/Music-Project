Evil war
We are the strong
Evil war
Our hate and swords
Evil war
They will bleed the earth again

From the ancient world we appeared
We descendant from the ancient rituals
We conquered with blood what we possess
We got over the ignorance and the weakness of many
We crossed generations worshiping our tradition
The power and the wisdom are our allied
We are warriors of evil

The warriors of evil are together again
The emperor of the darkness command his legions
We are armed in silence
And we will combat at the sound of our hymn
The warrior of evil hymn

Our warrior are join together
Ours swords in our fists
Will be our greatest battle
We'll defeat ours enemy

The time has come
To defeat the false
To burn the holy places defeat the kingdom of the weak
To get up our Throne

War of evil
We are the strong
War of evil
We'll bleed the earth again
War of evil
Our power is our honor

Join us to the last war

From the ancient world we appeared
We descendant from the ancient rituals
We conquered with blood what we possess
