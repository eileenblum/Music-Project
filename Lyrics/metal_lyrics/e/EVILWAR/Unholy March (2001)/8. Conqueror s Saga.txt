In the freezing northern lands
Fields are already occupied
To the new clans there aren't any options left
Only the searching for the unknown
Bound for new conquers

Winds report the beginning of the journey
Revealing the secrets of the seas
Vessels carry on
Following the stars and the moon
Searching for a new way

They fight for their life
They fight for their pride

From east to west from north to south
Carrying the honour and the courage of a conqueror people
New continents are come in sight
Since island of ice to the green southern fields

New colonies are founded
Territories are demarcated
A new life waits for them
Of abundance and victories

New cultures insult them
The pagan gods announce
War is established
The clans are joined
Together for the same reason
They fight for their belief
They fight for their honour

In the freezing northern lands
Fields are already occupied
To the new clans, their aren't any options left
Only the searching for the unknown
Bound for new conquers
