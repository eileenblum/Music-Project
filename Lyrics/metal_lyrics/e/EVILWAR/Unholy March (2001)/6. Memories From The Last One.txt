Looking for his past ways
Only aches are founded
Blindly looking around
Now discovers he's the last one

Just memories are kept
Memories of glorious time
When the honor and courage are the key
That will guide to victory

Life was resume in conquests
Steel was forget as in ancient rituals
That were slowly forgotten
Together with the strongest traditions

Passing through lost places
Still carrying the marks of the battles
Scars return to bleed
Hate's still present in his memory

Looking for his past ways
Only ashes are founded
Blindly looking around
Now discovers he's the last one

Wandering alone for old ruins
Where rites were created
Where the oldest secrets
Were eternally kept

In the vast fields the wind blows
They still brought the noises of war
And smell of the blood shed in the name of the honor
Honor from a conqueror people
That will never be forgotten
