Gathering clouds of grim empower
the serpent
descending, this atlantean storm
awaken vile ancient beast
for too long have you slept
arise from the cold and murk.... ascending
the might of this furious fiend
unleashed upon the seas
Hungered, these blackened waters
turn to blood

It calls upon the wind
for the wind screams an ancient wisdom
fortold the coming of this entity
forgotten being of cold and drear
chosen of the beasts
upon the dawn of gods, the birth of fiends
aeons you shall know...
and that knowledge shall undo the world

Now arise, the gods shall weep as they die
master of cold blackened destruction
COME!

Called forth now to purge these waters
Demon of the Serpent form

With ancient scorn of
the greatest fiends
calling of the ancients
fathom of oblivion
bringer of the final dawn

Behold the rise, it is he (he is risen)
who swims in an endless sea of suffering
and torment..... so dread
Oh livid Serpent Of The Deep
You are the fall of humanity

Behold it is he who defies the light
and brings forth eternal suffering
forever driven by his hate and loathing
destined to destroy the realms of man
and the scions of god whom he defies

The ignorance of kings
brought forth the wrath
of this entity
Behold it is he who defies the light
and brings forth eternal suffering
forever driven by his hate and loathing
destined to destroy the realms of man
and the scions of god whom he defies
