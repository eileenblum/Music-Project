Fools, you already suffer
condemed for eternity
by your own hands

Blind
he blinds your vision
you know not
but that of the doctrine of lies
your weakness....
the teachings leave you weak

Slaves of an unseen master
chained by a false hope
of the kingdom of god

Your god is torment
you have nailed yourself
to your own crucifix
Righteousness?
you shall suffer for such ignorance

Ignorance remains, and still you suffer for God!!
