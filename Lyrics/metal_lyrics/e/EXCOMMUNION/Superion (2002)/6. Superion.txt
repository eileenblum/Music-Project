From darkness I was born
forged in the black flame
and tempered in storms of war
I am conqueror, I am king

Emperors of this world, know thy coming
for your kingdoms shall be mine
carrion is a feast of bounty
blood, a drink divine

Legions kneel before thy power
no man can stand before thee

Conqueror
a god among men
Destroyer
champion of death

Rivers of blood
flowing under the blessed kingdom
flames scorch the land
hear the laments of mortal men

Rising age of the greater ones
cleanse the land of inferiors
great campaign of fire and blood
a kingdom dread shall come

Behold the rise of Superion
men are kings, and kings are gods
Hail the age of Superion
forever rule the strongest blood

Rivers of blood
flowing under the blessed kingdom
flames scorch the land

Emperors of this world, know thy coming
for your kingdoms shall be mine
carrion is a feast of bounty
