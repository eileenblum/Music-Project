Eternity Is Mine
Thy keep, the realms of time
Until death you shall torment
your death tis the kingdom ablaze

Tis damnation that i give unto thee
wrath and fury
I bestow onto thee
keeper of souls
unto thee you shall serve
now bow before thee
and hail thee as lord
glory in darkness
to serve is divine
no pity in might
I enslaved your souls upon thy waking
your gods never lived
now you serve thee

Tis damnation that i give unto thee
wrath and fury
I bestow onto thee
keeper of souls

So much suffering
torture of all
tis thy will

Into places of darkness
sacrifice
the blood destroys the light

endless wake of torment
agony
eternal keeper of death
praise
