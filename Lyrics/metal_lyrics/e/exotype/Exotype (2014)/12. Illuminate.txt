[feat. DJ Inukshuk]Give me sight beyond sight.
Iâll make the world regret what itâs hiding.
Give me sight beyond sight.
Letâs shake the earth with the depth of our findings.

Illuminate this fate, displaced.
Iâm counting the days until
It is taken all away.
I make an escape, and find Iâm always running fast in place.
I build and create and then
Iâm vanishing without a trace.

Iâm always seeking answers.
Hidden within myself.
I am my own disaster,
And itâs all so perfect now.

Give me sight beyond sight.
Iâll make the world regret what itâs hiding.
Give me sight beyond sight.
Letâs shake the earth with the depth of our findings.

Rejuvenate and lie in wait,
Iâm building a case and itâs
A miracle I got my way.
My thoughts are encased and I wonât subscribe to that clichÃ©
I kill and erase and then
I fabricate my own escape.

Iâm always seeking answers.
Hidden within myself,
I am my own disaster,
And itâs all so perfect now.

Give me sight beyond sight.
Iâll make the world regret what itâs hiding
Give me sight beyond sight.
Letâs shake the earth with the depth of our findings.
As above, so below.
Letâs heat it up and let the whole world know.
As above, so below.
Letâs heat it up and let the whole world know.
