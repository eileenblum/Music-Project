[feat. Rekoil]I am the voice of those afraid to speak
I am the fist that will defend the weak.
I am the tongue that will deliver the lonely
I am the hell for those that think that they own me.

They think that they own me.

If youâre living ashamed
And youâre feeling the pain
Just believe in yourself
Before it drives you insane

Do I need to remind you
The past is behind you
You wished it away
Can I trust youâll find in you
The strength to continue today

You are a slave to insecurity
You lavish in the pain or purity
You will be banished to obscurity
This is the price you paid to torture me.

I am the voice of those afraid to speak
I am the fist that will defend the weak
You think that you owe me?
I think that you owe me.

Back the fuck up

Do I need to remind you
The past is behind you
You wished it away
Can I trust youâll find in you
The strength to continue today
