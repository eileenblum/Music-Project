Stand up stand up, what are you waiting for.
This is everything you wanted.

Get up listen up, I got something to say.
You said youâd make it anyway.

This is what youâve been waiting for.
Hereâs your chance to form your legacy.
Hereâs your chance to engrave your memory.
This is what youâve been dreaming of.
Take a breath, close your eyes and dive in.
Take a breath, close your eyes and dive in.

From the beginning we are destined for a higher cause.
Our minds expanded how we planned it then we wrote the laws.
Now itâs come to a decision and weâre drawing straws.
Want to make our own conditions weâre technicians though weâre flawed

Stand up stand up, itâs what youâre waiting for.
This is everything you wanted. There is nothing more.
Get up listen up, I got something to say.
You said youâd make it anyway.

This is what youâve been waiting for.
Hereâs your chance to form your legacy.
Hereâs your chance to engrave your memory.
This is what youâve been dreaming of.
Take a breath, close your eyes and dive in.
Take a breath, close your eyes and dive in.

Stand up stand up, itâs what youâre waiting for.
This is everything you wanted
Get up listen up, I got something to say
You said youâd make it anyway

From the place you least expect I decide the fate of millions
I am the anomaly

From the beginning we were destined for a higher cause.
Our minds expanded how we planned it then we wrote the laws.
Now itâs come to a decision and weâre drawing straws.
Want to make our own conditions weâre technicians though weâre flawed

Stand up stand up, itâs what youâre waiting for.
This is everything you wanted.
Get up listen up, I got something to say.
You said youâd make it anyway.

This is what youâve been waiting for.
Hereâs your chance to form your legacy.
Hereâs your chance to engrave your memory.

Take a breath, close your eyes and dive in.
Take a breath, close your eyes and dive in.
