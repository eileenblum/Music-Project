When I look into your eyes you are familiar
And I know you so well.
(Better than I know myself, if youâre a lie then I know your tell)

Fateâs like an apparition
Itâs stance is unwavering
Iâm savoring a glance, a passing chance
And I wouldnât change a thing.

When I look into your eyes you are so familiar.
And I know you so well.
(better than I know myself, if youâre a lie then I know your tell)
I close my own to make you disappear, but
When I look youâre still there.
When I look youâre still there.

Trust me, just me.
You know that Iâve been there.

The dark is coming in but Iâm prepared.

So when the world turns its back on you
Keep in mind that it has turned on me too

If youâre hopeless standing next to me, then hell can collect me.

When I look into your eyes you are so familiar.
And I know you so well.
(better than I know myself, if youâre a lie then I know your tell)
I close my own to make you disappear, but
When I look youâre still there.
When I look youâre still there.

And now Iâm seeing oh so clearly.
There is something here.

If youâre here to take my heart from me
Take it fast before my mind can see

When I look into your eyes you are so familiar.
And I know you so well.
(better than I know myself, if youâre a lie then I know your tell)
I close my own to make you disappear, but
When I look youâre still there.
