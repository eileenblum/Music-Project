Breathe me in
I am the change that grows inside of you
We are one and the same, you have yourself to blame
And there is nothing left for you to lose

You know all my tactics
Dispense with theatrics
Attack what youâre after and
Stack in your mattress
The past that is after us
Creeps so disastrous
Cheat your defeat
The deceit will come after us
Fight your design by encasing your fear
Slight your designer as if he could hear
Patch all the cracks so the glass can be clear
Cuz itâs my face youâll see when you look in the mirror.

I see the word looking at me, hoping for me to save us ass
I feel the world piercing through me,
And Iâm willing to give it all

Breathe me in
I am the change that grows inside of you
We are one and the same, you have yourself to blame,
And there is nothing left for you to lose.

Thereâs nothing left.

I feel the world looking at me, hoping for me to save us all.

Breathe me in.
I am the change that grows inside of you.
We are one and the same, you have yourself to blame,
And there is nothing left for you to lose.

Thereâs nothing left.
