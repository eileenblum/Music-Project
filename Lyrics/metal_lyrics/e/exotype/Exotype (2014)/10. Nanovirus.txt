Can you feel it?
Can you hear me?
Can you feel it?
Can you hear me?!
Can you feel it? Can you hear me?
The carcinogen encapsulates my traits,
And shakes my fate into a stasis.
Can you feel it? Can you hear me?
The assessment has been made,
I wouldnât give my life to leave the whole world faceless.

I am genetically predisposed to feel this is,
More real than itâs ever been.
You can touch it taste it until the end.

Jump!
More real than itâs ever been.
You can touch it, taste it, until the end.
Youâve got your dreams youâre not ready to go.
Youâve got your life and you can take it slow.
Youâve got to live with the choices youâve made.
So let the poison course through your veins.

Itâs eating away at you from the inside out.
The guilt is sickness, corrupting your conscience, spread by word of mouth
Can you feel it? Can you hear me?
Upload the blame to your mainframe, I rise up as you fall.

Youâve got your dreams youâre not ready to go.
Youâve got your life and you can take it slow.
Youâve got to live with the choices youâve made.
So let the poison course through your veins.
Can you feel it?
The assessment has been made. The machines will decide your fate.

Youâve got your dreams youâre not ready to go.
Youâve got your life and you can take it slow.
Youâve got to live with the choices youâve made.
So let the poison course through your veins.
The machines will decide your fate.
FATE!
Can you feel it? Can you hear me?
