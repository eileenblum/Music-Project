This is the day everything will change.
Iâm gonna take back what youâve taken from me
And just let me be me.

You have burned every ounce of trust
Now there is no us left for me to believe
So I believe in me

You have burned every ounce of trust
Now there is no us left for me to believe
So I believe in me.

This is my time to rise and break the
Silence (paving the way for change)
Only I have the power to stop the cycle,
The world is just a breath away.

I know now that I need to find myself a way,
Find myself a way out.
And if I donât then we both know this will happen again and again
I know now that I need to find myself a way.
Find myself a way out.
And if I donât then we both know this will happen again and again
This will happen again

You told me everything would be okay
Itâs just a bruise, a little bump
And no one cares anyway
No one can hear me scream.

This is my time to rise and break the silence (paving the way for change)
Only I have the power to stop this cycle.
The world is just a breath away.

I know now that I need to find myself a way,
Find myself a way out.
And if I donât then we both know this will happen again and again
I know now that I need to find myself a way.
Find myself a way out.
And if I donât then we both know this will happen again and again
This will happen again

The walls are drawing closer.
Too close is too close, youâre too close.
Iâm slipping away from myself
Iâm drowning in doubt
Thereâs no more you and I
The hands of the clock have stopped at zero. Itâs time to wake up.

I know now that I need to find myself a way,
Find myself a way out.
And if I donât then we both know this will happen again and again
I know now that I need to find myself a way.
Find myself a way out.
And if I donât then we both know this will happen again and again
This will happen again
