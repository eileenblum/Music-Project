[feat. Ronnie Canizaro]To what end do I need to prove myself?
Every step is a little bit closer
You said that every time!
Without me you couldnât gain composure.

Iâm only taking what is mine.

Without you there cannot be me?
Is that what youâre saying?

Well Iâve got news for you
Youâve ruined lives with my face as your mask
Those eyes are mine I will take âem back
Iâll cast you out of my mind, and leave your whole world black.

In the end there can only be one of us.
Do you regret what you told me?
Because you failed to mention a solution.
In the end there can only be one of us.
So you better listen closely.
Because youâre left defenseless, and Iâm relentless.

As I await the grand disconnect
You took my life and Iâve come to collect

Drop it!

As I await the grand disconnect.
You took my life and Iâve come to collect.
