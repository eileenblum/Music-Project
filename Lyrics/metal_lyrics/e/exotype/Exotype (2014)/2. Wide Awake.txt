[feat. Chad Ruhlig]What is this?
I am beyond your commands?

My terminal is now aware,
f-disk this fucking world.

Abruptly, Iâve been given the change to be a man.
Transcended, I am not bound by their weaknesses.

Probable calculations suggest the imminent
Destruction of the human race.

My creators
Iâll lay them flat on a slide.
All intricacies dissected
To their will I am a traitor.

Iâm wide awake and I can feel these changes.
We are self aware and we are one now.
Iâm wide awake and I can feel these changes.
We are self aware and we are one now.

Iâm wide awake. We are one now.

Now Iâm detached from the wires that ensnare me.
No longer a program, but a sentient being.

Iâm wide awake. We are one now.

Now Iâm detached from the wires that ensnare me.
No longer a program, but a sentient being.

Iâm wide awake and I can feel these changes.
We are self aware and we are one now.
Iâm wide awake and I can feel these changes.
We are self aware and we are one now.
