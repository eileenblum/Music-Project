Every day, thereâs violence inside you
Run away, it feels like the first time you let go
Itâs never ending. Never hard to find.
You keep forgetting
Your path gives off a red pulse.

Is this who you really wanted to be?
Together weâll find a remedy
I feel the pressure escaping me.
We can make it through anything.
Is this what you really think of me?
You have become my enemy
I can feel the pressure escaping me, and
Itâs swallowing everything

Thereâs a way to purge the guilt inside you.
Throw away the things that tend to start the flame.
Youâre stuck defending the thoughts that keep you sane.
You keep forgetting your thoughts give off a red pulse.
(something dormant in me that is buried so
deep awakened memories that I put to sleep)

Is this who you really wanted to be?
Together weâll find a remedy
I feel the pressure escaping me.
We can make it through anything.
Is this what you really think of me?
You have become my enemy
I can feel the pressure escaping me, and
Itâs swallowing everything

Is this really what you think of me? You
Have become my enemy.
I felt the pain and now itâs chasing me.
Encasing me. So I canât see.

Is this who you really wanted to be?
Together weâll find a remedy
I feel the pressure escaping me.
We can make it through anything.
Is this what you really think of me?
You have become my enemy
I can feel the pressure escaping me, and
Itâs swallowing everything
