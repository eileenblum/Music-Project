I will walk away you can't hold me down, you can't slow me down. I can make it. Break me.

What does it take for you to give in?
I hate the way you justify your sins.

You left me alone, in this broken home with my demons
I hear them knocking but I will never let them in

I will walk away you can't hold me down you can't slow me down I can make it. I paid for my mistakes this life is for the taking and there's nothing left that can break me.

Will I ever see...what lies behind the mask?
That you put on to hide the shame and horrors of your past
It's getting closer...this pain and misery
Rip out the sutures, so you can bleed for me.

You left me alone, in this broken home with my demons
I hear them calling but I will never let them in.

I will walk away you can't hold me down you can't slow me down I can make it. I paid for my mistakes this life is for the taking and there's nothing left that can break me.

You exist in my mind.
I'm taking back what's mine.
But now you've crossed the line.
And you're running out of time.
Out of time.

I won't forgive you.
I will forget you.

I will walk away you can't hold me down you can't slow me down I can make it. I paid for my mistakes this life is for the taking and there's nothing left that can break me
