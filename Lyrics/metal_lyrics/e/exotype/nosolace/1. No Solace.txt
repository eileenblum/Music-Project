As I wade into the stream, I close my eyes, it's all a dream.
You can see me drowning.
But there is no solace left for me.
I'm keeping calm and collected, and I let the hatred flow through me.
I remember a time when we were still alive.
But when it starts getting hard, I see you run and hide.

I see you run and hide.
I see you run and hide. 

You took a piece of me.
The piece that wanted to believe.
We could conquer anything.
But after all, it's all a dream.

Face your fears, free your mind, that's what I tell myself. 
Am I really alive if I live for someone else.
You can hear me screaming. 
But there is no solace left for me. 
I'm feeling lost and rejected. 
And I still let the hatred flow through me. 

Bide your time.
You were the only thing on my mind.
Every second that I wish you'd die, is every moment that I feel alive.
You will get what you deserve.

You basic bitch! You will get what you deserve.

You took a piece of me.
The piece that wanted to believe.
We could conquer anything.
But after all, it's all a dream.
