Do you know why you will...
Always be a part of me?
When I look in the mirror...
I see you staring back at me.
You can't help but make me feel alone
I'm lost and I'm losing all control
Why can't you just find your way back home
I feel you there but I know that you're not here
I'm falling faster now but my world is standing still
I still can't comprehend that I'll never see you again 
I pretend that you're with me until the end 
And I suspend my thoughts just to make amends.
I'm falling fast these days and I think of all the ways that I can kick this phase.
I set the world ablaze and I sit back and watch as it all decays.
