[feat. Sanju Aguiar]Two worlds symphonize; with loaded guns
My world's turned black and your's without a sun
The darkest cloud; gather for a bombing run
Mother Nature cries in fury to call out a son
With vengeance and violence
I slay you in silence
With a tear of a mortal sin
The city lays in ruin

I consider my passion for killing
A joy to fill my eyes
(we've avenged all our lives)
Just to see the soldiers die
'Cause the mountain land was never ever
Laid aside [2x]

My world is a broken halo

As the blind bullet hits its prey
Mother Nature soaks my blood
Without any dismay
My wounded body in a horror of recoil
This is where the blood is drunk
By the soil [2x]

Lift my body and take me home
The day has come; to meet a loved one
The clock takes a halt and she meets here dying groom
And the remains of love
Love has just been exhumed
He kisses me with a tear in the eye
And he dies in his mother's womb

The highest degree of valour
For the bravest of the brave
The memories of a dead man
Has left us deeply engraved.
