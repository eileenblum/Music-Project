The land of opportunity, where one works hard to clear off his loan
And the other does it by admiring the boss' new cologne

This corporate serenity,
Where you oppress me with a smile on your face
And I hate you back with a smirk of my own

You eliminate your conduct
To join forces with the mass
And secretly you find your place
Near your boss' ass

The math of foulness that you mastered, my friend, you're a corporate bastard [2x]

An inevitable change of law and people in thrall,
When your boss is always right above all
No matter how hard you try
Manipulation will run deep in this cubicle walls

In this war of words
The tongue is often coated with honey
But it will sting, but it will sting, but it will sting,
Cause the threads are tied to the tongue
But it grooves on someone else's string, else's string, else's string, else's string

You eliminate your conduct
To join forces with the mass
And secretly you find your place
Near your boss' ass
