My curse is considered to be invoked with wrath
And I am striken with guilt in the aftermath

I might be the purest of heart
But by night I am the howling beast
Who can tear you apart

I am the beast
Who is not afraid of the priest
Neither the holy water
Nor the exorcist

Call me an insult to heaven or praise to hell
As the full moon whispers a spell
My soul and spirit start to rebel

Kill me before I shape-shift or get killed

As the claws of death call you out
You scream your last breath
I am the prayer for your sin
And I'll maul you to death

The curse invoked with wrath and guilt of the aftermath
Purest heart but by night growls and tears you apart
