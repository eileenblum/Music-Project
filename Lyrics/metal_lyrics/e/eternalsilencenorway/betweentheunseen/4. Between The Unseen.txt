Wandering on frozen ground side by side your real self.
Colour fades - Rainbow shades, pleasant flame - Not the same
Just as nothing, a long forgotten wasted fate of a lost life!

" You're laying on frozen ground - No shadow, no colour, no pleasure!"
" I fly over your face by the wind from your breath of your thoughts."

You don't see!
You don't see!

Sensous flame - the same.

Running on frozen ground
- tears freaze your eyes.

" I fly over youre face-
Follow you on the run
As the tought you have sought."

See between the unseen,
Flee into the most extreme.
Seek inside the human mind,
Far within to become supreme.

Rainbow colours faiding in,
An aura of your neverending wish
- Embrace you, entice you-
Make you part of it's inner being.

You think, you wish
You're home in yourself.
But joyous flame HA HA HA - Not the same!

" I fly through frezen minds."
A scenic stagnation
-A world so far beyond for others.
