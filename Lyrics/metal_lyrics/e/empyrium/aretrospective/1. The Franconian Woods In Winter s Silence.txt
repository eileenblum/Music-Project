Wrapped in morning's silence
of December's tree
Lonesome am I as I hear the raven's cry
Grieving art the mourning songs

Above the forest reigns tranquility
Just ice cold winds whisper to me
As if a velvet robe would wrap my bleeding heart
One gentle breeze of these winds and grief falls apart

A charm, like a dream,
The franconian woods
Enchant me, embrace me,
Franconian woods

Caught in infinity,
In the vastness of countless trees
Oh, what a purity,
Lies in the sceneries

Cursed for this winter hike
I see the dawn, its fountain of light
Morning glory -- ethereal night
