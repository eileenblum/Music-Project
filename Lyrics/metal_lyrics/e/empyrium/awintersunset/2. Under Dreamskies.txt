Storm skies from the nights
Shadows of the forest lie inside
And gleaming emeralds in decorative tones
Brushed by the ice under circles
Her timeless beauty started to wither
A green voice in her heart
She touched the red leaves in sorrow
A farewell was found inside
Oh my dreamless night
Again under the sea of moonshine of this night
Through darkened place in times of pale we have traversed
Do not fear the wounds of their swords
Let me dream of crystal lakes
Lit by the sun, the moon or the stars
Of green meadows and creations of elves and proud pagan hearts
Oh let me retreat 'neath fields embraced by winds and by your kiss
Oh you dwell in these ancient woods where the fantasy begins
Under dreamskies we will march towards the fortress of our love
The fair credence known to us will be as long as eternal kiss
