The current springs
A source pure and bright
Where magic sings in silence

Remembrance fades
All ends seem so nigh
Illusions break in silence

I drift away
You are led astray
With the current into grey
I'm staying here
While you disappear
With the current into grey

The current leads to places afar
With violent swirls into the pale
Illusions broke in a wide nameless sea
The source remains endlessly
