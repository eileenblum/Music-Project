Drifting through a void
without a voice
Grey and dark - through starless nights
that leave no choice
A lifeless mind, a soul astrayed
in autumn's maze
In shade and light, my days portrayed
A spark of grace

Floating to the farthest still
unto the winter's heart
Motionless, bereft the will
but where did we all start?

There is no pain without beauty at all...
