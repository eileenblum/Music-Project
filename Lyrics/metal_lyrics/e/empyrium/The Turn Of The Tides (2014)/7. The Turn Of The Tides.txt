Deep red skies
falling into blue
With every turn of the tides
I am closer to you

I am a wave in an ocean
Floating, gliding infinity
I shall not break at the rocks
Nor shall I decay before my time
At last I reach endless white sands

Ulf Theodor Schwadorf â Bass, Guitars, Drums, Percussion, Vocals
Thomas Helm â Keyboards, Piano, Vocals
