Bright were the days and fiery the sun
The nights were soft and cloudless the silent welkin hung
And winds did laze in forests and all was filled with airy sweetness -
In days before the fall

Light were our hearts and notions were young
The times were full of magic and secret songs unsung
And winds did laze in forest and all was filled with airy sweetness -
In days before the fall

Asleep is the past now autumn is grey
And silently we wallow in memory of the day
When winds did laze in forests and all was filled with airy sweetness -
In days before the fall
