Seconds or days have no meaning now
'Cause every life fades into death, somehow...
Moments come - moments go
Why the darkness wants me so...
Threshold of wails - is it the last resort?
An empty promise turned into a sad omen
Moments come...
There's a better place to be
Choose your path again or resign your faith
Searching - desperately
For a safe place to rest
But old memories - the thorns of tragedy
Heal me with emptiness
Take me to your Eden
Heal me with our moments
Release me from this life...
Seconds of pain served at the same old time
Unstable empathy for the ancient crime
Moments come - There's a better place to be
Choose your path again - don't look back...
Searching - desperately
For a safe place to rest
But old memories - the thorns of tragedy
Heal me with emptiness
Take me to your Eden
Heal me with our moments
Release me from this life...
