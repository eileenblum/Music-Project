Where should I find pain? - Here, Where I belong
Beneath a strange black halo lives a man without hope
Darkness closed my eyes - I still breathe the dust
And a cold sarcastic requiem plays for no one...
Where should I find strength? - Fear the unseen world
A prisoner of my own black grasp when temptation grows
I've walked into the dark...enlighten my old sores
The walls can mystify my path - walls without doors... Irreligious screams of hate
Waiting answers from Aeon
And the walls become the mirror of my being!
I've mourned all my dismal dreams
Crawling from the edge...
There's no return for no one
I am living it - nothing is sacred anymore
Oh, I'm so meaningless...
There's no return for no one
I am living it - nothing is sacred anymore
Inside my darkest room
The ancient believer now witnesses hidden pleasures
And silence became the most desirable disbelief...
Pain - not salvation
It's overcoming the fear...
Time. Eternity... wears a fragile scene
And a sinner's bliss becomes my lament
As the dark strives to unveil me!
Irreligious screams of hate
Waiting secrets from below
My last sigh to face the outside... Oh, it hurts
I've mourned all my dismal dreams
Crawling from the edge...
There's no return for no one
I am living it - nothing is sacred anymore
Oh, I'm so meaningless...
There's no return for no one
I am living it - nothing is sacred anymore
Inside my darkest room
