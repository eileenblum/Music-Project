Why... Did she cross the bridge?
Of illusive answers
As the hidden mask unclaimed
Change in the true face of a sinner...
...Oh no!
- Here's the true face of the unbeliever
Why... Didn't he look behind?
For one last time...
And a simple day became
In a conflict of existence
"Predicted by themselves - two worlds separated"
Or simply just what they have created!
Scars have been healed by memories
When there's nothing to believe in
Destiny has changed their faith
Because the trail of sinners has begun
Inside the towers of isolation
Inside the towers of isolation
A loss of faith grows - inside the towers...
A circle of crosses surrounds the inevitable shame
Betrayed romance rests in the cradle of all blames
"I replaced life for what I once believed
But now I'm afraid of what I've seen"
"Predicted by themselves - two worlds separated"
Or simply just what, what we've been creating!
Scars have been healed by memories
When there's nothing to believe in
Destiny has changed their faith
Because the trail of sinners has begun
A circle of crosses surrounds the inevitable shame
Betrayed romance rests in the cradle of all blames
"I replaced life for what I once believed
But now I'm afraid of what I've seen"
Inside the towers of isolation
Inside the towers of isolation
A loss of faith grows - inside the towers...
Inside the towers
