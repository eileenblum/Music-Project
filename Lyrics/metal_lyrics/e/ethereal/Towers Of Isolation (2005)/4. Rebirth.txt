A strange theory
Upon a stranger, that it's me
After all the blood I've shed was in vain
The dark insists to be - A companion of misery
Like the sea of the banished touched the shores...
Sorrow lives near me
Coldness...
An old euphony
Changed to offer agony
Did He open the aged gates of Babylon?
Behold divinity - A shameful irony
As a man falls with his icons and visions
Sorrow lives near me
Coldest fate...
All the questions remain inside this room
Let none see my existence...
Is the circle created for the rebirth?
Depraved in a world of tragedy
Oh, can't you see...
In aeternus nox
Miru tristis aura Est
Nulli sunt cernet
Vita...vita mea
Reditus ad Vitam
Maesti Fortuna
Obscurior Aedes
