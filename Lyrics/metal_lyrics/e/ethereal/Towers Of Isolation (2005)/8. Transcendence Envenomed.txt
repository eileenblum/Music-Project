Shame overflows strictly out of his eyes
What the ancient lust has left -
the remains of a splendorous light...
The most wanted rebirth - ascending to a new place
The most wanted rebirth - transcendence envenomed
Every single flash of light seems like the indelicate word you said
I'm drifting slowly to the unknown place
- I'm drifting slowly for the unknown place...
I found myself within your pain
I found myself within your pain...
Every single flash of light seems like the indelicate word
  You just said...
The legacy I once adored is pulling you down
Into a pattern of incomprehension
Behind the curtain dares to lie a petrified world
The principle you believed decays...
Unhallowed privilege
Now you believe in me?
The place where we dreamt away
Was always a mankind's fake!
A soundless weep flows from her mouth - Desperation drowns me
And beside you, lays a crest-fallen man...
The sadist overture began - enchantment died
What we're seeing... deliberates her cry!
Unhallowed privilege
Now you believe in me?
The place where we dreamt away
- Dark sanctum where you feel...
...Shame!! - Overflows strictly out of his eyes
The fragments of a man slowly dying at her side
The most wanted rebirth - ascending to a new place
The most wanted rebirth - transcendence envenomed!
The wounded circle awaits - it yearns for the damned
A new division seems condemned at the time
The last confession unleashed a pale-naked truth
Sacrilege - forbidden word - improved my fall...
...Resurrection began!
I pray... whispered - sharing all tears
Laughing as you scream my name...
I lay...weakened... sharing all hopes
Madness impaled this soul...
Transcendence-Envenomed...
