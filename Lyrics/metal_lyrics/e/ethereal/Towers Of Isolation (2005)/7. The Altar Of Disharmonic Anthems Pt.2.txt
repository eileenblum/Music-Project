Do you hear a sadist overture?
- I can heed dim allusions
I thought it might be the angels dying on their own
Why did you insist to carry on?
- I was yearned by inner force
When the circle is waiting for the damned...for the damned
Wait for the damned...
  Do you fear the gates I've once ignored?
- Gloomy signs affecting me cold
I know what may live behind these ordinary walls
And I must hide to recover...
- I'll find a light within our dreams
Perhaps inside the monument of reveries
Wait for the damned...
Open your eyes and see what you wanted to perceive
Open your eyes and see what you need to deceive
- Lucidity dares to fade away -
- Nihil sacratus est -
Here's the altar of disharmonic anthems
