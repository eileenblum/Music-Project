Would you try to face this life?
Now vanished for a world...
Delirium
The sweet state of mind - frail self-obsession
Covered by our dimness needs
The seeds of life are fading constantly...
A faked reality or is it a fake of the real me?
... And then I fall again
Into the depths of loneliness
... And then I fall again
Into the depths of loneliness
Should I try to face the light?
I was sightless by the years...
Are the walls feeding of my blood?
Or is it just imagination...?
Spitting the last weep of hate
Eternal grief - fading sense of life...
A faked reality or is it a fake of the real me?
"Waves of vanished fantasies
From a man drifting away..."
The haven of hallucinations
Where the 3rd circle awaits...
The dark consumes my soul
As the light blinds my way
The unnamed graceful pain
Lies deep inside of me...
... Will I fall again?
Into the depths of loneliness
"Waves of vanished fantasies
From a man drifting away..."
  The haven of hallucinations
Where the 3rd circle awaits...
The dark consumes my soul
As the light blinds my way
The unnamed graceful pain
Lies deep inside of me...
Where the 3rd circle awaits...
