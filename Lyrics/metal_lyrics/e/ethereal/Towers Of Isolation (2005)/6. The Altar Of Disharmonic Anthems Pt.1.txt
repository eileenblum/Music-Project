Few moments passed and I heard the approaching steps
A gentle breeze whispered in my ear
"You're safe now...
You're safe now..."
...Am I?
Softly hands caressing me
I ... I couldn't see her face...
"You're safe now...
You're safe now..."
I could only hear her voice
"You're safe now...
You're safe now..."
And a strange act began...
