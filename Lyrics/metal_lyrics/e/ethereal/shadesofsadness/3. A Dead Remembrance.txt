It shines my past - Why it brings the dark to you
Forever shining to me - To you, forever the darkness...
Close the door of your soul
And expect quiet the wind of sins
You rather feel the sadness near
Then death it's healing here...
And why? - I wish again the dark
And I fall deeply in an empty heart
You rather be with someone
But hear the wind's approaching...
In the dark someone with you
False illusions - but why?
It shines my past - A dead remembrance
Brings dark to you - A dead remembrance
It shines my past - A dead remembrance
Brings dark to you...
Desperation - I'm alone - desperation - faithless...
In the dark someone with you
False illusions - but why?
It shines my past - A dead remembrance
Brings dark to you - A dead remembrance
It shines my past - A dead remembrance
Brings dark to you...again...
