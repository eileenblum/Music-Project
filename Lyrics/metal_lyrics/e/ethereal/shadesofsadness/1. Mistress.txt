Throw your scars to the past
Love is least and never last
Throw the cards of your life to the winds
- I can feel the weakness
Drown your malice in the pain
Love is unreal, ever insane
Take away your evil greed - shall you be my mistress...
Call the colours of the night
Blessed once, ever fright
Call the wind to hear the whispers - words of emptiness!
Give your beauty to myself
Will you be what I've needed?
Throw your malice away and be my mistress...
Can you...can you be my mistress
Can you...can you be my mistress
I'll wait for that time...desire kills me
I'll wait for that time...can you be mine...
Can you heal my passions with such cold attitudes?
Can you keep relations above everything?
Can you avoid my words in your love abyss?
If you can hurt so much...why can't you feel this?
Can you...can you be my mistress
Can you...can you be my mistress
I'll wait for that time...desire kills me
I'll wait for that time...can you be mine...
Be my mistress...can you be mine...
