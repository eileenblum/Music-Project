Replace the flavour of darkness
Deny the deathless embrace
Mouth that spits roses, sometimes spit lies
Replacing the flavour of darkness
Denying the deathless embrace
My eternal love forgot the goodbyes...
Shades of Sadness
She completes my pain with dead poetry
Sadness. Makes me remind her (you)
Once again candles are dying beside me
I still think about your words
Death is the way to your dreams life
Life is just a dream on the way to death
Death is the way to your dreamÂ´s life
Life is just a dream again
She unchains melodies of a dead poetry
Women enchantment as died
I cover with earth my endless love
So dark, my dances of emptyness
Death is the way to your dreamÂ´s life
Life is just a dream on the way to death
Death is the way to your dreamÂ´s life
Life is just a dream on the way to my...
...Shades of sadness...
âLying I saw myself...
Drowning in a lake of tears
But now I remember you
And that meaning for my life...
My life brought me this pain
And I share it with poetry
Leave me to another place
And within my shades of sadness
