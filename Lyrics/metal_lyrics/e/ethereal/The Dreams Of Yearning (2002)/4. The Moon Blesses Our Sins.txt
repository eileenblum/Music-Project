The moon just blessed our sins...
The moon just bless...
You're shaking because it's cold or is it just the fear?
You share with me the night...unavoidable tears
Resentment in your eyes...forgiveness in my words...
The bleeding sky waits for my return...
The time as stop to both, the time as stop for everything
I'm still standing in shades of a lifeless love
Afraid to speak the truth...(I'm waiting for the lights of the day)
Don't let the rain take your tears away...
Full moon blessed our sins...moonlight cries with you
Blessed our sins...there's nothing that I can do
Blessed our sins...moonlight cries with you
Blessed our sins...now there's nothing that I can do
I am lost...I will save you...perhaps someday...
