I'm still waiting...for a moment, alone with you
Hopeless grows behind heaven's door
Where I belong now...
eyes full of oceans are waiting...
Are you crying?
Lord, blind my eyes to these visions
The distance is not so far anyway
And I can touch your tears from here...
eyes full of oceans still waiting ...
Oh...It's hurting me so
...And the darkness - Embraces my pain
Oh...it's hurting you too
And that mistake...
Frustration...it's growing between two worlds divided
The same old revelation's chapter
Eyes of oceans must wait, save my soul from this passion...
Oh...It's hurting me so
...And the darkness - Embraces my pain
Oh...it's hurting you too
And that mistake...I can't take it with me
"LORD, ALLOW THESE WORDS OF REDEMPTION
AND TASTE THE PAIN'S WINE WITH YOUR OWN SONS
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN NOTHING AND YOU INSIST ON CALLING THIS LIFE..."
Between...heaven and earth
This cold fever...I've lost tranquillity
Between heavens...he became...
An unbeliever man...still searching for his peaceful path
This equilibrium...eternal afterlife......
Between...heaven and earth
This cold fever...I've lost tranquillity
Between heavens...between...
An edge of promises...inside the garden of all lies
Why you stole my wings?-Why you stole my life...
OH... THE TRUTH, HURTS MORE THAN THE SCORN DIVINE
A CARVED THORN IN MY HEART SMOULDERING FROM INSIDE
FOR WHOM THE ANGELS DIED
SO ENLIGHTEN MY DIMNESS LIFE
UNPLEASANT REALM OF WHIMS
I BECAME A PRISONER OF TIME...
In heaven's darkest hour...ten thousand angels fall
For all eternity I'm condemned inside these walls of agony...
Between...heaven and earth
This cold fever...no tranquillity
Between heavens...between...Love ...
Between heaven and earth-Between heaven and love
Between heaven and earth-I can hear your whispers... ...
I'm still waiting...for a moment alone with you
Hopeless grows behind heaven's door
Where I belong now...eyes full of oceans must wait......
