I'm flowing unconscious...I'm hoping for a sign...
I think-"am I secure in this filthy sheets? (Formerly they were wanted)
Here am I yours?"-Only and always in a dream of eternal yearning...
Frustration it's growing...her black dress it's hidden upon shades (of
death's eyes)
Then lights turn to darkness and from the dusk finally, you appeared...
Shall I awake for life?-it's forbidden...
Iim drowning in infinity-shared oblivion...
Touch me...hold me...one more time...
Will...I ever awake for life...(I fear)...but after all...
A world of silence became in a filthy sin (the dreams of yearning)
A land of pleasures fading and the mirror of reality with it
Will I see you again...
Shall I awake for life?-it's forbidden...
Iim drowning in infinity-shared oblivion...
Touch me...hold me...one more time...
