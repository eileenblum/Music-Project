Imaginary walls surround me
And the silence embraces all my weeps
All the images turn into shadows... of myself
I'm breeding memories...I will not cry...again
Infinite voices...why they drown me here
All the words I hear are for sure...pure reality
Voices...controlling my feelings
Eternal kiss, touched my face
Voices...healing my pain
I am lost without you...
Lights touched my eyes and petrified my tears
Your last caress that I've been waiting...
Am I dreaming or is this your hallowed place
Because I'm feeling the cold of a last farewell...
Voices...controlling my feelings
Eternal kiss, touched my face
Voices...healing my pain
I am lost (without you...)
Fading faces-angels crying beside me
Guiding voices-where I will find you
Where I will find myself...
I am lost...where I will find myself?
I am lost...where I will find myself?
I am lost...where I will find myself?
Where I will find you?
Where I will find you?
Where I will find you?
So where I will find myself...
