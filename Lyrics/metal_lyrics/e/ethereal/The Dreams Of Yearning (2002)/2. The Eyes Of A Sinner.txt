Oh...Reflections, of what lives inside of my eyes
Some frozen tears are flowing from a sinner's cry
I believe that in this life I don't have much time
And the silence...compromise...
Cold attraction, for the last day of my life
How wonderful it's the final judgment? Taste the eternal wine
I believe in other life...I just have to close my eyes...
And the silence...can't deny it...
Senses...lying inside me...growing
Senses...a crossroad of destiny - an endless path
The symphony of a lost man
My eyes are bleeding...The depths of a sinner's eyes are infinite dark...
(Then look at inside of mine...)
Senses...lying inside me - growing
Senses...a crossroad of destiny - an endless path
The symphony of a lost man
My eyes are bleeding regrets...
It's the eyes of a sinner...
The eyes of a sinner...oh the eyes
