A fallen dream...I hit the ground of Eden
For a last time...
A bleeding vision...an ancient prophecy
White wings still burning...
I'm hidden in the dark...autumn never ends here
Forever trapped in the wings of eternity......
I gave you shelter...a place without fears
Oh, now I'm dancing with spectres of heaven......
A burning symbol bleeds - A deathless path ends
Did you realize what we have done?
A burning heart cries - A deathless love begins
I realized, life is just lies...
That bleeding vision shows us a true life
White wings are burning...
A lonely dancer...so far away from you
Sad melody dies - forever love lives...
A burning symbol bleeds - A deathless path ends
Did you realize what we have done?
We're living in a new paradise...a painful journey begins
We're wasting intentions of life...we're wasting all of our sins......

We are wasting all...a lonely dancer
This is the last serenade...this is the last serenade
This is our last serenade...a lonely dancer...I am...
A burning heart cries-A deathless love begins
I realized, life is just lies...
We're living in a new paradise
...a painful journey begins
We're wasting intentions of life
...we're wasting all
My fallen dream...it seems a broken mirror
In a lost time...
Ethereal vision...ethereal prophecy
White wings will fly again...
Until then a lonely dancer I am...will fly again...
Will fly again...a lonely dancer I am...I am...
