Allured from unhallowed realms
The most guileful of luminosity
A macabre dance that speaks of imminent death
To which, now, I gaze in awe and silently sigh
In guilt I draw ever so close as the eyes
of twilight dissolve in the descending heavens
Souls torn by envy and grief
Forever to reach out beyond the black stone
I finally embrace your bleeding heart
You who passes before me, have been the serene
haunting of my sleep
Too long have I feared this day
Your whispers envelop tears for what is yet to come
Shall we ever meet in myth again
My sorrow shall reflect passion
For I must bid farewell, to sleep eternally
Beneath the earth
