A majestic sight of everlasting reign
Behold the rise of December's frozen kingdom
Reddest of the skies welcome the angel of sorrow
the tower chimes the centuries end
I awaken to the eclipse of the blackest nights moon
Come forth winters orchestral winds
I am weakened by blizzards of sadness and chilling forgotten Eves
