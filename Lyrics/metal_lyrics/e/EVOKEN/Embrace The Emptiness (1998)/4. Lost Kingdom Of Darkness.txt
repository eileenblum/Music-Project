Darkest are the forgotten valley's where
Ancient forms gather amid the swirling winds...
Their presence felt only within the coldest depths
of the soul, plagued with fearful belief...
The moon casts an eerie glow revealing the vast
desolation where a mighty kingdom once ruled in darkness...
Tragedy has befallen these spirits
Revealed is the truth, all is forever lost
Weary eyes that search the dark side
Sigh of infinite sorrow shattered by the wind
