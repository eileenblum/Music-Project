Once again, this odious sunlight falls upon my face
As I awaken to the sun's uncaring glance
Must I suffer through this endless procession
of bleakest hours
Sinking deeper beneath the weight of depression
Faces loom just beyond my vision
Empty eyes full of contempt and fear
Is this dream or reality
Behind the facade of alienation
A scream lingers - reflections too surreal
I cannot fathom their pathetic, meaningless lives
In the cold grasp of insanity
powerless to cry out
Damned to exist in desolation and misery
I curse the sunrise...
