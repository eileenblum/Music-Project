Far within,when shall they return again?
Above the whore,to outshine every brilliant ray.
O see the face of disbelief.
O see the face of hatred.
Within it open into another world at length he who torments with a hollow groan

Each outcry does cease to sing
Each outcry wounded in the wing.
Each outcry I wander from here to there.
Each outcry I frown upon the eyes that stare...
