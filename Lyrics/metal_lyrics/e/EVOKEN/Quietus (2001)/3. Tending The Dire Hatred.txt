Feelings of horror and fear unable to distinguish what I see before me...
Uncompromising is it's aura, thick bands of fog and downpours of hail disturb.
Myself and I cannot deny this anymore.
Hatred is poured all over me [repeat]
and now, I must reciprocate this emotion for life is to suffer and death belongs to you...
