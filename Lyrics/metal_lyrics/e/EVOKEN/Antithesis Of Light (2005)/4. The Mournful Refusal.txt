Alone, rational thoughts submerged by the fear
Dark, only faint visions of the cruelty appear
In sporadic tone, the composition of beauty
Turned grim and cold...

Once again, I must face the horrors of regret
Antiquity arrives before it is welcomed
Only to leave behind an empty shell of delirium.

Waiting only prolong the wanting
Living only prolongs the arriving
Death knows no regret of a mournful refusal

In sporadic tone, the composition of beauty
Turned grim and cold...
