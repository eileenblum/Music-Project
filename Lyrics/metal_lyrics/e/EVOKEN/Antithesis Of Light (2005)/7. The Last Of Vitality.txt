I watched
From mountains of spirit
Where gods claim the universe.
I watched
As life lingered
In sordid desperation.
My hidden, true form
Became a mask of solitude
A prodigal reflection
Of human depreciation
Utter isolation approaching nirvana
Beckoning me to my womb...
Back to the earth
The end arrives peacefully
With silent finality
So swift, across eons
Not even legends remained.
Streams of pain descend
Like purifying waters
In this hideous bliss
I taste the last of vitality.
