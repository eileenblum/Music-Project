White noise
Then darkness
The awful darkness...
Rites of burial are spoken
Before the last descent
Down... beneath the realm of the living.
Deadened eyes
Extinguished dreams
Muffled sounds
As the coffin's lid
Is slowly nailed shut.
White noise
Then darkness
The burden of existence
Lifted
Free from this dreadful GIFT... Life
The long sleep of withering upon you at last....
