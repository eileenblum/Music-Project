Stone pillars crumble at the feet of iconoclasts
Accursed omen of the coming extinction
Dust billows above, blotting out the last arcs of
sunlight
Shadows negate all; windswept death descends.

A thousand nights of plagued slumber to come
That we may transcend all pain
Into the darkest depth of unreality
The great destruction lies in wait
Visions have prophesized
What shall stir from he burning rubble.

The eons beyond sleep in darkness visible...

Those who scorned the eyes of sacrosanct
Afflicted with eternal tribulation and raging pestilence
Feel death approaching
Already devouring their very will
As the fall before the sound of dying knell
Oh, what great beast shall stir from the rubble?

The eons beyond sleep in darkness visible...
