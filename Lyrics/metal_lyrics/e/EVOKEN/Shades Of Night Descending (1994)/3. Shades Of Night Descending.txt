"There was no life , no light... A brooding night enveloped all...
Over which darkness and silence reigned supreme"

Gaze into the astral depths
The advent of endlessness
The ill-fated winds of sinister praise
like echoed shrieks as darkness reigns...

Blackened hail shall fall upon the shores of Lethe
As the pitiless winter begins its unending season

Amid the sunless tombs
Tragic symphony of mourning
Abysmal depths have risen
Season of nocturnal reign
