Runic blade of crystal skies
Arise the winter of blackest frost
Through the northwinds mournful chant
In frozen mists and dying light

Abyssic darkness descends on funeral wings....

Ancient towers rise before me
Like blades in the midwinter's sky
I kneel before the gates of black
In the etherial fire of dying sunsets

Within the blackest valleys
In Etah's silent grace
frozen moon , cursed lands
Visions of eternal winter

A vision of dark ages yet to come..... 

Diabolical winterwinds
A spectral dance of beauty and frost
My journey to the Northlands
A return to evil ways
