Eternity has no bottom
It is the breath of a dying sun
Exhaling its icy last gasp
Above the pillars of the dark corruption.
Hanging low in the vast nothingness,
Symbol of destiny - mirror of the ages
Eternity is an illusion
Burning quickly away into molecular shadow
There is no measure of it; it's depth in endless
It is in the eyes of all who see.
Elusive, the antithesis of light devours life
And eventually, eternity shall endure
When all else has fallen to myth;
And no dream is left to believe.
Eternity is dust - a churning sea of pale dementia
Burying, reaping beneath the ashen shroud of heaven.
Desolate father of all time
Awaits the final breath... and stands a lonely vigil
To greet you in the inevitable darkness once again.
