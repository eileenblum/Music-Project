I watched...
From mountains of spirit,
Where gods claim the universe.
I watched...
As life lingered in sordid desperation.
My hidden, true form
Became a mask of solitude
A prodigal reflection
Of human depreciation
Utter isolation approaching nirvana.
Beckoning me to my womb...
Back to the earth
The end arrives peacefully - with silent finality
So swift, across cons
Not even legend remained.
Streams of pain descend
Like purifying waters
In this hideous bliss - I taste the last of vitality
