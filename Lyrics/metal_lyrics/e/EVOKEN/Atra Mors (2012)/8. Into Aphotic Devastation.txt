A soundless realm, an unforgiving place where time seems endless.
Its creation concealed; its myth an unparalleled wonder.
Light cannot escape the sole purpose of ultimate obliteration.
Bending, swirling; a senseless storm which has no rival.
Shown as the bereavement of gods, the foundation of matter shall crack.
Worlds shall never go unscathed within its fabric of unrelenting punishment.

Mankind's burden to bear within the age to bring hell upon heaven

Anthology of the coiled reality, damned to inherit the blessed.
It is not the sick verse of immortality, but the conflict of belief.
