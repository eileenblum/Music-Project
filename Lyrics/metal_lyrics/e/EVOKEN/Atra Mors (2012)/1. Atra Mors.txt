I have come; the dominant one
Virulent, I am the influence unnoticed
Antiquity is my strenght; I shall cast upon the world my solitary message.
I will diminish those centuries and persecute those with quiet desperation...

They shall call me the "Great Morality"; a stain upon time.
Lugubrious, unforgiving; a terribleness that I bare for all age.
The crossing shall cease by only the shadows of my completed undertaking.
They will die both day and by night with the air still, the trenches deep.

I will unlock the mysteries of this universe, not within the heated stars, but below
the consecrated churchyards, cold in misery and disdain.
For it is not the singing of angels that beckon, but the feral groans of death...
