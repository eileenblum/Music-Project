Lessened in degree, upheavals will be anointed.
Final persecution at the very hour,
the cowardess invited to be claimed by death.
Bent and laid waste to the roots of ancient trees...

Their faces twisted, imprisoned and exiled by the principalities of fear.
While they endure the undone, the crimson seas, the heretics of grim eloquence.

The famine which is felt becomes universal.
For one to be spared, trustfulness will betray the world.
In the quiet of the hollow mountain,
uncontrolled anger will tear apart the consequence of dread.

Separated from judgement, your odyssey of failure will return...
