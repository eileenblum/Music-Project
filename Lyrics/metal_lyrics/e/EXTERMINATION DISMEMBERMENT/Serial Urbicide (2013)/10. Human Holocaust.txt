We'll ruin their bloody cenotaphs
Annihilate that dirty tumor
The smell is attracting vultures
So let them tire

Turn our arms into the
Deadliest gear of human tearing
Serenity impaler
Sets passage to fear

It's here, it's a venom
It's virulent and fierce

See to believe
In eternally blustering cataclysm
It's here to rip, it's here to kill
Relentless, merciless chaos

See to believe
In the torment of the innocent
In the human cries chanting their demise
And it's never turning back its fury

It's a severity brought to the limit
It's turning into hominid curse
It's turning ultimate, supremacy
It's turning into satrapic manslaughter

Acid, pouring acid
Shall replace the water
Deadly gases shall replace the air
Rancid bodies shall replace the ground
Under your feet

Bow to the rupture
Return to the primitive
Put to the slaughter
Any who dares to breathe

Bow to the rupture
Return to the primitive
Put to the slaughter
Any who dares to rebel

Put it to the carnage!

Insanity for eternity
For infernal remedy
Death!
Let them feel the wrath
Let them feel the pain
Let them see us entertained
By perfection of the game

For term of life forced to bleed
Throughout the life degrading
Feverishly chasing nothing
To end the path eviscerated

Run for your life
Don't look back. Ever,
For this is no war!

Nowhere to hide
All shall suffer
This is a slaughter!

Eradication!
No more society!
Annihilation!
We have one direction!

Obliteration!
No more authority!
For now your filthy world will burn!
