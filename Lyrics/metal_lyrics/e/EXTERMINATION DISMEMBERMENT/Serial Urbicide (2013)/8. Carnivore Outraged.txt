Retarded, all covered with blood
Returning with rage inside
Monsters worthy of tyrants
That turned him into the terror he is

He is more powerful than ever before
Nourished by their greed

The heartrending groans of the dying
Chant coming of the ravager
The terror is intensifying
The end is only a matter of time

There is no salvation
Everyone will perish once he
Enters your purulent world
Death will triumph

Sin!

The heartrending groans of the dying
Chant coming of the ravager
The terror is intensifying
The end is only a matter of time
