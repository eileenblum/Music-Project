I turn an injury into tumidity
I turn that moisture into pus
I turn a human into grunting entity
I turn life into torture

I tremble in foretaste of consumption
Of the soft tissues and bone marrow
Lungs are torn by my poisonous mandibles
Rest of oxygen is melting the throat

Guts are melding
Into pulsing liquid manure
Spewing liters of music
And swarming larvae clots
Convulsions are shaking the whole body
It's turning into suppurative soup

Eyes slowly start to swell
Filled with spawning insects
Ichor oozing congealing
In turbid crust

Inside the bloodshot gullet
I tear it out,
Tear this meat out from the insides
Impregnated, saturated with putridity

Inside the bloodshot gullet
I live to eat to breed
This is my territory
This is my newfound hive

Here I will secrete sorely
My maggots that shall
Complete my business here

Overwhelming frenzy blinds my eyes
While I start to grow
I gnaw my way outside
Becoming a beast, battling no more
