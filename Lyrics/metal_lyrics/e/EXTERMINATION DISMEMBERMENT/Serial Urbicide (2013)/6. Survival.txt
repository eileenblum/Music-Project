Destroyed by a deadly virus
People decompose and feed the flies
Blood and flesh clotted on the sun
Mass cannibalism and loss of mind

Survivors turned into undead
Wandering in a lifeless desert
Somewhere far there are explosions
Unbearable heat kills all the emotions

My hunger is now my obsession
I have become an abomination

Survival!
While tearing the skin from the face
Survival!
I want blood!
