Total desolation
Ruthless ruination
This is retribution
I am extermination

Welcome to the world of madness
Of devastating pain
Prepare for major suffering
You're nothing but a shame

Feed the increasing terror
Feel the severity of your disease

Abandoned by its bearer
You sun is gone forever
Flooded with blood
Of your relatives

Now you are going to learn
The attraction of pain
This is where you should start
Complain of destiny
You worm!

I am your wicked nightmare
And you shall say your prayers
Behold the bottom of the stairs
Unleash the fear
Disgrace!

You worm!

Filthy slug is born to suffer
Denying its significance
Redemption is not an option
There is no escape

And so you kneel
