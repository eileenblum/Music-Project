Death!
We start annihilation of the human race
No one will stay alive to breed
And everything and everyone
Will drown in rot

Parts of human entrails
Lie mangled and distorted
Worms about to feast
Like never before

Refugees are torn
Blind boars eat that substance
They keep vomiting maggots
That consume what's left of humans

Still living welter in fel
Choking with their own stomach acid

Skinned bodies scattered half-eaten
Being squashed by invaders' legs
Destruction inestimable
Nothing can stop this bloodbath

War!
Torture the mankind
Don't let them retreat
Their anxiety turns into panic and tenuity

Inability to fight, obscurity
Cornered, the only way
Is to commit suicide
