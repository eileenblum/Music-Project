Raze everything that stands!
Infected earth
Shall bring the cure to their dying kind
The marching tonnes of hate!

Rotting, gorging sweaty meat
Crawling to its victim in insanity
Retarded, deceptive sluggishness
Specious immobility
Slowly accelerating
In direction of the putrid sore

They dare to believe
Let the messenger fall!
There is no more dignity
Crying for mercy
They watch their towers fall

Buried under corpses
Meat and stones are all that's left
