[Music by Enchantya]
[Lyrics by Rute Fevereiro]

The pounding of a heart is a disharmonic beat to a killerâs mind
We meet all the other in limit life experiences
Hoping that it could fight something that we could never find
Hoping that it could give something that we could never find

Hoping for a change on life
Eager for the hope inside

I have many unspoken words
My mouth is dry and full of sand
Who can I blame? No one is left
To listen to my screams!

I have many unlistened sounds
They put me deaf or even blind
Who can I call? No one is back
To listen to my screams!

The pounding of a heart is a disharmonic beat to a killerâs mind
Widow burning with desire

Moonlighting the living
Moonlighting the dreamer
I had a place in my heart
Something fulfilled it
Apart from the lies
Was it your light?
Moonlighting the living
Moonlighting the dreamer
