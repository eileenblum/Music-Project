[Music by Enchantya]
[Lyrics by Rute Fevereiro]

The rain is so heavy in the dawn
It beats on my window so fast
That I cannot sleep!

(Night in whisper)

Is it your voice that I hear in the wind?
Is it a whisper that keeps me asleep?
The sound of your voice echoes in me
This is a feeling that I cannot leave!

All the power contained in your rage
Whisper in the night
Call for my name!
All the anger lost in your pain
Whisper in the night
Call for my name!

A dream would never give me an illusion
As I know reality blooms
It blooms in my mind, my mind
In the silence of the night
Would you listen to the beat of my heart?

The rain is so heavy in the dawn
It beats on my window so fast
That I cannot sleep!

I sleep in the wings of the night
I am the angel that never cries

Is it your voice that I hear in the wind?
Is it a whisper that keeps me asleep?
The sound of your voice echoes in me
This is a feeling that I cannot leave!
