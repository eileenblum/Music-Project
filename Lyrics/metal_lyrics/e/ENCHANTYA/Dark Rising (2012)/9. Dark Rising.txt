[Music by Enchantya]
[Lyrics by Rute Fevereiro]

Alone with my thought
All I hear is your wished and your words
Your love filled me, despite youâre gone
Iâll never forget you!

I feel that my world is coming down
I feel thereâs no hope to hold on

Now that your time has come
I must feel strong for you
Gratitude for the life we had
No more tears for you

In the deepest sea
This feels like a dream in a bluest whirl
The silence is my best friend
Moments with you, with my memories

Now that your time has come
I must feel strong for you
Gratitude for the life we had
No more tears for you
Precious moments I hold so dear
I wish to be with you

âNo ore hopeâ said despair
An easy decision this to forget
Will I be strong, stand this forever?
Face this for now or outcome my faith

My mother!
