[Music by Enchantya]
[Lyrics by Rute Fevereiro]

Iâm your tattoo, darling
Iâm a razor in your soul
You donât sleep
You donât eat
You donât dream

Some years have passed by
Since I left you, darling
When you tried to beat me
Kill me, hurt my child
Made me feel like a crap
But I left you and thatâs final

You wish my warm kiss once again
Loving you no more
Your skin touching mine now that Iâm gone
Youâre feeling guilty
Say goodbye!

You can send your lawyer with your stupid threats
Take me down, down to court
And you can call me everyday
But itâll never be the same

Iâm your tattoo
Darling, Iâm a mark in your heart
You donât love
Donât even work
While you think of me
