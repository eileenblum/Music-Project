[Music by Enchantya]
[Lyrics by Emanuel Henriques]

Iâve roamed astray for too long
Silent confinement to hollow walls
Lucidity brought me down and deep
Just hoping for a darker corner to sleep

Innocence brought me down into this world

Only you can set me free from myself
From my pain, from my inner me
Only you can set me free
Bring me home, take my hand

A glimpse of love revives my soul
A ray of light ripping the dark apart
Clad in black, wrapped in fear
I feel this primal call

Home in your arms
Womb of love
Heal this wrecked soul

Iâve roamed astray for too long
