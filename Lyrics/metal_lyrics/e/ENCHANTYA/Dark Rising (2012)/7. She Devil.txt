[Music by Enchantya]
[Lyrics by Rute Fevereiro]

She is the devil
Black moon of your heart
She will take you
And then tear you apart

Mistress, Enchantya
My luck born as woman
Chained to mankind
Struggle for equality
Break the laws to survive

I am the widow
Whose eyes shall not cry
I am the virgin
For luxuryâs demise
Those are my words
My wound, my sacrifice
Those are the words of my demise

She is devil
She stands for what she is
To nobodyâs will
Sheâs a rebel
And will always be strong
For her soulâs in eternal bliss

I bring the war of the wars in your head
I will show you forever who is the she devil
