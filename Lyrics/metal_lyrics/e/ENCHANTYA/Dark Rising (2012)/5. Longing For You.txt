[Music by Enchantya]
[Lyrics by Rute Fevereiro]

Sometimes, in the night I wake up with tears
Waiting for you with my memories
No physical bounds, no wounds and no fears
Iâm still here waiting to find you in me

Longing for the spring
That never comes in the winter
Longing for the memories that I could never had

Longing, longing, longing for you

Longing âcause Iâm longing, longing for you
I can almost see you dancing in the rain
Away with me
I can almost feel you dancing away
Away with me
Longing âcause Iâm longing, longing for you
Longing

Sometimes, in the night I wake up with tears
Waiting for you with my memories
