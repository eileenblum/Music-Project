[Music by Enchantya]
[Lyrics by Rute Fevereiro]

Canât change the feelings inside of me
Iâve tried to tell you always with my eyes
But the sea, the distance is what brings me here
Alone I am in a night with no stars

If only love was here
In your arms...

Thereâre no stars in the sly
Love in me cannot be

If only love was here
In your arms I could breather
You canât erase the feelings that grows inside of me
I have tried to let you go always on my mind

Thereâre no stars in the sly
Love in me will then be
