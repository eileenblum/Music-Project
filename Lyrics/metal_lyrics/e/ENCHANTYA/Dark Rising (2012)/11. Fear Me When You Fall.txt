[Music by Enchantya]
[Lyrics by Rute Fevereiro]

All the time that passed me by
Didnât heal the pain and all the sorrow
Fed the hatred in me

Fear me when you fall

Now Iâm all alone
Feeling eternity with all my tears
So fear me when you fall

A crowded place hungry for my blood
Testify my glory, see what Iâve become

Fear me when you fall
Fear me when you fall
