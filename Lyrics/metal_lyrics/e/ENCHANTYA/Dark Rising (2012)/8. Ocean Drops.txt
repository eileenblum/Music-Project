[Music by Enchantya]
[Lyrics by Rute Fevereiro]

An illusion in the eyes of an angel
My tears drop in my lap tonight

Iâve never wanted to reach the other side of the ocean
The mere reflex of my dreams will follow emotions

In my heart
In my heart

As the ocean drops all my tears
On the other side of the sea
I will be, you will be
Youâll never see!

And the ocean drops

Tonight the stars in the sky
They are light to me eyes
Tomorrow life will always be
As the ocean drops my tears

Star in my heaven
You know what I feel
Stay with me
Stay with me

In a long time ago
You were there!

Tonight!
