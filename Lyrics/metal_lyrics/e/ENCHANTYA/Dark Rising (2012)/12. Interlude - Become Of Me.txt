[Music by Enchantya]
[Lyrics by Rute Fevereiro]

She cast the spell once
Lightning the candles
For the healing, for love
The incantation was done
She made sure it was right
When she did her spell
Orange, pink and white candles
Where there to bless

Please angel, think again
Heal my pain
Please angel, grant my wish
Everyday
Please angel, think again
Iâm so lonely without you
Think again

The waning moonlight
Became light of the day
Golden chant easing the sun

When you become of me
Mote it!
Please angel, think again
Heal my pain
Please angel, grant my wish
Everyday
Please angel, think again
Iâm so lonely without you
Think again

Please angel, think again
Angel âI will heal your painâ
Please, grant my wish
Angel âI will bring the rainâ
Angel
Angel
Angel âYour wish will be grantedâ
