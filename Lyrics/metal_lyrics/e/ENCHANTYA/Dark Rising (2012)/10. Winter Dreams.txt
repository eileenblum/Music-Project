[Music by Luis âVladâ Fernandes]
[Lyrics by Rute Fevereiro]

Standing in the corner of my emotions
So many were the tears I shed for you

Living for the music
Living through this song

The winter will always be in you
Take me to your reality
The winter will always be in you and me
Take me with you

Unborn souls never meant to stay together
Rarity in your eyes
I wish Iâd never die

Come take my hand
I will show you the spring

Take me with you
