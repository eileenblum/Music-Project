Disturbing silence surrounding me, embracing me
I cannot fall asleep tonight

The puls is rising, tension's growing
It's hot but I'm shivering
This night is hell for me

This goddamn silence awakes me and feeds me
I cannot sink in sleep tonight

The visions coming, they're getting clear
There's something closing
It's growning in my chest, pulsing in my veins

I cannot sleep but I still feel
I want to sleep but I still see
I put the pillow on my face
All I want is my final rest

I cannot sleep but I still feel
I want to sleep but I still see
I put the pillow on my face
All I want is my final rest
