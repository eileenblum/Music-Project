When I saw it unexpected and unconquered
This was it, familiar place
Lost in me, then there found
Feeling naked, newborn, getting ready
End of dream definetelly
Getting out of that suppresion and fear

And I'm coming there for more
I'm coming to take it all
I am marching with eyes wide open
I'm coming to take control

When I saw this place, it was lost and abandoned
Not just the horrid vision
Seems to me there's something I should ever want
Nothing's there and no ones listen

Suddenly there's something moving in that depth
I can fell someones presence
Expecting me, waiting for me to come
So here I am - I speak, they listen

And I'm coming there for more
I'm coming to take it all
I am marching with eyes wide open
I'm coming to take control
And I'm coming back for more
I'm coming to take it all
I am marching with eyes wide open
I'm coming to take control
