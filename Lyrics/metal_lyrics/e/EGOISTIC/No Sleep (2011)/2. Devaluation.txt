I saw you, you saw me
That moment was so obvious
I sold you, you sold me
Transaction - just keep the change

Devaluation of my life and what I've done
Once and twice and every time
A brand new reason need to be found

Suppression, collision - state of decomposition
My mind price, body's value, soul's colour
I saw you, you saw me
That moment was so precious
I called you, you called me
So different but we've the same name

What you've said was relevant
Keeps my open motion
That transaction we have done
What you preach I will follow

And doesn't matter where are you now
It's only presence of a different kind
The burning thoughts erupting in silence
Devaluation of my life

I saw you, you saw me
That moment was so precious
I called you, you called me
So different but we've the same name

Devaluation of my life and what I've done
Once and twice and every time
A brand new reason need to be found
