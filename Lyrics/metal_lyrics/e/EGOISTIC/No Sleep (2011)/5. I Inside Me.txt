What I see not can only see
Reflecting nothing to touch, nothing to hear
So narrow I'm trapped within myself
Respecting only the powers I can create

I am the mirror, I am the stone, I am the purest chord
I am imprisoned on my poky world
Here I am the soil
Reflection, resuscitation
Self-slave is the act of self-reason

I'm speechless, appreciating my time
Respectful I have no boundaries of any kind
What I see when the others see not
Your damned world is out of my sight

I am the mirror, I am the stone, I am the purest chord
I am imprisoned on my poky world
Here I am the soil
Reflection, resuscitation
Self-slave is the act of self-reason

I am inside me
But outside there's no one left
When I feel I'm safe here
Everything except me is dead
I am inside me
But outside there's no one left
When I feel I'm safe here
Everything except me is dead

What's inside, who's locked within
So senseless, no one's alive, no one to kill
I'm captured - my body is a trap
Inside it there is a failure it's so unreal

I am the mirror, I am the stone, I am the purest chord
I am imprisoned on my poky world
Here I am the soil
Reflection, resuscitation
Self-slave is the act of self-reason
I am inside me
But outside there's no one left
When I feel I'm safe here
Everything except me is dead
