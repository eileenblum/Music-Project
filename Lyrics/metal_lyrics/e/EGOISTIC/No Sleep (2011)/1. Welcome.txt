Indifference, hesitation, embarrassing me before myself
From wall to wall I walk constantly
You have come and you've crashed what I have build before
I'm all yours, now I surrender

Your mistake and my guilt - no common sense, just disappointment
Your denial - my acceptation
What is wrong, what is false, what's to be done
I forgive you everything

All the past and all what have last
What remains now have no sense
Now you're here and I'm too
I spread my arms and welcome you

I spread my arms and welcome you
What I've expected all the time has never become true
I'm sure it was the last in my entire life - welcome
I spread my arms and welcome you
What I've expected all the time has never become true
I'm sure it was the last in my entire life - welcome

Impatience, irritation keep my doubts on and on
And if you'll talk I will listen
Will it right? Will it good? I'll never know
I will ask no more question

All the past and all what have last
What remains now have no sense
Now you're here and I'm too
I spread my arms and welcome you
