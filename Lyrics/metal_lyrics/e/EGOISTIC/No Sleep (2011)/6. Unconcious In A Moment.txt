There's something growing in my mind before I wake
My eyes are open but I feel the presence of that state
The biggest plan I just have done and everything I become
I'm fading without a trace with this new-coming-dawn

Unconscious in this moment
I see world bigger than he appears
I rise then fall
The dreaming on and on
How did it come to this
Unconscious in this moment
I see world bigger than he appears
I rise then fall
The dreaming on and on
How did it come to this

There's something calling me from the world I don't belong
I've started something here but there are always things undone
The decision is made but I didn't take a part
I'm fading without a trace in this claustrophobic world

Unconscious in this moment
I see world bigger than he appears
I rise then fall
The dreaming on and on
How did it come to this
Unconscious in this moment
I see world bigger than he appears
I rise then fall
The dreaming on and on
How did it come to this
