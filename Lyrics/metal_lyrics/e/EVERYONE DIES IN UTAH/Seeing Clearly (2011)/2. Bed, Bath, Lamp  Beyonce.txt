This is your world, you will remember this day.
Feel the repercussions of running away.

This is my war; this is my hope in all I am.
This is my battle, my witness to my heart.
I'll tear it out and give this all I've got.

You've weighed your options and it's time to act now.
I won't let this go.
Open your eyes to a world that's real.
Shed some light into this darkened world.

My world, my love why do you torment me,
To give up and give in to all you are?
I like the man I am, but I despise the fool I've been.
Can you help me out?
I'm ready for a change, I wont back down.

This is my war; this is my hope in all I am.
This is my battle, my witness to my heart.
I'll tear it out and give this all I've got.
