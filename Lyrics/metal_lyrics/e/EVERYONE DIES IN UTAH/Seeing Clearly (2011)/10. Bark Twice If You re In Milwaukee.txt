I kinda got a secret that could bring you down,
that could tear you down from the throne you sit on high
And you can try to shut me down try to bring me down but
I just won't die. No, I won't die.

This is what it takes
For you to change

Cover up your eyes before the sands of time
Begin to fall
And shows us how these times turn us all into the men we are,
This is how we'll end
Don't you dare turn your back on me

This is the end
of the beginning
You will learn that I am to be feared
You will learn

I'll be there on the day you fall
I'll watch your face hit the ground as the weight of this world crushes you
This is what it takes
for you to change
