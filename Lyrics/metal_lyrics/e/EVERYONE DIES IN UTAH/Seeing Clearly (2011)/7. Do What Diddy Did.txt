My time has come to overthrow you my conquerors, my demons
Rise above this, rise above this
Wake me up before it's too late
I'll become someone that you'll hate
Do you get the message

I'm thinking I could break this bond
I'm gonna shout it till there's nothing left to you
I'm thinking I could break this bond
I'm gonna scream till there's nothing left for you

(I don't want your simple life, you've gotta become something greater)

We're talking rise baby,
You'll feel it in your toes and even in your walls maybe
and every time you decide on an option you'll find
There's no single place to hide or reside
in the darkness of your mind
You've gotta give a little
You've gotta give a little more
You've gotta give a little
More than you did before
You can't accept your life as it is right now
You've gotta shake things up
Hey, lets shake things up

Be someone tonight
I see the truth in all your lies
I see the truth in all
