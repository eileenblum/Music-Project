Take the time to read through my cliche lines

Did I stutter when I said these second thoughts are killing my head
and I would like to say...
Am I making a mistake telling you the truth
My heart can't take the beating, is there something I'm not reading

Where do we go from here

I gotta get this picture out of your head
To make room for your regrets
Is it wrong to say...

I'll take all the blame for this
I'll fall
I'll take all the blame for this
I'll fall down
