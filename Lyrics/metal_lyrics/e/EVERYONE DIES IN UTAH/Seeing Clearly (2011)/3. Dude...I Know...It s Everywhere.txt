Count your blessings
Not your burdens
Count your blessings
Not your burdens
I'm alive, just for now

I know that I can't turn back the clock
Your holding the key and
I'm holding the lock
The past will never change
Standing still can't keep me safe
anymore...

What where am I?
Do I know you?
I've seen this before
And it don't look good
It don't look good
And then i see a light

I know your biggest secrets
I know your down falls
Cross paths with me
And I'll show you that's not all
I'm not among you
But I will never die

I know that I can't turn back the clock
Your holding the key and
I'm holding the lock
The past will never change
Standing still can't keep me safe
anymore...

I know your biggest secrets
I know your down falls
I know your biggest secrets

GAME OVER

I know your biggest secrets
I know your down falls

Lets play a game
We'll play it everyday
Lets play a game
We'll play it everyday
Your running from yourself
I'll stop you dead in your tracks
Your running from yourself
I'll stop you dead in your tracks
I'll stop you dead in your tracks
Your running
Your running, run from
Me
