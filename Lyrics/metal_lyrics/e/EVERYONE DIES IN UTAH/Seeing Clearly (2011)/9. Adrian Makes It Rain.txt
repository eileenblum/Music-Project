And I can feel you slowly fade away
Was this all just a false memory
Dreams will come
And dreams will go
But the memories are here to stay
And I can feel you slowly fade away

This is the day I learn to feel again
We've all been taught to let go
Show your strength
Hold on hold on

Can you see the change in me today

Resistance is useless
Don't turn your back on me now
We've gone to far to let it all end
To let it all end
Watch me rise
As you fall

Watch me reach the sky
Watching down with vengeful eyes
Resistance is useless
Watch me reach the sky
This doesn't end with ease
This doesn't end with ease

This is the day I learn to feel again
We've all been taught to let go
Show your strength
Hold on hold on

Resistance is useless
And I can not stray away
This burden is too much for me
To bury my ashes here
I will fight until the end
