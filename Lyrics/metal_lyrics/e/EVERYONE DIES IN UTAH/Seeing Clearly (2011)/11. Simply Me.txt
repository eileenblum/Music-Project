When does a boy become a man?
What qualifies his soul as being worthy?
His hands, his feet, his smile they determine his view.
But his mind, his thoughts, his actions define his worth.
My time has come to rise above your words, your painful words
and fall in love again with who I am. Iâm simply me.

I hope to God that Iâm someone to be proud of.
I strive not for perfection, but a loving heart.
When youâre told youâve changed youâve lost it all completely.
Are you deemed insaneâ¦ Cause you swear youâre hearts still the same.
My time has come to rise above your words, your painful words
and fall in love again with who I am. Iâm simply me.

This is my war; this is my hope in all I am.
This is my battle; my witness to my heart. Iâll tear it out and give this all Iâve got.
