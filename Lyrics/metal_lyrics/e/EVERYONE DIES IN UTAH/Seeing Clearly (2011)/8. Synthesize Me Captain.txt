Take one good look around
We shoot we shoot to kill
We aim we aim to please
Nothing is what it seems
We're like an open book
No one can ever read

Take us for who we are
Never for what we've done

Take one good look around
We shoot we shoot to kill
We aim we aim to please
Nothing is what it seems
We're like an open book
No one can ever read

Take us for who we are
Never for what we've done

This is our last reason
This time we spend
Sound fills the room
Our time begins

Lets break the barrier
Between whats real and not

Take one good look around
We shoot we shoot to kill
We aim we aim to please
Nothing is what it seems
We're like an open book
No one can ever read
