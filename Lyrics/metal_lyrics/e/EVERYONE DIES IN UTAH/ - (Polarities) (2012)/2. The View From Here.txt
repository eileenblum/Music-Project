Just what have you got yourself into
This world is not for the faint of heart

Define to me what true life can mean cause
Iâm looking, Iâm searching for answers
In this soul once known to be my own
Donât lie to me, you canât lie to me
Thereâs not a single beating heart in the world
That doesnât want to be screaming happy, so let them scream

Dig deep, and show them what youâre made of
Never give in, never give in until the end
The choices that you make from here on out
Will set the path of your futureâs route
Donât let them go to your head
âCause you know deep down in your heart
That this is where you were meant to be, where you were meant to be

Do you fear that doubt, do you feel those thoughts in your mind as they race right now
If I told you those were the nerves aimed to bring you down
Would you run, would you fight, would you battle with all your might tonight
I hope youâd break through to make new your heart

With life comes struggle
So many will get in your way
Keep looking forward and open up the doors

Define to me what true life can mean cause
Iâm looking, Iâm searching for answers
In this soul once known to be my own
Donât lie to me, you canât lie to me
Thereâs not a single beating heart in the world
That doesnât want to be screaming happy, so let them scream

I'm positive that if you just believe
Anything can be achieved
The world is what you make of it
It could be yours for the taking
Just hold true to yourself
