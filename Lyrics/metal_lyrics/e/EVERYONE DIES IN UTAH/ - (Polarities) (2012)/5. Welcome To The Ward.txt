These dark walls
They hide the truth
Iâm alone
Iâm alone inside this tomb
Perception of mentality
Itâs hard to tell
which mind is mine

Donât give your heart to the dark
You must strive to fight for your life
The struggle grows harder and I can no longer
Idly sit by on the sidelines
I wonât hand you to the dark
I will strive to fight for your life
The roomâs getting smaller and I can no longer
Let your mind murder your heart

I'm always
Pacing back and forth
I have walked for days
With everything around me
Have I lost my way
A certainty comes over me
Itâs hard to find
But Iâm out of my mind
My composure is
Nowhere to be found
And now I can barely breath

Donât give your heart to the dark
You must strive to fight for your life
The struggle grows harder and I can no longer
Idly sit by on the sidelines
I wonât hand you to the dark
I will strive to fight for your life
The roomâs getting smaller and I can no longer
Let your mind murder your heart

Time stands still
In this delirium
Itâs like the walls are closing in
Itâs like Iâm suffocating
These dark walls
They hide the truth
Is this real
âCause I think I lost it this time
If this is real, why canât I find my mind
