Do you remember that summer
I remember it just fine
With the top down, when we crossed the state line
You were kinda sad, and I was almost mad
The sun had run and the clouds begun to rain on our parade
But you werenât sad that long, you kept singing that song
And to this day I remember the way it, the way it went along

You are the only one who walks
Down the hardest roads
To prove that Iâm whatâs worth fighting for
Whatâs worth fighting for

Remember the time we went downtown
Went searching for drinks but I found the wedding gown
And just for fun you tried it on and I was simply knocked down
Gladly enough the world kept spinning
And madly in love my face kept grinning âcause I
I heard you singing that song
So in the middle of that store I simply sang along and it went

We took a stroll to your favorite park
The sky so dark, just look at
Look at all the stars, they
Could never shine bright as you, my darling babe

You are the only one who walks
Down the hardest roads
To prove that Iâm whatâs worth fighting for
Whatâs worth fighting for

And though I donât see
Why you love me, youâre still my only one
You are the one
