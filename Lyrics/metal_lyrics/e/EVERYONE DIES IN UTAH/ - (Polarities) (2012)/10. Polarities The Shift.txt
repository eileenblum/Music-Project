Who is there
Is there no one but me
I yell louder but
You still barely hear my screams
You stand there with your
Eyes wide shut to all thatâs good
Where do you see the light
You can only fix whatâs broken from the inside
When running away canât stop the pain
Where is your light

I got lost on the road on the way home
Couldnât find the way back to see your note
You donât know how much it hurts to know
To know I let you go
Heâs clouding all my vision to see
so I broke
Through the clouds, did to him what he did to me
And now heâs a coward as he walks with a face full of
Scars

You wonât be saved tonight
You wonât be spared your life
The decisionâs been made
Your wrongs have become my wrath
You wonât leave here alive
You wonât leave here alive

I got lost on the road on the way home
Couldnât find the way back to see your note
You donât know how much it hurts to know
To know I let you go
Heâs clouding all my vision to see
so I broke
Through the clouds, did to him what he did to me
And now heâs a coward as he walks with a face full of
Scars

Whatâs to stop me
From taking your life
I lost myself years ago
Look at what you've created
A monster disguised by hate
But I can change this fate
And emerge to purge the curse

Itâs over now, itâs over now
Weâve reached the end this time
