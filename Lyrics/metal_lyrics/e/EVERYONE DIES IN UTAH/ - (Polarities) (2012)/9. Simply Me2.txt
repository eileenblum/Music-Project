Itâs been a year since I wrote in this book
It seems much longer since I took a look
Inside my heart and found I wasnât pleased

You see, diary, I must confess
I havenât always tried to do my best when
It comes to forgiving, when it comes to forgiving my flaws

Rain falls and the Earth shakes
The sky tears apart
You gotta run away, you gotta run away now

Iâve got this terrible tremble in my hands and I canât believe Iâm not screaming
This is the end of the world but I hope I am dreaming
Thereâs so much left to do

Itâs been two years since Iâve had that nightmare
It seems much longer since Iâve been aware
Of the darkness pulling me away from the light

You see, diary, I must confide
When I fall short I just die inside
âCause I strive, I run, I fight for the goodness in life and thatâs just simply me

Rain falls and the Earth shakes
The sky tears apart
You gotta run away, you gotta run away now

Iâve got this terrible tremble in my hands and I canât believe Iâm not screaming
This is the end of the world but I hope I am dreaming
Thereâs so much left to do

Tears fall and my world shakes
My heart is torn apart
I gotta run away, I gotta run away now

Iâve got this terrible tremble in my hands and I canât believe Iâm not screaming
This is the end of the world and I know Iâm not dreaming
Yet I forgive you
