When you live in a world
Where there is no sun, you tend
To focus on the dark
But all you must do is look below you and find
I have the light

I am the man whose only job is to fuel the fire
That burns inside the core seen through your floor above my head
The gears will spin and the wheels theyâll turn
As long as I give my fire fuel to burn

When you live in a world
Where there is no sun you tend
To focus on the dark
But all you must do is look below you and find
I have the light

I never have a second just to simply fall asleep and I
Would do anything to live up on the topside
Though I can promise you that everything that you do see
I will protect it till the end of all that makes me
This is my life, but not by my choosing
This is my life, I will do what needs doing

The gears will spin and the wheels theyâll turn
As long as I give my fire fuel to burn

When you live in a world
Where there is no sun you tend
To focus on the dark
But all you must do is look below you and find
I have the light

But on the darkest day
The man of light can find himself astray
When your only means of life is kept alive
By one man, by one spark
And I'm nowhere to be found
To fuel the core of it all

When you live in a world
Where there is no sun you tend
To focus on the dark
But all you must do is look inside you and find
You are the light
