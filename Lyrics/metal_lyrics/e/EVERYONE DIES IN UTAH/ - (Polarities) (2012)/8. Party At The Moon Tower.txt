Donât bother trying to change mind
Iâve seen this far too many times

Iâve begun
A search for good across the human race
Because my doubts have grown about this place
If you can find someone that I maybe
Could be taught a thing or two, I might believe in you

About this place that I now have under my feet
On solid ground
As the world spins around

Well I should have known that time would come
Come to an end to everything I thought I knew from the things that Iâm learning
I canât hide in this darkness, live in this darkness no more
âCause Iâve seen the light in the darkest hearts of the world

If you lost your way
Iâm not keeping track
Iâve seen the changes in this world
And Iâm not going back

Show me a place that wonât give up right now on me
Iâm torn between the two
This is not the place I knew

I once had full faith in this place I called my home
This place is not my own
A world set in stone
Open up
those eyes
To see
The changes in
The light in me
Everyday is a struggle
To keep the dark
Away from me

Well I should have known that time would come
Come to an end to everything I thought I knew from the things that Iâm learning
I canât hide in this darkness, live in this darkness no more
âCause Iâve seen the light in the darkest hearts of the world
