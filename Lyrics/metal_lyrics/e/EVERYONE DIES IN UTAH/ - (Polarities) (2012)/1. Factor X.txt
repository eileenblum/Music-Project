Don't make a single sound
I can see all that you do
And where you run and hide
This is a black heart
A black soul
I can't control

I come from hell
I fear nothing and I fear no one
Your time on earth has come to its end
My darkness needs this release

When you took her I was unprepared, it wasn't fair
You snuck in and saw the opportunity waiting there
You found the darkness in your heart to hurt the beautiful
And I swear you'll pay

I can hear you
I can hear you in my own head
But I can't see you
I can't see you now
And I understand
And I want to but can't
Forgiveness always seemed like it was such an easy thing to give out
Not with the shadow-walker walking about

You said I'm not like the rest and I agree
Beg for your life 'cause soon you'll see
That I am the worstÂ 
I am the worst of all
What they say about me in your nightmare is true
You better say your prayers 'cause your life here is through

When you stole her I was unprepared
It wasn't fair
You snuck in and saw my little girl just standing there
You found the sickness in your heart to kill the wonderful
And I swear you'll pay

I can hear you
I can hear you in my own head
But I can't see you
I can't see you now
And I understand
And I want to, but can't
Forgiveness always seemed like it was such an easy thing to give out
Not with the shadow-walker walking about

No more games
The stage is set for the perfect red night
Oh, how her screams slowly faded away
Oh, the control
Oh, the control

I can hear you in my head
My head
I can hear you
I can hear you in my own head
But I can't see you
I can't see you now
And I understand
And I want to, but can't
Forgiveness always seemed like it was such an easy thing to give out
Not with the shadow-walker walking about

I can hear you
I can hear you in my own head
(Not with the shadow-walker walking about, oh)
I can hear you
I can hear you in my own head
And I understand
And I want to, but can't
Forgiveness always seemed like it was such an easy thing to give out
Not with the shadow-walker walking about
