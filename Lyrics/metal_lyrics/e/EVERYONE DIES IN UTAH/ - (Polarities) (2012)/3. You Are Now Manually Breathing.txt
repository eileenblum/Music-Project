I may walk slow but Iâll never walk backwards

Be honest with yourself
You never expected much from me
But how could I blame you
How could you have faith in me
I never had faith in myself
The times have changed
I wonât let this get in the way
No, not anymore
Itâs not the man I am

I may walk slowly but Iâll never walk backwards
Progress is not how much you know
Itâs how much of what youâve learned has changed you
Weâre all not the same

Everything that Iâve done to get to this point wonât be forgotten
From the debts that Iâve paid
And the scars that Iâve made
With my legacy laid
I will never die

What makes you think youâve already won
I donât go down so easily
Despite what you may think this might not end so peacefully
I'll take the hand that Iâve been dealt
And with everything that I've got, I'll persevere

I may walk slowly but Iâll never walk backwards
Progress is not how much you know
Itâs how much of what youâve learned has changed you
Weâre all not the same

Everything that Iâve done to get to this point wonât be forgotten
From the debts that Iâve paid
And the scars that Iâve made
With my legacy laid
I will never die

I'll strive forward
Until my dying breath
I'll never stop
Until I've reached the end
I may walk slow but Iâll never walk backwards
This is all I am

I may walk slowly but Iâll never walk backwards
Progress is not how much you know
Itâs how much of what youâve learned has changed you
Weâre all not the same

Everything that Iâve done to get to this point wonât be forgotten
From the debts that Iâve paid
And the scars that Iâve made
With my legacy laid
I will never die
