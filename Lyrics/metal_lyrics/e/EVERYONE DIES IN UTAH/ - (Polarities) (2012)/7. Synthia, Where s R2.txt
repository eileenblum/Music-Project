Everyday is better//Than the last//What do you have to//Show but a forgotten past//I'm on top of the world//Your words mean nothing to me//Everything that I have//Is no thanks to you//This won't hurt a//Bit, too much for you to handle//Everything that I've said was real//You are nothing//Insignificant//My friend, I told you I would overcome you//Defeat the painful words you said//And now I'm moving on, moving up//Persecution does not work with me//Just look where I'm at//I am stronger than that//I'm on top of the world//Your words mean nothing to me//Everything that I have//Is no thanks to you//My friend, I told you I would overcome you//Defeat the painful words you said//And now I'm moving on, moving up//Unlike you and those backstabbing friends//You belong at the bottom of the ocean with some weights around your heads//It's not my heart//But it's what you've chosen//And now again you're losing//Breathe in breathe out//Of everything that//You've done//The lies spill from your mouth//And pour from you tongue//What makes your better//What makes you think you're alive//I have seen who you are//You're nothing but a coward inside//Go and hide and run//Like the rest//While I go and live for myself//And I wanna remember you as//This, so selflessly loving//And I wanna remember this like//Then, when you cared for the others//This like//When you cared for us all//But you've lost your way//Just remember when you hear my name//I've already won
