Never in a thousand years
Did I ever think that i would hear
You wanna go on and live your own life
You wanna break free and be with out me

Life goes on
Life goes on
What made you think that it would be so hard?
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Goodbye

Never in a thousand years
Did I ever think that i would hear
(I share my empathy, cause i never really care)
You wanna go on and live your own life
You wanna break free and be with out me
(This love was false, it should have never gone this far)

Back away from me
Back away from me
I didn't need you before
What makes you think I do now
Well I don't

Never in a thousand years
Did I ever think that i would hear
(I share my empathy, cause i never really care)
You wanna go on and live your own life
You wanna break free and be with out me
(This love was false, it should have never gone this far)
