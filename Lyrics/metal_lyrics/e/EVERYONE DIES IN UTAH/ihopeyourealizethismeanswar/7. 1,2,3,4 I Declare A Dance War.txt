Do you hear the silence?
It's stronger than all your words

Stare right through me
(you think i care?)
But now the wind blew down the door
No grace could break the raging storm
(taking wrong when we go right)
But now the wind blew down the door
(everyone knows the truth)
no grace could break the raging storm
(will come out in a fight)

good intentions take a toll
to never bear whats on my soul
only the lasting breath I'll take
keep close your life's at stake

(Why cant the world spin around me?)

Don't run away
from the letdown of the everyday
don't run away

Is there no sleep?!
For the, light hearted soul
For the wicked
The dice will roll
Is there , no sleep
Is there
No, sleep
is there no, is there no
is there no
Sleep
