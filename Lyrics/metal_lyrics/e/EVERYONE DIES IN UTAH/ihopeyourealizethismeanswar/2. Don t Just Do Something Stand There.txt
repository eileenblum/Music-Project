Off with there heads

Breaking all silence
Screaming my heart out
Wish you were hear to see my up rise
Standing with my head high
Try to bring me down
I don't fall easy just wait and you'll see

I am stronger now than ever before
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I am stronger now than ever before
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

The silence of the day
The calming of the night
Helps to ease the pain
That's flowing through my veins
The silence of the day
The calming of the night
Helps to ease the pain
That's flowing through my veins

I won't go down
Without a fight
I refuse to be brought down by you
I won't go down
Without a fight!
