Pushed up against the wall for the last time
I won't live in fear 'cause I know the end is near
Come on, come on!

Where is my salvation?
I'm losing hope
This generation has lost its way
To the slippery slopes of no return

Snowing up is when we're taught to hate
So can we love again

So sick and fed up with the way we live our lives
We let the tyrants come rule over our minds
No more
No more
Tonight we stand our ground
No more
No more
Tonight we stand

Wake up
This world is gone
Take time to realize
Your actions shape this world

If only you can see the things that I have seen
Then you wouldn't think that I was crazy
You'd know that I'm insane

Come on, come on!

Do I have to go insane just for you to learn?
But until the pain this was all just a game
I've had enough
See through the scars
Work to rebuild
To break what we create

So sick and fed up with the way we live our lives
We let the tyrants come rule over our minds
No more
No more
Tonight we stand our ground
No more
No more
Tonight we stand

No more
No more
Tonight we stand our ground
No more
No more
Tonight we stand
