Time flies and it won't slow down
Well, my dreams, they lead me town to town
Never know where I am to be found
But I know just who I am today
My message will forever stay

Be who you are

We can search,
We can search for years to find ourselves
Take a step back, reevaluate yourself
Don't hold your breath

'Cause I'm gonna take my time
And live my life
'Cause I'm gonna take my time
And live my life

Afraid of never having stories
And letting life pass me by
I took my chance to say goodbye
And I left it all behind

Too much to lose
So much to gain
Too much to lose
So much to gain

Don't close your eyes
Don't miss your chance
Make the moments count
You'll miss your chance
Don't live in doubt
You've wondered long enough
And it's time to see
What you are to become
So show the world

To find yourself
To find yourself
Define yourself
To find yourself
To find yourself
Don't hold your breath

We can search,
We can search for years to find ourselves
Take a step back, reevaluate yourself
Don't hold your breath

'Cause I'm gonna take my time
And live my life
'Cause I'm gonna take my time
And live my life
