Time and time
And time again
I let you get inside my head
But you're not sinking in
No not sinking in
Picking up the pieces
I'm trying to hold on tight
I don't know where I'm going
Or where I've gone
For far too long I've lived
Underneath the shadows
And it's time to live again
No more living in lies
And I will love my enemies
Time will leave them hollow
I have chosen the broken path
In hopes for better days
Better days
We can seek
But we will not find
Stay on the path
See nothing more
Stray from the path
Expand your existence
Time will leave them hollow
