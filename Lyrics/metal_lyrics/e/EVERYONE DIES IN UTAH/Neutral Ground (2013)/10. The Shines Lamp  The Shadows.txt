Nothing is as it seems
Cause life on earth
Is a constant dreams
And
Every nightmare has an end
But where one stops one will begin
You said you're better left unknown
With no place to call your home
You'll look somewhere for comfort
But tonight you'll be alone
And I can say it'll be alright
And I can say it'll be okay
But don't believe my words
Believe my words
This is just a game
Of cat and mouse
The weak are prey
The strong will stay
Obliterations
Lies spread like diseases
It tore this world to pieces
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
I've watched this place die to trust
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
I've watched this world die to trust
We've seen the grasses on the other side
And burned the fields to mask the truth
That the weak are prey
And the strong will stay
No one knows if this will be forever
It's been some time
Since I've seen some light
So onto our next endeavors
You want a new beginning
You want a new another start
We'll never a happy ending
Cause there's never been a darker heart
You think you've seen it all
You haven't seen a thing
So many questions left unanswered
So now you'll answer to me
