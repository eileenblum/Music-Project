Have you ever held in your hand,
a big bottle of pills to take?
Thinking that the only answer,
was to never again come awake?

Fighting â holding on to make it one more day
Weakness â Am I strong enough not to give in

The blade slips and cuts the skin
dark emotions entrap the tear
needing a way to heal the pain
take a breath and cut a vein.

Have you ever been to the edge
but did not let death take your soul?
Did you stop the very last minute,
Come to your senses take control?

Fighting â Holding on to make it one more day
Weakness â Am I strong enough to fight the pain?

The blade slips and cuts the skin
dark emotions entrap the fear
needing a way to heal the pain
take a breath and cut a vein.

When hearts shatter they lay in ruin
Lay crumbled in pieces so small.
Time can stand still in the darkness,
Nothing seems to matter at all.
