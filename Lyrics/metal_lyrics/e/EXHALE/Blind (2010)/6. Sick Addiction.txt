Do you feel the rope getting tight around you neck?
Do you the feel panic when the veins are getting small?
Quiet! Quiet! Someone screams you can head but not see, it canât be a
dream or reality

Where are you? The symbiosis was made for this

Nothing could stop it or tear it a part,
Except for the unforgiving betrayal â now youâre marked
Trying to find, to locate, trying to be all awake.

Now youâre marked, itâs time to take the punishment and get sliced apart.
You knew all along what you did a sick symbiosis where the weak bleed.
You where the master of abuse, now itâs time to pay-back and reduce â
Your sick addiction! Your sick addiction!

Trying to find, to locate, trying to be all awake.
The smell is strong, hanging in a rope around the neck upside down.
Did you know? Did you feel? That something like this was going on?

Now youâre marked, itâs time to take the punishment and get sliced apart.
You knew all along what you did a sick symbiosis where the weak bleed.
Your sick addiction! Your sick addiction!

All I want is you to die hate is what I feel.

Stolen pride, never to heal again, always reminding â the scars on the body.
Trying to rust â without satisfaction, talk without a tongue.

HATE
HATE
HATE

Turning away â inside is the answer â can I go on, was it my fault?
