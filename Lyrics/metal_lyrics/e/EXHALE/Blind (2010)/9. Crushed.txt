Anger, pent-up, waiting to explode
Deceit, Infantile, wait till I unload.

Crushed, I feel myself fall, deeper into oblivion.
Electrified by angry words blood drips from your two edged tongue.

Past and present collide, beneath stained hearts I hide.
Anger, pent-up, waiting to explode.

Crushed like a bug under the foot, messy guts all over
Like a smelly cadaver without a soul
Is this your contributed sour goal?

Plant your face down on the floor
Set the time bomb to go off at four
Sink to the bottom of your ego
Iâll laugh when the timer hits zero

My only way to find redemption
Bloody thoughts of retaliation
Ego seductive bastard laughing no more
When the bomb are going off at four

Past and present collide, beneath stained hearts I hide.
Anger, pent-up waiting to explode.

Plant your face down on the floor
Set the time bomb to go off at four
Sink to the bottom of your ego
Iâll laugh when the timer hits zero

My only way to find redemption
Bloody thoughts of retaliation
Ego seductive bastard laughing no more
When the bomb are going off at four.
