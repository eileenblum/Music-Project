Turning blind eyes
at thing we wish not,

and making our lives fake
made us lose the insight

Shielding behind others,
watching people live
in the darkness which
appears at every corner!

We walk a path paved by others,
yet we keep up our own appearance
So our guard is never down
because we forgot who we really areâ¦.

Fake smiles on fake faces â everyday faÃ§ade for a masquerade
Itâs just another fake, another rambling line â
Another step towards ambition.

Turning blindâ¦.eyes.

We walk a path paved by others,
Yet we keep up our own appearance,
So our guard is never down
Because we forgot who we really are..

Fake smiles on fake faces â everyday faÃ§ade for a masquerade.
Itâs just another fake, another rambling line â
Another step towards ambition.

Stealing away their smiles,
Setting free their hearts,
Cutting their strings â
Their souls have been lost,
But not for much longer â
Freedom beckons.
