The same anger that makes me bleed inside in my heart and in my soul
-killing me with soft whispers of hate.

Why canât I just âonce fee
From anger â thatâs trapped inside me
The anger which âyou provide.

Softly, deeply but quickly my blood flows outwards,
Pouring showing its true power to the world.
Slowly but surely it destroys me.
I am not it but it has become me.

Why canât I just â once be free.
From the anger â thatâs trapped in side me
The anger which â you provide
The anger which you create.

The anger thatâs inside me now are conquering, and swallowing piece by
piece.
From the inside earning its way through my mind.

The only emotion we ever shared â was anger
The only words we ever said â were yelled.

The same anger that makes me bleed inside in my heart and in my soul
-killing me with soft whispers of hate.

The anger thatâs inside me now are conquering, and swallowing piece by
piece.
From inside eating its way through my mind.

The only emotion we ever shared â was anger
The only words we ever said â were yelled.
