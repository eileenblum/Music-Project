Focusing into shape, born and raised without choosing the fate, designed
Thoughts and intellect â blind like a dead insect! Like a bird without
wings- a
Small world with imprinted thoughts and things â wings a small world
With imprinted thoughts and things.

What is the goal? What is the question?
Serve and die, propaganda deny!

A part of a big machine with wheels in constant motion victim of some
doctrine
Eluding â all personal motions! Staring with eyes wide open â blind to
the world
And the brother beside choking. Dreams, fading away.

What is the goal? What is the questionâ
Serve and die, propaganda deny!

Numb, betrayed, blind, depraved
Numb, betrayed, blind, depraved
Down on your knees keep reading the mantra or never be saved

Solutions through violence, violence for freedom, freedom âa
indoctrinated dream?

Is the political correct world that we live in stopping us from
recognising &amp; defining what we are being faced with Fascists.
