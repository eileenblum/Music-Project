The lines do not connect the dots
The voices do not speak the truth
For words can only express thoughts
And not the verity of youth

We see through pain and step on hate
The crying flowers yearn to live
No longer shall we prize the jewels
No longer shall we be fools

The disconnect in beating hearts
Is tragically the way of life
What once eye sees the other shuns
What once was freedom now is strife

We see through pain and step on hate
The crying flowers yearn to live
No longer shall we prize the jewels
No longer shall we be fools

A childâs eyes so like the dew
That glisten on the morning leaves
And know not of the reckless lies
Of cheating fools and tempting thieves

Corrupted we all have become
Through viewing foul deed of the years
Weâve taught our minds to slight the thirst
We long to quench with boundless tears
Boundless tears
Boundless tears
