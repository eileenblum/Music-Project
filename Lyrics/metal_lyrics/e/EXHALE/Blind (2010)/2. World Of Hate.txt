Welcome to a world of hate!
Weâre all so glad youâve come.
Let us know what we might do
To keep you feeling numb.

May your stay âbe long an bitter
Welcome to a world of hate where the greedy men, in suits are in
controlling your fate.
May your tortured soul keep bleeding
Until all you love is gone.

May your stay be long and bitter,
May your problems keep pilling on.

There are things to eat at the sideboard:
Just words, junk and pain.
All the things that you canât swallow now
Will, of course, be served again.

Welcome to a world of hate where the greedy men in suits are controlling
you fate.
Welcome to a world of hate where money lies and the body is only trade.

Welcome to a world of hate
Welcome to a world of hate
Welcome to a world of hate
Welcome to a world of hate

Welcome to a world of hate!
Weâre all so glad youâve come.
Let us know what we might do
to keep you feeling numb.

May your stay be long and bitter.
may your problems keep pilling on
