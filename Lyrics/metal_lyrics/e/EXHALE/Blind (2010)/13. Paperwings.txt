Close your eyes, draw a breath, comfortable in your coffin?
Since you never started living you can might as well be dead.
Although you gave me nothing I want to give it back.
Useless weak excuses will never feed my need.

Spread you paperwings and try your luck.

Walls rise up around you, no way to make them fall.

To rid your arms of shackles.
To rid yourself of guilt.
