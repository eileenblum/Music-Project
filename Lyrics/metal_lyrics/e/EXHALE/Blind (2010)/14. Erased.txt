Standing here, alone, prohibited to think
Your will we shall follow, your will we still swallow.
No mind, no self-respect, no own person

Starting to get â erased
Starting to get â deaf
Starting to get â dumb
Starting to get â blind

Erased â listening to the lies
Embarrassed â by propaganda
Erased â no own thought
Embraced â by greed and cold

Locked doors, left outside, propaganda, world of lies
Focus lost, humanity lost, empty words â without control.

Starting to get â erased
Starting to get â deaf
Starting to get â dumb
Starting to get â blind

More money, more power, more greed
To the ones who not need.
More money, more power, more greed
To the ones who not need.

Erased â listening to the lies
embarrassed â by propaganda
Erased â no own thought
Embraced â by greed and cold
