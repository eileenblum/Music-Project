You stand in the middle of the chaos, your wish is to scream
Scream of all your pain, scream of all your anger
With you scream, with your anger, with your word you want to destroy.

Your word is like a sharp blade cutting down everything in its way â
Leaving traces deeper than a first in the face

Your tears are forever locked inside the coffin.
Your tears never existed.
Our tears are not visible, your tears are no more.
Your tears never existed.

You stay in the middle of the chaos, your wish is the scream
Scream of all you pain, scream of all anger
With your scream, with your anger, with your word you want to destroy.

Your word is like a sharp blade cutting down everything in its way â
Leaving traces deeper than a first in the face.
