We live in a World of shit, where all that's decent is gone
A new Colosseum where the weak are torn apart just for fun
I refuse to stand by in a World
Where the lifeless rule and the vicious follow

Enough is enough, lock and load, this has to end
It's not a crime to kill someone that's already dead

No longer normal according to fucked up standards
A menace in a World fueled with filth and driven by greed
Why even have civilization when nobody acts civilized?

Enough is enough, lock and load, this has to end
It's not a crime to kill someone that's already dead

Enough is enough, lock and load, this has to end
It's not a crime to kill someone that's already dead

I'm a part of your world of shit
Where all that's decent is gone
Fueled with justice and driven by hate,
And I refuse to standby in a world
Where the lifeless rule and the vicious follow

Don't you forget that you created me
