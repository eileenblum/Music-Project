Illusions shattered, an existence of lies
Facedown in an Alley, observing faith with dead Eyes

Outnumbered from the start, society marked as a blackened heart
Meetings with different titles, puking my insides out

Trying to fit in, make me free from sin, empty my skin - illusions
Trying to fit in, make me free from sin, empty my skin - illusions

Vision of no hope will always be an illusion, accepted fate
No stamina in the body, nowhere to emigrate without help

Who to blame, all I wish is to be like them, get a second chance
No one answers, no one care, forever doomed in this nightmare

Observing faith with dead Eyes
Outnumbered from start
A vision of hope, just and illusion
