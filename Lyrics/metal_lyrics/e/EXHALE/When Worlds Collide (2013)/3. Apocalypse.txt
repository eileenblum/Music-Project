Vermins, unable to grasp the gift of Life
A poisonous breed, cursed since the dawn of time
Conquering, infecting and destroying all along it's path
The apocalypse in all it's prime

Masters of Death, sweeping across the face of the Earth
Bearers of the plague, striving to be gods

Creators of greed, paper-thin divinity justifies their deeds
Born of sin, oblivious to the storm closing in

Mankind, ignorant and blind
The apocalypse in all it's prime

Primitive minds, living by preying on others
Aggressive by nature, an all-consuming fire

Cutting each others throats, spreading the plague
Possessed by Power, rule as gods at any cost

Mankind, ignorant and blind
The apocalypse in all it's prime
The apocalypse in all it's prime

Mankind, ignorant and blind
The apocalypse in all it's prime
