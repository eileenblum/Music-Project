Everybody's watching eagerly awaiting moments of human decay
A twisted craving, to be both predator and prey

A game were everyone are bound to fail
Entertainment is god, and all of our souls are up for sale

Glorify the dumb
Glorify stupidity
Glorify a sick World in which failure is the only option

Consume and get consumed by fortune and fame
Two sides of stupidity, we're all playing a loosing game
