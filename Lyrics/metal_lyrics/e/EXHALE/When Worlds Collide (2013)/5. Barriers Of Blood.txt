We are the glory of man, reaching for the gods
Statements of immortality
built upon soil of Deep red

We are the barriers of blood

We are the portals to paradise and divinity unknown
Messengers of filth, built to protect, to keep them in check

Instruments of fear, monuments of the dead
Instruments of fear, barriers of blood
