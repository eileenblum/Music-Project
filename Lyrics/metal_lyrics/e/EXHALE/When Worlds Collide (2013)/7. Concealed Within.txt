Attention denied, no strength to repair
The chaos inside, anger supplied

Lies concealed within the serpents deceptive skin

No understanding of the deeds, revenge is at hand
Hate reveals, feeding the hand of man

Lies concealed within the serpents deceptive skin

Suffocating the mind, spreading like a disease

Lies concealed within the serpents deceptive skin
