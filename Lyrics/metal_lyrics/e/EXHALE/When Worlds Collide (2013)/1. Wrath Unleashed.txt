We're filled with the stench of maggots,
which confines and repress all that's pure and human
Controlled by fear,
Kneeling in the darkness like fucking victims

The time has come, to take that path to the edge were Worlds collide
Wrath unleashed

Scars fill our souls to the Point of no return
Principles are lost and broken
The deeds of few becomes the wrath of many

You brought us here, over the fucking edge
Inhuman deeds, deadly to those who care

Forgivness will never be granted, you made your choice
One way path, without fear
Wrath unleashed

Take control, brake those chains of silence
Repress and destroy that stench, fight fear with fear

The time has come, to take that path to the edge
were Worlds collide
Wrath unleashed
