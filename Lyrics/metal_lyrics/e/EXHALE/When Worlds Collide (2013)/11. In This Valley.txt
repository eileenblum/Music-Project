Gear up, get ready to defend all that you believe
cause those fucking vultures are ready to attack

Holding on to a lost cause as all out war lies ahead
I am the prey, and they are waiting to get fed

In this valley only shadows find a way to live
In this valley only the departed have the will to forgive

Gagged and unable to speak the truth
Fake loyalty demanded, so disturbing and sick

I will not fall into that hole of shadows,
to be one of them, to become a shell so hollow

My head is bloody but unbowed
