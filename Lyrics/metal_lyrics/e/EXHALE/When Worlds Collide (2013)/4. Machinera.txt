Lifeless tools, standing in perfect lines
Ready to serve the "greater good"
Slaves to cause unknown, bearers of inhumanity

Fall in line - no complains accepted, stay low or get detected
Do or die - accept your fate, you got nowhere to hide

Disposable parts made of flesh and blood, 
oiled up by hate and deceit
Owned by men in suits, soldiers of democracy
