Standing on my knees, waiting for the axe to fall
There's no light to follow, I know that this is the end of all

Those ugly scars are starting to show again
as i'm fighting a war that cannot be won

Staring into eyes of indifference, begging for mercy
Abandoned by hope, left here with all that is filthy

Those ugly scars are starting to show again
as everything crumbles and turn into dust

The darkness fill my lungs
I'm choking on every breath
From this there is nowhere to hide
The world is dead to me as I'm left inside

Crawled up against the wall, I'm feeding the flames
Unable to breath the air, unable to break those chains

Those ugly scars are starting to show again
as I'm loosing faith and all turns to stone

Isolating myself from all that is pure and divine
A living-dead, with all of hell left inside

Those ugly scars defines me
I'm dead inside, never to be born against

Standing on my knees, waiting for the axe to fall
There's no light to follow
I know that this is the end of all

Those ugly scars defines me and all that I am
Dead inside, never toe be born again

I'm left with all of hell inside
