Maybe we weren't suppose to feel
When the sun gave us its first ray
We were captured by its radiance
But the light blinded us and we were lead astray

This world is filled with sorrow
The blackbird lies dead in the ground
Where shadows hold their last breath
And pain last eternally

All lost in the embrace of time
When hours just keep passing by
All those skulls are now our homes
The bones that once were covered in flesh

Maybe we were lost in the descent
But don't forget you'll also be there
Under the dark earth
The peasant and the king remain

And pain last eternally
