Through this valley of tears we wander
Awaiting for the dream to come
And give rest to our weary soul

We're dragged, by the currents of time
Always flowing, with no stopping
Never in the same direction
Pulling us apart

After the harvest
No name on my grave
No warning signs
From sorrow and despair

We're just the shadows
Reflected on the smoke
The searing heat of life
Leaving only ashes behind

We're just the shadows
Reflected on the smoke
When the blaze turns to embers
And the embers to dust

Walking through these empty halls
Hearing endless sirens call
Erratic and pleasing songs
Tearing away the roots no one can see

[Poem]

The light of the moon
Shines on the ghostly field
Dark shapes looming through the mist
Where memories lie hidden and safe

Our lives are the rivers
That gather downward to the sea
We're just shadows
Reflected on smoke
