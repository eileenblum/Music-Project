Staring at the grey stone
The wind brought a distant thought

The summer breeze, the green grass
The moon was lighting our path

The winter rain, the grey clouds
Dreams of sorrow crawling like worms

It's cold and I'm alone
Sealed in this urn
I was lost in the return

As you walked into the night
The world was chewing my bones

Will ever the longing fade out?
Will I hear again those words?

My hands were trying to reach for yours
But my skin was shredded by the thorns

The howling of wolves in the night
Woke me up shrouded in mourning
