At the darkness of the end
Memories have become blurred
Not even I can hear the echoes
Of my final judgement

I left all behind
As I erased the reason
From my mind
As the smoke raised

Keeping a tight hand
On my own mistakes
And trying to be freed
Biting me to death

Lost and now rotten
When the past can't be forgotten
And together we fall

We tried to be forgiving
Silent words in a deaf mind
And together we fall

My weary heart, just failed at last

We dreamed an unconscious dream
We were the priests of the cease
The carriers of the disease

From the deepest of your soul
I saw a myriad of dreams
But in this mourning world
Broken promises is all that we got

In another life, would I stay?

Even these days
Still I wear the flowers you made
Still I wait to hear your name
Leaves have come and leaves have gone
But these roots still feed from you
