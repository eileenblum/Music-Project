As the last ray shines
After the sun sets
I fall into the dark
And the shadows embrace me

Don't cry for me
It's time to make peace
For the agony to cease
For our last kiss

And beneath the cold soil
An empty husk will lie
And not anymore
Your soul will be alone

As I walk down this road
The passing of ages wore down
Darkness caress me
Like a mother her child

The river runs empty
The light fades away
The leaves are falling
I shall no longer stay

"The night falls in these woods
The wind carries your words
Goodbye"

No, I'm not gone,
From your side and your thoughts
