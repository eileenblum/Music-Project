Awakened from the dream
The spirits wailing around
Behind the falling veil
After the cursing bond

The broken heart
The lusting soul
Walks down the earth
Over a trail of tears

Where were you
During my downfall
These wounds
Won't heal the pain

The broken tree
The rotten roots
The cold morning air
Revealed the truth

We are reflections
Of a delusive god
The anger, the pain,
the sorrow, the fear

Alone the ghost
Questions this world
The missing words
From the hole in its soul

The missing words
From the hole in its soul

We walk alone through this world
We're just returning home
The senses might go numb
In reveries we'll find us

Illusions come to my mind
Darkness still awaits
Trying to hook my self
In the bottomless deeps
Of despair
