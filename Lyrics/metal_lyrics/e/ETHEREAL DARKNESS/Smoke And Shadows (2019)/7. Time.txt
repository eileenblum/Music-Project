I was thrown into the dark
I saw no light at the end
Where there's no tomorrow
And the hollow craves the sorrow

The misdeed seemed so strong
But crumbled with the lightest touch
All those scars and marks
Time will erase them all

Oh darkness, free me of my woes
In your knees I rest
There I would see the oceans burn
And all the stars fade

Hear the silence of the void
The changing colors of the worlds
Lost traces of another time
Memories from a distant past

The irony of the cruel fate
The dense fog wouldn't let see
One has to bleed to be healed
Be hurt for the skin to grow thick
