even as a friend you manage to lodge a knife between my shoulder blades. i have no more need for these photos. i have betrayal and viciousness to remind me of your face. so i'll be giving these pictures back with me torn out. this will be my last phone call. you wont hear my voice again. i'll chalk it up to one more loss and wish you the life you deserve. this is my ill wish for you and i'll wear it like its going out of style.
