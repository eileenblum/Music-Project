shed tears of blood in the evening sun. bathed in orange and silhouetted. the brightness decieves. you ripped out my heart. your smile decieves. turn your sour face to the sky. bare reddened teeth in a somber grin not reflected in your vacant eyes. the insects are silent in my last minutes before bitterness.
