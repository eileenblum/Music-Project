She's a dead horse. There's no sense in beating her into the ground. She's a dead horse. Accept it and move on. No matter how many times you kick her in the chest she will not take another breath. And don't let the twitches fool you. It's just nerves, it won't last. There's something newer and better waiting to take her place. But you won't move on. So as you sit here beating a dead horse we'll be riding circles around you.
