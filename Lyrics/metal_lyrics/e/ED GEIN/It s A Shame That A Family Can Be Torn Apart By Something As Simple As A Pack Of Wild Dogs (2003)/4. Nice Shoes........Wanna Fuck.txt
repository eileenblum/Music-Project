Carve another notch in your bedpost, whore. Lay back and tally up the score. Count the number of hearts you've ripped from chests. Then put your pretty eyes to rest. They've had a long day of looking for love in all the wrong places. Putting too much stock in pretty faces. When will you learn there is a difference between lust and love?
