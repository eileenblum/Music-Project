You want to see me fail. You want to pump my dreams full of lead and put their blood soaked corpses on public display with a sign around their neck that says "this is what happens when you dont do things our way." But your ways aren't for me. And when you realize you have wasted your life away I'll be there, ready to hang a sign around your neck that says "I suck at life."
