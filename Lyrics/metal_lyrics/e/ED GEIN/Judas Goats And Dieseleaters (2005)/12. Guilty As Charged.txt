we bitch and bitch and bitch, but nothing ever changes.
no one ever changes.
and I'm just as guilty.
I wish I was strong enough to leave it all behind.
but it's life support and I'm clinging on.
fighting to breathe for myself.
someday I'll pull the plug and walk away.
but until that day I'll keep throwing rocks, hoping to make a dent.
I'm trying.
I'm failing.
but I'll keep pushing on.
I'm just as guilty, but I'll keep pushing on.
