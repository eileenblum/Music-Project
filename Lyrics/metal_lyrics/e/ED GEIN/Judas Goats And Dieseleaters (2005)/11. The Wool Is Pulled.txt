force that plane to land.
he doesn't need it.
its not important.
but get these men on the next flight out.
they're friends of the family and we're thick as thieves.
now force that plane to land.
there's money to be had.
there's favors to be paid.
I don't care who has to die.
the heart doesn't need to fly.
