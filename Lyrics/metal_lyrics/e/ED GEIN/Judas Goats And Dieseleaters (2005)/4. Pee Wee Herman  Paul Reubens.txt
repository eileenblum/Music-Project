isn't it a relief to know that even the most perfect people have flaws?
hiding secrets behind candy coated exteriors.
a book with a perfect cover hiding dry rotted pages.
but don't worry you goody-goody some day you will fall.
Someday you will be caught pulling it in a movie theater.
someday....you will fall.
