why don't you just whip 'em out and measure dicks to find out who's the bigger man.
it'll save us from your macho bullshit.
let me say this in words you can understand; it's not just dancing ï¿½broï¿½, and you're not just ï¿½going offï¿½ because you're ï¿½stokedï¿½ on some ï¿½sickï¿½ band with ï¿½crucialï¿½ breakdowns.
you're not ï¿½accidentallyï¿½ hitting people.
but even if you are, that's like putting perfume on a pile of shit and calling it a fucking rose.
I've had enough excuses.
I won't eat shit anymore.
this ends now.
