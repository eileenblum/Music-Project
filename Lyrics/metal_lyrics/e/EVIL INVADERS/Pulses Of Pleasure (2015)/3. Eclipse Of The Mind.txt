Open the gate to my life as it was
Don't leave me imprisoned inside this black mass

Is this world just a mirage in my dream?
Or am I doomed to roam in this darkness...
Forever

[Pre-chorus:]
Who's blind?
They can't see through your eyes (that)
our mind
Got awakened inside
Alone
Left alone in despair
Outside
Does anyone care?

[Chorus:]
Trapped inside your own body,
Paralyzed and blind
Find a way to exit
The eclipse of your mind

Captive in this total darkened space
NO WAY OUT!
Can't find a single trace!!!

Is there a path through
This endless...
Emptiness!

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
