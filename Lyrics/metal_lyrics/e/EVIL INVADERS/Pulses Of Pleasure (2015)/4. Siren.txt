There it is again,
The call of temptation
It breaks the silence that I had finally found
It rips through my mind
The scream of impatience
Enslaved to the beauty of this horrible sound

It guides, guides me away
And I know I should stay
But I can not resist the sound, the sound of regret
It rings in my head
It drives me so insane!!!

Trapped in this maze
Between love and despise
Will I wake up from this nightmare alive?
Invading my mind
With it's ice cold blue eyes
And I'm diving deep into the darkest of nights

Deep, deep down in the sea of misery
It's pulling me closer to it's side
The side that I detest
It gives me no rest!
Insanity's creeping up my spine!!!

Can you hear it calling me?
Can you hear it calling me?

[Chorus:]
Vermin is feeding on me
I forgot what it's like to be free
Screams straight out of hell
The siren casting it's spell

Rotten inside
Lies result into grief
My trust is shattered, I've been deceived
The magic enchantment
This creature creates
It leaves me deranged and filled with hate

But hate, it keep me alive
My way to survive
And the screeching carries
On and on, and on in my head
Driving me mad
Can't get it off my mind!

Can you hear it calling me?
It's cutting through my bones!!!

[Chorus]
