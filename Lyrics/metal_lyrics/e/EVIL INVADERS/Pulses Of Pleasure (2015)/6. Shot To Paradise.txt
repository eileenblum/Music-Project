I am the one
You rely on
The one that you need
To succeed in life
Listen to me
And I will set you free
For just a little free
The price is sharp as a knife

I hit you harder
Every day
But for a paradise
That's a small price to pay
Inject the illusion
A liquid prophecy
The utopia within your mind
It ain't reality

[Pre-chorus:]
Blinding your mind
Like you're doing every day
Running from yourself
No escaping the decay
You'll always walk alone
With me by your side
I am the needle
Ready to guide

[Chorus:]
You to the way
To ecstasy
Reality is what you sacrifice
On your way
To ecstasy
I welcome you to the paradise

Realisation
There's no chance of liberation
As we collide as one
The end has begun
Stricken down
In agony you moan
Prey to a demonic saint
Kneel before his throne!

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus:]
You to the way
To ecstasy
The road to desire leads to my empire
A trip to heel
I pull you t me
No turning back now!
You're coming with me!
You're coming with me!
