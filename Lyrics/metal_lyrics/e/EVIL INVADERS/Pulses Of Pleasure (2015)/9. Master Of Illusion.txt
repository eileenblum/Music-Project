A source f knowledge
The answer to all
My light shines on and on
I educate your children
Teach them wrong from wrong

In an addicted way
You pray and pray
The pressure's growing strong
Pushing the others to the light
The herd just moves along

Deceiving my believers
A spider in it's web
Waiting for prey
Bringing decay but take it step by step

As you look at me
Your eyes can't see
The truth behind my lies
Lies that burn, yet cold as ice
A mindfuck exercise

[Chorus:]
Master, master of illusion
My filthy lies, their mind's demise
Master, master of illusion
My blinding eyes they paralyze
They're begging me Master
Oh Master please
And they will all just bend the knee
I AM THE ONE
Controlling your reality

The shepherd of the second life
Decides which throat will feel the knife
Provides the mask for those in fear
I decide what you will hear

And in the end
You'll kiss my hand
There's no one else to blame
A god without emotions
Hallowed be my game

[Chorus]

No individuality
A puppeteer's banality
Stripped of all reality
My herd will saunter on

The master with his heart of stone
Sitting on his worldwide throne
War death and agony
'till nothing else is left to be!

Master
Master
Master
Master
Master
Master
