Welcome
Into my freakshow
A poisonous venue filled with hate
Ripping through
Your vital organs
Tearing the flesh off of your face!

The blast that you
Are about to witness
Will leave you
Addicted to pain
I'll bring it to you
Fast, loud 'n' rude
Crushing your bones
To a pile of dust!!!!

[Pre-chorus:]
I'm the infection
Molesting your health
I am the dictator
Obey my command
You need my action
It's a fatal attraction
Lash out your neck
To the speed!

[Chorus:]
Burn, burn
Let the fire ignite
Scream it out!
Destroy this place tonight
When all you sick bastards collide into one
The world will be ours! Let it be done!
Fire, fire
Burn it down
Burn this place right to the ground!
So sick of this shit, it's time to intrude
We'll take 'em down
Fast, loud 'n' rude!

Fuck off!

Fuck all of this bullshit
I'll break through
I'll show them I'm right
This expression
Of my passion
For aggression
Exhibiting my might

The blast that they
Are about to witness
When our powers
Come together as one
We'll bring 'em down
On their knees and bow
[Breaking their necks]
To the gut cutting sound

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

I'm the infection
the fatal attraction!
The cause of all your body fractures
I will rage on
Without looking back
A violent storm in for attack

It's time for action
Give me the right reaction
Show me the force
Of a total destruction
United as one
Inferior to none
We'll blow them away
Like a fucking H-bomb!
