Pathetic and selfish, just a piece of shit
Betraying yourself and not aware of it
Denying and lying, but always complying
Retarded, demented everyone know
Empty-headed it clearly shows
It shows that you should stop trying!

[Chorus:]
The venom is good
That's what you said
The venom is right
But only in your head
Confusion and fear for the speed of transience
Love without hate for this deadly alliance
The venom is good
That's what you said
The venom is right
But only in your head
You search for the fuel which will burn you tonight
Embrace the silent assassin in white

Too blind to see, to see the hurt
You cause to the ones that pulled you out of the dirt
While digging your own grave!

[Chorus]
