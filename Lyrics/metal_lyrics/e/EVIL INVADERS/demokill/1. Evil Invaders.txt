You are marching without fear
Crossing over the frontier
Bursting flames stick it in their face
"hear me soldier, do as I say"
Don't doubt the mission
Understand!
That they're the ones, they're in command

Trenches filled with mud and rain
You witness the screams of pain
Bunkers shaking, emotions breaking
They'll make out what's right or wrong
Run on through towards the target,
it is time to drop the bomb

EVIL INVADERS
They brought you here to fight
Evil invaders
March on while eating their lies
Flashing light, a bullet storm
People wishing they'd never been born
Assassin attack, move in from the back
Just as easy as it gets!
Slit his throat before he cries and he will never be recognised.
City burning. Fire! Smoke!
Mothers crying while their children choke!
No compromise they have to die, can't you see the reason why?
They are just rats in our path and you will accept!

Evil invaders
They brought you here to die
Evil invaders
You never questioned why

Now you stopped marching, it's time you start watching,
that this just can not be your goal
You must stop the hating, it's deteriorating,
You only invaded your soul
Don't follow the order, it's just out of order,
this battle can not be won
Wake up your head, you're already dead,
this ends with a mouthful of gun.

You die!

[Solo Sam]
