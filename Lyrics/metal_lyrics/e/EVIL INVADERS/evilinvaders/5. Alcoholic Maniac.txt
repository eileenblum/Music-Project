I woke up in the trash,
An awful smell and body rash
Was I hanging out in a bar
or drinking from a whiskey jar?
My head is still sour,
but I'm going back to the liquor store

I'm an ALCOHOLIC MANIAC, never stop drinking till I hit the sack
Everyday I am wasted
Ain't got no job, ain't got no friends and the boozing never ends
Everyday I am wasted

Let's go drink, don't you think?
Cause we don't care if we stink
You smell us coming from miles away
Come on, we'll get wasted today
Puke all over me, shit on the floor
But I'm going back to the liquor store

[Chorus]

[Solo Sam / Solo Joe]

I woke up in the trash,
An awful smell and body rash
Was I hanging out in a bar
or drinking from a whiskey jar?
My head is still sour,
but I'm going back to the liquor store

[Chorus]

ZATOS poepeloeres!
ZATOS poepeloeres!
