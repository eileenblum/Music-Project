Screams of burning pressure, roaring in my ears
Raging on towards you without a sign of fear
Bring it on harder! FASTER COME ON!

Lemmy's voice rings in my head
Telling me he's killed by death
Turn it up louder! LOUDER COME ON!

[Chorus]
Driving like a maniac like never before
Flipping the road, give me some more
I'm lightning on wheels and I'll strike you down

DRIVING FAST!!!

Wheels are rotating, annihilating
Roadkill lies dead in my destructive track
Destroy it all! Destroy yourself!
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHWWWWW!!!!!

[Chorus]

[Solo Joe / Solo Sam]
[Solo Joe / Solo Sam]
[Solo Joe / Solo Sam]
[Solo Joe / Solo Sam]
[Solo Joe / Solo Sam]
