These feelings tear me up inside
My brain's corroding by its might
The beast is in me and takes control
It is feasting on my soul
There's no way back, it's all my fault
Evil has started it's assault
When my vision gets blurry I know it's too late
I am delivered to my fate
Demons are crawling through my throat
Destroying my body from the head to toe
I take a look in the mirror of doom
That's when I know the torture comes soon

[Chorus]
TORTURE
I'm TORTURED BY THE BEAST
TORTURE
Like a terminal disease
TORTURE
I'm tortured by the beast
TORTURE
When will I be released

Trapped in a room with no memories in me
My stomach is burning and I can't stand the heat
I remember nothing my brain has been drained
Is my mind playing tricks or am I really in pain
A panic attack, there's no way to turn back
No future perspective or a memory to track
Another look in the mirror of doom
Yes I know the torture goes through!!!

[Chorus]

[Solo Joe]

Adrenaline rushes I tremble and shake
Is this a nightmare or am I awake
My mind's going crazy how long will this take
It feels forever please give me a break!

[Chorus]
