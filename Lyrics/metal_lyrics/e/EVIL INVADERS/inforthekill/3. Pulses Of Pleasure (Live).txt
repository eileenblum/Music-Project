Black and blue, bruised and battered
You're demolished but still you want more
You feel the urge to be taken by force
As you're crawling along the floor

Your body is mine! I'm in command!
That's what we both wanted
Now you understand
That I'll leave you addicted to me!
Tearing you down, 'cause I'm wild and free.

Pulses of pleasure, pleasure or pain?
Red hot and wild and I know you feel the same
A force that has been ruling
Since the very dawn of time
I feel it, I have to cross over the line

The rush is increasing, no way to slow it down
A one track mind, there's no way around!
Lust overpowers, you'll have to obey
Driven by instinct I grab hold of my prey

The heat is building, it's burning your skin
I bet you're yearning for this bestial sin
Pushed down to the floor
Are you ready for more?
A strike from the back heading straight for the core!

Nowhere to go, your limbs are tied
Waiting for the fire to ignite
Enjoy or suffer, suffer the delight
Here we go
Prepare for the bite!

In the night
Pain is right
Don't you know
Only pain excites!

I'll tear you down,
Tear you down
The burning sensation of love and frustration
Down
Get down
Back to the root of mankind's creation!

Screams of desire, desire for pain!
Unstoppable hits! I'm in your domain.
Into a higher sphere of sensation
You've stopped into my trap of temptation!!!

Nowhere to go, your limbs are tied
Waiting for the fire to ignite
Enjoy or suffer, suffer the delight
Here we go
Prepare for the bite!

In the night
Pain is right
Don't you know
Only pain excites!

I'll tear you down,
Tear you down
The burning sensation of love and frustration
Down
Get down
Back to the root of mankind's creation!
