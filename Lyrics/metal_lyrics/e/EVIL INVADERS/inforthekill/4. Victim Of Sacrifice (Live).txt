You are the chosen one, and you are born to die
Bounded, there's no place you can run nowhere you can hide
The inside of this temple is the last thing you'll ever see

Captured by the Aztecs, they brought you to this place
As a prisoner of war, you'll be sacrificed
A quick stab of the dagger will release you from your fears

They are gonna steal your heart,
Tear your flesh and meat apart
Victim of sacrifice
Victim of ...sacrifice
Victim of sacrifice
The priest of sun will take your life
Your body starts to feel the knife
Victim of sacrifice
Victim of ...sacrifice
Victim of sacrifice

Fear and anger driving your nuts, you try to escape but you can't
All for that one god that does or does not exist
Your wrists and ankles bleed from the cuffs that you're wearing

When the day has come, your blood starts to steam
You're laying on the altar, now your time is come
Feel the knife cutting your body, cross into your apart

They are gonna steal your heart,
Tear your flesh and meat apart
Victim of sacrifice
Victim of ...sacrifice
Victim of sacrifice
The priest of sun will take your life
Your body starts to feel the knife
Victim of sacrifice
Victim of ...sacrifice
Victim of sacrifice

[Solo]

They are gonna steal your heart,
Tear your flesh and meat apart
Victim of sacrifice
Victim of ...sacrifice
Victim of sacrifice
The priest of sun will take your life
Your body starts to feel the knife
Victim of sacrifice
Victim of ...sacrifice
Victim of sacrifice
