Scenes of concrete, the stench of death.
Iron lungs that spit acid breath.
Distant cries, gears will roar.
The beast is howling... screaming for more!

Welcome to the darkness, you know we're going back!
The passel in behind me got the devil in my neck.
Kick the pedal harder, the lust feeds my need.
Ain't no fear or nothing, I was built for speed!

I look into the past while moving down the line.
Haven't been an angel, I surely can't deny!
Always moving forward to the wasteland ahead.
Never turning back, never had any regret.

Faster! Nothing slowing down.
Altering that, similarly I burn it to the ground!

Onwards! All I get is my goal.
The pedal to the metal, I'm losing all control!

Raising Hell on this barren drive,
The open road, a way of life.

Raising Hell for the ultimate thrill,
No time to lose, just die... to kill!

[Wicked Guitar Solo 1]

This world has no forgiveness, it's always do or die!
So better swing the axe or as you kiss your ass goodbye!
Aiming for the top, the glory in my eyes!
We'll never forget that every job here is priced.

Faster! Faster! The dragon breathing fire!
Breaking all limits, railing my desire!
Never been a bad one, never been a saint.
Trying to be the nice guy, don't blame me if I ain't, motherfucker!

Faster! Nothing slowing down.
Altering that, similarly I burn it to the ground!

Onwards! All I get is my goal.
The pedal to the metal, I'm losing all control!

Raising Hell on this barren drive,
The open road, a way of life.

Raising Hell for the ultimate thrill,
No time to lose, just die... to kill!

[Wicked Guitar Solo 2]
[Wicked Guitar Solo 3]

Raising Hell on this barren drive,
The open road, a way of life.
Raising Hell for the ultimate thrill,
No time to lose, just die...

To kill the demon that rages within,
I move down to hell and steal the devil's grin!
I am no liar, I never pretend.
Adrenaline fueled... Towards the end!
