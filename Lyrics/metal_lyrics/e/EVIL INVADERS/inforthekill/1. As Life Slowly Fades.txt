I'm your shelter when your plans will fail
weak minds I conquer, I shall prevail
your wish for death yet your source of life
tell nothing but truth that's built on lies
I feed you anger, fill you with hate
sustain the will to retaliate
preach forgiveness, love and peace
I'm the sweet tempered joy and subconscious disease

I'm the serpent in for the kill
fall and obey to my will
a torture of pleasure, laughter and pain
suffer the leisure, keep playing the game
you are alone, together with me
feeling good in this insanity
subtle I conquer dominant I reign
the envoy of pleasure and bringer of pain
your cause of misfortune, your force of ascent
your source of redemption with sadistic intent

I prey upon your weakness and I feast upon your fears
take responsibility for all your fucking tears
your angel of mercy breaking your spine
freedom's illusion
know that you are mine

I'm the serpent in for the kill
fall and obey to my will

forlorn your breath turns cold
darkness surrounds you, your skin's turning old
solitude no one hears your call
as life slowly fades
a new one shall fall
