[Chris deBurgh cover]

I am left in the night, trembling with fear,
I have seen to the future, and the future is here,
Our leader will bring victory, but our land is in flames,
And as the final sounds of battle disappear, I had to say -

What about me, and you, and the ones that we love,
What about me, and you, and the ones that we love,
Well what about us?
