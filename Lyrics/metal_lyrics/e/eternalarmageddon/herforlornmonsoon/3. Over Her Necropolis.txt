âWhat I trust, all proved wrong,
What was true all proved false?
Then what use to pray to that God?
Iâm walking through the way that Satan showed!â

As I walked through the mist,
I felt some dark figures behind me.
But I didnât even fear, didnât even scream,
I knew, Iâm gonna sodomize my dreams!

Smell of death, in the bliss
Itâs blowing over her necropolis,
Besides sitting alone, in the sand,
I cried, I dug her grave by my own hand!

Tearing eyes, I Swim in the ocean of sorrow
No demise, then why Iâm waiting for tomorrow?
My every breathe has cursed my flesh &amp; every cell
I know my life is the shadow of hell!

People who didnât want her live
Cut her from the heartless world,
Iâm the one beside her lonely grave
Blaming my God at every moment!

Iâve lost the moon of my lonely nights!
I couldnât scream, I couldnât cry,
Iâll let astray, after my final kiss
Giving my love over her necropolis!

Tearing eyes, I Swim in the ocean of sorrow
No demise, then why Iâm waiting for tomorrow?
My every breathe has cursed my flesh &amp; every cell
I know my life is the shadow of hell!

Tearing eyes, I Swim in the ocean of sorrow
No demise, then why Iâm waiting for tomorrow?
My every breathe has cursed my flesh &amp; every cell
I know my life is the shadow of hell!
