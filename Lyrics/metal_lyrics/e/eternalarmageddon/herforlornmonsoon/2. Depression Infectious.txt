The silence that grows in the winterâs womb
Rips my soul under dying moon
My eyes are fading, tears bleed no more
As night unveils her blackened soul

The orchid that never bloomed in my heart
Iâll bloom that precious in my rebirth
No dreams of living, only hate remains
A soul forlorn, a life condemned

As night unchains her hounds apart
I feel their thirst for my frozen heart
Soul stops breathing wind blows malicious
My heart fills with depression infectious
Depression
Depression infectious
Depression

Those lonely memories cry for me
Into darkness Iâm gradually falling
I hear they are calling me everyday
Hiding in solitude I decay
