-
Through spiked eyes I can see
Images from far beyond within;
- visions in a fairy reality.
No pain in sight!

A crying angel with broken wings
Unflown in deity deeds,
In fear, lying to the laughing demon
Whom has given helping hands!

As the white dove rests in peace,
It's mission forsaken
As the predator is satisfied!
One's bread - another's death!

Day and night, Heaven or Hell
- black and white through dark light.

It is to be - contrary energy!

I worship the harmony of opposites.
Law of Nature, basic balance - equilibrium.

Those who denies the existence of Gods,
They are as blind as people who assert;
- visions in a religious reality.
A lot of pain in sight - equilibrium!
