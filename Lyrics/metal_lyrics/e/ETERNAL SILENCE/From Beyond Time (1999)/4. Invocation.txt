Secret truth, appear before Me!
Obey, in all things I say!

In the mystery of this vestry
I invoke Thee

Let it be mighty my power,
Let it endure forever.

Demons of the depths,
I call upon Thee.
Open the gates for Me,
To whom the praise and glory shall be.

INVOCATION (arkanum)

This is Thy seal, show Thee before Me
Within this Circle of Divine.

Come forth, secret wisdom
Of all things in Darkness as in Light.

I stir Thee up
And move Thee into mysteries
Of the secrets forbidden.
Obey the law which I have made.

INVOCATION (arkanum)

Spirits - do for Me.
I order Thee for Me,
Make Me live endlessly.

Bael, Amon, Barbatos,
Pour Me power.

Shax, Sitri, Belial,
Portray my answer.
