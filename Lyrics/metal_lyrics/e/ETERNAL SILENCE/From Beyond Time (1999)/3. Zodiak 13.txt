...Through ice-cold emptiness,
Thundery silence and universal force...

The Only Truth, old as Time itself.
Whirling through the endless epoch of Dark Embrace.
Mournful forces rejoice in Life's eternal fight.
Timeless secrets concealed by a distant past.
History's depths sings the Wordless Song.

Constellations' total polyphony.
Throughout Time - cosmic portal, finally exposed.

Dancing among all the Signs.
Every - all's destinies call.
It is all in One.

Come forth... forth...
Unity... unity...
Of stars... stars...
Reveal for Me... for Me!

Time has come for Me!

Floating free in unity.
Cosmic sincerity.

... Through ice-cold emptiness,
Thundery silence and universal force...

The Only Truth, shall now be done.
Mysteries touch the path to Eye of All.
Universal unity arise in human life.
Immortality reflects in starlight.
Zodiac 13,
All-embracing sign.
Constellations' total polyphony.
Throughout Time - cosmic portal, finally exposed.
