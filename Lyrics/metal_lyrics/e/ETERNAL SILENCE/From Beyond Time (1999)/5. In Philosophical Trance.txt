Step outside your human mind,
Get up high and You will see!

Perspective - I see it coming,
Prospective - I choose my faith.
Sometime I'll lose my sanity,
Into the deepest quest of life.

Draw the parallels between now and past.

Watch the cycles of time re-occur.
Try to visualize the outcome of this life
- outcome of this life.
See the blindness of humanity
- blind humanity.

Insanity - I'm not inside myself,
To be - my eyes above all.

Morning dusk grows forth
Like a newborn from the dark of the light.

Symmetry - I can see the balance
Between all the vital parts.

Paralysed by my mind,
Flashes From Beyond Time,
I see visions through my eyes above.

Welcome to the home of Madness.
In my state of mind
I bid welcome every bizarre thought.

Dreams from a personal paradise.

In philosophical trance!
