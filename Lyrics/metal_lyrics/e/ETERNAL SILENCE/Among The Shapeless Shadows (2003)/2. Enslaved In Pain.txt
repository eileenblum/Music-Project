A pulsating pain enthrones forth in madness,
In it's enigmatic form.

The last piece of sense is soon swept away
-invasion of psychic termination...

Laughing with its mask, crawling into your mind
-paralysed and dismayed you break!

Non-existant in your mind, you twist your soul around inside
And swallow yourself away
-away from what the inner eye can see.

Infected by sufferings!
Poisoned with mental pain - malicious insane!

Strangled! Tortured! Enslaved in pain!

Laughing with its mask - crawling into your mind
With a hunger awakened within,
And pale you stare like a gargoyle in the dark.

Searching through your possessed mind - where to escape?
Blinded you are caught inside your own maze.

Fragile - wrapped in chains.
You lay upon the throne of mind apathy.

I see your eyes - they beg for death!

I absorb your soul...
