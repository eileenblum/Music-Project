" Oh, Great Goddess, Thou who dwelleths within the shadowland of obscurity.
Let Thy heart thaw and Thy lips speaketh to the ears of Thy slaves who rest
Their heads in dust by Thy feet.
Speak, oh Great Goddess from the holy abyss! Thou paveth our path and embraceth us in darkness.
Shineth Thy lustrous wisdom upon Thy servant's way.
Telleth us, oh Goddess' mouth;
What wisheth Thou, wherefore art our worthless destiny? "

Great Goddess - shadows in moonless nights.
Inhuman triumphant pride from the night before time.

Great Goddess - from the dark beyond the existence of light, to foredoom our path!

Among the shapeless shadows that crossed the utter darkness,
At the time our world was young and free among the hungry stars;

Great Goddess' time, shadow so bright - obscurity.

Pale her grace, lustrous her gaze - visionary.

"For me to see your destiny! In time you will find; my bell will chime!"

A shadow from before the past - shepherdess of fates.

"I rhyme the words from the disguised depths where the light never reach!"

"Speak Great Goddess from beyond!"
"Tell us, O Mighty; when will Thy bell chime?"
"Blind your eyes from the moonlight, open them for the Darkest Night!"

The path that leads to decay and death - maybe there lies The Eternal Life!

Great Goddess' time, shadow so bright - obscurity.

Shadow ballet, Destiny's Dance - fatality.

"The mortal in me is long since dead.
Now I tell you what's in cosmos said!"

Among the shapeless shadows.
