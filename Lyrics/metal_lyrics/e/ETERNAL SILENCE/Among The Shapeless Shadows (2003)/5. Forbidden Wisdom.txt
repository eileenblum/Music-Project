How to kill a memory?
Nothing - is everything and all in one!
I am lost in unfathomable thoughts...
"... you fall into the sear..."

I serve my time in chains.
My crime, they fear will gain.
Cold walls, steel bars - makes me frail...

" By the faith in our authority
And in faith to the fine aristocracy,
We sentence you to a lifetime in pain
- you, who possess wisdom unblessed!"

Who can tell who's already written in the book of death?
Who can tell whose destiny is already chosen?

Floating in emptiness...
Unholy powers - help me to die!
I will return to the source of all life...
... a universe beyond reality!

" He was a threat to the clergy of our time!"

I serve my time in Death.
My crime, they feel have gained.
Cold walls, steel bars - I have fled...
... into ageless rest!
