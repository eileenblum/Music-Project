Let yourself go to the
Kingdom of Sleep,
Where your mind is lost
In time before you wake.

Through the portal of your dreams,
Far within inside an unknown world.
Swept into infinity.

Far out of reach of human senses,
Distant and cold as a star
-let your dreams take flight!

The gate is open
Between your world and reality.
Disastrous dreamdust
And frozen fire's wrath.

All is as one for you
Who possess the cosmic key!

Dreaming all into emptiness.
Complete eternal oblivion.

Cries from destruction of the existence.
Universal grieve at the end of time.
