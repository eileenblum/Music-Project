The child must die!
Hear the mother's cry as the old man kneels before the Gods
- he waits for them, to give praise to them.
Wizards Of The Elements summoning the keys...
Crossing lines, seeing signs through visions in their minds.

The child must die!
Hear the mothers cry through the mantric chant of sacrifice.

The old man gazes to the sky
- turns around, falling blind to the ground...
They are here! They are here! The Elder Gods are here!

... The child must die...
... sacrifice...

Breaking through dark clouds
- the incarnation of them, and dismal shadows falls...

The worship grows into a thundery hymn
... and fills the night.

Blazing circles marks the invocation of them,
And creates a shadow dance...

" Spirits of Air... Worms of Earth
- bear witness to this deed!
Demons of Fire and the Slime in Waters
- bear also witness, to complete the keys!

From the Grail of Devote we pour thee, Elders of Divinity,
The flesh and blood and the very soul of this symbolic dawn;
Be pleased with this child as our sacrifice!"

The child is sacrificed!
Hear the mother's cry as the old man, blinded by the Gods
- in debt of honour for her, embraces her.
Wizards Of The Elements calling back the keys...
Crossing lines, blessing signs to make a martyr of this child!
