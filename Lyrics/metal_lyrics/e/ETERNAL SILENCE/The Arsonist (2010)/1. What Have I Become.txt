Fires burning on the horizon 
Flames as far as the eye can see 
Behold this burning image before you 
All life is engulfed in a fiery red sea 

One man's dreams 
And anothers desire 
To bury all life 
Beneath a pile of ashes 

Incineration takes its toll 
Fires rage beyond control 

Undying obsession 
To destroy his creation 
Watch the worlds cremation 
Succumb to death within the blaze 

The time has now come for 
The earth's rebirth in flames 
Wildfires surrounding 
There's no escaping me 
Longing to watch it burn away 
Only the embers shall remain 
Scorching the earth consuming all of life 
Cry out in vain 

My happiness is measured by your pain and suffering 
There are to be no fucking survivors - you'll pray for rain 

So the arsonist speaks 
And all shall heed the warnings from thee 
And the arsonist seeks 
To bury it all in a tidal wave of flame 

Longing to watch it burn away 
Only the embers shall remain 
Scorching the earth consuming all of life 
Cry out in vain 

My happiness is measured by your pain and suffering 
There are to be no fucking survivors - you'll pray for rain 

And buried beneath the ashes 
The dreams of the broken and dying 

I want to watch it burn 
I long to see you burn 
So the arsonist speaks.
