Here comes the new regime 
Behind the scenes as they pull the string 
Smokey mirror intent to deceive 
To make you see what they want you to see 

Years of deception at their hands 
You fall into their master plan 
The after lie too blind to see 
They have control they make you believe 
Now 
Make you believe 

NaÃ¯ve and innocent 
Deception their intent 
Assimilate control your thoughts 
Your freedom now is lost 
Fucking lost 

Deception the finest art 
Manipulate the masses 
Society torn apart 
Misled by those in control 
Deceived by authority 
The lies take their toll 

Look at us now 
We pay for their lies 
They just walk away 
Walk away 

Time after time 
The same excuse 
Trying to justify 
This sick power abuse 

Can it be 
It's happened again 
Enough is enough 
It's time for this to end 

Deception the finest art 
Manipulate the masses 
Society torn apart 
Misled by those in control 
Deceived by authority 
The lies take their toll
