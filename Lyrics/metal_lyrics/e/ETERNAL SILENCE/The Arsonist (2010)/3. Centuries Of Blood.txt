Suffocating
Hard to breathe
These walls surround me
I cannot be
Have dreams been shattered
Or just begun
Decades have come and passed
I must remain strong

One can only hope
That this is not the end
Reach into obscurity
To find myself again

Festering within me
The anguish - the pain
Can this ever be
Or will I feel ashamed

The endless sands of time
Can smash one's desire
Not to wither away
Into days gone by
With every breath
I feel it crawling near
The end of our time
Is becoming clear
From the beginning
One's life becomes a test
Who will rise above
And who will be much less

Forever I will be
Aspiration to the dream
Into a burning past
This fading destiny

Believe in me
I am the one
Sickened and vile
For you I have come
For it is you
Who makes me hate
To feel my pain
Suffer again

What have I become ?

(What have I become)

What have I become
Reaching deep inside
This empty shell of life
To grasp what is mine

Fucking doubt me again
I'll bring you to your knees
Pray for your soul
You're my fucking disease

Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
I sentence you now
To an endless life of grief

You are a waste of life
Forever now, I'm your pain
Never again will I fall
Weakened by my shame

One can only hope
That this is not the end
Reach into obscurity
To find myself again
