Itâs been a thousand years 
A millennium of destruction 
Stained by the bloodshed of man. 
Another senseless war 
The death toll still rises 
As history repeats itself again and again. 

Nothing is learned from mistakes that have been made before. 
Body count rises theyâre just casualties of war. 

Another soldier killed for reasons still unknown. Left behind, just memories. 
Still trying to figure out what the fuck weâre fighting for. 
Fuck these foreign lands. 

We are all numbers, just part of the governmentâs plan. 
Soldiers still falling, the bloodstains on their hands. 
Nothing is learned from mistakes that have been made before. 
Body count rises just casualties of war. 

Never (never) (never) again shall existence be erased. 
Broken (broken) shell of a man just a number to be replaced. 
Suffer (suffer) (suffer) no more as the firing starts to cease. 
Never (never) (never) again will you be a casualty. 

Itâs been a thousand years, a millennium of destruction. 
Stained by the bloodshed of man. 
Another senseless war, the death toll still rising. As history repeats itself again and again.

Nothing is learned from mistakes that have been made before. 
Body count rises, just casualties of war.
