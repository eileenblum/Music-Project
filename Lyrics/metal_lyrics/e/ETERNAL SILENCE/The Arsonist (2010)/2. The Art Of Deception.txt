You kneel down before the father 
And call out his name 
"Anything you ask of me" 
"I shall obey" 

You will never find the strength 
To release what lies within 
Plagued by the words 
Forced on to you from him 

Tears of despair 
Fill my eyes 
Spreading within me 
My hate grows stronger 

Filth and corruption 
Intrude my mind 
Tearing me apart 
From inside 

The epitome of hate 
Scars your soul 
Lies and deception 
Mind control 

Forgive me father 
For now I shall sin 
Released to the world 
Your reign now shall end 

I seek my redemption 
As I end your life 
The tables now have turned 
As it's your turn to die 

Now you hide behind your collar 
A servant faithful to your god 
Defiling the young at will 
Neglecting so-called laws 

The dominance you once possessed 
Is overcome by fear 
The desire in which you obsessed 
Will soon be laid to rest 

Tears of despair 
Fill my eyes 
Spreading within me 
My hate grows stronger 

Filth and corruption 
Intrude my mind 
Tearing me apart 
From inside
