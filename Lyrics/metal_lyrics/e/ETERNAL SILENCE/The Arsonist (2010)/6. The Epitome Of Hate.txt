Bow down to the centuries 
As you drown in your own bloodbath. 
Bodies butchered and defiled. 
Wiped out in the aftermath. (aftermath) 

I hear their screams 
As they beg and suffer. 
Itâs not a dream. 
Slowly you die from torture. 

You run for cover as they approach. 
Sentenced to die, firmly they grasp your throat. 
Thereâs no escape now, the end will soon be here. 
Victims left slaughtered, no signs of life appear. 

Centuries of â¦. Centuries of blood. 

No remorse in their eyes. Ignored are the cries, as the slaughter begins. 
Soon there will be nothing left, just visions of death. Will this ever end? 

Bow down to the centuries 
As you drown in your own blood bath. 
Bodies butchered and defiled. 
Wiped out in the aftermath. (aftermath) 

I hear their screams 
As they beg and suffer. 
Itâs not a dream. 
Slowly you die from torture.
