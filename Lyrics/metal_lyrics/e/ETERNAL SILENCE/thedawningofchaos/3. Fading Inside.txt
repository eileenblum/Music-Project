Severed from reality
Mind taken away
Ungodly torture
Terror and dismay
Fading inside
Will this be the end?
Dreaming of darkness
Screaming again and again
Endless thoughts
Invade my mind
Consume my soul
Cannot be left behind
A nightmare becomes reality
The struggle now begins
This reality will not possess me
I must fight to win
Thoughts of the past
Become so clear
Visions of hate and love
Are now visions of fear
I must not let this control
The power from within
Suppress the enemy
It will never live again
