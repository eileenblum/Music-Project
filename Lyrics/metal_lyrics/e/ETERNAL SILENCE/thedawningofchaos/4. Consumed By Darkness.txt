I can see the light
Slipping away
I can feel the darkness
Descending on me
Can this be for real
My life is ending
There is no escape
Consumed by darkness
I begin my journey
To a place I've never been
Soul released from my body
To the land of the damned
Mortal life now ending
As my spirit starts to rise
I await my sentence
As my body dies
I look at my body
Lying lifeless
Confused at what I see
There before me
There is no explaining
The torment within
As darkness consumes me
Consumed by darkness
I no longer live in this world
My existence wiped away
Written is my final chapter
Now the darkness consumes me
Consumes me
