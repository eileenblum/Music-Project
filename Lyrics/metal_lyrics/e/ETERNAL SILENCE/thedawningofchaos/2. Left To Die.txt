Lying on the ground
Lifeless as I'm close to death
Beaten and left to die
I struggle to take my last breath
Trying to save my life
Unconscious unable to move
Blood loss is killing me
Slowly I'll die from my wounds
I was left to die
I was left to die
Raging adrenalin flow
Evading my victims demise
I told you if you fuck with me
You're going to pay the price
Eyes gouged from his head
Teeth are hanging by threads
Gravel shoved in his mouth
Body covered in red
Intense suffering
Within his eyes
Bleed, motherfucker
Until you die
