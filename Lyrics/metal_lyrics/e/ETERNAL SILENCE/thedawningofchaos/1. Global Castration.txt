Slaughtering 
The faces of humanity
Like a sickness you invade
Obliteration
Servant of a false god
Scarring innocent minds
Through generations
Onward, through the path of the weak
Corrupting all that is real
Abomination
Running
Thick in your mind
The enmity to mankind
Global Castration

Misleading prophecies
Of the afterlife
Falsifier
Prepare for your demise
It is you that I despise
Worthless fucker
Agony
Awaits your soul
I've lost all control
Annihilation
Suffering
And agony
Through eternity
Retaliation
Soulless-Deceived into the system
Dominate-In the end you will fall
Mindless-Revenge will overcome
Envious-The power will enthrall
Slaughtering
The faces of humanity
Like a sickness you invade
Obliteration
Servant of a false god
Scarring innocent minds
Through generations
The end has yet to come
For now you will hide
Into the shadows
Running 
Thick in your mind
The enmity to mankind
Global Castration
