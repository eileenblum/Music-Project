Iâm not expected to be perfect, thatâs far from what I am.
To have the weight of the world pushed down on your back;
that itâs so hard to maintain a steady pace.
In this world of imperfection, Iâm not meant to fail.

Iâm not expected to be perfect in this world.
Iâm not expected to be perfect in this world.

I will not fall short again and slip through the cracks of time.
To be picked up by my brothers at my side.
I will not fall short again and slip through the cracks of time.
To be picked up by my brothers at my side.

To call out to Him and ask for His forgiveness.
A glimpse of perfection, a glimpse of what I have become.
To call out to Him and ask for His forgiveness.
A glimpse of perfection, perfection.

Thereâs a certain date you are born.
Thereâs a date youâll eventually die.
What happens in between, goes in eternity... eternity.
Thereâs a date that weâre all born, and die.

Accept His presence, let Him into your life.
Accept His presence, let Him in your life.
Accept His presence, let Him into your life.
Accept His presence, let Him in your life.
