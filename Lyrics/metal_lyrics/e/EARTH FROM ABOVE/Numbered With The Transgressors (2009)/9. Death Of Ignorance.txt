What has happened to our integrity?
Weâre suffocating in a sea of emptiness.
Our integrity has shattered, fooled by the lies and promises.
Our integrity has shattered, fooled by the lies and promises.

Reeled in the traps of villainy.
A greater evil is ignorance.
Why should we follow, when we should lead?
Take His hand.

Annex the condemned.
Bring them to light.
Their blood is on our hands.

The skies are painted red for a reason.
The skies are painted red for a reason.

This is my desire to honor You.
I am growing weary, so carry me!
This is my desire to honor You.
I am growing weary, so carry me!

When battle lines are drawn and vast conflicts arise, we stray from the truth.
Weâre cowards in our fight.

Those who do not fear death, will not die!
Those who donât fear death, will not die!
Those who donât fear death, will not die!

This is the death of ignorance.
This is the death of ignorance.

This is my desire to honor You my God.
Without You Iâm weary, so carry me in Your arms.

We werenât robbed of our faith, we threw it away.
But now Iâm taking it back to make a difference.

This is my desire to honor You my God.
Without You Iâm weary, so carry me!
