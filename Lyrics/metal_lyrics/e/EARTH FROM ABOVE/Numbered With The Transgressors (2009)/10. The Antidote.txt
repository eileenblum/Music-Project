We were raised by a belief system that fails to pour out the truth.
Do not be misled.
Your faith in Christ will save you.

Your antics donât impress me, you really donât impress me.
Do not be misled.
Your faith in Christ will save you.

So slowly yet surely, this disease begins to demean us.
All along, the antidote was there.
So many of our hearts have been broken.
Far too many lies have been spoken.

The Gospel has power to change these lives.
There are no words left for all of mankind to utterly describe how merciful and
noble the Father is.
Yet your filthy testimony has suppressed the love that has been so gracefully
given... given.

The times that we have wastedand the lives that we have taken away.
In the end weâre all dying, dying for purity.
The times that we have wasted and the lives that we have taken away.
In the end we all are dying, dying for purity.

We were raised by the belief system that fails to pour out the truth.
Do not be misled.
Your faith in Christ will save you.

We are walking bombs.
Who will save us from our demise?
We are walking bombs.
Who will save us from our demise?

Iâve got news for you.
Iâve got news for you.
Iâve got news for you.
Iâve got news for you.

The burden has been lifted.
The burden has been lifted.
The burden has been lifted.
The burden has been lifted.

I deserve hell for what Iâve done.
I deserve hell for what Iâve done.
I deserve hell for what Iâve done.
I deserve hell for what Iâve done.

But the blood of Christ has washed away my shame.
But the blood of Christ has washed away my shame.
So why stand here so filthy?
But the blood of Christ has washed away my shame.
So why stand here so filthy?
But the blood of Christ has washed away my shame.

I deserve hell for what Iâve done.
I deserve hell for what Iâve done.
I deserve hell for what Iâve done.
I deserve hell for what Iâve done.
