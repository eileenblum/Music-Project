Numbered with the transgressors.
In our realm of self-arrogance weâve all gone astray.
Each of us going on our own distant way.
With wicked hearts and filthy souls, we put our faith,
we put our faith to the test,
we put our faith to the test.

How foolish we were.
Weâve turned unto men in search of a new dawn.
This feeling of deceit has never felt so strong.
My God, save us now!

Took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows.
Yet we considered him stricken by God.
Pierced his bruised body alongside the afflicted and the broken, and mocked for
him to save himself.
How can we be foolish enough to think, that this man is not the One we seek?

If there ever was an example of a perfect being; this is Him.
If there ever was an example of a perfect being; this is Him.
If there ever was an example of a perfect being; this is Him.

You stood there with your beauty and all your majesty.
Beaten and mocked.
Yet you never denied us.
Crushed and broken.

Yet you never denied your love for mankind.
Put to death by the ones you came to save.
Led like a lamb to the slaughter.
Led like a lamb to the slaughter.
Led like a lamb to the slaughter... slaughter.

Wise men foretold of this Savior.
One whoâll conquer it all.
The freedom of all, paid for by the price of none, but One.
"You were sold for nothing, and without money you will all be redeemed... be
redeemed." Sinless.

Put to death for sinners.
Lord show us the way.
Teach Your Church to love.
Cleanse our generation.

He will give Him a portion among the great, and He will divide the spoils with
the strong.
For He has poured out His life unto death, and was numbered with the
transgressors.

Our redeemer.
You bore the sins of many.
Our redeemer.
You bore the sins of many.
