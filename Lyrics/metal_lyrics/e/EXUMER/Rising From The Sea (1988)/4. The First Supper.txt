Incantation summoned from below
The sacrifice is given, the power will grow
Drink from the head the purest blood so red
Take my flesh and break it as your bread
We sit at this first supper
Planning the fall of your world
Our time is growing near
The human race has much to fear 

A dark spear through the heart
To destroy and tear your world apart
The seven ministries from sight they flee
Now you have realized your soul belongs to rne
So weak are your people
Believe so true in their king
Out he will be banished
With a swoosh of my wing

We're going to take over your world - the first supper

Will you feel the power from my empire, the first supper
You must listen to my words
Eat the fruit from the tree of evil, the first supper
Have no fear, then your mine

Live with me, down in hell

Heed the decisions of the infernal regions
Branded for death, show the scar on your head
You have been judged and the sentence been set
To die a slow death was the best you could get
Steal your life and devour your soul
Exist in my land where I'm in control
Your guardian angel turns and goes away
For it knows you will die today

We laugh at your pleas as we sit here and feast
Stare into the mirror and gaze into the beast
Don't ask for forgiveness, don't try and repent
You've already done the damage, it's your testament

Pass through the gate, your name is written there
Perish underground, there we will await
You can be a witness of this violent overthrow
Watch as they all die in this apocalyptic show
