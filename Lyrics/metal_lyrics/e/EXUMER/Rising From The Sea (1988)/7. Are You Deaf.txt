I'm trying to speak, but you just won't hear
Are you paying attention, is there something in your ear
Come on stupid, why can't you comprehend
Did you just hear anything that I just said?
What the hell is wrong with your fuckin' head?
No - asshole! I told you my name is Fred

Are you deaf?
I'm sick of repeating myself
Are you deaf?
Might as well as put your head on a shelf
Are you deaf?
I've only been talking for an hour
Are you deaf?
It's like speaking to a fuckin' flower
Are you deaf?
Goes in one ear and out the other
Are you deaf?
Why don't you listen you stupid mother
Are you deaf? 

Maybe you should think about cleaning your ears
How long has it been - a couple of million years?
Doesn't seem like you have anything upstairs
I've had better conversations talking to some chairs
I'm getting pissed, you sure are acting lame
Hey shithead, this aint no fuckin' game
