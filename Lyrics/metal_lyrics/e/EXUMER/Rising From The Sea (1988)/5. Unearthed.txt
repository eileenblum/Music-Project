Enter into the cemetery
More specimens are in need
We steal during the night
And leave the hole defied

Unearthed ... who'll know that you're gone
Come with me, your body will be put to good use
A medical malpractice, let's experiment today
Wait for a death, to make another trip
We're getting close, the projects are getting better
Cranial defusion, study of the brain

We try to bring back the dead
And revive them from the grave
Live again, not below the ground

We work with the dark, gone in the light
Put together parts, you'll live again someday
Fill the veins with the fluid of life
Feel the heart as it pumps again
Jolt you with electricity, see the corpse jump
Start to move, our task is complete

No witchery, just plain chemistry
Our creation has escaped, rampaging through the night
Terrorize the town, the people want him dead
His fear of the flame was the only defense
He'll live again once he's been unearthed ... today! 

I have been called a mad scientist
They don't know what I've brought from below
It's life breath will soon begin
They shall all pay, we'll have our revenge
If you're alone in the wood he will be there
We'll remove your body and bring it back with care
