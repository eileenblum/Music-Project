Together they ride to the sea
They hear his call and obey
It is time and the ritual has begun
To summon up their chosen one
Rising from the sea

Knowing that the time grows short
Indulgence from his ceremonial court
Reading from the dead sea scrolls
Feel the power as it unfolds
Rising from the sea

A benediction from the high priest
A timeless spell can now be released
The chant from a circle prayer
The sound of homage fills the air
Rising from the sea

Arisen from his perpetual rest
Exhaling his first breath
Once more to control his clan
Awoken to claim his land
Rising from the sea

The revelation has been told in the past
It is written that this world wouldn't last
He would control with his race
There would be nowhere to run, no hiding place

His servants kneel by his side
Taking part in the genocide
Submission is the only way
Or with your life you can pay
Rising from the sea

Return to the ruins of birth
A place once before on earth
Now deep below the depths
No mortal has seen this place
Rising from the sea
