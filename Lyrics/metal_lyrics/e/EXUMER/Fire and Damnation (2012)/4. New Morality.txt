Don't need no reason don't need to fucking think.
I burn your house down and laugh when you can't win.

I hold you hostage when I steal your wife.
Don't beg for mercy this happens in real time.

Don't blame no one you could not know.
I'll put the trigger and the gun explodes.

I have the bloodlust born in urban veins.
And broken childhoods they might just explain.

WE RIDE - INSANE - DEFY

I will define the end of your time you hurt inside but know I decline.

Don't need no answers don't need know its sin.
I blast your skull of and watch you fucking sink.

I am the darkness that you all fear.
I have no heart see I make you disappear.

WE RIDE - INSANE - DEFY
