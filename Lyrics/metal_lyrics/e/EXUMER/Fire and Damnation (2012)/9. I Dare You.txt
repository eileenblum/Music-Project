Come on tuff guy, you talk so much shit
You run your mouth day and night, it's just a bunch of shit
Why don't you go and say it to their face
Instead of talking behind their back
All you do is tellin' lies, that's all you know how to do
Just keep fuckin' with me, I dare you!

You've got no clue, your head's up your ass
You just want attention, I bet you were the nerd of your class
Back up your words or shut the hell up
This time you're gonna learn because I've had enough
Turn and run as far as you can, you're gonna have to
Or you can stay here, I dare you!

You make me wanna puke, you're such a stupid joke
You brag that you can do this and that

I can see through your disguise, your master of lies
Get away from me, I can't see your face
Start to walk out, just get out of this place
You tried to bullshit me, but I knew
A fist in your mouth, rip off your face
Kick you in the head, you fuckin disgrace!

You're so stupid, don't know how to dress
Your hair hasn't been washed for about a month
Come over here and I'll give you a kick in the butt
You want to act so cool, you're out of luck
Why don't you just leave, it's the best thing you could do
Or stay another minute, I dare you!

Come on tuff guy, you talk so much crap
You run your mouth day and night, it's just a bunch of shit
Why don't you go and say it to their face
Instead of talking behind their back
All you do is tellin' lies, that's all you know how to do
Just keep fuckin' with me, I dare you!
