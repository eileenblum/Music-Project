Rise from the emptiness inside strings and chords I am high. Feel this arsenal of lust terror reigns sublime.
Close the open door behind, I crush your tiny throat. I freeze your face turns blue no remorse my only truth.

DEATH MISERY AND PAIN - WE'RE WAKING THE FIRE
LIES TORTURE SUPREME - WE'RE WAKING THE FIRE

What guilt could be my downfall can't hold back destroy you all. My hands grab snap your necks your time has come.
Don't resist the final stretch lights go out you are dead. My cum stains your little clothes keep them all I won't come back.

DEATH MISERY AND PAIN - WE'RE WAKING THE FIRE
LIES TORTURE SUPREME - WE'RE WAKING THE FIRE

Bring back them memories now bound and gagged I remember how foul, I shred through them innocent years in hell took away the fear.

I wait anxious to kill never enough I bend your will, stare in my eyes see nothing at all, no light no sense, no hope.
Rise from the emptiness inside strings and chords I am high. Feel this arsenal of lust terror reigns sublime.
Close the open door behind, I crush your tiny throat. I freeze your face turns blue no remorse my only truth.
