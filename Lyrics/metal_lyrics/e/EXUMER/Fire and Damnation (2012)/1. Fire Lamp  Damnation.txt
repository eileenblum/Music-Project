I break to your face and life, that's right. I know you said we won't shine bright.
I feel you will go down with the rest I check all your steps.
Obey only one and master's call I know that Satan will not fall.
I shed not one tear and destroy. Burn down heaven...

FIRE AND DAMNATION - WE WERE BORN

This game is mine won't let it go shred through you and all my foes.
Bend to none and never will I dominate in for the kill.
None divine and just pure hate lesson learned annihilate.
Demonic cause spread the vile bodies churned into a pile.

WE WERE BORN - FIRE AND DAMNATION

You will sink like dead weight. I have been here anticipate.
The end comes without a doubt you will see infernal clouds.
Obey only one and master's call I know that Satan will not fall.
I shed not one tear and destroy. Burn down heaven...

FIRE AND DAMNATION - WE WERE BORN
