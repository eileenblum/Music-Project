Shock the world like a beggar king lines are crossed when ruled by greed.

Pull you down in this hellish fire do not grant another tomorrow shedding tears only make me hollow take my hand let it go.

Mock your faith with machete and gun nothin's sacred the end has come.

Pull you down in this hellish fire, days and nights are filled with sorrow lest goodbyes on the killing floor shedding tears only we want more.

BURN YOU WILL DIE
BURN - DIMINISHED CRIES
BURN - WORLD TURNS BLACK
BURN - WE WON'T COME BACK

Your last breath is what we live for nothing stands when we're through.
Lost souls command me, I hate resent thee, my promise you die free THE DEVIL CHASER.

Shock the world like a beggar king lines are crossed when ruled by greed.

Pull you down in this hellish fire do not grant another tomorrow shedding tears only make me hollow take my hand let it go.

BURN YOU WILL DIE
BURN - DIMINISHED CRIES
BURN - WORLD TURNS BLACK
BURN - WE WON'T COME BACK
