Fighting warriors tear down their way
War gods crosses strike them down to pray
Screaming, captured souls call in poisoned lust
For blood they seek, they thrust
The key in hand to set their bodies free
Forceful eyes and they do catch me
My mind twisted in two, my throat is cut
Secret whispers speed, drive me nuts
I AM POSSESSED BY FIRE

Doors to eternity are open wide to go
Merciless powers, painful and slow
Demons in disguise, flames of sin
Forgotten armies, again and again
Haunt the enemy in the rain
The haunting begins in the middle of the ring
They walk through wood and snow
Hate in seconds it grows
THEY SAY: THEY WILL RISE TONIGHT
YOU KNOW: THEY WILL STEAL THE LIGHT
WATCH OUT: HOPE YOU NEVER SEE
BEWARE OF THE FALSE PROPHECY
THEY SAY I AM POSSESSED BY FIRE
AND THE FLAMES ARE BURNING HIGHER

I know my name is there written in fire, so beware
Keep away all these thoughts from my mind, let them rot
Peace and rest is what I need, for hours now I had no sleep
There is no chance I will survive this night, time has come to fight

Got the feeling the end is near [?] he will die tonight
Facing death but I feel no fear [?] he will die tonight
The one I face will he be the one [?] he will die tonight
It is my fate I know when he is done [?] he will die tonight
