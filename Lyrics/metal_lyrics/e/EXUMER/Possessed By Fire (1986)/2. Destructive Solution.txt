Killing flames on the streets
Pushed down now you bleed
Minutes of death without control
Again you pay on parole

Make a stand, be strong
Hide yourself, that is no wrong
Time has come to survive
Long before the clock strikes five

COME, OBEY [?] DESTRUCTIVE SOLUTION

The master leads your way
First you cry then you obey
He decides of life and death
Now take your last breath
