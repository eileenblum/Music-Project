From unknown worlds into the twilight zone
A new star will rise before the dawn
Buried dreams, the planet sets free
A thousand screams, a nightmare you will see

Time comes, finds it way
From lies you betray
Fire burns in your flesh
Sun moves, starts to crash
From ashes and of dust
Hidden wishes, cries of lust
Crashing world without sense
From the one you have got to glance

XIRON DARK STAR

Once you are there you can't return
Don't go in this you'll learn
Feel the fear, no one cares
A place like hell? a nightmare
