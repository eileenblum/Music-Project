City's right to burn
Live like no return
Leading our way
Nothing left to say

Fading sorrows all alone
Fear of self it is getting blown
Sirens you can hear them call
No more power, soon we will fall

Praying in the night
A light is shining bright
Feelings you once had
We are lost in sin
Hide your face and grin
What is the command
Hours of the living dead
Tells you how to move your head
That is the way it goes
Pray you will loose society
Now it is time you lie to me
Lock up all your doors

Do you like being killed
I can see the lights you tilt
This is the answer you will know
Reign of sadness, here we are
You can't stay here without a scar
That's the way we have to go
