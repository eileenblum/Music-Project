Going through the back streets of the waking town
Fighting is coming easy when hate is all around
Kill my heart, feel my force
Bending sound of the lords

Screaming for the murders living in the night
Darkness spreads slow when you turn off the light
Break my will cold and fast
Rip my heart, make it last

TAKE THEM AWAY, LIGHT UP THE DAY. BURN!

From the sky tonight they will come
Take my life, hit and run
Crystal balls shine like dreams
Hear the lies, louder it seems

Paid off my deeds
Long time ago
Feel now my needs
From down below

Sorrows of the judgment, these are the words
Freedom after ages, break the endless course
Blades of steel, fear comes down
Nights they cry, to be found
