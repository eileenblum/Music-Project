Come near, I will be your master
Takes a while, then you will see disaster, right

Down in this hell I know you
I see, I feel I have got you now

COME AND GIVE ME YOUR HAND
AND I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO THE DEATH [?] NOW
COME AND GIVE ME YOUR HAND
AND I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO THE DEATH [?] RIGHT NOW!

Can`t you hear the nation on its knees
Begging for mercy, asking you please
After the horror you won`t exist
A bitter cold feeling about this
Nuclear warfare, the first strike
Nuclear Armageddon, never seen something like
Scary the winds, the winds of hate
Dead and naked bodies, that is their fate

Welcome, welcome, welcome to the silent? DEATH!
