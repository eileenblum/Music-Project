It's all insane, no legs, no arms
What kind of torture is to live this way?
No words I can speak, on a floating mind
The calm I asked for is at my reach

Yet mankind still let me
Scream in my pain for silence
Yes mankind, I'm disabled
Scream my veins for solace

Your gods
My enemies

What faith is left, what did I leave behind?
So many questions, have I been reborn?

You know, I've gone, and loss will be memorable
Maybe for some, and maybe too soon
I've lost all importance, locked in a cage

Worlds I've conquered, is this the way I end?
I did lay my trust on...
Your gods
Your enemies

Your gods
My enemies

Carnivores of faith, your sweet pure seduction
Such a disgrace for the sake of the race
I'm a dead man alive

What faith is left, what did I leave behind
So many questions, have I been reborn?
