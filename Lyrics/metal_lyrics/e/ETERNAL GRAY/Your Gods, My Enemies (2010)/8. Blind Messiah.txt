Angels halo have shattered to pieces
Now my Gods are nothing but a passing vague of a memory
Finger nails as claws, worshiping the flawless only for his own

Blind messiah, empty promises
Kept us away for far too long
Blind messiah, empty promises
Kept us away...

He will sell the world if he can
Spread the words they want to hear
Represent everything I hate
The beauty in silence is the sweetest vengeance

Beauty....
Silence...
Sweetest...
Vengeance...

Blind messiah, empty promises
Kept us away for far too long
Blind messiah, empty promises
Kept us away...
