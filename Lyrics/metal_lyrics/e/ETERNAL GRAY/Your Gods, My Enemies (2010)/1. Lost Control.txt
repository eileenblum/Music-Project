Lost control of myself
Its lunacy in active mode
Triggering violence out of hibernation fort
It's out of my limits...
Capacity of hate in shape of fists
I am blind to...
My...
Rights...

Aiming at the targets
One by one they will fall off
Singular overdose
This moment will not be remembered
As a loss for mankind

Short and sweet,
Senses turned on, high adrenaline,
Unstoppable psycho minds
On the loose, vital sign
I'm self potential hate with no regress
Decimate
Detonate

I am blind to your rights...

Categories of fear
The time is now
With the pain in my veins
Madness, less the sorrow

No control within myself
Abandoned vigilant
Eye hates the screen today
My pulse is throbbing higher
I scream the pain you'll never set it free
I scream the wrath you always kept within

You always kept within

Aiming at the targets
One by one they will fall off
This moment will not be remembered
As a loss for mankind
