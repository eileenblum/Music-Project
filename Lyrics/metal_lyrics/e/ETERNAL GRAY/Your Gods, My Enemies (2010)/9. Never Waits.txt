It's the scorching burn
It's the blazing hate
It's the foulest of a virus nature

Repeating history
For artificial words of...
Non-compromised human being

Age of thrillosophy, age of pleasure
Wide open space for nature to evolve

There is no one else but myself
I'll show you pleasure, like no one knows
Stating facts push away from unwanted truth
So I lied, to ease the pain
And I lust, for all I care
Never waits, never trust
Never to stand still my own score to settle

A battle!
When my own desire turned on me
Mountains of faith collapsed
(Predatoria)

Now it is time for self destruct
Believing in words I rephrased
My own ideology

Manipulative as can be
This beast should never be unleashed
I evolve to rebuild my desires
Over your needs
So I lied, to ease the pain
And I lust, for all I care
Never waits, never trust
Never to stand still my own score to settle

Predatoria
