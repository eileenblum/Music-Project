Unlabeled!
In my four walls, a king in the castle
Keep it shining, my ivory tower
No self respect to others
And none above of dignity

These days, it's hard to keep in-sane
I dope myself when pain-attrate

I'll fight critics with my fists
(Untouchable...)
My creation is to be protected
(Dear to me, less to others)
High-end words I choose
Refined words and overtones
I am above all, unique
One of a kind

Politically harmonized, cocaine nurturing
Physically balanced, will it be for eternity?
Painting it black, with inner demons
And reflection for your reality

I fight the critics with my fist
No matter what the cost
No matter the humiliation
I am just stating facts
One day will come it will stab you in the heart

Passing decades till realization
Passing over, just passed away
You can't criticize me
I shall retaliate

Don't stare at me
I'm not here to deliver you peace
I didn't write this
So you will redirect my ache

Just don't
