Inner anger, inner peacefulness
With two faced run colliding in between
Silent servants, power preacher
Fiction is raging inside this mortal coil

Shifting in between, anxiety taking in
Another breath for cancer
Another toke of pain
With so many ways to die

Where did I lose the will to live?
With whom did I choose to live?

Armor me; this is war where I am at

Countless rage, mind's rage
Raging in this mortal coil

Inner war

Endless challenges till the end
And what end would it be?
Did you die in pleasure?
Or did you die in vein (sic)
Did I mislead you in my way?

For your realm I die!
For my realm you'll die!

Where did I lose the will to live?
With whom did I choose to live?

Armor me!
This is war!
