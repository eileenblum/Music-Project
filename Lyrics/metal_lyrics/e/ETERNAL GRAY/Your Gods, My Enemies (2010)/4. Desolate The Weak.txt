Come now, jump into the sea of glamorous goals
Come child, dive into the depths where disproportion 
Is a disease
Nothing to suffer for, 
Countless needs
Devotion to the core

Assembly of scavengers, 
Nothing is disposable
Be a protagonist 

I will...
Desolate the weak

Win the grace of a few to scream forbidden words
This will is rejected for the sake of convenience

Repaving the concrete underneath
Revising and rising beyond your outer reach
On the hunt no loose ends

Desolate the weak
Demanding attendance, special needs

I will...
Desolate the weak

Seems like your trip is heading to its completion 
In the manners of equilibrium

Win the grace of a few to scream forbidden words
This will is rejected for the sake of convenience
