Waking up screaming 
The desire to die 
Instead of killing myself 

I'm searching pain and strife

Imagine the scent, imagine the sight 
A world gone and perished a world turned to ice 
My darkest whishes brought back to life 
Inflicting pain-trough a knife

Killing you was easy 
Watching your heart die 
A needle glazed with evil 
No one will hear your cry 
Punching trough your flesh 
My sick mind needs to play 
My work will not be done 
Until your last breath will be mine

Nauseous from all, sickened from all that breathes 
The last breath won't be taken 
Stopping it I will

[Solo: Dory]

Waking up screaming 
The desire to die 
Instead of killing myself 
I'm searching pain and strife
