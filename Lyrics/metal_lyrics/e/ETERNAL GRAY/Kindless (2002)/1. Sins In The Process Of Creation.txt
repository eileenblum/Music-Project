Wrongs, the things I have done - sins in the process of creation 
Sinking my own thought inside - in a pool of UNrestless darkness 
Condemned to never know - if the death I inflicted on others 
Should be the same judgment solving my own life

Increasing pain I seek no forgiveness 
My death will be as all 
Killing my soul slowly the mind sees to exist 
Chained, nailed 
STRAPPED BY MY SKIN

This feeling of remorse - this sickening vain inside 
Never resting - until I die

I found the evil in me-the evil that's inside my soul 
No longer shall I resist-keeping my soul inside

Increasing pain, I seek no forgiveness...

Inflicting pain 
Discovered my true meaning in life 
All souls will be redeemed 
When my mind sees to exist

[Solo: Dory]
[Solo: Eyal]

All souls will be redeemed 
when... my mind sees to exist

Increasing pain, I seek no forgiveness...
