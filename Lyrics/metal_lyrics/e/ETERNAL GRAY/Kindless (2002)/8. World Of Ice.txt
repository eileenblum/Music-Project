World full of lies, people turned to ice 
We trust our faith to desecrate all existence 
Of our lives 
Drawn into the down, into eternity that is now gone 
No more will, yes, no regrets, of what we are 
And what we've done.

It's hard to reveal the secret of the sanity 
That fades away 
It's hard to decide now whom we will kill 
And who will stay.

Now when it's too late, to change our minds 
And take things back 
The world we built the world we shaped 
Turned its back- manipulate. 
You - fools of god, we're full of hate 
You - beg your lives, but no more mercy 
I'll show you the gate - to hell

It's hard to reveal the secret of the sanity 
That fades away 
It's hard to decide now whom we will kill 
And who will stay.

I cross my heart and realize it has gone, 
We turned to soldiers in a war we haven't done ...again 
I seek the truth beyond the wall - it's non exist, 
We have the power to change - we drawn into the mist.

World full of lies, people turned to ice 
We trust our faith to desecrate all existence 
Of our lives 
Drawn into the down, into eternity that is now gone 
No more will, yes, no regrets, of what we are 
And what we've done.

It's hard to reveal the secret of the sanity 
That fades away 
It's hard to decide now whom we will kill 
And who will stay.
