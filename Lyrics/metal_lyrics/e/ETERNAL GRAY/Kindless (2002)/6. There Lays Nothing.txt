Why should we awake, to a world in 
Which everybody is sleeping? 
What will we see when we will open our eyes? 
The sinister creatures spreading poison in us.

Darkness, showing us its path, 
The way to nowhere, the way to a world - 
A world of waking dead winds, 
That is blowing us to the promised lies.

Look at me and tell me what do you see 
Deep in my eyes there lays nothing. 
Feelings is only a word that I've used, 
And nothing has left, no hope anymore!

Tomorrow is not promised to anyone...

Watch my soul burning - fading again 
Seeing the world ending - torching my eyes 
Fight your dark wishes - blinded by sin 
Empty spirits surrounding me - all filled with lies

Look at me and tell me what do you see...

Blinded by sin - you fools...

Tomorrow is promised to no one...

[Solo: Dory]

Seeing the world ending - torching my eyes 
Fight your dark wishes - blinded by sin 
Empty spirits surrounding me - all filled with lies 
No hope anymore...?
