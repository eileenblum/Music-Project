Absorbed my spirit to darkness 
Left my being to rot away 
Into fleshless lost 
I seek a cross - nailing myself for humanity

Punishment in its purest form 
An expression of minds so deformed 
I am pleased from the pain - releasing my soul 
RETURN TO THE PLACE I ONCE LOST

Again my joy turns to sorrow 
And sorrow turns into rust 
My soul has now left - the spirit deceased 
I return to the place I once lost

Punishment in its purest form...

When I do find others, and find them I will 
The starting of a religion long lost 
Fear me they shall not, fearing nothing but sins 
Casting their own flesh aside

Now that you're all with me - given me your life 
A war needs to be taken - THE UNBELIEVERS DIE

Making them repent 
Repenting with their life

With me you shall come my chosen friends 
Never will you be lost again 
We return to the place in my mind 
The place you once lost - NEVER AGAIN
