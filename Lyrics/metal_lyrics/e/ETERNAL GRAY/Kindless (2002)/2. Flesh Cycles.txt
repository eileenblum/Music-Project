Darkness falls within my eyes 
An ever-dark dimension in my mind 
For every moment sores soul-pain 
Without fear I walk towards vain

Walk towards the light 
Stopping all life 
For your death came soon 
And the cycle starts again 
No looking back 
Sleep, wayward soul 
Wresting my breath 
Cycles turn again

Break free with me and I'll break all your walls 
Embed your self to me, I'll give all you ask for 
Fear me and you'll never know the truth 
I am powerful, I am your soul!

Walk towards the light...

This grief will never be again 
Just thoughts some day fulfill, my wish to never be 
No more these cycles keep re-turning 
For every turn our soul keeps burning

Walk towards the light 
Stopping all life 
For your death came soon 
And the cycle starts again 
No looking back 
Sleep, wayward soul 
Wresting my breath 
And the cycle starts again
