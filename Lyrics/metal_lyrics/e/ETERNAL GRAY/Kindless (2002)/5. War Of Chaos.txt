Disaster plagued upon the earth 
Denying all you were-your life, the past 
Condemned your brothers to die 
War of chaos-point of no return

Disaster plagued, destroyed the earth 
War of chaos- war of fate 
Into thin air the souls were crushed 
Poisoned harvest of the lives-no trust...

Only at the end 
When death will triumph 
The last souls will be free 
When humanity extinct

Disaster plagued upon the earth 
Denying all you were-your life, the past 
Condemned your brothers to die 
War of chaos-point of no return

[Solo: Dory]

Only at the end 
When death will triumph 
The last souls will be free 
When humanity extinct
