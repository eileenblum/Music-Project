[Solo: Eyal]

Fools, with no repent you keep on preaching 
The hate I feel through ears receiving 
Only sadness at that time 
When friends became my own disease 
Feeding on my soul, I find it hard not to ask why 
Condemned my self to never feel 
Though parting I absent mourn at all

Speak no more of all these words 
The just my ears need to be served

Stupidity reeks from empty lies 
unleashing germs unto the sky 
The air polluted form mind disease 
Spread around the evil lives 
Harsh words from empty mouths 
Yet still heard all around 
Need you not I shall not listen 
Serenity within myself

Speak no more of all these words 
The just my ears need to be served

Sacred is serenity 
And gray the path need to be taken 
Forever I am in the middle 
Eternal gray with no regrets 
Speaking only to be heard 
Your words penetrate my brain 
Another cell just burned away 
Causing me to feel just pain

Never shall I listen to my heart alone 
Thinking only of what good occurs 
Triggered to spawn from within 
In sickness you stand afflicting spreading around 
Forever sealed my ears from your lies 
Thoughts, words and looks all die
