Black toxic haze killing smoke
Blasts your bones, burns your skin
Storm of merciless death kills
Faster than unleashed hell

Eternal darkness without a dim of light
Unclear vision because of blazes bright

A Hellish reign comes from the skies
Lethal winds ride ,killing who is still alive
Dead bodies underneath crumbled land
Killing storm its a dead man's fate

Killing storm

Winds of torture cast upon the land
Soil turned to venomous sands
A storm of hate kills you and me
An innocent society destined to die.
