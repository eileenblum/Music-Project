Human wastes destroy the landscapes
Nature dies from the pollution we made
Back skies kill because the acid rain
Crying out another life is dead

Poisoned biosphere
Toxic atmosphere

Living the present but we're killing the future
Abusing mother earth consuming air
Lack of nature resources but we're looking for more
Fear of the reflections, but it seems we don't care

Deformed at birth
Organic drained

Out of our mind, think we have full control
Living hell, the earth is gonna explode

Poisoned biosphere
Toxic atmosphere.
