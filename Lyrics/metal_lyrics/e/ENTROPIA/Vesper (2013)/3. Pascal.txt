One single wager and victorâs mask fell to her grace
Black rose. Wearing a crown of thorns
Her scarlet gown brought a glow
That I believed to be my saviours mark
Black rose. A prodigal loss

Life became at once
As muddy water
Slowly running
Through our fingers

But if we could walk along
Your hand in mine
We would burn in Pascalâs fire
A beautiful demise
