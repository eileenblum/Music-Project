(Nikola Tesla: You're familiar with the phrase "Man's reach exceeds his grasp"? It's a lie. Man's grasp exceeds his nerve. Society only tolerates one change at a time. The first time I tried to change the world, I was hailed as a visionary, the second time I was asked
politely to retire. So here I am enjoying my "retirement". Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier, what you want is simply expensive.)

My eyes are the paddlewheels of steamers
And my heartbeat turns the tide
That feeds propulsion
Tension growing
Tubes glowing
Copper wires become nerves

Rampant tempest will incinerate those fossilized minds
But my dreams will take a thousand seasons to grow
Remember all nights I've wept electric tears
The second coming shall reveal the light
