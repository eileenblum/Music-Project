A castaway on a distant shore
Never meant to find a source
Of pain once distant and internal
Of loss at the core of being
Te void that teases me
That lurks over my shoulder
The deafening silence
Radiating to the steady signal of the beacon.

Secks of sand
Sarks of reason
Hllow splendour

A soul lost in limbo
Tenfold euphoria
In this moment of clarity
I am giving birth to the other side.

Witness chastity of the paradise once lost
