WHY IT'S SO HARD TO SEE
THAT YOUR SCENT DECEIVES ME
I AM PRONE TO BE
DEVOURED BY MY OWN KIN
WHY IT'S SO HARD TO SEE
THAT GODS LOVE DEFEATS ME
WHEN EARTH IS DONE
NO HEAVEN SHALL COME
BUT WORLDS WITHOUT END
I'VE BUILT WITHIN MYSELF
THE DREAMS WITHOUT SENSE
OF CONJOINED HANDS
BONDED WITH PARADOX

DOUBLE HELIX DANCE
VIRGO CLUSTER TOMB
HELIOCENTRIC DOOM
DIVINE GRAVESTONE
