God do You hear me cry?
Do You hear me crying?
Do You hear my cry?
Do You hear me?

Out on deep water
With nothing to hold on to
I've been attacked by storms of disillusions
Vessel of isms that was my security
Has now become a wreck

Waves of indifferance
Forcefully they crush my hope
I see no point in struggling for survival
But in the distance
There is a light so bright
A glimpse of hope in sight

Lighthouse, shines
Salvation is at hand
It is the Saviour my light His name is Jesus Christ
It is the Saviour it is the light
It is the Son of God

There is a lighthouse
That shines to guide my way
So I may find the harbour of salvation
The Son of God is
Reaching out His hands to me
Saved by the Trinity
