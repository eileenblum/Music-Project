I'm enthralled by this force
Priceless peace altering my mind
Essence of higher life
Infiltrates my spiritual being

Perfect state of mind [x2]

Grace divine comes to me
Silent God moves within my heart
Giving me certainty
Now I am a fragrance of life

Perfect state of mind [x2]

Having knowledge of He who guides me
I see through your empty and hollow lies
You can never separate me from Him
My spirit is forever in His hands

I bring forth praises
To He who reings
He is my perfect
State of mind
