[Music: O. BÃ¸rud, Lyrics: O. BÃ¸rud]

And I watch how your big words
Return with an echo of emptiness
Inside your walls of fear
Feeding the insecurity

And I watch as your soul
Swallow the blackest lie
Resurrection rejected
Denial of afterlife
Symptoms of a blind man

To comprehend the insanity
Of this grand illusion
Is unbearable

The spirit that fears the Blood
Can never bring truth
Fallen with the snake
Never to rule

And I watch you return to your folly
As a dog returns to it's vomit
The choice has been made
Abandoning the call of freedom
