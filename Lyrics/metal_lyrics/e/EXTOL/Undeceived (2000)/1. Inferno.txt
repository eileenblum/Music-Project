[Music: O. BÃ¸rud, Lyrics: o. BÃ¸rud]

The result of a failure
Genetic error
A system out of control
Creative energy
Transformed into hatred
A twisted perception of truth

Mankind breeds mortality
Sickness passes on through generations
The effect shows through genocide

Malfunctioning minds

A bite of the fruit
Termination activated

This creation once destined for success
Now violated and raped by one
Given access to the heartland
Evil dominion over their spirits

Divorced from it's creator
Crying out
