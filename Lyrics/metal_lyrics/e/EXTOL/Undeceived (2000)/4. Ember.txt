[Music: O. BÃ¸rud, Lyrics: C. Espevoll]

There is a fire to light a sleeping heart
A wish to see the spirit take control

Crush the chains that hold you down
And let yourself be filled with fire
Wake up and realize the dream you've lived
Was set up by the liar

A broken heart, a kneeling soul
The spirit will set you on fire
To give you strength to reach the ones
Who search the truth with a deep desire

Crucifixion of the ego
Death and burial of the old

Crush the chains that hold you down
And let yourself be filled with fire
A broken heart, a kneeling soul
The spirit will set you on fire

There is no spiritual authority
Outside obedience to God

A broken heart is needed to reach this state
Divine encounter with the living God
