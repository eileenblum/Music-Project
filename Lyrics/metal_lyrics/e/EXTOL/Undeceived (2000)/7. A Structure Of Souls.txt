[Music: O. BÃ¸rud, Lyrics: O. BÃ¸rud]

A fusion is conceived / Through a synchronizing Faith
Exposing forces unseen
This is the embodiment of Love

Growing, the image of a man appears
His limbs are injected with power
The heart of his mission is peace / And deliverance

Stronger, his body increases with strength
Absorbing a Godly nourishment
The members work in one accord / Reaching the fullness of man

A Structure of Souls / Bounded by one Spirit
A union of hearts / Saved by the same Spirit

We are the members of / The body of the Son
We are the Church of Christ

Freedom is to be our destiny / Due to the eternal grace
That comes from the Author of Life / The one and only God
