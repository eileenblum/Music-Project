[Music: O. BÃ¸rud, Lyrics: P. Espevoll]

She lies in her bed staring into nowhere
Tears running down her face
An open wound bleeding
Her body turns pale

Recalling the road leading away from right
As the dark had appeared as light
Tricked to cross the line, dragged further in
Then trapped in a swirl of wicked lies

Now, no sign of light, no sign of hope
As a dark shadow enters her room
A freezing chill runs down her spine
The presence of death fills the room

The shadow encircles her, pale of fear
Slowly draining the last drops of life
Her last strength she forces through
And cries out to the Lord she used to know

Overwhelming light annihilates the dark
Immediate rest fills her heart

My dear child, come to Me
I will restore you and embrace you with My love
