[Music: O. BÃ¸rud/C. Espevoll, Lyrics: O. BÃ¸rud]

I can hear a signal from the center of my soul
Ignite the impulse of life
Make a change of patterns in the
Landscape of the inner man

Obtaining a new perspective on life
Discovering a new dimension of Freedom

Renewal

A penetrating power claims dominion in my being
Leaving the old man to die
The presence of a spirit is reflected
By the wave of change

Recharging power / Receiving strength
Renewal of mind and soul

I have established contact
With a higher form of intelligence
Giving me wisdom and insight
A complete restoration of my spirit

A revelation of the truth
Effects the way I'm thinking
I am part of Your plan
I will let Your Spirit move inside me
Like a Breath of Life

I send out a message to the souls still searching
Invite the Maker of Life
Let Him be the guidance to
Complete your life in every way
