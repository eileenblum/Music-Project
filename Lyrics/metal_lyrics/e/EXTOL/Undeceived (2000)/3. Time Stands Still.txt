[Music: C. Espevoll, Lyrics: C. Espevoll]

Temptation
Temptation

Time stands still
The whisper in my ear
The spirit within
A struggle destined to fail

Infested thoughts
Spirit contracts
Lust dominates
Fallen once again

Frustration accumulates
Anger towards the fraud of the world
Anger towards the lack of self control
Condemnation, immediate repentance

How much can You take?
The disappointment of my deceit
Pain
Disobedience to Your will

Of my weaknesses I'm desperately aware
Do I even dare
To repent again?
Why (would you) endure the pain?

Prisoner of filthy chains
Unclean, unclean

Help me God
Set me free
