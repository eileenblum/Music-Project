[Music: O. BÃ¸rud/C. Espevoll, Lyrics: P. Espevoll]

I close my eyes
It's not the picture of You I see
The impressions, the sight, the thoughts
Are stuck into my mind

My vision is blurred
I can't see clearly
I can't hear Your voice
It's all disturbing my peace of mind

Something inside tearing me apart
Trusting myself to find the way out
Leading me just deeper into
A well of confusion and mourning

There is nothing else for me to do
But to put my hope and trust in You
I know You will lead me through
When my eyes are focused on You

Let me dwell in Your shelter
Let me live in Your shadow
Free me from these destroying plagues
Your faithfulness is my shield and protection
