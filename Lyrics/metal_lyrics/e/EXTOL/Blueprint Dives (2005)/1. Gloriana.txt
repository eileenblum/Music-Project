You are sweet as wheat
And white as wool
The depth of your eyes
Goes deep into the night
I want to embrace you
Let myself go
Into your tender kiss
With hands inviting me
You move with wedded bliss
Oh, place your hand
On my soul
Your name be gloriana
Touch me still
For by grace be you only
You are
And your name be gloriana
Your calm ways clear my mind
Drive me towards you
You protect me from myself
Your breath inspirits me
Your hair blows through my face
You remove it from my lips
Your name be gloriana
