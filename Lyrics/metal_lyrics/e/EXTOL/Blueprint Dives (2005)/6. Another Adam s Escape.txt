Silence, be silent
Don't make a sound
Don't let me find you
I'll take you down
Fear me, don't come near me
Flee from my sight
Truth makes you tremble
And you know I'm right
Run and hide
Inside your safe self-constructions
If you let me come too close
I'll question your values
Your dreams and self-image
I'll tear down your fences
I will make you see clearly
And love you so dearly
Run for your life as you know it
