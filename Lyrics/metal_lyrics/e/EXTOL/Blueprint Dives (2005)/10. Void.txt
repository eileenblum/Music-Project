Sometimes
Just like when
The seasons linger
I slowly find myself
Undercurrent
Within the vortex
Of our time
Come closer
Whisper your name
Lean over
I wish you would stay a little longer
Sink into my ear
Your words I pray
Will keep me safe
And my flesh
A little warmer
The void I sigh
When I hesitate
The cold outside
I will undertake
Otherness
I sense the motion
My catatonic shell
Clad in fire golden gray
To all others
You are a stranger
Veiled in mistery
Uninvited thief
Bringer of light
Drift into night
Soar on the wings of a new dawn
Where winds blow
In houses of hollow
And water runs
Through statues of salt
