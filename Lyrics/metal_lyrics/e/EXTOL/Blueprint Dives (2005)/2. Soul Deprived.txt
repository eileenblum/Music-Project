Confined I'm confined
Straightjacket
Strapped to my side
Entangled
In motion I'm bound
In suspense
Seclusion alternates
Only between hope
And delusion
A victim of substance
And anchored prey
Who will not live
To see the day
The devil lies below
I am deprived
Light blinding
In my eye
He uncoils his claws
And clasps my nature
And to grasp my soul
He stretches his life out within:
In trade for freedom
In change for designs
His demons consume
The death sedative
I see them fly
Through the sun
Of my eye
Then comes the way
He slides along
Quietly listen
Into the deep
Mouth of the venom
Planting his teeth in
The poison remedy
While demons swarm
