It starts from within
Confess, repent, let go
The truth will set free
Let the holy power
Ignite the fire inside
The spirit will trigger
Vanished dreams in your life
Face your life
No need to fake
The light will let you see
Reversal
Hearts on fire
They will see
Through the love between us
Deeper, more profound
You will have to choose:
Hiding inside
The masquerade of death
A transparent life
With a burning heart
