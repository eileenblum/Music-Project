[Music: O. Brrud/D. Husvik, Lyrics: C. Espevoll]

Immediate gratification of desires,
The meaning of life
This propagator of a
Consumeristic lifestyle,
So seemingly benign

This is your entitlement
Living an affluent life
A scrap conduction
A shallow state of mind

The delusion of their raison d'etre
Being nothing more than the
Accumulation of mere things,
Driven into the consciousness
Of precious young minds

An instrument for turning of the brain,
An instrument for death
Compellingly perverted to create
A reality for hiding truth,
Creating a window for
Spiritual blessings on sale

No arduous sacrifice or demands
No restraint of passion
No spiritual disciplines, No God!

This is your religion,
Feeling without intellectual content
This is your religion,
Nihilism 2002!
