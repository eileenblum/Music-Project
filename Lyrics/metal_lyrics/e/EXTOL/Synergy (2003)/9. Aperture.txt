[Music and lyrics: P. Espevoll]

Will you be there when I call? Will you be there?
Will you be there when I fall? will you be there?
Will you be there? [x2]

Will you be there when the darkness has no end?
Will you be there when the light descends?
Will you be there? [x2]

Yes I'll be there when you call out my name.
Yes I'll be there - I'm your light, take my hand.
Yes I'll be there... I will be there...
