[Music: O. Brrud/J.R. Mjlland/D. Husvik/C. Espevoll, Lyrics: C. Espevoll]

The worship of creation
Seeming endless
But it will end
And every knee shall bow

Thoughts of a coincidental existence
And a futureless world corrodes into the
Spinal chord of the narcissistic man
A paradigm shift for worse
My ego is my god
Given authority by the enlightenment
Of science,
The enlightenment of the age of freedom
Freedom - the name in which we legalize all
The name in which we tolerate all

Credibility for truth, image for substance
Weakness and failure
- unbearable elements in life
Subtly opposed through an endless flow of
Constantly replaced trends, neither allowed
To mature nor to fade
The surroundings,
A mirror reflecting the signals
Of admiration that makes my identity
A constant egocentricity providing a
Purging of anything threatening popularity

The peak of this shallowness
Displayed by the so-called stars
In their quest for self-actualisation
This beautiful people experiencing
The illusion of narcissistic prosperity,
Uncritically and boundlessly admired,
Simply for their own sake
