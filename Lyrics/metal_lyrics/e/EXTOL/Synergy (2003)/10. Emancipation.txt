[Music: O. Brrud/C. Espevoll, Lyrics: J.R. Mjlland]

The Plague threatening the status quo
Imposed afflictions between
Leviathan and the divine
Who's to blame
And who's to say it isn't so?

Emancipation
Beyond the bare bone
Liberation
Of spirit and soul

The unclear course of nature
Violations, separations
For every action and reaction
A matter of consequence
Ways of changing the score

But the Lord comforts me more
Than the riches of the earth
The cares of the world
For the purse is a dead cause
Far worse than woe
And carries the stamp of human vanity
