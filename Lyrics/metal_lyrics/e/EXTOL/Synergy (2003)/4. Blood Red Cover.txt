[Music: C. Espevoll/D. Husvik/O. Brrud, Lyrics: P. Espevoll]

Life, an abandoned wreck
In motion, driven into circles
Never ending circles
Nothing new has taken place
Seems like this place will never change

Just a mercy child
In a blood red cover
Just a mercy child
Covered in truth

A roller coaster of feelings
Steering whatever thought and action
Into a pattern
A pattern repeated

Remove the veils
The glory seems weak
The heart needs the light
Of your glorious presence
Regain control
Of this powerless wreck
Let it complete the course of life
