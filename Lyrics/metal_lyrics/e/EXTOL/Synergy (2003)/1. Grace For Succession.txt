[Music: C. Espevoll/O. Brrud/D. Husvik, Lyrics: C. Espevoll]

Man - born with the nature of evil
All inherited the sin from Adam
No man escaped
The commandments - the law
No one were able to fulfil
No man was pure
Everyone's share was death
All was dark - hopelessness ruled

Light intervened
Annihilating darkness
The path of salvation made clear
For the prodigal human race

Given to mankind
For all to receive
The sacrifice of life
For all to believe

This unnatural act of love
A model for succession
The act of forgiveness
A supernatural force
