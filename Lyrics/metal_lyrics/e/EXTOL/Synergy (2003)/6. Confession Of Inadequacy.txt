[Music: O. Brrud/C. Espevoll, Lyrics: C. Espevoll]

The incomprehensibility of
A love so pure
Too good to be true
It seems

This preposterous act of empathy
Unveiling my insufficiency
The will of God accomplished
Redemption revealed

Realize, repent, receive
Confession of inadequacy
Initiate, admit, believe

I am not my own
- I belong to he who sacrificed
The glory of eternity and fullness of peace
To fathom this mystery
Is beyond what I can express
That he'd endure this path of pain

Realize, repent, receive
Confession of inadequacy
Initiate, admit, believe
Freedom

The incarnation of the one I am?
Inverting the course of history
Hiding the kingdom in the heart of man
For him to share the grace of God
