[Music: O. Brrud/C. Espevoll/D. Husvik, Lyrics: J.R. Mjlland]

And so it's the end
The hollow end
So speed the process
Again and again
Move as fast as you can
Like the wind
On no end

Horizontal flickering
Like flash before my eyes
Recurring pictures
The holocaust
Over and over
Burnt into my mind
Like bright stars

I will deliver
Your work shall be forever
I will endure
Keep my strength in you

Memories fade
Cease to pause
To measure time
To treasure day
But when I see it
The way I see it

I swear the scissors have moved
At a distance - in space
The constellations have changed
