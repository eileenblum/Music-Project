Embraced by evil
In this world of hate
Searching for love
That was not there

Nobody gave me
What I was looking for

The shadows fell before my eyes
And all of a sudden
I could only see black

Hate became real
Partaking in evil ceremonies
Worshipping the beast
Mocking God and His servants

Depression weighs upon me
With its strangling hands
I'm looking for a way out
As suicidal thoughts enter my mind

Surviving in a mysterious way
With demons haunting me
Every time I close my eyes

Embraced by the spirit of life
Accepting the sacrifice
That fills my heart with true love
The only way to be whole
