Behold He comes from the cross
Where He suffered for our souls
Behold the King of Life
Is entering the fields of death

In the dark empire of death
A light is shining through the mist
As the Lord of Life and Death
Enters the gates of pure evil

By the sight of Him
The demons are shaking
And the power of darkness flees
And death for His feet is slain

Predetermined through the ancient prophecies
The incarnation of God and His victory
Over death through purity and holiness
His name is forever to be praised
