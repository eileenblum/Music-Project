Twisted intention
Lucifer, the highest angel
Wanting to overthrone God
No impurity tolerated in God's presence
Like a lightning
Falling down to earth
With his angels now appearing
As pathetic demons of hell
Sly and malicious
Filling man with lies
Greed and perversity
He loves to watch you die

Beware of the vicious serpent
Suffocating the world with poisonous hands
Intoxication of twisted views
On Christianity and the Lamb of God

He knows where you're weak
And tries his best to make you fall
Endless attempts, well aware
That he failed two thousand years ago

I'm washed in the blood of Jesus Christ
I'm holy, justified by the Lamb of God
Mercy was given undeservedly
The blood was shed, the pain endured

The battle is won
But still going on
To complete true justice
