The biological struggle is coming to an end
Tears and sorrow in the eyes of the beloved

Spirit rising,
Underneath a carcass
Marked by the signs of time
Floating away
Into another dimension
Travelling with the speed of light

Reaching a wonderful place
Under a deep blue sky

No fear, no pain
Just peace and harmony
Majestic music
Filling the air

Millions of colourful flowers
Covering the ground

A tall companion
In shiny white clothes beside me
A warm dazzling light makes me feel whole
As all my longings are satisfied
By the power that runs through it

I bow down to the source of the light
And I hear a vigorous voice

"Well done good and faithful servant
You have been faithful with a few things
I will put you in charge of many things
Come and share your Master's happiness"
