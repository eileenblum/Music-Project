Let me drift within your reach
Where I'm blameless and pure

Hold my hand - move forward
Take me to the gates of righteousness
Lead me on - by Your word
Enter through the gates of righteousness

At the threshold of reconciliation
To the land where nothing separates
From the promise of protection

Hold my hand - move forward
Take me to the gates of righteousness
Lead me on - by Your word
Enter through the gates of righteousness

Evidence of the ancient declaration
Once dead - detached, elevated
To live by the faultless law of liberty
My darkness drowned in the depths of the sea

Open up the gates, I will enter
Open up the gates, I will enter through the gates

I'll enter through the gates - the gates of the undying
I'll leave everything behind and enter - enter

Hold my hand - move forward
Take me to the gates of righteousness
Lead me on - by Your word
Enter through the gates of righteousness

Liberty - Undying
