[Limited Edition Bonus Track]Anxiety, fear
A life in chains
A clammy hand that grips the heart
Squeezing the joy out of everyday life

The perishable will clothe itself with the imperishable
The mortal clothed with immortality
O' death where is your victory?
O' death why is your sting?

Inadequacy, shame
A notion of being small, nobody, nothing
A pain from deep within
Knowing I'm not the one I should have been

Loneliness, emptiness
Withdrawing into myself
Confused about truth
Lost in the egocentric sphere of my pathetic life
O' death where is your victory?
O' death why is your sting?
