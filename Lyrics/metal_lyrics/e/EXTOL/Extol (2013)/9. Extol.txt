I've found peace
Your Breath of Life strengthen my bones
In my deepest desperation and fear
Your presence within my heart

Above all else You stand mighty and terrible
Yet gracious and compassionate 
Slow to anger and of great mercy
Until the day I take my last breath
My soul will praise the Lord, and everything within me
Extol His holy name

Your Breath of Life strengthen my bones
In my deepest desperation and fear
Your presence within my heart
Restoring power everlasting

When I call upon You, You never abandon me
You preserve my heart
You invite me to a place of comfort
Lover of my soul, Prince of peace

Generations past and generations to come
All will speak of Your sovereignty
There is no end to Your splendor
Your kingdom and power everlasting
