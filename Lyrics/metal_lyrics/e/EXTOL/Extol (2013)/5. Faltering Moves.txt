Provider of so much care;
I'm aware of my shortcomings
In my sight, all pointed out
How can spoken words be kept
And my heart be unburdened

Still You're here - come, surround
Oh I welcome You - come, surround

Will Your eyes be upon me
Despite my distorted being
Will Your presence follow my faltering moves
Through times of failure

Yet I know Your light represents something anew
Affirming my value
With light comes certainty
Exposing the light from the enemies around me
With light comes awakening
The visible truth

So sick of being held back
My mind is still paralyzed
Am I haunted - will they ever leave me
The attacks bring afflictions to my weary soul

Still You're here - come, surround
Oh I welcome You - come, surround
