Pure and clear, Majesty
Endlessly, turn your gaze to me

Behold, the Sun
Surrender to its will
My face a reflection 
It will surely shine

Light so sweet, cover me

Truly the light is sweet
A pleasant sight it is for the eye
To behold the Sun

Omnipresent, never fading
Captivating, nowhere to hide
Energizing, fulfilling

Circling at distance
We're all left here, showered in light
Everything is so clear

Light so sweet, cover me

Revitalization, illumination
Come energize, spiritize
Colorize, mesmerize

Sun persist, turn your gaze to me
Through the mist, turn your gaze to me
