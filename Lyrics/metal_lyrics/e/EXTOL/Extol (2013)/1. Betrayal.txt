Living amidst filth and dust
Crawling in mud searching for scraps
Excruciating stench of decaying remains
Constant starvation, a state of nothingness

Failing the overlooked, the ignored
Betraying the least of my brothers

You see them shivering, in solitude
Excluded, Imprisoned, defenseless
You see them tortured, abandoned
Laying on the ground left for dead

Failing the overlooked, the ignored
Betraying the least of my brothers
Failing Me

A refugee in a strange land
Mistrusted and hated
Human beings denied fundamental rights
Exposed to fear and intimidation

Desperate cries of dismay - isolated
Like worthless creatures - nonexistent

Betrayal of the outcasts
You are the accursed goats herded to doom 
Turning away from the sight of the needy
Turn away from Me, to a place for the wicked
