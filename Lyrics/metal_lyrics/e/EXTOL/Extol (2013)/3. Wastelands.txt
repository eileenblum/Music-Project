Inside dark, suffocating shades
Behind black blinds
A price to pay
Pains of becoming a lesser man
Suffer from doctrines 
Stuck in my head
Lies from the pits of hell

Dwelling in wastelands
Lead me to the deepest wells
Never poisoned by the world
Grace, the only nourishment

Forced through the desert
The burning heat strips my motives
What is the true nature of the heart?

Dwelling in wastelands
Lead me to the deepest wells
Never poisoned by the world
Grace, the only nourishment

Will my own good salvage my soul
Will I follow to where You are?
