In a place of peace and confidence
Bring us to complete unity

Adopted, chosen - seekers of light

May all be one, like You are one
So we can see the glory of the Son

Conversion - a new perception of reality
Relinquish - in pursuit of relief, unyielding peace
Despised, rejected - for the sake of a name

Wisdom, vigor - transposed to the willing
Unveiling the obscure - the concealed truth
Anticipated Messiah - visible in the flesh
Believing, accepting - inseparable Father and Son

May all be one, like You are one
So we can see the glory of the Son

Guidance and strength - provided to endure
Alienated, separated - yet part of the scheme
Purified by blood - protected from malice
Enabled to testify - declaring eternal life

In a place of peace and confidence
Bring us to complete unity
You have overcome the world
A new way for humanity
