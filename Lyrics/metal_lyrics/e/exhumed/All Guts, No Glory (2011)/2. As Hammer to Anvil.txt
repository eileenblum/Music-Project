Pulverization- bones snap, break, and rend
Trituration- truncheon falls again and again
Castigation- dumbstruck, dazed and contused
Excruciation- blackened, bludgeoned, blinded, and bruised
As hammer to anvil
As hammerâ¦
As hammer to anvil
To anvilâ¦
Agonized- pummeled, crushed, pounded, and beat
Tenderized- cringing, battered human meat
Traumatized- painful, unbearable, ceaseless throbbing
Brutalized- thrashed and subjected to quite a drubbing
As hammer to anvil
As hammerâ¦
As hammer to anvil
To anvilâ¦
Forging death, upon this human anvil
Prepared to smite as I raise the handle
Writhe in pain, at the hammerâs blow
Hammer fells, like tolling bells
Ring out their dull and pounding knells
The final sounds, youâll ever know

[Lead - Wes]

I smash your brittle bones to powder
Screams crescendo ever louder

[Lead - Matt]

Your shattered torso now gone to bits
A puzzle of pieces that no longer fit
As hammer to anvil
As hammerâ¦
As hammer to anvil
To anvilâ¦
