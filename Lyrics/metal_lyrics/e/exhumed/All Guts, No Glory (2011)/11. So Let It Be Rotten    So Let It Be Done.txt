Desensitized to the necrotized, a trompe-lâoeil made zombified
Mocking death mask for the mortified -deformed
Repellant rite now sanctified, pallid parody of the putrefied
In formaldehyde death now baptized - reborn
The sickening sight now sanitized
In celebration of the demised
Death unrevealed - decay clumsily disguised
But behind the lurid, leering eyes
Decomposition will arise
So let it be rotten - so let it be done
Behind the shroud decrepitude begun
So let it be rotten - so let it be done
So let it be rotten
So let it be rotten - so let it be done
So let it be rotten

Immured deep within the absurd, beyond the pale obscenely blurred
Rigor mortis sets in undeterred - putrescent
Embalmed in lugubrious repose, as from within you decompose
Unmoved by orchid, lily, or rose - quiescent
The distasteful scent lurks just beneath
The truth of death lay out of reach
Its cold caress - would curdle funeral wreaths
But beyond the mendacious mask youâll see
Putrefactionâs perfidy
So let it be rotten - so let it be done
Within the casket, decay has claimed its throne
So let it be rotten - so let it be done
Death worms its way into the corpse its work begun
So let it be rotten â let it be done
