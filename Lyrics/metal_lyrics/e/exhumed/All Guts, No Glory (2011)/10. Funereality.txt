Necrotopian vision of a world deceased
A tumescent carcass upon which the morbid feast
The salubrious veneer pulled back to reveal
A gruesome hulk of rotting meat where fluids congeal
Truth - without beauty
Cruelty - without beauty
Funereality
Global mass-grave for humanity
Where the ghoulish feed on atrocities
Funereality
Immersed within a miasma of carnage
We chew our way through a quagmire of human garbage
This world belongs to the maggots, weevils and grubs
Who gladly join us in the graves that weâve so eagerly dug
Truth - without beauty
Cruelty - without beauty
Funereality
The mass-grave grows exponentially
The voracious feed as the rapacious bleed
Funereality

[Lead - Matt]

Our destiny manifest only in autopsies
A landscape of monuments and cemeteries
Befouled air smelling thick of the crematory
Our deadened world laid to rest permanently
Truth - without beauty
Cruelty - without beauty
Funereality
An abattoir of grotesqueries
A planetary mortuary
This is funereality
