This olidous odyssey
A macabre descent
Through a mass of necrosis
To reach beyond the end
Suppurative cessation
An ending in gore
Pathological obsession
To reach the rotten core
Tangle of bowels I now unravel deep within
Lost in this carnal labyrinth
Tumescent hive, or just a human rubbish bin
Lost in this carnal labyrinth, I rot within
Serpentine intestines
Their coil unwinds
Mortuous vexation
Is all there is to find
Repugnant, reeking maze
That seems without egress
Enterotome, chisel and bonesaw the keys
To open the abscess
Tangle of bowels I now unravel deep within
Lost in this carnal labyrinth
Tumescent hive, or just a human rubbish bin
Lost in this carnal labyrinth, I rot within

[Lead - Matt]
[Lead - Wes]

Quagmire in pus
Livor Mortisâ aftermath
Posthumous waste
Culling human chaff
The grotesque grip
Of deathâs dissolve
Ensnared in entrails
The puzzle unsolved
Tangle of bowels I now unravel deep within
Lost in this carnal labyrinth
Tumescent hive, or just a human rubbish bin
Lost in this carnal labyrinth, I rot within
