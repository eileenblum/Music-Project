I see the world through cadaver eyes
Sickened by the sight of all that I despise
Rotting mass devoured by maggots and flies
A ghoulish feast upon the necrotized
I see the world through cadaver eyes
A sucking grave from which nothing will rise
Too late weâve just begun to realize
All that we touch, we cause to rot and die
The ichor in which weâre immured
Clotted, purulent, and impure
Infected well past any hope of cure
This is the world that I see
Decaying for the feasts of parasites
The human wreckage whets their appetites
In the polluted carnage they delight
Our flesh their fetid fantasy
Their fetid fantasy
Through cadaver eyes - the shroud torn back
To view the carnage at which we hack - bleeding black
Through cadaver eyes - see only death
The putrid truth of what is left - rotten flesh
Inhale the crematoryâs noxious reek
Savor the stench of a world deceased
The taste of slaughter that our palettes seek
To dull the buzzing in our brains
Taste the blight fester within your flesh
With every mouthful that you gasp for breath
Revolted by this wretched world grotesque
And every horror it contains
Every horror it contains
Through cadaver eyes - the shroud torn back
To view the carnage at which we hack - bleeding black
Through cadaver eyes - see only death
The putrid truth of what is left - rotten flesh

[Lead- Wes]

Through cadaver eyes - the shroud torn back
To view the carnage at which we hack - bleeding black
Through cadaver eyes - see only death
The putrid truth of what is left - rotten flesh
All the world is a cadaverâs eye
We crawl like maggots from beneath its stye
Engorged we consume, to be consumed in time
A noisome plague in both death and life
