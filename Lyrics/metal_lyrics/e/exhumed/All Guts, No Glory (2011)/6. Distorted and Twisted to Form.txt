Life made to imitate art
Disfigured features re-sected upon being torn apart
My cubist rhinoplasty has left you defaced
Any semblance of dignity erased and replaced
The face of death staring at you is only your own
Distorted and twisted to form
The medium of meat, tendon, sinew and bone
Distorted and twisted to form
Eye-sockets rerouted, now to re-wire your shattered jaw
Aesthetic mutilation leaves facial tissue red raw
Gouged, cleft and hacked, now youâre drastically deformed
Through your grisly countenance, as an objet dâart you are reborn
The face of death staring at you is only your own
Distorted and twisted to form
The medium of meat, tendon, sinew and bone
Distorted and twisted to form
Sightless eyes - gaze vacantly at the monstrous face in the reflection
Chiaroscuro realized - Obscure art incarnated through unnatural selection

[Lead - Matt]

Disintegrating death masque - leering features rearranged disgustingly askew
The work of a hack - your visage gleams with the moist sheen of sanguine and sinew

[Lead - Wes]

The face of death staring at you is only your own
Distorted and twisted to form
The medium of meat, tendon, sinew and bone
Distorted and twisted to form
