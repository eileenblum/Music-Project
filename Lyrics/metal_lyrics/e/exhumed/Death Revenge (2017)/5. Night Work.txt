[In which Dr. Knox makes the acquaintance of Misters Burke and Hare, Resurrectionists by trade

"The bulk of the work was done at night, using wooden shovels... and a "dark lanthorn" â a device commonly used by burglars: designed to shed light where necessary, but not to attract attention... A hole would be dug at the head of the grave, down to the coffin, and hooks or a crow-bar inserted under the lid. The weight of earth on the rest of the lid acted as a counter-weight, so that when pressure was exerted lid invariably snapped across, and the body could be hoisted out of the grave with ropes."
âRuth Richardson Death, Dissection, and the Destitute 1987

"The corporation of corpse-stealers, I am told, support themselves and Families very comfortably, and that no-one should be surprised at the Nature of Such a Society, the late Resurrectionists in St. Saviours, St. Giles's and St. Pancras churchyards, are memorable Instances of this laudable Profession."
âAnonymous A View of London and Westminster 1728

"Blest be ye man [that] spares these stones,
And curste be ye [that] moves my bones"
âWilliam Shakespeare's epitaph 1616]

[Hare:]
Welcome to our nocturnal vocation
Disembalming we grimly extract the expired
Disinterring by lanthorn illumination
To fulfill anatomists' cadaverous desires â

[Dr. Knox:]
Giving Nightwatchmen fits
With the mortsafes you've picked
Finding fresh graves to dig,
I must say it's a hell of a gig

[Chorus:]
Night work be done,
The lifeless made graveless, our prize to be won
Exhumed by torchlight, dead weight dead to rights
This night work, an unholy sight, undertaken tonight

[Hare:]
A livelihood in death we scrape
Your casket vacant, corpse taken forthwith
From our fell spades you will not escape
Second coming ignominious, unclean and sick â

[Dr. Knox:]
Wooden shovels and picks,
From your tomb you'll be nicked
Sink to new depths of sick,
Compunction cut to the quick

[Chorus:]
Night work be done,
The lifeless made graveless, our prize to be won
Exhumed by torchlight, dead weight dead to rights
This night work, an unholy sight, undertaken tonight

[Solo: Matthew Harvey]

[Dr. Knox:]
It's a dirty job, finding fresh graves to rob

[Solo: Michael Burke]

[Dr. Knox:]
These are dirty deeds, six feet of dirt, dug dirt cheap

[Solo: Matthew Harvey]

[Dr. Knox:]
It's a dirty job, finding fresh graves to rob
Toil as the casket's slaves, death is our living wage

[Chorus:]
Night work be done,
The lifeless made graveless, our prize to be won
Exhumed by torchlight, dead weight dead to rights
This night work, an unholy sight, undertaken this -

Night work be done,
The lifeless made graveless, our prize to be won
Exhumed by torchlight, dead weight dead to rights
This night work, an unholy sight, undertaken tonight
