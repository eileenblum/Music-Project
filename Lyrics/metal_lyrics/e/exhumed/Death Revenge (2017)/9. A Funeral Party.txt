[In which a shocking discovery is made in West Port, Edinburgh, the repellent nature and lurid details of which stun and shock the city to its very core

"...a most extraordinary circumstance that took place on Friday night, the 31st October 1828, in a House in the West Port, Edinburgh, where an old Woman of the name of Campbell is supposed to have been Murdered, and her Body Sold to a Medical Doctor."
âEdinburgh Broadsheet 3rd of November, 1828

"Up the close and down the stair
But and been with Burke and Hare
Burke's the butcher, Hare's the thief
Knox the boy that buys the beef"
â19th century Edinburgh skipping rhyme]

[Hare:]
Follow me to my humble lodging
What's mine is yours, such as it may be

[Dr. Knox:]
Enjoy the hospitality, soon you'll be cold dead anatomy

[Hare:]
Along the narrow, crooked wynd
Then through the close, this house you'll find

[Dr. Knox:]
So many honored guests to fete, always an empty bed to let

[Chorus:]
A funeral party

[Hare:]
Drink up, the hour is growing late

[Chorus:]
A funeral party

[Dr. Knox:]
The fete will end when you meet your fate

[Hare:]
Here you may rest from your journeys
And warm your bones with a dram of whiskey

[Dr. Knox:]
Drink to what's left of your health, soon you'll be another corpse to sell

[Hare:]
Intoxicated, the room starts to spin
And at that moment our night work begins

[Dr. Knox:]
Quietly asphyxiate, you see your end, but far too late

[Chorus:]
A funeral party

[Burke:]
Drink up, the hour is growing late

[Chorus:]
A funeral party

[Dr. Knox:]
S tuff the carcass in a crate

[Narrator:]
All revels must come to their end
So for the constable the tenants send
False friends meet most unpleasant ends
The corpus delicti now made evident

[Chorus:]
A funeral party

[Burke:]
Step inside and have a quaff

[Chorus:]
A funeral party

[Hare:]
Where guests soon shuffle off

[Chorus:]
A funeral party

[Narrator:]
Protests of innocence rebuffed

[Chorus:]
A funeral party

[Narrator:]
The life of the party â snuffed
