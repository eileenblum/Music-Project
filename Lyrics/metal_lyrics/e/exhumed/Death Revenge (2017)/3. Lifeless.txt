[In which the boyhoods of Dr. Knox and William Hare mold their decrepit destinies

"...From my earliest childhood I have been a dreamer and a visionary.... I have dwelt ever apart from the visible world. Well did I come to know the presiding dryads of those trees, and often have I watched their wild dances in the struggling beams of a waning moon â but of these things I must not now speak. I will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets...."
âH.P Lovecraft, The Tomb]

[Dr. Knox:]
Mem'ry haunts me clearly
The winter of my thirteenth year
Wind moaned through headstones dreary
A siren song only I could hear
A fevered brain infected
Where terrors spawned each night
A young man grew dejected
A waking dream, a fright amongst frights

[Dr. Knox:]
Though my symptoms at last abated
And the coughing fits did surcease
An insalubrious nature gestated
Breeding malaise, a subtle disease

[Narrator:]
Then with each passing breath
In life, he dwelt in death
[Dr. Knox:]
This truth I now confess:

[Dr. Knox:]
A morbid mind obsessed
Unhealthy thoughts depressed
By cryptic dreams possessed
To ever dwell among, the lifeless

Lifeless!

[Hare:]
A casket-builder's low-born boy
Child of the grave in name and fact
Grey days and nights in dark employ
Set destiny 'pon its deathly path

[Hare:]
Dismissed as morbid youth
Obsessions quite uncouth
Led to unpleasant truths

[Hare / Dr. Knox:]
A morbid mind obsessed
Unhealthy thoughts depressed
By cryptic dreams possessed
To ever dwell among, the lifeless
As all life ends in death
So with each passing breath
My destiny professed
To ever dwell among, the lifeless

[Dr. Knox:]
Into the family crypt, I stealthily crept
Knowing not what I sought 'mongst the mold and the rot
A sight that was not soon forgot
And as I lay in the grave, finding the solace I'd craved
At peace there with the decayed, though they called me depraved
It was there a dark path was paved

[Dr. Knox / Hare:]
A morbid mind obsessed
Unhealthy thoughts depressed
By cryptic dreams possessed
To ever dwell among, the lifeless
As all life ends in death
So with each passing breath
A destiny professed
To ever dwell among, the lifeless
