Reheat your entrails
SautÃ© the frothing slop
Extract your intestines
Macerate the stenching glop

Stir fry your gall bladder
Prepare the chewy meat
Splattered organs and gore
Festering mealtime treat...

Microwaved slushy grime, Steaming oozing chyme...

Empty the Tupperware container
Onto my plate
Your omentum I mangle
Your rectal tissue I grate
Gurgling gristle I tear
I eat your dribbling gore
I vomit your remains
Onto the kitchen floor...

Lick the slab clean
Redigest regurgitated remains
Masticate semi-liquidized chunks
Of your decrepit splattered brain...
