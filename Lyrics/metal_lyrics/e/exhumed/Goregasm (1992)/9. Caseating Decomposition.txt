Splattered tumors reek, guts turn to cheese
Dry festered entrails, withered caseating carnage...

Moldy septic boils are munched,
Cankered, suppurating gore is devoured...

Mashed, ground, and bleeding
Pyosisified, torn, and seeping
I lick your rupturing carbuncles
and taste your pyorrheic scabs...

A festering disemboweled torso remains
As I gleefully munch on your decomposed brains -
Your genitals I hack and mangle...

I crudely tear open your body cavity
Ruptured organs splatter chyme
I gorge myself on your rashes
And feast on the sticky rectal grime...
