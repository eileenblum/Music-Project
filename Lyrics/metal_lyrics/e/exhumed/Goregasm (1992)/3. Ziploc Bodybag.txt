Mangled body lies wasted
Decaying on a mortuary slab
Ulcerative heap of carnage
Preserved in a plastic bag...

Cavities are opened, innards dislocated
Gastric fluid gurgles, as your entrails are masticated
Vile evisceration, discarded in a box
Liquefacted autopsy, I ladle the cadaverous slop...

Peeling the perforated skin
Scour the malignant scabs
I collect the putrid offal
In a ziploc body bag...
