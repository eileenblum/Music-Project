[performed by Exhumed]
[originally by Negative Approach]We won't take any shit and we're not about to leave
Just cause you don't like who and what we want to be
Who are you to say what's wrong what's right
If it's what it takes, we're ready to fight
Ready to fight, ready to fight
Ready to fight, fight, fight, fight, fight
