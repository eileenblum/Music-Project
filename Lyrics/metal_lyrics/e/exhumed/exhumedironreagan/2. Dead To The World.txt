[performed by Exhumed]Contagion spreading, eroding flesh, corroding brains
Global splattering of entrails over sanguine stains

Distorted reflection rotting, as we pretend forever young
Beneath the gleaming visage, a cesspool of pus and tripe and dung

Disease accelerating, the putrid touch takes hold
A grotesque shadow looming, as decay takes control

Distorted infection clotting, distends our fevered bung
Beneath the bloated visage, a cesspool of pus and tripe and dung

Remake the globe in death's image
Dead to the world
Over a planet necrotized, our banner unfurled - dead to the world

Incursive decay indoctrincated, the rot takes hold within
Unable to see where life has ended, and death begins

Discolored defecation rutting, under the horrid flag we've hung
Beneath the fevered visage, no brains remain just pus and dung

Remake the globe in death's image
Dead to the world
Over a planet necrotized, our banner unfurled - dead to the world
