[Musick - Mike Beams, Lyrixxx - Matt Harvey]

Upon a knife's edge, your sanity stretched
Nerves wrenched on the rack
A step beyond the ledge, sends you headlong into madness
With no turning back...

Arcs of light to penetrate you - stabbing picqueristic feints
Gleaming blight to perforate you - throbbing voyeuristic taints...

Each atrocity exacerbating, upon a carnal continuum
They careen unhindered
Each animosity accelerating, as any shred of sanity
Is systematically splintered...

Gouging slashes to perforate you - in a bind you're peeled and silvered
Maiming gashes to truncate you - you're signed sealed and delivered...

Arcing violence apexes with deadly consequences
Trapped in its blind blight, your death revealed in the arclight...

...

Dehumanized, objectified, unsanctified, anatomized...
Uncreating, unabating, underhanded, undertaking...

[Lead - Mike]

Underhanded, undertaking...

[Lead - Mike]

Insensate, inanimate, I mutilate, 'til I ejaculate
Unforgiving, unfeeling, unveiling your undoing
It was your destiny to die for me, your anatomy, will fuel my fantasies
Reliving, revealing, reviling, your dying... your dying...

Your final moments spent in fetters
And after death you'll be dismembered
Body parts to torment, to incite me to remember
These bloodstained memories crystallized forever...

Irons and chains to degrade you - as each instant grows inexorably worse
Knifepoints and members to invade you - stinging wounds brand my name on 
your corpse...

Tearing at chunks postmortem
Your breasts fall prey, to mandibular avulsion
Feeling a swelling at the base of my scrotum
There is only arousal, where there should be revulsion...

Heavy manacles to immobilize you - the better to act out my whims unabated
As a cannibal I'll immortalize you - until my appetites next needs to be 
sated...

Eternally apexing arc of violence, brings a bevy of consequences
At the continuum's end with no end in sight, seeing only death in the 
arclight...
