[musick - Mike Beams, Lyrixxx - Matt Harvey]

Pernicious - A ghastly Gordian quandary to elucidate
Pestiferous - A nebulous necrotic novelty to navigate
Labyrinthine - A contumely carnal conundrum to cogitate
Serpentine - An exulcerated entanglement to execrate...

Hands stained and filthy from digging deep for the answer
That lies at the heart of the matter of splatter...

Eschatological - The grave matters with which we struggle
Pathological - The perverse perpetuation of this purulent puzzle
Repugnant - The wretched riddle unravels in a reeking revelation
Repulsive - The final fetid farce yields such a rancid realization

Now your morbid curiosity may finally be answered
Deep in the heart of the matter of splatter...

A morbid matter on which to meditate or mutilate
A deathly detail to deliberate and desiccate
A sombre study in which sagacity is tantamount to insanity
An insalubrious interest in the inhumed and the unsanitary...

An unhealthy pursuit of the purulent and parturient
A feculent fixation upon the fetid filth and excrement
An exhaustive examination of the excreted and the exhumed
A tireless appetite to hill the silt atop the tomb...

[Lead - Mike]

Nebulous - The sanguineous solution is seldom seen before the last
Amorphous - Seemingly always six deep feet beyond your grasp
Funereal - Carnal cartography to chart the course of life's denouement
Corporeal - The wretched revelation that you sought proves harder to swallow 
than you'd thought...

That anatomy is destiny is the unforgiving answer
Culled from the heart of the matter of splatter...
