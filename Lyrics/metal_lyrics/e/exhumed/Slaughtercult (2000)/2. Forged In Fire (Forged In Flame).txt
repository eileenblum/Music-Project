Fahrenheit facilities my endeavour
To seal the abhorrent aperture forever...

Chastity assured, regardless of desire
Misshapen fidelity, forged in fire...

Melt and weld...Raze and smelt
Blistering crotch...Searing hot...

Forged in fire - Formed in flame
Sex will never be the same
Forged in fire - Formed in flame
You will never fuck again

Blistering and boiling vaginal skin
Eternally sealing this gateway of sin...

Scalding and melding her minge
Smell the acid reek of pubic hair singed...

Melt and weld...Raze and smelt
Blistering crotch...Searing hot...

Forged in fire - Formed in flame
Sex will never be the same
Forged in fire - Formed in flame
You will never fuck again

Crumbling crooze...Crack and ooze
Black as tar...Forever scarred
Smoking groin...Splattered loin
Molten orifice...Now I seal your lips...Forever...

Fluxing flesh collapses under its own weight
The molten labia majora with my blowtorch I liquidate

The vagina rendered impenetrable
The blackened clitoris is unmendable

Waxen labia now gelatinous and congealed
The faithless breach at last is sealed

Forge the seal...the flesh now peeled
Bubbling flesh starts to glut...Castrated vagina now shut...

Forged in fire - Formed in flame
Sex will never be the same
Forged in fire - Formed in flame
You will never fuck again
