Step by step, death by death
The end draws closer breath by breath
An ichor-stained fate from which you won`t be spared
The crimson labyrinth in which we`re ensnared...

Behold-
In shattered mirror what you`ve become
Only now at the end-
Can you see how terror runs...

Blood runs cold
Horror runs wild
Your life runs out
Death runs-
DEEP RED [x2]

Your existence ebbs in a scarlet symphony
Your parting words gasped in dismal necrony
Any hope you had to survive has now died
Gagging on blood as you swallow much more than your pride...

So many times-
I fantasized
About you so many ways-
To take your life!

Blood runs cold
Horror runs wild
Your life runs out
Death runs-
DEEP RED [x4]

Blood runs cold
Horror runs wild
Your life runs out
Death runs-
DEEP RED [x4]
