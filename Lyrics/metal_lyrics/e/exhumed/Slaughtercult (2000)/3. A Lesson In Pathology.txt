A crush course through your cranium
Trial and error, wear and tear, through your cerebellum
Hacking - slashing
Saw through bone, tear through gristle
Carve my way through muscle tissue
Cleaving - gouging

A lesson in pathology
I deconstruct your anatomy
For you - a premature autopsy
For me - a lesson in pathology
Postmortem performed haphazardly
Draining ichor sprays erratically
Forensick medicine is lost on me
I need a lesson in pathology

Though this carnal curriculum I pass
Suppurated blood congeals in a moist, fetid mass...
Gagging - choking

A lesson in pathology
Embalming fluid sprays all over me
Making a mess of your necropsy
Just another lesson in pathology
This is a medical atrocity
Screams echo in mortuary
Extracurricural necro-sodomy
A painful lesson in pathology

This will be your truly final exam
Butchered by numbers, carved up by hand
Dismemberment is par for this course of instruction
Chopped, minced and ground beyond hope of reconstruction

Scored, scoured and scarred with high marks
Along the lenght of unrecognizable body parts...
Gutted, butchered...
Your remains have failed me - there is nothing left to maim
I`ve learned nothing from this lesson, and I`ve only the dead to blame
Your chapter closed, it`s time to decompose

A lesson in pathology
I deconstruct your anatomy
For you - a premature autopsy
For me - a lesson in pathology
Postmortem performed haphazardly
Draining ichor sprays erratically
Forensick medicine is lost on me
I need a lesson in pathology!
