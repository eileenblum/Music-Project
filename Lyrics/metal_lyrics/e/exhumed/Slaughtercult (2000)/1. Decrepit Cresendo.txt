Once upon the slab
The torso starts to swell as entrails bloat
After the toes are tagged
Crepitus is the smell that has you clutching your throat
Irrigate flatus, foul, tepid splatter...
Decrepit Crescendo

Flatulent emanations so rank
The air`s turning sour as the bowels start to leak
The morgue is now fetid and drunk
The stench overpowers, such a noxious, nauseating reek
Crepitating stiffs, take another whiff...
Decrepit Crescendo

The hypertrophic cadaver erupts
With a curdling stench as it`s bowels starts to vent
The creaking anus ernits a stench so corrput
Your guts will be wrenched `til the intestinal tract is spent
Putrid odours emanate, from beneath the mortuary drape...
Decepit Crescendo
