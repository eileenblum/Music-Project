To have and to hold after death`s done its part
In a grave lying cold there remains my heart
In sickness and stealth I come for conjugal exhumation
Disinterring my betrothed for postmortem consummation
To love and to cherish, though rotten and perished
For richer or poorer
Even though I abhor her...

In a chapel we were wed
We found marital bliss
Now in this chapel of the dead
Again we shall kiss...

Drawn back to the mausoleum, to rekindle love`s icy flame
A dutiful bridegrume`s devotion, to the corpse who bears my surname
By night it`s her embrace that I crave, our conjugal deathbed is her grave
By undying love I am depraved, I am the casket`s slave

On one hand is my revulsion to these sordid tomb trysts
On the other is a gold ring that sill binds me to this
Necro-nuptial bliss is hard to find often
Our second honeymoon was spent nude in this coffin
My loving memory lives on in ways some would deplore,
Since she has passed on, death is all I live for
At times it`s mortifying, being in love with a stiff
The rigors of marriage were never quite like this...

In a chapel we were wed
Seeking marital bliss
Now in this chapel of the dead
I once more open your lips

Drawn back to my consort, To feel the passion of love`s icy flame
An amorous necrophile`s compulsion, To ravish the corpse who took my name
By night it`s her embrace that I crave, Our conjugal deathbed is her grave
By undying love I am depraved, I am the casket`s slave

SLAVE TO THE CASKET
SLAVE TO THE CASKET
SLAVE TO THE CASKET
SLAVE TO THE CASKET

Though her beauty has long since decayed
My love carries on unafraid
Emboldened by the stench of my wife, I give her the fuck of her afterlife
My love is beautifully pure
In putrefactive innards immured
Once I was soft and unable to love her
Now six feet down I molest my dead lover

In a chapel we were wed
I never found the true bliss
Till in this chapel of the dead
We shared a stolen kiss...

Drawn back to the chranel house, To feel the cold breath of love`s icy flame
Now you take all of me deep inside you, The way once you took my name
By night it`s her embrace that I crave, Our conjugal deathbed is her grave
By undying love I am depraved, I am the casket`s slave...
