You`ll fester forever in this forensic hell
Sempiternal suppuration, throax starts to swell
Purulent perdition, the body`s fluid coagulate
Half dissolved gizzards oozing on my plate
Slathering the chyme and pyathoric grume
Your Last Supper is meal that turns my table to your tomb
Imbibe the fedit fluids and gorge myself upon the guts
Ravenously I stuff my face, my gullet starts to glut!

My meal congeals, my nostrils reel, flesh is all I need
Spoon the grume, stole from the tomb, bute the hand that bleeds
Sputter, spatter, supper, splatter, slurp the sicky swill
Chyme after chyme, at feeding time, I always eat my fill!

Fester Forever
Gored, Devoured and severed

Eat, drink, and be marry
For tomorrow we die
Meat is just flesh, only temporary
On its pulpous provisions we dine
A carnal cornucopia
Of maturating bowels and offal
The bitter rasp of decay`s pungent taste
Permeates every putrid mouthful

My meal congeals, my nostrils reel, flesh is all I need
Spoon the grume, stole from the tomb, bute the hand that bleeds
Sputter, spatter, supper, splatter, slurp the sicky swill
Chyme after chyme, at feeding time, I always eat my fill!

Fester Forever
Anatomized, gnawed, and dismembered

Ribcage pried apart and sundered open wide
The pulmonary splatter platter is served
Mucu-purulent morsels of viscous heart and lung
A fell feast that is quite ill-deserved
If meat is murder, then cannibalism`s carnage
My seven corpse meals are an excess in death
I rise from my table soaken in the fluids of the deceased
Bile hangs hot on my breath

Fester Forever
Gored, Devoured and severed
