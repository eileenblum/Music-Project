Purulent necromorphism takes hold
As curdled innards turn yellowish with mold
Autodigestion of entrails and liquefaction
Decaying viscera collapse in colonic compaction

Sludge and grume - Viscous gore
Pyomorphism rots - To the core
Spawning ground - For grubs and worms
Infested gut - In your grave you turn...

Bowels bleeding black - As they are consumed
Intestinal tract - splatters all over your tomb
Consuming impulse - The larvae are gorged
The corpse starts to convulse - Dinnertime in the morgue

Gelatinous hulk, once bone and flesh
Your body rotten, there`s nothing left
Totally decayed, your carcass consumed
This grotesque end to which we`re doomed...

Dissolving guts - putrefactive grunk
Nest of maggots - In your trunk
The deadened guts - They make their womb
Necrosis borne - In the tomb
Rotting away - Turn in your grave
Infernal decay - Burn in your grave
Necrosis sets in - Let there be rot
Pyosis begins - Left there to rot

Bowels absorbs into the turmorous, amorphous mass
Dissolving proteins break down in the morass
Death becomes you in quite a ghastly way
Held fast in the decrepit grip of decay

Bowels bleeding black - As they are consumed
Intestinal tract - splatters all over your tomb
Consuming impulse - The larvae are gorged
The corpse starts to convulse - Dinnertime in the morgue
