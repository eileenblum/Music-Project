The rabble made sick, by infection, so quick
And left anaemic
Aided by pests, the skin is made wet
With fever and sweat
Abdominal pain, 'cause the sphincter is strained
And they're driven insane
Blood is expelled, while bubbles all swell
It's bacterial hell

Ensconce yourself in quarantine
Sanctuary for the people of means

No escaping, no delaying, no refraining
The red death
No forestalling, no stonewalling, no mothballing
The read death

Extremities rot, from gangrenous clots
And odious snots
Choking up bile, and other tastes vile
The tongue is defiled
Torment is felt, covered in welts
As their guts melt
Bloodied sputum, and fingers all numb
All will succumb

Blue bloods in isolation
Preserved from contamination

No escaping, no delaying, no refraining
The red death
No forestalling, no stonewalling, no mothballing
The read death

[Solo: Sebastian]
[Solo: Matt]

Capitulate to plague by degrees
Affluenza of filth and disease

No escaping, no delaying, no refraining
The red death
No forestalling, no stonewalling, it comes calling
The read death
