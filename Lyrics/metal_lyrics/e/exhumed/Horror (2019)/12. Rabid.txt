Infection spreads like wildfire
Mouths begin to form
Hydrophobic epidemic
Spurs a lust for blood and bone
Feral instincts awakened
Devolved to savagery
Preying upon each other
In deranged ecstasy

Salivating thirst - drink your blood
Your arteries they'll burst - rabid
A hunger slaked by flesh - eat your skin
Thralls enslaved by death - rabid

[Solo: Sebastian]

Death can come in many forms
Closing in around you fast
Scream in horror as your neighbors
Are the ones who will make you breathe your last
Primitive urges
You once thought had been tamed
Now rise to the surface
To hack, rend and maim

Salivating thirst - drink your blood
Your arteries they'll burst - rabid
A hunger slaked by flesh - eat your skin
Thralls enslaved by death - rabid

[Solo: Matt]

Salivating thirst - drink your blood
Your arteries they'll burst - rabid
A hunger slaked by flesh - eat your skin
Thralls enslaved by death - rabid
