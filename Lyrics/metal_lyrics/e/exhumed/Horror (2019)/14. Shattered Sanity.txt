Gaze into the chasm
Sights you can't un-see
Lose your fucking mind
Shattered sanity

Witness ancient horrors
From beyond reality
Perception grows distorted
Shattered sanity

Waking world a nightmare
Your mind begins to rot
Gouging out your eyes
But the visions just won't stop

[Solo: Sebastian]

Forever you're tormented
You will never rest in peace
A trauma never mended
The horror will not cease

[Solo: Matt]

Clutching at your flesh
Blood runs cold
Totally insane
Losing all control
Screaming out in fright
Forever you will be
A prisoner of your madness
Shattered sanity
