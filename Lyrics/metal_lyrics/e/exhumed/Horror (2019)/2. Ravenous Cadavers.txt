Something stirring in the darkness, clawing at the dirt
Casket walls now splinter, the dead crawl up from the earth
Unnatural ways of science, breathe life into a corpse
Dead things rise from grave-sites to feed without remorse

Re-animated cannibals
Rise again to eat their fill
Flesh to rend and blood to spill
Return to life to fucking kill

Doomsday voodoo prophecy, prediction now fulfilled
Upon unholy ground the cursed blood is spilled
Graveyard now a slaughterhouse, tombstones spattered red
To mark the place the living were vanquished by the dead

Re-animated cannibals
Rise again to eat their fill
Flesh to rend and blood to spill
Return to life to fucking kill

Bones and flesh, walk without breath
The dead alive, you won't survive
Feast on flesh, devour brains
Until only the dead remain

[Solo: Sebastian]

Re-animated cannibals
Rise again to eat their fill
Flesh to rend and blood to spill
Return to life to fucking kill
