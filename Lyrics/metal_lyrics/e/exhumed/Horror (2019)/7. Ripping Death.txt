Shredded, maimed and slaughtered, barbaric way to die
Skin is ripped and mangled, before your very eyes
Drenched in blood you welter, in pain you scream and howl
Bones are smashed and broken, your torso disemboweled

Ripping death
Ripping fucking

Death for you comes slowly, first there comes the pain
Limbs torn off and twisted, stabbing through your brain
In pieces you're dismembered, your body torn apart
Ripping off your twisted face, puncturing your heart

[Solo: Sebastian]

Shredded, maimed and slaughtered, barbaric way to die
Skin is ripped and mangled, before your very eyes
Drenched in blood you welter, in pain you scream and howl
Bones are smashed and broken, your torso disemboweled

Ripping death
Ripping fucking death
