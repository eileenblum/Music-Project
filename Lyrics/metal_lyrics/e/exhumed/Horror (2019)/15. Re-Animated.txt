Lurking hulk of rotting flesh
Far beyond the point of death
Experiments re-animate
Cadavers from their lifeless state

Re-animated, reborn in bloodshed
Re-animated, not yet fully

Dead bodies rise, the living die
Never understanding why
All the lives they tried to save
Were dragged into a hellish grave
Not alive, not fully dead
Torso searches for its head
Corpses strewn around the morgue
Walls are spattered, dripping gore

Re-animated, reborn in bloodshed
Re-animated, not yet fully dead

[Solo: Sebastian]
[Solo: Matt]

Decapitated maniac
Armies of the dead brought back
Severed head between your legs
As for your worthless life you beg

Distorting of a human life
Tearing flesh, gouging eyes
Try to run, it's too late
Even death is no escape

Re-animated, reborn in bloodshed
Re-animated, not fully dead
