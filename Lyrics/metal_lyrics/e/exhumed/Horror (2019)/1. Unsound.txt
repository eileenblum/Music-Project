Casket lies waiting, for you to rot inside
Life at last is over, so long since you have died
Cadaver lying wasted, blood has dried to black
Passed beyond the vale, never coming back

Decrepit and decayed
But I just can't keep away

Bed the dead to satisfy
Unsound urges undenied
Driven by demented lust
Exhuming for a rotten fuck

[Solo: Sebastian]
[Solo: Matt]
[Solo: Sebastian]

Funeral home no resting place, when I make my rounds
Corpses I inseminate, beneath the burial grounds
Cold and stiff and putrid, I go down with the worms
But I'm the only one to rise again, the maggots in you squirm

Don't close the casket door
I'm coming back for more

Bed the dead to satisfy
Unsound urges undenied
Driven by demented lust
Exhuming for a rotten fuck

Unsound
Unsound
