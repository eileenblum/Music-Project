Terrorized, heart skips a beat
Horrified, 'cause you're dead meat
Paralyzed, too scared to run
Petrified, your life is done

Transfixed by fate
Now it's too late
Death in the night
Scream out in fright

Lacerate, shredding skin
Mutilate, the end begins
Regurgitate, in abject fear
Hyperventilate, the end is near

Transfixed by fate
Now it's too late
Death in the night
Scream out in fright

Scream - for your worthless life
Die - by the slashing knife

Darkness calls, to hunt again
Footsteps fall, the chase begins
Features pall, a bloodless face
Now you crawl, to a gory fate

Transfixed by fate
Now it's too late
Death in the night
Scream out in fright
