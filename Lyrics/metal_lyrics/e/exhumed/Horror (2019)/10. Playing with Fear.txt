Deep in your subconscious
The terror that's always dwelt
Just beneath the surface
Like a pulsating toxic welt

Distort your mind
Senses decay
You lose your grip
As reality fades away
Insanity, is drawing near
Madness unleashed
Playing with fear

Unnatural solution
Takes hold of your brain
With just one injection
You are driven insane

Distort your mind
Senses decay
You lose your grip
As reality fades away
Insanity, is drawing near
Madness unleashed
Playing with fear

Hearing thoughts within your mind
Not your own
Tremble in abject terror
Chilled to the bone

[Solo: Sebastian]

To do their bidding
You soon will learn
Your hands stained red with blood
To sanity, you can never return

[Solo: Matt]

Playing with fear
