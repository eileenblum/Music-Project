Flee from the butchers, into the night
Weeds tangle around you, the moon the only light
You can hear their screams, echo in the air
Your friends are being slaughtered but you can't afford to care

Run for your life
Hide from your death
Into the night

Your blood-streaked goose-flesh, quivers in fear
A shadow starts to move, could it be they're drawing near?
The chill in the night air, cuts straight through to the bone
You hear the chainsaw's rumble and you know you're not alone

Run for your life
Hide from your death
Into the night

Naked, screaming and covered in blood
There's no one there to help you, no one even could
Naked, screaming and covered in blood
You will meet your death, alone in the woods

Naked, screaming and covered in blood

[Solo: Sebastian]
[Solo: Matt]

Captured by the butchers, dragged back to their home
To watch your friends all tortured, and hear their breaking bones
Chained to the table, you scream as they gather 'round
And as they close in on you, you know you won't be found

Naked, screaming and covered in blood
There's no one there to help you, no one even could
Naked, screaming and covered in blood
You meet your death, alone in the woods

Naked, screaming and covered in blood
