Locked within a padded cell, home for the deranged
Condemned within these horrid walls, totally insane
The fear within you starts to build, creeping up your spine
Gaze on the unspeakable, forever lose your mind

Terror chills your flesh
Thoughts of gruesome death
In the mouth of hell
No one hears your death knell

Terror-stricken, try to run, there is no escape
Forbidden sights made of flesh, mind and soul are raped
From beyond they arise, on sanity they feed
Blood spurts from behind your eyes, fall onto your knees

Slither through the walls
Hear the darkness call
In the mouth of hell
No one hears your death knell

[Solo: Matt]
[Solo: Sebastian]

Asylum lost to lunacy, walls painted red with death
Portal to another world, far beyond the flesh
You wander ever downward, not to be seen again
Lost in darkened corridors - now you're one of them!
