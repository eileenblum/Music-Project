Descend down the food chain
Your remains ground and minced
Corporeal Utility
Clearly Evinced
Corpse-grinding madness
Makes a meal out of you
Canned, sold and devoured
Your remains now pet-food

Dead meat

Your murder is meat
Your body is mulched
To be sealed into tins
And ferally munched

Dead meat
Dead fucking meat
