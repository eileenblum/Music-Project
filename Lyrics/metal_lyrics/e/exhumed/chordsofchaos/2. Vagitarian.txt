[musick - Matt Harvey , Derrel Houdashelt, Matt Widener; lyrixxx - Matt Harvey, 1994]

Beholding the kaliedescopic hue of your decomposing hymen I salivate,
Entranced by the effervescing effluvium of the rotted vagina, Carefully
excising the fragantly fermented labia I shall masticate, Savoring the
pungent aromatic whiff, my quivering lips wet with saliva...  Nibbling the
avulsed petals of the flower of womanhood so delicate, My slavering palate
overwhelmed by the feotid flavor, Marinating chunks of vaginal skin in
feminine hygine creams so elegant, This culinary clitoral carving is a
decidedlt putrid endeavor...  The shriveled copulatory organ, Falls prey to
my culinary whims, Sliced, diced, and mangled, painstakingly garnished and
trimmed...  Dried and festered, salted to taste, A douche bag helps clean
out the clots, A napkin will insure that none goes to waste, As I heartliy
devour the rot...  Vagitarian - a morbid mortified meal, Vagitarian -
gorging myself with psychopathic zeal, Vagitarian - a rancid repast so
horrific, Vagitarian - with a pinch of salt it's terrific...  Gnashing the
clitoris with inconceivable delight, The dried vaginal potrusion I adore,
The most culinary form of cunnigulus, A strict diet of vaginal gore...
