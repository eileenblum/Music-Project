[musick - Matt Harvey; lyrixxx - Ross Sewage, 1995]

The sterilized scalpel glistens in the light, Plasma issues forth as it
plunges into my skin, Slicing the meat, I gleefully smile, Covering my body
with carefully made incisions... The epidermis snaps back to make way for a
gaping hole, Osseous tissue revealed as sanguinary fluid flows, My stomach
painfully contracts as I regurgitate, Glazing my exposed dermis with acidic
vomitate... Defecation in hand, Clutching moist feces, Stuffing the shit, In
my freshly made slits... Splashing about, basted in blood, Avulsed flesh drips
from my lacerations, My fetish is fed, to skillfully rend, Sublime pain,
masochistic satisfaction... Blood drenched stool lines my wounds, The odor of
decaying discharge looms, The fecalith acts as my suture, My cuts erupt in
gangrenous sores...
