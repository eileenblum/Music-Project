A moribund procession, rots its way through the streets
Eagerly slavering for the essence they'll secrete
Smearing the walls of the world, with mephitic putrescence
They drag all within it, to their state of excrescence

Necrocracy
One nation buried under the debt
Necrocracy
One nation rotting under the dead
Necrocracy
A nation nursed on bile, filth, and gall
Necrocracy
With gibbeting and pustules for all

Under blighted skies, a foul banner is raised
As the feast now begins, for all that decays
The reek of the slaughter, mars the smog-stricken skies
And the heady thrill of the kill, bloodstains dead livid eyes

Necrocracy
One nation rabid under the sword
Necrocracy
One nation ravenous and engorged
Necrocracy
A nation nursed on bile, filth, and gall
Necrocracy
With gibbeting and pustules for all

A morbid chorus cries out, "unlife is now birth"
And proclaims its dominion, over all the earth

[Lead - Bud]

A mordant chorus descants "only the dead truly live"
A decrepit decree that we must never forgive

[Lead - Matt]

Necrocracy
One nation gorged to their grue-glutted fill
Necrocracy
One nation wallows in a cesspool of swill
Necrocracy
A nation nursed on bile, filth, and gall
Necrocracy
With gibbeting and pustules for all
