The things you see and believe
The reflection displays quite differently
Dysmorphic impressions held tenaciously
Open your eyes, behold reality

If you can bear the disappointment
When you see what you truly are
If you can choke back the repulsion
At all of your pustules, buboes, and scars

Dysmorphic - vision of self and state
Honor and compassion, avarice and hate
Dysmorphic - reflection forever barred
Can't accept what we truly are - dysmorphic

Sickened, you infect all that has occurred
With twisted truths and honeyed words
The soothing deceptions you've always heard
As you shamble along immured in the absurd

Twisted self-image cultivated
Self-gratifying death mask to hide behind
Dysmorphic animus to turn your eyes from
The rotting truth you would find

Dysmorphic - vision of self and state
Honor and compassion, avarice and hate
Dysmorphic - reflection forever barred
Can't believe how disgusting we truly are
Dysmorphic - vision, from many one
The truth undone before we begun
Dysmorphic - spawned from slaughter and war
Can't accept ourselves as we truly are - dysmorphic

Dysmorphic - eyes that cannot, will not see
Dysmorphic - distasteful truths exhumed from your mind's cemetery

[Lead - Matt]
[Lead - Bud]

So scrub the blood from your conscience
With a steady stream of comforting lies
Prey-like sheep as you stand ankle-deep
In a river of corpses left behind

Dysmorphic - vision of self and state
Honor and compassion, avarice and hate
Dysmorphic - reflection forever barred
Can't believe how disgusting we truly are
Dysmorphic - vision, from many one
The truth undone before we begun
Dysmorphic - spawned from slaughter and war
Can't accept ourselves as we truly are - dysmorphic
