Terminal condition, rampant infection spread too far - leaving many scars
Cadaverous contagion, to necrotize, slash, and mar - blood now black as tar
Repugnant epidemic, deadened hearts beat as one - keeping time with death's drum
The rotting now systemic, the end at last must come - now the grue starts to run

A global funeral, a worldwide wake
Lay it all to rest, for the worms to take
Experiment that failed, we now must help it die
And let our death knell now decry:

Sic transit gloria mortem
So passes the glory of death
Sic transit gloria mortem

So long unrecognized, dying once disguised as life - on the edge of a knife
But lift the putrid veil, beyond the pale and see the light - existence wrought with strife
A shattered hope undone, the dead were taught they'd none to serve - a brutal lesson unlearned
They then enthroned, 'pon their own bones the masters that they deserved - for a gravesite reserved

A global funeral, a worldwide wake
Lay it all to rest, for the worms to take
Experiment that failed, we now must help it die
And let our death knell now decry:

Sic transit gloria mortem
So passes the glory of death
Sic transit gloria mortem
So passes the glory - of death...

For the glory of death - so many caskets were nailed
For the glory of death - so many bloody banners were hailed
For the glory of death - so many putrefying years
For the glory of death - we present an anthem to fall on dead ears

[Lead - Bud]

Sign the death certificate, tag the toe, close the box - and let it rot
Place this vile grotesquery in the vault and turn the lock - and pray it's forgot
Misshapen and horrendous, filthy, diseased, and impure - a necrotopia obscure
Better off reduced to ash thus its extinction assured - but bury it deep, to be sure

A global funeral, a worldwide wake
Lay it all to rest, for the worms to take
Experiment that failed, we now must help it die
And let our death knell now decry:

Sic transit gloria mortem
So passes the glory of death
Sic transit gloria mortem
So passes the glory - of death...
