All who walk 'mongst the graves through the murk and the gloom
You that crawl to the depths of the filth in the tomb
So obsessed with the fruits of the autopsy room
Heed this carrion call, join with the exhumed

A voice descanting dirges
Upon dead ears these requiems fall
The cacophony of our vilest urges
Indulge them one, indulge them all
Come six feet deep to our level
And heed this carrion call
Join this repugnant revel
Heed the carrion call

Those who shudder at filth but can't turn away
Deaf to love songs that but cloy and betray
When life is a tomb you can do naught but decay
Heed this carrion call to snatch your carcass away

A voice descanting dirges
Upon dead ears these requiems fall
The cacophony of our vilest urges
Indulge them one, indulge them all
Come six feet deep to our level
And heed this carrion call
Join this repugnant revel
Heed the carrion call

The carrion call - ringing out long and clear, foul and loud
The carrion call - an intoxicating reek spreads like a noxious cloud
The carrion call - a blast of fetid, stinking, putrid air
The carrion call - you reek to high heaven, but you no longer care

[Lead - Bud]

Join with the dead, hold high your severed head
From our graves to the streets we're inexorably led
Stink through the night as we paint the town red
Awash in the ichor we've all willingly bled

A voice descanting dirges
Upon dead ears these requiems fall
The cacophony of our vilest urges
Indulge them one, indulge them all
Come six feet deep to our level
And heed this carrion call
Join this repugnant revel
Heed the carrion call
