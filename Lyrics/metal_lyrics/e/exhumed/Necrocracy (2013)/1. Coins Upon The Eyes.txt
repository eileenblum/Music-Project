Place these coins upon your eyes
The final payment in your necrotic tithe
And so the gleam that rendered you blind
Affords the last entertainment you'll ever buy

Filthy lucre's gleam - leaves you excoriated at the seams
The rented corpse you've been, now teems, a necrovore's unburied dream
Coin of the realm misspent - another grey life, came and went
Sundered and rent, your carcass spent upon the wheel unbent

Coins - upon the eyes
You paid to live, now pay to die

A lifetime bled out by degrees
Haemorrhaging figuratively
Now as you pay the final fee
It comes to pass quite literally

Evil's root unquenched - from your cold dead hands your legacy wrenched
Into the trench to stench along the other dead blood-drenched
Mortgaged life past due - just as you knew you'd one day rue
The contract in blood they drew, you signed and what ensued is that they ran you through

Coins - upon the eyes
You paid to live, now pay to die

Now pay to die

DIE! [x4]
Die - even as you think you live
Die - with all you have to give
Die - lifesblood drained as through a sieve
Die - with all your regrets to forgive - never forgive

[Lead - Matt]
[Lead - Bud]

This tenebrous tariff will cost you dear
In sweat and blood, but please no tears
Clinking coppers fall upon dead ears
Overdrawn and overtaxed for years

Coffin nails are never still - ever more plots we've yet to fill
Another deposit in the till, gravehills, rising grim and still
Some say that death is dead - it's all undertaking, too much overhead
But in sooth I'm in the red, in my deathbed I repose obscenely overfed

Coins - upon the eyes
You paid to live, now pay to die
