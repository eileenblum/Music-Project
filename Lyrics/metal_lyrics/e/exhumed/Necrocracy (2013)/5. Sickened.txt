The first ripening pustule - reared its black head today
A mephitic harbinger - of inexorable decay
Carbuncles and buboes - weeping welts to ensue
Blood bears infection - as it courses through
In sickness as in health - sickened by the sight
Of myself in the mirror - cowering from the light
Sickened in heart and mind - bowed beneath this blight
Flesh suppurates - blood drains to white

Once infected death's grip seizes through my veins
Blackening sores erupt, fever boils through my brains

A contagious affliction, sputum expectorates red
Sickened unto the grave
As epidermal revulsion marks me as soon to be dead
Sickened unto the grave
Sickened - unto the grave

My family and neighbors - come shun my face
For fear of infection - I'll be left to my fate
Writhing in dejection - in an abhorrent state
My blood drains to white - sickened unto the grave
The pustules rupture - a foul, fetid spew
Swollen piles leaking - infectious, discolored grue
My shocking reflection - I no longer recognize
As I succumb to decay - before my festered eyes

The only solace I find is that as the contagion spreads
I'll be joined by you all amongst the numberless dead

A contagious affliction, sputum expectorates red
Sickened unto the grave
As epidermal revulsion marks me as soon to be dead
Sickened unto the grave
Sickened - unto the grave

Life looms somewhere forgotten in a feverish haze
As my extremities contort beneath my gore-grizzled gaze
Waking hours turned to nightmare as my senses decay
And my blood drains to white, sickened unto the grave

There's a ripening reek that emanates from my crotch
And I dare not speak the horrid shade of the blotch
That marks my face as one soon to be at death's door
As I now become totally rotten to the gore - totally rotten to the gore

[Lead - Bud]
[Lead - Matt]
[Lead - Bud]

As my bowels liquefy and my skin sloughs away
Sickened unto the grave
I welcome the cold comfort of death's black embrace
Sickened unto the grave
Sickened - unto the grave

[Lead - Matt]
