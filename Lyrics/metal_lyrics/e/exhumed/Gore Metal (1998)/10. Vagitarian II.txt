[musick &amp; lyrixxx - Matt Harvey, 1995]

Admiring the syphilitic visage, Of the pustule ridden genitals that I adore,
Oozing sebum and pus dribbling on the labia, Leaves me panting for more...
Vaginal excrements fume and funk, The stench of festering menstrual discharge,
The wafting odor tortues my nasal passage, The glistening cunt wet with
blood... A crust ridden musty flap of lust suffering, From severe
dermatological disorder, The sanguined slit lined with papules, And genital
warts along its fleshy borders... Licking the sickening twat, The foul stench
of the blistering crotch, Drinking the menstruated slop, Delight in each
pustular drop... Passing blood clots, Eating crotch rot, Septic blood and pus,
Consume the runny crust, Urine flows out of the slit, Piss washes over the
clit, Taste the blood and piss, Nothing compares to this... My face fully
buried within, The pubic mound of grime and warts, Voraciously lapping up
excrements of, Every sordid type and nauseating sort... The atrocious
nauseating odour, Proves too strong to resist in the end, The nauseating fumes
overwhelm me, As I vomit into the moist pungent gash... Regurgitate onto the
cunt, Puke on the gore ridden slut, Drunk off the urine flow, I bathe in the
afterglow...
