[musick &amp; lyrixxx - Matt Harvey, 1997]

Consumption of flesh as dead tissue is uncreated, Rancid smoke effervesces as
your torpid corpse is cremated, Another inert mutilated mess is sent up in
flames, An expedient way to obscure the facts, figures and names... Flames
unmake flesh and bone as all semblance of life is erased, Ensuring ashen
anonymity for my dusty victims untraced, Bellows belch forth the stench of
roasted human game, As the torso is engulfed in a torrid rush of flame...
Human kindling to burn, And then scrape into urns, Burnt to a crisp, Another
name scratched from my list... After fulfillment of the sadistic whims to
which I aspire, Their existence is expunged in the searing burst of fire, As
other truncated stiffs await the flames in a torpor, My nose is beset with the
reek of blazing corpses... Entrails eradicated by the scorching furnace blast,
The blistering temperature leaves you a thing of the past, Sweltering in
incandescence as you blister, boil and reek, Seething in flames as your
complexion turns ashen gray and bleak... Beyond recognition your liquefacted
body is now molten slag, Your charbroiled remans are scraped up in ziploc body
bags, Nothing to mark your birth, life or death, Smelted, scalded and singed
'til there's none of you left... Human broiler pan, As flames I fan, Cremated
husk, Return to dust...
