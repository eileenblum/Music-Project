Headstones overturned and smashed
Your fucking corpse I want to thrash
The cold, hard ground I hack and slash
Coffins torn apart like trash
Six feet closer to your doom
From this grave I will exhume
Horrid flesh my blade consumes
As I destroy your earthen tomb!

Vacant Grave

To remove my rotting prize
From the soil the box will rise
Disembalm the cadaverized
Defile the dead I so despise
The pick-axe now unburied
Slaughter in the cemetery
From the site the corpse is carried
The ink still wet on the obituary

Vacant Grave

Your hands and feet I masticate
The body I incinerate
A shovel used to decapitate
The corpse's head I obliterate
Only pieces they will find
Of the carnage so unkind
Twisted fragments of your spine
At the hole I left behind!

Vacant Grave!
