Cleaving away at any extremity, from his torso his appendages are ripped
Another pass of my chainsaw, and his leg is disjoined at the hip
Cutting with my shoulder blade, his forearm I lustily seize
Bit by bit deconstructing his demise, allowing my victim no piece

Limb from limb
From limb
From limb
From limb
From limb
From limb

Dislimbing my victims for my collection of severed and rotting keepsakes
Trophies for my room displayed in mylar on decorative platters and stakes
Once in possession of the fleshy sinewy gew gaws that I demand
Only these quadrapalegic cadavers are left to give me a hand

Limb from limb
From limb
From limb
From limb
From limb
From limb

Taking her hand and arms and legs, she is left looking quite stumped,
Collecting the body parts that I greedily hoarde, the torso is callously dumped
Her grevious wounds spill precious ichor, upon the makeshift abattoir's floor
But the sacrifice is not made in vein, donating her arms to the poor

Limb from limb - Mercilessly taking people for an arm and a leg
Limb from limb - An unscrupulous bargain upon which you cannot renege
Limb from limb - I have so many, but I always hanker for more
Limb from limb - At times it's impossible to get a foot in the door

Limb from limb
From limb
From limb
From limb from fucking limb
From limb
From limb

You must hand it to me as I split you at the seams
I always get a leg up on my victims, your ensanguined projections I glean
Jigsawed without hope of reassembly, I take what's yours as mine
You watch as your existence slips away, your losing it one piece at a time
