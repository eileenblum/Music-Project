For ages striven for guidance to harmony
Searching for answers to life s mysteries

The world we once knew now ceased to exist
Our science left no questions
Only an emptiness surrounding our lives
It should have stayed untold

Open eyes, into tears of undeceived world
Into life for us for so long unbeknown

Struck by disorder and confusion
A new civilization built upon the ruin of man
Why did it have to take this long to reveal
The truth of life

The world we once knew now ceased to exist
Our science left no questions
Only an emptiness surrounding our lives
It should have stayed untold

Open eyes, into tears of undeceived world
Into life for us for so long unbeknown

Open eyes, into tears of undeceived world
Into life for us for so long unbeknown
