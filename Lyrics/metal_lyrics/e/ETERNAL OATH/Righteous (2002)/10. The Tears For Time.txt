Even in death your beauty was drowning
The sadness of life is not for you no more
I embrace you and hold you tight in my arms
Mild as a mother I kiss you to a dreamless sleep

In your eyes I saw the pain for the task you had
In front of you, a game none of us can ever win

The tears for time, all we had together, the tears for time

In your comforting arms crying the last joy of my life
Never-lasting love in a hopeful moment, end was at hand

The tears for time, the tears for time

After endless hesitation you finally kissed me
with sadness, and the memory I will bring with me
In whatever here after follows

In your eyes I saw the pain for the task you had
In front of you, a game none of us can ever win

The tears for time, all we had together, the tears for time
