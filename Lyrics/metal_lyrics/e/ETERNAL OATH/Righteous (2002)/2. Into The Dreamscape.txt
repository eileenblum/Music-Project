The changing of seasons continues its strong march
Everything dies to get reborn in a repeated circle

Though in your eyes still burns the dedication
Using the shades of history in this world of ours

Touching me with wings of dreams
You caress me with the tranquil air
The bond between us stronger than life

Though in your eyes still burns the dedication

Into the dreamscape, the enigma of life
Our path has just begun to lead our fate
Into the dreamscape, the glory of realms
Into the mysteries we unite, now as one

The changing of seasons continues its strong march
Everything dies to get reborn, reborn

We roam the tides of enlightment
A longing soul together merged
We roam the tides of enlightment

Here high upon the arms of immortality, the fusion of dreams
In a life of solemn mysteries, we are welded together
In a tear endless, in a tear endless

Into the dreamscape, the enigma of life
Our path has just begun to lead our fate
Into the dreamscape, the glory of realms
Into the mysteries we unite, now as one
