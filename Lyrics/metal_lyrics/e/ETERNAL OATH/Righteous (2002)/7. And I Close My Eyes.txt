As the sun sets, nothing have I done
A human life, like a blink of an eye for a god
As the time ends, born is a sense of failure
You watch us fall, and you close your eyes

I asked you for the meaning, for all my efforts
Why now when I could be so close to redemption
What is the point when I accomplished nothing
You felt my frustration, and you closed your eyes

Why the wars and hunger, injustice and pain
All the tears shed for a lost, endless cause
Why all this suffering, for a life we don t even understand
I want to know, but you closed your eyes

As the sun sets, nothing have I done
A human life, like a blink of an eye for a god
As the time ends, born is a sense of failure
You watch us fall, and you close your eyes

It hurts me to death to see, the things that we put others through
The beauty of life raped by this selfish world
You chose to show me the truth, a vision of total knowledge
I saw the end that we create and even I close eyes

All these tears shed for a lost, endless cause

I watch the falling skies, I see the determined rain
Tearing up the sadness surrounding
And even I close my eyes

I asked you for the meaning, for all my efforts
Why now when I could be so close to redemption
What is the point when I accomplished nothing
You felt my frustration, and we closed our eyes
