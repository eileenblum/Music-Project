I watch the shadows emerge from life
Dark around the world rests the waiting night

Dreams of the silent, in front of your eyes decayed
Hollow as your truth, embrace the unformed end

Drowned into thoughts i listen
For the heart of life to fade, decay
I saw the truth in hatred
And gave myself to the night

Dreams of the silent, in front of your eyes decayed
Hollow as your truth, embrace the unformed end

Unjust you stood and watched me drown
Like a feather the memories
Anger claimed his rightful due
And now await for the solemn end

Unjust you stood and watched me drown
Like a feather the memories vanished in the air
Anger claimed his rightful due from my tears
And now i await for the solemn end

Now one with the night, my name in every whisper
The sleep of the righteous
Faded from my life, born within the shadows
Honor the fallen

Dreams of the silent, in front of your eyes decayed
Hollow as your truth, embrace the unformed end

Unjust you stood and watched me drown
Like a feather the memories vanished in the air
Anger claimed his rightful due from my tears
And now i await for the solemn end

I await...
