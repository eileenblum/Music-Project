This wicked dream shaped and formed to life
Standing before me, consuming my self-dignity
Touched me with your inpurity in a devoted embrace
The hatred frozed my world in shrouded despair

Righteous are the tears that s falling
Forever I drown into these memories, in your arms
Righteous are the tears that s falling
Enclosed in sin I welcome defeat, take me away

Surrounded by disgust I entered death
Where s my pride to defend, lost in dreamlike anquish
All my tears before now seems so trivial
In company with loneliness I return dead inside

I face the emptiness that has become my life

Righteous are the tears that s falling
Forever I drown into these memories, in your arms
Righteous are the tears that s falling
Enclosed in sin I welcome defeat, take me away

Surrounded by disgust I entered death
Where s my pride to defend, lost in dreamlike anquish
All my tears before now seems so trivial

This wicked dream shaped and formed to life
Standing before me, consuming my self-dignity
Touched me with your inpurity in a devoted embrace
The hatred frozed my world in shrouded despair

Righteous are the tears that s falling
Forever I drown into these memories, in your arms
Righteous are the tears that s falling
Enclosed in sin I welcome defeat, take me away

Surrounded by disgust I entered death
Where s my pride to defend, lost in dreamlike anquish
All my tears before now seems so trivial
In company with loneliness I return dead inside
