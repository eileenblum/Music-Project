Substancial memories worn out through the years
Like old pictures fades into persistent oblivion
The shades of the past relightens the sorrow
Unveil my sense and let forgetting relieve

Like a curse destined to me, this crown of emptiness
Fallen for my joy denied, the crown of emptiness

Obscure truth that i have to relive
A sadness ever consuming
My back turned to the world i cry
And await for the touch of mercy

A soul to cherish forever, i wasn t allowed to sustain
In a world perfect, there would be no room for me

Substancial memories worn out through the years
Like old pictures fades into persistent oblivion
The shades of the past relightens the sorrow
Unveil my sense and let forgetting relieve

Like a curse destined to me, this crown of emptiness
Fallen for my joy denied, the crown of emptiness

See my tears, feel my world, open heart to life s irony
Search your soul in my hands, the joy that wasn t ment for me

See my tears, feel my world, open heart to life s irony
Search your soul in my hands, the joy that wasn t ment for me
