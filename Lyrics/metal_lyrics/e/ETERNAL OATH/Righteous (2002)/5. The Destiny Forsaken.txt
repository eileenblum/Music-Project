Painful is the longed for contact
A rape of our substitute harmony
In your eyes I saw the same reaction that I felt
But the tears ain t for you to decline

The torn up scars bloom to wounds again
And with hatred I loved you for it
This emotionally devouring moment
Shattering all the barricades to pain

Stay away from my hopes, our memories too obstinate
Stay away painful tears, we betrayed our life to be
The destiny forsaken, the destiny forsaken

A wintertime dismantled my beliefs
And along with the nature I died
In stillness reborn to a hollow existence
Now I m only a shade of a shadow

Painful is the longed for contact
A rape of our substitute harmony
In your eyes I saw the same reaction that I felt
But the tears ain t for you to decline

Stay away from my hopes, our memories too obstinate
Stay away painful tears, we betrayed our life to be
The destiny forsaken, the destiny forsaken

Another winter in yet another decade
A dying soul never healed
Forever weakening in the hands of
This destiny forsaken
