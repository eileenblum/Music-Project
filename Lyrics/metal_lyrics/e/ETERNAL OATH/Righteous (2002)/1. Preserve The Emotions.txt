Has your heart lost all reason within
Lies upon lies until truth is outstarved
The cries within tearing my soul into silence
A lie is everything we lived for in vain

Preserve the emotion you never had
Was honesty all too much to ask

Whatever you said, your eyes always told different
I wasted a young lifetime on your game
I never got to know the person behind the lies

You couldn t have cared less
Your lack was the interest of devotion
My tears gave you the strength
All hopeful promises faded to pale

Preserve the emotion you never had
Was honesty all too much to ask

Preserve the emotion you never had
Was honesty all too much to ask
