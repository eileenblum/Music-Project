I tried to hide my fear of losing her
But she knew, she saw it in my eyes
Entrance of death, the last embrace
I hear the beating, the beating of wings
Another sunrise, another day of tears
When the dreams die, is there no end of pain
The final moment, they gave me one last look
Into a tempting glare they disappeared
Bereaved, left alone, in the mist of sorrow
But I know I'll meet them both again... one day
Every day I fear to wake up
To hear the whispering of sorrow
Awaiting for you to come and take me away
One day
Another sunrise, another day of tears
When the dreams die, is there no end of pain
Once again I hear the beating of wings
Death lays a hand on my shivering chest
I look into her angel-like, sad eyes
And in them I see my beloved one... finally
