Ever through forgotten worlds, hand in hand
Floating on our amazement, decided to stand
Behind this sophisticated outer illusion
Lies endless desires forever attempting
To reach fullfillness, pleasures unawakened
In disguise of dreams, in your arms...
Forever keep it burning, the secret flame
Our lives soon come to pass
Never let it fade, the secret flame
Feeding of your thoughts
Withered skies, fallen from grace
Open your eyes to your world
In your tears lies the truth
Open your eyes to your world
Loss of reason, behind the mask, web of truth
Echoes of desires innermost, through the time
Betray your nature with the lies, forever they lie
Tempted by your need, more time
Forever keep it burning, the secret flame
Our lives soon come to pass
Never let it fade, the secret flame
Feeding of your thoughts
Ever through forgotten worlds, hand in hand
Floating on our amazement, decided to stand
