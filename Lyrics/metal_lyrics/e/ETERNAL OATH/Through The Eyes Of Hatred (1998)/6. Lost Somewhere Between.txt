With my guilt and my fear I condemned myself
Into this eternal dream, that weights like sin
How easily a human life is ruined
Lost somewhere between, sure I fly, in the sea of flames
Lost somewhere between, burned to tears and I drown
Like a withered rose in the hands of a new-born
Squeezed to dust and thrown into the wind
Lost somewhere between, sure I fly, in the sea of flames
Lost somewhere between, burned to tears and I drown
With my guilt and my fear I condemned myself
Into this eternal dream, that weights like sin
