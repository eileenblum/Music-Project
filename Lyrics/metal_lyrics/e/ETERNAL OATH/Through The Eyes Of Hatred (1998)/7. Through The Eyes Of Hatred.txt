Fading is the world you had in your hands
Changing is the landscape of time
Through the eyes of hatred
Forever burning in your heart, a lost decade
Through the eyes of hatred
The world evolves, never try to change the course of time
Misguided through the endless mist
Close your eyes again
Fading is the world you had in your hands
Changing is the landscape of time
Life fades, into your hands
Times upon the restless world, search your life
Through the eyes of hatred
Forever burning in your heart, a lost decade
Through the eyes of hatred
The world evolves, never try to change the course of time
Misguided through the endless mist
Close your eyes again
Fading is the world you had in your hands
Changing is the landscape of time
