"Forever" you said, another lie
you gave me only fragments of your love
don't you have any pride, any feelings
my angel of deception, deadly as time
You left me behind betrayed
how could I be so stupid to believe, 
that I could trust you again
I gave my life into your hands, 
but you just let me fall
My angel of deception
A lady bitch, real temptress
You cannot pull me any deeper
I?ve already reached the bottom of sorrow
Torn apart and thrown away
Alone - with my tears, my wounded pride
Beaten - on my knees unable to rise
Stolen - is all I valued in life
Alone - with my angel of deception
"Forever" you said, another lie
you gave me only fragments of your love
don't you have any pride, any feelings
my angel of deception, deadly as time
