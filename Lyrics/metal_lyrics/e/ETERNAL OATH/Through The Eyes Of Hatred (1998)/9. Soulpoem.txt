Memories of a young girl, now gone beyond the dreams
Reminding me of how short our time is
In our tears lies the trace of this sad tragedy
But the memories remain forever to be
I open my eyes only to see the sadness lie
She has fallen hard, but now been picked up to shine
Innocent, full of life, in our minds she will live
On secure hands she rests safe
In our tears lies the trace of this sad tragedy
But the memories remain forever to be
Why...
Tell my why...
