Throughout pain we learn that harmony bleeds
Stabbed by the daggers of death, wind whispers its sorrow
Weakness splays his wings, infecting my dreams
The sand of time slipping through our hands
I tried to hold on to the last of the grains
There's no excuses for incautiousness
It took a life to learn, life of someone else
You never blamed me the way I did
But no comfort found now that you're gone
The funeral winds blowing once again
Pierces our hearts with it's mournful song
The winds of grief raging endlessly
Leaving a painful stillness behind
Sadly staring the eyes no longer see
Left was the silence from the calm
I forever prayed that I would be spared
The same wind one day will be my salvation
Throughout pain we learn that harmony bleeds
Stabbed by the daggers of death, wind whispers its sorrow
Weakness splays his wings, infecting my dreams
The sand of time slipping through our hands
I tried to hold on to the last of the grains
The funeral winds blowing once again
Pierces our hearts with it's mournful song
The winds of grief raging endlessly
Leaving a painful stillness behind
The funeral winds blowing once again
Pierces our hearts with it's mournful song
