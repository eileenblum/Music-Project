Guilt is consuming me from inside
Feasting on my tortured soul
I cannot undo the happened time
Marked for life with the memory
Without tears, fallen from the hand of god
Lost within the shadows
Without flames I burn, without death I die.. within
I close my eyes forsaken by time
In my hands the fragments of a withered dream
Will I endure forever in your shade
This subtle torture increasing
Without tears, fallen from the hand of god
Lost within the shadows
Without flames I burn, without death I die.. within
Swallowed by the darkness, my impaired mind misled
By the lack of harmony, with my arms outstretched
Shattered pictures of a lost happiness
Times never to be returned again
My adament cry echoes through all time
Forever more
Swallowed by the darkness, my impaired mind misled
By the lack of harmony, with my arms outstretched
Without tears, fallen from the hand of god
Lost within the shadows
Without flames I burn, without death I die.. within
