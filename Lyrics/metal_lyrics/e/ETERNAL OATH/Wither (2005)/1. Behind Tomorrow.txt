The retribution for our greed, curiosity led to our downfall
Degraded with centuries of the evolutionary scale
Now we stand at the ruins of life

Behind tomorrow, relive the yesteryears
We are lost from the path of faith
Left on thin ice standing
Behind tomorrow, reborn from the ashes
History cannot be allowed to repeat our fall again

Staring at the reasons engagement, so determined
Leaving nothing for the hand of chance

Behind tomorrow, relive the yesteryears
We are lost from the path of faith
Left on thin ice standing
Behind tomorrow, reborn from the ashes
History cannot be allowed to repeat our fall again

We now stand at the ruins of life
Leaving nothing for chance

Degraded with centuries of the evolutionary scale
Staring at the reasons engagement, so determined

Behind tomorrow, relive the yesteryears
We are lost from the path of faith
Left on thin ice standing
Behind tomorrow, reborn from the ashes
History cannot be allowed to repeat our fall again
