Deny the world your pain
And in loneliness endure
Hide it all away in shame
No-one does ever need to know

Feed the demanding secret of yours
By keeping all the sadness inside
Truthful are your tears covered in shame
But thereÂ´s no-one else, no-one else to blame

A second life, your hopes cry for a new beginning
A second life, in this tearing loneliness

Reason lost its faith in you
or was it the other way around
Now you want to find yourself lost
From this endless, lonely course
yet the pain is yours alone, yours all alone

Deny the world your pain
And in loneliness endure
Hide it all away in shame
No-one does ever need to know

A second life, your hopes cry for a new beginning
A second life, in this tearing loneliness
A second life...
A second life, in this tearing loneliness
