We shared the same dream, but the boundaries of reality rippled it's surface
Like your reflection in the water destroyed by a tear falling
And the slightest impact scatters all hope of faith

A growing passion, hidden within a solemn promise
Never before had desire burnt me this hard
Though my heart crawed for it's lust
At least the dream was ours to share

Never before had desire burnt me this hard
A withering passion, hidden crawed for it's lust
At least the dream was ours to share

Whenever I see you again... I wither
For the truth that I saw in your eyes
Yet even without you now... I wither
Who are we to deny our destiny

Whenever I see you again...
For the truth that I saw in your eyes
Yet even without you now...
My world fades away

Whenever I see you again... I wither
For the truth that I saw in your eyes
Yet even without you now... I wither
Who are we to deny our destiny
