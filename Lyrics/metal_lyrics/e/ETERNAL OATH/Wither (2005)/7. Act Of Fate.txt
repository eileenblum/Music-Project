A harsh end descanted by hollow tears
Cornered within this insumountable moment
It seems that I have deserved this lack of desire
Dereliction towards the inner cluster of depravity

Though I tried to prevent this slender
Persection to the bitter end
I stumble in the darkest of worlds
My struggle for help devours my everything

The act of fate comes closer to the end
Grasping for itÂ´s spoils without hesitation
Without resistance, I shall too descend
For this final termination

The act of fate...
