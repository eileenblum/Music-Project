My harmony banished by this suffocating fear
A flash of the blade changes the outcome of our lives

A watcher sits by the sleepless, ready to guide this soul to whatever end
Through endless nights we await, yet only time can save us from this loss

Through my tears you are the godsend
Take my fears away and let me wish for hope
Slow decay of my weakened will
End of this night one will be gone

A watcher sits by the sleepless, ready to guide this soul to whatever end

An angels sigh, a timeless cry
All I hear is the whisper of the godsend
A dreamless night, a fathers cry
In this truth echoes the whisper of the godsend

Mornings light reaches me back again
A watcher still sits by the sleepless
Ready to guide this soul to whatever end

Through my tears you are the godsend
Take my fears away and let me wish for hope
Slow decay of my weakened will
End of this night one will be gone

An angels sigh, a timeless cry
All I hear is the whisper of the godsend
A dreamless night, a fathers cry
In this truth echoes the whisper of the godsend

An angels sigh, a timeless cry
All I hear is the whisper of the godsend
A dreamless night, a fathers cry
In this truth echoes the whisper of the godsend...

A timeless cry, all I hear is the whisper of the godsend
A dreamless night, a fathers cry
In this truth echoes the whisper of the godsend, godsend...
