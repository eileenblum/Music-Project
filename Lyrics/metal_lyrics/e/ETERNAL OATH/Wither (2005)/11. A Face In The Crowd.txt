As I fall asleep my eyes still see just a face in the crowd one that walks you by
I am all alone still theres no space just a silent whisper that passes you by

Where the dreams comes to die
You will see me standing in the shadows
Waiting for the one we shared
To finally come to its end
But would you welcome me, into the light

As I fall asleep...

Nights cold caressing as you can feel upon my breath
But will you deny me if I reveal my world to you
In this perfect dance impossible

Touch my soul and feel what rises
A newborns cry ready for the world
Will you take it to your heart or leave it astray
But the purity of an angel would burn my wings

As I fall asleep...
