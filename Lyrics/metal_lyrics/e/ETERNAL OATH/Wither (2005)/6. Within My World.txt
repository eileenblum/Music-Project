See the eyes fixed upon what never was
Only gaining the things that will be lost
Had my choices been altered in any way
And if only there was an if only
And if only I'd acted differently
Looking back, looking forward, it's all the same

To this world I'm oblivious
I'm haunted by the actions of those who feel
That they know everything so much better

Within my world I stand by this fate, yet nothing touches my soul, I stand alone
Within my world I stand by this fate, yet nothing touches my soul, I stand alone

See the eyes fixed upon what never was
Only gaining the things that will be lost
Had my choices been altered in any way
And if only there was an if only
And if only I'd acted differently
Looking back, looking forward, it's all the same

Within my world I stand by this fate, yet nothing touches my soul, I stand alone

Nothing can take the pain away, I stand on my two feet
Standing alone and here to stay, to stay...

Shadows of failure leaves a mark on my path
Should you fear my dreams and hope to change direction
Now let me follow the light at the end of the line

Within my world I stand by this fate, yet nothing touches my soul, I stand alone
Within my world I stand by this fate, yet nothing touches my soul, I stand alone
