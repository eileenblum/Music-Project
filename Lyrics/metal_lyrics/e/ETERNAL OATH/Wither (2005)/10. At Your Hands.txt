I saw the panic entice you and the tears you tried to retract
Pain as it seems to be the language of your life
In your arms a new beginning to end along with your doubts
Now will the world see your fears at yours hands
The tears of a dream abandoned as suffering turned into innocence
Blood of your sins

Fear weights into evils favor, tempting with promises
It drowns you into hope, casting a shade on your soul

At yours hands, the tears of a dream abandoned as suffering turned into innocence
The choice lies now...
At yours hands, the tears of a dream abandoned as suffering turned into innocence
Blood of your sins

At yours hands, the tears of a dream abandoned as suffering turned into innocence
The choice lies now...
At yours hands, the tears of a dream abandoned as suffering turned into innocence
Blood of your sins
