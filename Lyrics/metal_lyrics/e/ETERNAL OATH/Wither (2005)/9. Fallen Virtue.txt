Slowly return the world to it's former grace and let evolution repair the flaws of mankind
Our roads leads nowhere, but to our own downfall
Purest of fiction to believe in change

Fallen virtue, the purity of life so eagerly defiled
Fallen virtue, descent into the absence of hope

Fading in the hands of man, the heart of the world
Soon the waves will bounce back
It's only a matter of time for the weak to fail and nothing is left behind

Hear it's, it's the fall of virtue...

We see the truth without acting
Letting injustice occur without interference
Yet who are we to alter this course
When it's so much easier to continue in blindness

Fallen virtue, the purity of life so eagerly defiled
Fallen virtue, descent into the absence of hope
