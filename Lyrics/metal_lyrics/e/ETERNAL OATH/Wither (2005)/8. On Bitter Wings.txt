Conquer the control before the hour is yet too late
A truthful desire burning still in heart
As I lived my life jeweled by my sins
My world torn to shreds by your growing needs

I climb the ladder of my downfall and truthfully envy the malice in your eyes
But my tears won't become you
Since my pain enjoices you too

Giving you the world I sacrificed my will
On bitter wings yet my pride is not unstained
On bitter wings, on bitter wings

In fantasy this pain is everlasting but time will scar these wounds of you
Truthful is the malice in your stone-cold eyes but still my tears enjoices you

Giving you the world I sacrificed my will
On bitter wings yet my pride is not unstained
On bitter wings, on bitter wings

These bitter wings
