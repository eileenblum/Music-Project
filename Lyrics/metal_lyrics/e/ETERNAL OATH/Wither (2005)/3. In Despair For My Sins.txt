See into my dreams and turn the tides of time
Back into the days before tears

Life to live in despair for my sins
See me now in despair for my sins

I watched you fade away, within your eyes the blame froze for eternity

Life to live in despair for my sins
See me now in despair for my sins

Wrapped in sorrow anger breeds the hate
Black as night the sin weights upon me
The voiceless cry within me
Growing from a whisper to a scream
See into my dreams, and turn the tides of time
Back into the days before tears

Life to live in despair for my sins
See me now in despair for my sins
Life to live in despair...
See me now in despair...
All this life to life in despair for my sins
