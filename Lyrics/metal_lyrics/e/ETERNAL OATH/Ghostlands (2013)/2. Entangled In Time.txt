Lead the blind one last time
Into slaughter where worlds collide
Stand ablazed for this last demise
Leave this world and the lsot
Battles behind

When all smoke and dust settles
Like the veil on the battlefield
Silence roaming through these lands
No life nor pride remains

Time entangles
a fragile web for our deeds
For as life is fading we all drown
And for what cause, entangled in time

When all hope and screams dies out
And the fate has cast the dice
Silence roaming through these lands
No life nor pride remains
Who has won, no one left to
Claim the price

Time entangles
A fragile web for our deeds
For as life is fading we all drown
And for what cause, entangled in time

Lead the blind one last time
Into madness we shall dwell in line
Leading the blind one last time
Into madness we shall dwell in line

Time entangles
A fragile web for our deeds
For as life is fading we all drown
And for what cause, entangled in time
