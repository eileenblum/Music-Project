I buried a seed deep within
My solemn dreams
Anticipation slowly fed my hopes
By my wishes it got nurtured
While the seasons changed
Yet the soil was still
Naked as the night

No fear, a new dawn awakes

In the fields of dreams
I now whisper your name
Come and dance with me now
Until dawn breaks away
Through these fields of dreams
Echoes your name
As it pierces my crawling heart

I sat down by your side
Playing some old tunes
With my violin now only
Slightly out of tune
I danced around the fire
Chanting int he night
Yet the moon revealed no signs

Night passes by as the fire dies out
In the fading embers my wishes die
If lonely could
Hear your voice one last time
But everything turns silent
And drown into night

No fear, a new dawn awakes

In the fields of dreams
I now whisper your name
Come and dance with me now
Until dawn breaks away
Through these fields of dreams
Echoes your name
As it pierces my crawling heart
