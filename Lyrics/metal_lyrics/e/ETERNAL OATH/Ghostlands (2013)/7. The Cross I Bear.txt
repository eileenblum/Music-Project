Through the archways
Of my will you walk, just to remind
As I feed you with my thoughts
So bittersweet

I have felt you a thousand times
In my thoughts you hide
Behind the dreams of countless sins
Biding your time

Standing unprepared
Whispering sweet words
Of events impossible, the cross I bear
Dressed in darkness
Like a shameful secret
Whispering sweet words
Of events impossible
You are the cross I bear

The secret grows as does desire
Yet you're not welcome here
As I cannot contain you
Into life you're breaking through

Same matter cannot
Occupy same space
It would destroy itself
Dissolve into nothing

Into life you're breaking through

I have felt you a thousand times
In my thoughts you hide
Behind the dreams of countless sins

Standing unprepared
Whispering sweet words
Of events impossible, the cross I bear
Dressed in darkness
Like a shameful secret
Whispering sweet words
Of events impossible
You are the cross I bear
