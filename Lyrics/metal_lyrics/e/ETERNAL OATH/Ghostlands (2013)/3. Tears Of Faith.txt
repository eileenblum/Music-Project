Your beauty is astonishing,
Like sculpted by teeth of time
Pet you hide your sorrow
Behind that beautiful mask

Who's to give you comfort
When you've beaten, bruised yet proud
Nothing can take away this pain

Who's to give you comfort now
When you've beaten, bruised yet proud

Tears of faith
Hang on to hope
Stillborn dreams
Doomed to fail
We are doomed to fail this life

Tears of faith
Hang on to hope
The tears of faith,
Stillborn dreams
Doomed to fail

Like the oldest,
Wisest of women
With beauty of an angel,
Your wings are retracted now

You cover up your body
From the kicks
With the make-up of guilt
And shame you cover up this abuse

Who's to give you comfort
When you've beaten, bruised yet proud
Nothing can take away this pain

Who's to give you comfort now
When you've beaten, bruised yet proud

Tears of faith
Hang on to hope
Stillborn dreams
Doomed to fail
We are doomed to fail this life

Tears of faith
Hang on to hope
The tears of faith,
Stillborn dreams
Doomed to fail
