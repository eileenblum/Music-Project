Stare in to the abyss too long
And you might just see me
Listen to the voice in your
Head that says "kill"
And you can hear me whisper

I am the rage that leads to rape
The anger burning
That cuts through the flesh
I am the reason why you fear the dark
The shiver that you feel
As I breathe down your neck

Hear me as my words they echo
Listen close as I have much to say

Your world is mine

I am the hate inside
That drives you as a guardian
Of your morality
I only ask for more when the last
Drop is spilled
I am the hunger you cannot satisfy
Now hear me whisper, whisper

Scratching your skin
I want to break free
Your tears for mercy

Like music for the deaf
You will see the world
Through my eyes
Even through the tears
Let the fun begin at last
Now hear my cry

I am the rage that leads to rape
The anger burning
That cuts through the flesh
I am the reason why you fear the dark
The shiver that you feel as I breathe down
Your neck
