Feel the world
Open up your eyes to life
Read the truth
Not just between the lines
No one else
Can decide your point of view
As we let them fail trying

Read the truth
And not just between the lines
No one else can decide
Your point of view
Let them fail

Now fade away
Bury your dreams
Let the darkness hide your tears
Abandoning reason
Inflicting a deadly strike
On your bleeding sympathy

Choose your path, don't wander astray
March it proud or stay behind as prey

Feel the world
Open up your eyes to life
Read the truth
Not just between the lines
No one else can decide
Your point of view
As we let them fail trying

Now fade away, bury your dreams
Let the darkness hide your tears
Abandoning reason
Inflicting a deadly strike
On your bleeding sympathy
