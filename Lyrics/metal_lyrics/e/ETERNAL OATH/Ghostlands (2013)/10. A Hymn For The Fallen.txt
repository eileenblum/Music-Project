Alone stays the night
Sweeping through our lives
Memories they now remain untouched
Gathering what time has left behind

Fading, into yesterday
Fading, lifetime of traces in our heart

Lifetime of searching
Has seen the final day
Lifetime of traces in the past

Alone stays the night
Sweeping through our lives
Memories they now remain untouched
Hymn for the fallen soul of love

Lifetime of searching
Has seen the final day
Lifetime of traces in the past
Lifetime now turning into yesterday
Lifetime of traces in our hearts
