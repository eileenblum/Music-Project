Many days has turned to night
Many dawns forced the dark to light
Many storms savaged through these lands
And many memories gone lost

Now I fear
That this road has reached its end
And the footsteps I see behind me
Being the last
As I have reached the shore
Where the waters are still
And the swans do not move
The wind it does not breathe

By his ferry he stands
Waiting for us wanderers
Inviting me to a journey
Far away from these ghostlands

Hesitation tempting my fears
Will the destination be my last
Can I still turn back
Is there more to say
Or will there be another time

All is quit it's not just calm
Everything seems frozen
Even the mist seems still
Yet I walk slowly into its embrace
And into your care
I surrender, laying down

By his ferry he stands
Waiting for us wanderers
Inviting me to a journey
Far away from these ghostlands

The tears for time I see once again
Once the moment to cast-off
Is at hand
I lead the time into eternity
I always have and always will

By his ferry he stands
Waiting for us wanderers
Inviting me to a journey
Far away from these ghostlands

By his ferry he stands
Waiting for us wanderers
