The night falls as if slain by the sun
Flares once then fades away
Keeping me chained
To these intrusive memories
Yet this downward spiral
Just gaining speed

Finding me here time after time
You reach out and touch my soul

Behind the tears
Dwells a craving to escape
The emptiness that i now own
Yet do I dare to take the leap
And try my new wings
Gazing by the edge alone

A new day breaks into the unknown
Frozen still, looking like a painting
Dusty and faded
Colors peeling off the frames
Like I belong in the scenery

Behind the tears
Dwells a craving to escape
The emptiness that I now own
Yet do I dare to take the leap
And try my new wings
Gazing by the edge alone

Belief remains, remnants of yesterday
Belief is everything I have

Behind the tears
Dwells a craving to escape
The emptiness that I now own
Yet do I dare to take the leap
And try my new wings
Gazing by the edge alone
