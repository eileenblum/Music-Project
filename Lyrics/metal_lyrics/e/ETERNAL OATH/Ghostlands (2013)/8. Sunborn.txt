A distant dance
Under the lovers sign
Like crossing oceans
Yet nothing's stronger
Than a will tainted by burning love
And her raven hair, our souls unite
So begins the tale

Born of the sun
I embrace the night
Born of the sun
Spreading seeds of light

Birth of a new day
Proud watching their children play
Jealousy of sister moon
Drowning all in darkness

Born of the sun
I embrace the night
Born of the sun
Spreading seeds of light

It's a brief but intense meeting
Like a movement you see
Int he corner of your eye
Yet there's nothing there
Birth of a new day
Proud watching their children play
Jealousy of sister moon
Drowning all in darkness

Born of the sun
I embrace the night
Born of the sun
Spreading seeds of light

Born of the sun
I embrace the night
Born of the sun
Spreading seeds of light

Sunborn
