Lying, untrustable, two-faced angel, mortalize
Trying to get a grip of your weakness friendship

Denying his real identity, in case you did not know
Beholding evil powers to harm you psychicly

Satan, you snake of betrayal art, mortalize
Hiding from the light in the shadows of pain

Humanitarian - trying to be
Humanitarian - eternally

In him you trust, wake up
open your eyes and face it by yourself
his evil cannot hold us back

Humanitarian - trying to be
Humanitarian - eternally
