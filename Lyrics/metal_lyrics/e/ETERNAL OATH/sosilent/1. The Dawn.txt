[Music: Nagy/Tarvainen Lyrics: Maensivu]

Little child now it's time to close your eyes
and soon into my hands you will fall
I am the ruler of dreams
In midnight hour you will enter my world

Darkness knocks on your door, dreamtime arrives
Your world is gone, you have entered mine

The dawn-bringing the tears of the world
The dawn-also driving the darkness away

Arriving to the city among clouds
In here you can be whatever you want

We travel through lands, times and deeds
Realm of opportunities lies just in front of your eyes
The truth is gone, beaten by the fantasy
Darkness reaches for you, but you're safe until..

The dawn-bringing the tears of the world
The dawn-also driving the darkness away

Little child...
