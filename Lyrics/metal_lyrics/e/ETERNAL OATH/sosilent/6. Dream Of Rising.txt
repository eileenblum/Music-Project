[Music: Nagy/Tarvainen/Almquist Lyrics: Maensivu]

Shadows has now become my dominion
I am self nothing but a shadow

Wistful I dream, to be able to rise
to once again be the man I used to be
Wistful I dream, to be able to rise
to once again be the man I used to be

Tears has frozen on my cheeks
Brought by memorires
Brought by the disbelief in my faith

Touched by the winds of sadness
I've become the object of pity
I cannot fly through the skies of happiness
Though my wings are broken, so broken

Someday... 
I will rise and feel the for so long denied 
Air under my wings, but until then it is only 
A dream, though my wings are broken

Shadows has now become my dominion
I am self nothing but a shadow

Wistful I dream, to be able to rise
to once again be the man I used to be
Wistful I dream, to be able to rise
to once again be the man I used to be
