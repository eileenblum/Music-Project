Love, where are you now?
What do you feel now that I am weeping?
And did you know, that when you left...
My heart was cold?
So I sit, and think of our last night together.

And how I begged, but still you walked right...
Out the door.This is the peak of the fall...

How can this be the right decision?
Aren't I a simple fool?
A jester in the court of love.
A painted clown of woe.

As I sit here, in the dark...
With my head in my hands.
And my mind is racing...
Where did I go wrong?

And I wait for a knock at the door......A knock that never comes
A knock that never comes...

For this is the peak of the fall...!

How can this be the right decision?
Aren't I a simple fool?
A jester in the court of love.
A painted clown of woe.

Love, where are you now?
What do you feel now that I am angry?
And did you know, that when you left my heart was cold and empty.

This is the peak of the fall...

How can this be the right decision?
Aren't I a simple fool?
A jester in the court of love.
A painted clown of woe.
