I would storm the gates of hell to see you once again.
Hear devil footsteps in the corridors of sin.
My angel guide takes flight to lead me through the din.
The deafening winds taunt me to give in.
Give in...
I won't...give in.

Boldly I charge into the pit of eternal fire.
Burning souls exalt to form the Devil's choir, 
Nearing Styx the smell of sulphur bites my nose,
And I am left alone to pay the boatman's toll.
And we ride into the depths of hell.
Crossing the scorch'd earth Beneath a burning sky, And with a squinted eye.

Into the depths I ride.
Across the barren lands Into the heart of flame.
Where hatred knows no bounds.
Love has no name,
Fear not my fallen dove, For you are not to blame.
Nothing can stop true love, Our paradise regained.

If I close my eyes you're always there, But my empty heart keeps me aware.
And you know I love you so, I'd rather die than go on alone....Cry not my love....
Devils make way, And though I walk on burning coals.
The horror chills me to the bone.
Listen close and hear the moans of the weak and dying souls.

When I see you there Looking at me through your empty stare.
I wonder where you are, And if you still love me....Cry not my love....
Devils make way, As I'm watching you Through my eyes so pale and blue. 
I see your tears of pain.
Was I to blame?
