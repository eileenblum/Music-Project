A few steps away from my destiny
the trail before me narrows suddenly
I can see it now justified, silent, calm
the path to the bliss

Crimson moon lighting my path to eternity
whispers in the wind encouraging me

Recalling the last night together
all the joy I once felt
you stole my heart you devious being
time to show you the way
one path to the end forever so dear
you're forever mine
feeling your hand touching me again
I miss you now my friend

I can see it now justified, silent, calm
the path to the bliss

Suicide behind the lake of tears
to escape all her fears
enter the world of dreams
finally free to live
