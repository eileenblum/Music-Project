Two people fallen in love
two people grown apart
one bitter and vengeful
other a child so ingrateful

Two people fallen in love
two people grown apart
both full of anger
both lost in the sea of sorrow

Tear falling on ones cheek
never worth a thing
hatred as gratitude for lost time
hate, the essence of two stranded lines

You call yourself a saint
a martyr you truly are

So cold is the truth behind the mist
the table was set for your favor
but you failed to play fair
rejected to see the pieces that couldn't fit

Two people fallen in love
two people grown apart
one bitter and vengeful
other a child so ingrateful

Fire burning in ones heart
never worth a thing
vengeance as gratitude for lost time
grief, the essence of two stranded lines

So dark is the web of lies

So cold is the truth behind the mist
the table was set for your favor
but you failed to play fair
rejected to see the pieces that couldn't fit

Two people fallen in love
two people grown apart
one bitter and vengeful
other a child so ingrateful

Two people fallen in love
two people grown apart
both full of anger
both lost in the sea of sorrow
