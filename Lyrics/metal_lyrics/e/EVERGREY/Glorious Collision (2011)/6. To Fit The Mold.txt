We are liars and vultures
Rapists of the weak
Plunders of peace
We're on a constant search for someone
To walk us through the storm
To help us when we're lost
Make us understand we're not alone
We are defenseless
Not knowing when we will fall
Without words and speechless
Walk us through the storm
On a bound collision course

We're scared we'll end up to nothing
And we change to fit the mold
We are...
We're accidents forced to happen

We are liars and vultures
Rapists of the weak
Plunders of peace
And we are hiding from each other
Afraid you'll see our right face
We're planning the escape
To rid our fate

We're scared we'll end up to nothing
And we change to fit the mold
We are...
We're accidents forced to happen
We are the hollowed center and...
And we bend to reach to control
How far...
How far will we reach for something
We don't even know

We're scared we'll end up to nothing
And we change to fit the mold
We are...
We are the hollowed center and...
How far...
How far will we reach for something
Something we don't even know
We are so afraid of the unknown

We're scared we'll end up to nothing
And we change to fit the mold
We are afraid we stand last with nothing
And we bend to reach control
