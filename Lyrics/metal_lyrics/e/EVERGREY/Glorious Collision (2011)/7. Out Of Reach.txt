So what now my friend
Where do you go from here
When will the dark days end
And all the clouds clear
Is it goodbye my friend
I've see your fall and it's calling
Got we by hidden tears
that just keeps falling

Falling out of reach
You can't prevent it
You can't cause
All wounds won't heal

So times have changed my friend
Took a turn to the worst of worse
Can't turn your head on fate
Cause you can't unwound a curse
Closed eyes won't kill thoughts
Your fears the vivid dark
Got wet by hidden tears that just
Keeps falling

Falling out of reach
You can't prevent it
You can't cause
All wounds won't heal
Falling out of reach
You can't break free from chains
You can't cause all wounds won't heal no

They stretch greater and further
Until there's nothing to conquer
And all you do is watch then unfold

Falling out of reach
You can't prevent it
You can't cause
All wounds won't heal
Falling out of reach
You can't break the chains
You can't cause
All wounds won't heal
