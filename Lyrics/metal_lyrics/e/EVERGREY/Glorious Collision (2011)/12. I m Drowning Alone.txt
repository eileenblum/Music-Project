I paint all black and step in among the shadows
The feelings of emptiness devours me quickly
And I know I never asked
But I need you to help me

Release me from darkness
Release me from all that chains me here
I'm drowning in silence
And I'm drowning alone

I hate to ask but I wouldn't if I didn't need it
Not stronger on my own
I'm weaker just so much weaker
And I know I never asked
But I need you to help me

Release me from darkness
Release me from all that chains me here
I'm drowning in silence
And I'm drowning alone

Release me from darkness
Release me from all that chains me here
My arms getting tired
So relieve me from hurt

See me cause here I am
Hear me cause here I am
Remember me cause here I am
Notice me cause here I am

Release me from darkness
Release me from all that chains me here
I'm drowning in silence
And I can't out-swim the fear

Release me from darkness
Release me from all that chains me here
My arms getting tired
So relieve me from hurt
