When did the walls grow this tall
And the darkness begin to fall
When did I lose the sense of control
How much can I overcome
And I'm lying here
I'm tired I'm worn
It comes from within

It's taking me over
It's making me weak
Brought my doubts to the surface
It's leaving me helpless with no air to breathe
I belong to the shallow
To the ones who praise retreat
I stumble and falter

Who's there to catch me when I stumble
Reduce the pain of my fall
Be my embrace of comfort
And the voice that ease it all
And I'm lying here 
So tired so torn
Threat comes from within

It's taking me over
It's making me weak
Brought my doubts to the surface
It's leaving me helpless with no air to breathe
I belong to the shallow
To the ones who praise retreat
I stumble and falter
And it's taking me over

For as long as I remember
I fought this war alone
And the blood on my hands the weight of the cross
Are bricks in a wall
Built from vengeance

It's taking me over
It's making me weak
Brought my doubts to the surface
Tides rise from within
I belong to the shallow
To the ones who praise retreat
I stumble and falter
