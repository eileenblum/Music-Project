I've read your words
I understand it's said it's done
I walk away in fear of what you said that I've become
Can't change your words now they are stains made to stay
Won't be erased

I've read your words
I understand it's said it's done
I walk away in fear of what you said that I've become
Can't change your words now they are stains made to stay

Free are those who walk away from setting suns
And free are those who laughed at chains that held them bound
Free are those who conquers in vain but won't stop to run
Battered and down they pick up their pieces to rise as one

Free are souls who wander alone in the shade of sun
And free are those who's forgotten by all but still warm inside
Free are they with no intention to fold never bend for the cold
Just to find someone too

I've read your words I understand it's said it's done
I walk away in fear of what you said that we've become
Can't change our words now
Can't make them undone
I'll walk away
I'll walk away
Just walk away
