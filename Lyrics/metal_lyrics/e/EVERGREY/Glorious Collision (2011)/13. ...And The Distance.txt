We tried, we fought, we lost
We cried, we saw it fall
We lost this game to forgiving needs
Carve the wound until it bleeds

You're keeping your distance, you're pushing me away
You've never let me say the words I want to say
Our time here has withered
Our circumstances changed
You never let me say the words I want to say

You're keeping your distance, you're pushing me away
You never let me say the words I want to say
Our time here has withered
Our circumstances changed
'cause you never let me say the words I want...

Too close to edge and we are down, we are shattered
Still we strive to rise again against the will that push us under
The surface of pride and hope
And through the roof that holds the rope

Too close to an end and we are down, we are shattered
Still we strive to rise again against the doubts that held us under
The surface where light brings hope
And through the dark that kept us closed

Resist the will that push us under
Resist the will that push us under
