I run to prevent the fall
To escape the wounds
The unanswered calls
Just put it all to sleep
Lay it all to rest
I need to rid the doubt
To believe again
To even breathe in the same way
But someone needs to show me how

I always thought that I would know
That when things were broken it would show
Somehow I though I always knew
The difference between the lie and truth
I always thought Iâd live a little longer 
To have a chance to grow a little stronger 
But maybe I was wrong

I ran but I did still fall
I can't prevent the wounds
I'm sore and my suffering's greater
How I wish for sleep so that I could rest
And I run from the obvious
Been so devious cause I thought that I was free
Thought that I was free and

I always thought that I would know
That when things were broken it would show
Somehow I thought I always knew
The difference between the lie and truth
I always thought Iâd live a little longer 
To have a chance to grow a little stronger 
But maybe I was wrong

Somehow I thought I'd always know
If you were hurting it would show
We are broken and I'm left alone...
Then I was wrong
Maybe I was wrong
I always thought I'd live a little longer
To grow a little stronger
I always thought that I would know
That when things were broken it would show
Somehow I though I always knew
The difference between the lie and truth

I always thought Iâd live a little longer 
To have a chance to grow a little stronger 
But maybe I was wrong
