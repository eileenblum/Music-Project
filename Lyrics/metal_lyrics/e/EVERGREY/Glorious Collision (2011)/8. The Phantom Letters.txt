I leave this note by your side
I did the same thing every night
Through years I've tried
Inside are words for you to find
To let you know
About the things I never dared to show
Or say out loud
And I know it's late
Tears from sorrow now fall in hate
Too late to change
I undress my guilt here by your side
And maybe I can bury it tonight
Along with memories of things I've done to you
That Will never come undone
Can't stop my world from burning down
These flames are all my fault
When the ashes fall from heaven
They fall as my confession

All the words that I leave offer reasons
Holds the keys to the doors that I've locked
And I knew they would never be opened
Cause the ashes fall from heaven
Cause the ashes fall from heaven

I cease my shame here by your side
And maybe it will vanish with the lies
Along with memories of things I've done to you
Things that cannot be undone
Can't help myself from falling off
This thirst is all I've got
When the ashes falls from heaven
It calls to be forgiven

All the words that I leave offer reasons
Holds the keys to the doors that I've locked
And I knew they would never be opened
Cause the ashes fall from heaven
Cause the ashes fall from heaven

And I know it's late
Tears from sorrow now falls in hate
Too late to change

All the words that I leave offer reasons
Holds the keys to the doors that I've locked
And I knew they would never be opened
Cause the ashes fall from heaven
Cause the ashes fall from heaven
