Maybe the pain will bring me closer
Maybe the hurt makes it easier
If isolation plants the seed to stay
Repainting the shade of grey

Don't ask me to stretch any longer
These arms are strained beyond what they can take
Don't ask me for strength cause it's gone
And I've reached my end restoring the loss to faith

My moonlit walks
don't scatter thoughts of shattered dreams
The lack of sleep serves as morphine
Awake and stretch for any shoreline
Just as the current  tears me to sea

Don't ask me to stretch any longer
These arms are strained beyond what they can take
Don't ask me for strength cause it's gone
And I've reached my end restoring the loss to faith
Don't ask me to feel any longer
These feelings been worn since I sat down to play
Don't ask me to help cause all aid is lost

Don't ask me to feel
These feelings been worn
Don't ask me for help
This heart has been torn

Don't ask me to stretch any longer...
