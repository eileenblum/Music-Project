I wear these marks of shame
Not with pride my head's held low
And I aim beyond where I stand today
Far beyond fate where I am placed
And if weakness is a virtue 
And an act of strength a pride 
Then I am king and miseryâs my empire

You
You said you would be there
Always claimed you would see me
Never ever forget
Always try to forgive
Always be understanding
If I was wrong you'd believe me
If days were hard you would ease them
Things would stay the same
We would never change
Always be who you are my friend

I dress in shame and guilt
With despair as my robe
Must save this abandoned ship
From the mist and the raging storms
If weakness is a virtue 
And an act of strength a pride
Then I am king and miseryâs my empire

You
You said you would be there
Always claimed you would see me
Never ever forget
Always try to forgive
Always be understanding
If I was wrong you'd believe me
If days were hard you would ease them
Things would stay the same
We would never change

And you...
