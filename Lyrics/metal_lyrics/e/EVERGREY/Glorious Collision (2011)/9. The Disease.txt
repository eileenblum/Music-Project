Have I
Worked this soul too hard
Strained these arms to far
Fooled myself to think I was superior
I am inferior
And have I forced myself to think I fight this on my own
I'm all alone

Been loyal to the blind
Had friends that were not mine
I failed to see the disease before it created distance
Seeds sown when we were young
Gave birth to frozen lungs that breathe to exhale the illness

We were seduced by the phantom
Closed our eyes despite the symptoms
The apparition made us bleed like open wounds
It took us from awake to simple fools

Been loyal to the blind
Had friends that were not mine
I failed to see the disease before it created distance
Seeds sown when we were young
Gave birth to frozen lungs that breathe to exhale the illness

We have come to nothing
And we belong to freedom
We are hollow
But we belong to nothing

Been loyal to the blind
Had friends that were not mine
I failed to see the disease before it created distance
Seeds sown when we were young
Gave birth to frozen lungs that breathe to exhale the illness
