Everything is built from change
All the things we recreate
Fallen - lost - forsaken faith
The unspoken made us frozen
If we took time to contemplate
The years has passed and now it's late
Much too late to compensate
The loss that made me frozen

Reaching out with dying hope to still be seen
Longing to belong

We're frozen we're numb
We're misunderstood when we're hurting
We're frozen we're numb

If you could dive into my waters
Where the light's been chased away
If you could wake inside my hurt
Where all needed sleep is slayed
Then your eyes would see what I see
You can feel what I feel
And we meet on the surface
To catch the same air to breathe

We're frozen we're numb
We're misunderstood when we're hurting
We're frozen we're numb
We have left this alone too long to see
that we are hurting

We're frozen we're numb
We're misunderstood when we're hurting
We're frozen we're numb
We feel overlooked when we're hurting
