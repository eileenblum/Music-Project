Speak to me
I can't hear when your words not spoken
Where's your belief to me
The one that could never be broken
I'll take your burdens and sorrows
And I'll rise if I can
It's your silence that makes me so hollow

We should leave it behind us
Cause we're lost and astray
All things that were known now are changing

I'll take your burdens and sorrows
And I'll rise if I can
It's your silence that makes me so hollow

We should leave it behind us
Cause we're lost and astray
All things that were known now are changing
And we should leave it behind us
Cause we're lost and astray
All things that were known now are changing
Everything changes

Make way for the darkness
and create space for something new
Remove the blinds that held us
from seeing what we really should

We should leave it behind us
Cause we're lost and astray
All things that were known now are changing
And we should leave it behind us
Cause we're lost and astray
All things that were known now are changing
And we should leave it behind us
Cause it can't stay the same
All the things that were known now are changing
