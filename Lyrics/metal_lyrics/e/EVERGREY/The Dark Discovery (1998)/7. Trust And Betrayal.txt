Some time has past 
the winter is here
Dark memories haunt me
My vision is not clear
But my focus is crystal
Cause my wounds are bleeding still
You hurt me forever
How could I ever have thought that you would
The only two that I trusted
Why the hell should I forgive
You left me to winter
And god damn this loneliness

[Solo: Englund]

My sadness you'll see
This sorrow ends in victory

My trust your betrayal
I stab away my sorrows
It all ends here my sight now clear
A new day begins tomorrow

A brighter season is here
The sun chases away the cold
But it hasn't got the strength to scatter
The clouds inside of me
Have they been building forever
And now to thick to cut through
What did I do to deserve this punishment
And why am I the only one who's forsaken
Made you rest made you sleep eternal
But this empty soul is mine

All my tears 
All this sorrow
All ended in defeat

My trust your betrayal
I stab away my sorrows
It all ends here my sight now clear
A new day begins tomorrow

We are gathered here together
To decide over the hearing 
Of a most evil and an unpleasant crime
Perpetrated by an evil and unpleasant mind
Someone who would even kill his best friend
For reasons of personal greed and ambition
The defendant is accused of
cold-bloodedly parting
the murder of his best friend

[Solo: Englund]
