There is no way to tell his story
Without telling my own 
And if his story is really a confession
Then so is mine...
What will it come to
Where will it end where is
The last stop of this journey among shadows
Will I ever find myself
Where am I being sent
The well of my faith is close to dry
who knows...

Have I got the strength to make a step again
Tired of just giving and have nothing gained

Silent screams
My fears are real
Cause I'm scared you see 
Of the shadowed me

I'm travelling the footsteps
Of so many more
How come I feel so damn alone
You try to comfort
But you don't really care
Cause this is my cross to bear

Silent screams
My fears are real 
Cause I'm scared you see
Of the shadowed me

[Solo: Bronell]

Silent screams
My fears are real
Cause I'm scared you see
Of the shadowed me
