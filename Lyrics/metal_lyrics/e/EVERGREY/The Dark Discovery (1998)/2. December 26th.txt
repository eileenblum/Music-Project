I recall when the bright light descends
Something takes possession over me
I remember when the nightmares began
On that cold night of December 26th

I don't know what it is but I lost all control
Can't you see I'm condemned by the past that
They close in my history I don't want to be like
This no more you can't see what I mean but you
Would if you saw all the sight that I have seen

I cross my heart in hope to see
What I saw was not a part of me
Dig inside yourself and you shall feel
But dig to deep and you become like me

I hate to see one more get lost like I 
To those big eyes 
December
Evil words are spoken makes me fear
The world that now reigns over me
I was strong but now weak and I fall with my tears
Can't you please make the demons leave me be
I don't know what it is but I lost all control
Can't you see I'm condemned by the past that
They close in my history I don't want to be like
This no more you can't see what I mean but you
Would if you saw all the sight that I have seen

Please don't let your eyes meet mine
I have seen it all before
Cause the eyes mirror the soul

I hate to see one more get lost like I
Those big black eyes
December 26
Those big black eyes

I hate to see one more get lost like I
Those big black eyes
December 26
Those big black eyes
