Brought into this world
Met by open arms
I was born as a hero
All the tears I wept
The tears that just kept falling
All the dreams I dreamt
Dies when the river's calling

Liars
Soulless
Lairs
I am soulless

Another side of me
Oh yes it's getting stronger
Kept as a prisoners
A darker soul can't be found
All the times I've cried
The times when I was lonely
Breathing for the last time
My body dragged down slowly

Liars
Soulless
Lairs
I am soulless

[Solo: Mattias "IA" Eklundh]

Why wont you leave me alone
Wont you leave me alone
Why wont you leave
Why wont you leave me alone

[Solo: Englund]

Liars
Soulless
Lairs
I am soulless
