Will the sun be rising that I wont know
cause light reaches me not
I know I'm aging and that I can't see
In darkness I am fumbling
With these hands as my eyes
Sensitive fingers lead my way
Through this pit of no light

I cried before my gods
I wept for my sins
Blackened dawn
And what kind of god
Would have me deserve this
Blackened dawn

Clouds gathering darkness
The already black sky
Rain starts falling
Soaks the far ground sour ground
Cries from where 
Demons inside of me

As the son of eternal night 
Wants to become 
The son of light
Like a candle someone blew out
The glow is there but slowly fading
The ashes as my soul lies shattered
I cried before my gods 
I wept for my sins 
Blackened dawn
And what kind of god
Would have me deserve this
Blackened dawn

In the dark of this blackened dawn
