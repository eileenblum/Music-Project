In a garden of sorrow
Among the mourning of souls
A silent whisper you must walk alone
Even though my tears tells me not to
I must walk alone
I seek shelter
Cause I am hiding

As light is our darkness 
We seek the day
But when the shade of the night comes
It chases my strength away

My steps echoes
In this chapel of fall
And I see my past being
Being left behind
I hope I beg
Can't someone come and take my soul
And take my soul...
