Make me see through eyes
Of a different soul
Cause mine are closed and sealed
Since long before
To seek and hopefully find
Find my own voice
To sail beyond the sunset
And strand on solid ground 
I must to maintain
My now so weak belief
May it grow or else
The darkness will never cease

Lost am I in woods of never ending tress
That tomorrow will be dying due to my grief

Is this my ending I failed in my calls
Should have been there
Would have stayed
But to live in fear is not to live at all
Yes to live in fear is not to live at all

I close my eyes and I drift away
Crying loud gone is the day
Will I be awakened tomorrow
That I can only pray
The spark in me quickly fades
A silent voice inside
Child take a look at yourself
You've got to look with better eyes than that
Or else this journey ends

You're fighting a war
where the battle is yourself
Falling and you know
you are bound to fall again

Is this my ending I failed in my calls
Should have been stronger
Would have fought
But to live in fear is not to live at all
Yes to live in fear is not to live at all

[Solo: Bronell]

I'm climbing this latter
But it seems to long
Still it lights up a fire inside of me
That I did not think existed
But thinking again remembering hard times
Cause am I forsaken
Forsaken by gods
But this still is my battle
I am
I am abandoned
Oh yes I am

[Solo: Andy La Rouque]
