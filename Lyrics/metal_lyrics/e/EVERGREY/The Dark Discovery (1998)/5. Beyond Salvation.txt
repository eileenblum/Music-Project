The wolves carries my name 
In their midnight speeches
And that quiet subtle voice
Is summoning me from afar
And a voice much closer
Screams to me with unholy impatience

And the weight of your soul
Will decide it's final resting place

As light is our darkness 
we seek the day
But when the shade of the night comes
It chases my strength away

I've seen unknown lands 
No map has ever charted
And I lived in the deserts
And the wastelands
And I have spoken with the demons
And the souls of the slaughtered

And the weight of your soul
Will decide it's final resting place

As the light is our darkness...
