Weakened by the truth of life
Suffering this endless pain
Mourning the birth of time
Falling asleep to wake up in vain
Demons making trophies out of man
Nurturing from the souls of the lost
False prophets behind every lie
Predicting disaster in hope of horror

I hope death finds me
With the proper god in mind

To hope is to fear
To hope is to fear
To hope is to fear
To hope is to fear

Try to imagine not to fear the awakening of the sleeping
Try to see this fiction in it's truth
Instead of believing in a romance being
Distracted confused sad my soul's abused
I won't drift away with my tears
Cause to hope is to fear

I hope death finds me
With the proper god in mind

To hope is to fear
To hope is to fear
To hope is to fear
To hope is to fear

Let me through this hall of light
I've got to set foot on
The other side...
