Brought into this world
Met by open arms
See, I was born as hero
But deep inside this kingdom
I know that that's untrue
Given to many reasons
Lost my faith in you

Civitas
Civitas diablo

On and on we rise, we fall

This king is crowned by errors
Lost right to the throne
So place your crown of errors
Your kingâno soul!
All that we ever wanted was just to feel like you
But we're locked inside this prison of empty echoes

On and on we rise, we fall

I need to see
See the inside of me
Straight into the depth to unlock it all
To set all free
I know you fell the same
