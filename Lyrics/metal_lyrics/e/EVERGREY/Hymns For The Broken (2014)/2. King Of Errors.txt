We are crowned by our errors
And we're lost in the lone
Dare not look in the mirror
We've crowned a king with no soul

We have lost this to silence
There's no one left to fault
Dare not look in the mirror
'Cause it's full of holes

They call us kings then watch us fall down broken
Lost right to the throne then crown the king of errors

We have lost this to silence
There's no one left to fault
Dare not reach out and falter
When no one's left to call

Dare not reach out I falter
Cannot stand all your laughter
Reach out and touch me
You'll need to scream loud to reach me

They call us kings then watch us fall down broken
Lost right to the throne then crown the king of errors

They call us kings then watch us fall down broken
Lost right to the throne then crown me the king of errors
