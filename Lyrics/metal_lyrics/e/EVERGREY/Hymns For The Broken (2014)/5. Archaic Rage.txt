Deep down inside of me
Deep into infinity
Here it lies the birth of me
And here it dies 'cause you're hurting me
And you just keep breathing me
And I just keep bleeding through
You rule no longer
The kingdom's ours and growing stronger

We rise
'Cause nothing's the same
You hide when no one's to blame
We rise from ashes and stone
'Cause who I am to you does not reflect the truth

The steamy mist in the hollows makes it tougher to see who to follow
And at the altars of days forgotten the sacrifice is to separate the rotten
These shells have lost the capacity both to suffer to hope and to breathe free
There's no remedy

We rise
'Cause nothing's the same
You hide when no one's to blame
We rise from ashes and stone
'Cause who we am to you does not reflect the truth

We're the shells that have lost the capacity
Both to suffer to breathe and to bleed free
There's no remedy
There's no remedy

We rise
'Cause nothing's the same
You hide when no one's to blame
We rise from ashes and stone
