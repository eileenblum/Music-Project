I came with the harvest
I flew with the flames
We are the same
The black seeds of autumn
And cold winter rain
We are the same

Come
Come tear us open
Always felt that it was us not you
I am broken in two

Come, come tear me open
Always felt that it was me not you
I... now that I'm broken
I'm broken, not broken, not spoken to
Come, come tear me open
Always felt that it was me not you
I... now that I'm broken
Not spoken to

Six months have passed now
We're weary we're cold
Are the fires the same?
Still burning the same?
Is the fire the same?
Is the fire the same?

So we came during autumn and left with the snow
Our hearts had grown weary, we were wounded and cold
So I took my comrade's hand I stared him in the eyes and said
"We'll come back in spring," but then the bomb sirens bled

Come, come tear me open
Always felt that it was me not you
I... now that I'm broken
I'm broken, not broken, not spoken to
I, Come tear me open
Always felt that it was me not you
I... now that I'm broken
I'm broken, not broken, not spoken to

Not spoken to
