I missed you since forever
I longed for you when I was hurt
Longed so long I can't remember
Were there ever days of heaven?

Replace this pain with something new
Magic thoughts of white turned blue
I'm clinging to what seems a tale
Searching for the Holy Grail

And I've been missing you forever
And I've been missing you forever

Grand brushes of white and blue
Where one is Me
And one is you
Hope of highs soon joined by lows
And thoughts of why last sung by bows
That fire arrows that land in snow
Wake up hollow

Replace this pain with something new
Magic thoughts of white turned blue
I'm clinging to what seems a tale
Searching for the Holy Grail

And I've been missing you forever
