Only breath in the darkness
Feels like a black undertow
Only breath in the darkness
Let what is left just unfold

Freedom unfold
Feels like a black undertow
Free
Unfold like a black undertow

The morning mist chase the night away
But inside this heart it never strays it stays
And how solitude understands me it could never change
I know the swings how he tumbles how he sways

Freedom at last
Feels like a black undertow
Free
On hold
Like a black undertow

We're still in this together
Still in this together
Still in this together

Freedom on hold
Feels like a black undertow
Free
Unfold like a black undertow
