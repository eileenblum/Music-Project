Today I lost my way
Today I lost my will to say what I have known as truth
Becoming numb must wake a change
I used to live to stray
I used to choose the easy way
Becoming numb must wake a change

Becoming numb must wake a change
Must wake a change
Must rise to wake a change

'Cause no one knows our hearts
Not as well as us, that's what keeps us apart
Distant
But we'll conquer anything
Defeat this world that make us slave

Becoming numb must wake a change
Must wake a change
Must rise to wake a change

So if we're not keeping silent
If we just let it surface
Something surely comes to set us free
We're not keeping silent
Must defeat the words that make us slave
Leave this world that makes us hurt
Believe the sun will rise to greet a brand new day
Becoming numb must wake a change
Becoming numb must wake a change
Must wake a change
