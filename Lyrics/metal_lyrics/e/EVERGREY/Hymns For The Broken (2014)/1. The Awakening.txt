We've crowned a king with no soul
When all doors are closed, we walk alone
We know you've seen us, you always did
And every time you close your eyes
You make us fade
Don't you ever wonder if we sleep at night?
If we sit in silence, you think you're right
In the end, you were never right
(You were never right)
