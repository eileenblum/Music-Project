We wanted to be caught in dreams that never end
I want to travel to a place where I feel less insecure
But I will never fell like you

Came so close you, I
Came so close you, I
Came so close you, I
Came so close you, I

We fall like feathers
We fall forever
And we know you see us all
But do you really see the fall
The grand of I collapse
To contradict the past
