I need to disappear
Devoured and forgotten
Gotta hurry, these lands
Before it is too dark to see
I have to disappear

[Chorus 2x:]
Reach out, show me how you feel the same
Scream loud, these hymns are for the broken

Hey, you know me, my every turn
Hey, you see me, in front of you Iâll never hurt
Hey, hear me, it is time I learn
Hey, I know youâre watching me
Setting fires to the sea winds I burn

[Chorus 2x:]
Reach out, show me how you feel the same
Scream loud, these hymns are for the broken

[Instrumental break]

I need to disappear
Devoured and forgotten
Got to hurry, these lands
Before it is too dark to see
I have to disappear

[Chorus 2x:]
Reach out, show me how you feel the same
Scream loud, these hymns are for the broken
