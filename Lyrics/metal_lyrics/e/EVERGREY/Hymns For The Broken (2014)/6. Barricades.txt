Do you ever think it's over?
That we already lost
We'll never be convinced to change
Do you ever feel it's over?

We are the ones with too fast beating hearts
The ones who won't say that we are lost

But we have been fighting for much too long
We're getting tired
'Cause we have been watching our comrade's fall

So we throw ourselves with open arms
These open wounds and open palms
You watched and left us all to bleed
Drained these veins for all to see
But we're not falling
No!

We are the ones with too fast beating hearts
The ones who won't say that we are lost

I threw myself at heaven's arms
And wore my open wounds to see
You swore yourself to me
You swore yourself to me

But we have been fighting for much too long
We're getting tired
'Cause we have been watching our comrade's fall

And we have been fighting for much too long
We're getting tired
We're longing to see
The barricades fall
