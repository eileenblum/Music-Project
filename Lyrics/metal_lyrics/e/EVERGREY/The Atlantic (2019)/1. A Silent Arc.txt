A bursting hull
This ship torn asunder
Remote hearts now too distant
to survive another year in slumber

Gusts of wind fill my sails
I cast off into the twilight red
New winds offer strength
but I might rest on the ocean bed

Our heaven's dead
A silent arc
A reverie adrift for years
Our heaven is dead

In solitude I hesitate
the dark still blue, threatening
The empyrean silence speaks
telling me it's far too late

Our heaven's dead
A silent arc
A reverie adrift for years
Our heaven is dead
In search for new horizons
Sunrise for new horizons

Salvation came with newfound bearing
It rescued us from the careless sleep
And all these years of silent drifting
comes to an end in a dawning spring
Liberation from a perpetual burden
I see us disappearing I can feel us dissolving
By the grace of a pardon the eclipse yields for the break of day

Gusts of wind fill my sails
as I cast off into the twilight red
New winds offer strength
and I might rest on the ocean bed

Our heaven's dead
A silent arc
A reverie adrift for years
Our heaven is dead
In search for new horizons
A dawn for new horizons
