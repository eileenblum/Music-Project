A mind has traveled
A heart has changes its course
A sudden shift and a focus worn

I want to give you my silence
I want to five my solitude too
To share what's unspeakable
is all I own and can give to you

It's all I have
It's all I have
All I have
All I own that I can give to you

A mind has traveled
A heart has changes its course
What is left when all else pales?

It's all I have
All I have
It's all i have
All I own that I can give to you
All I have, all I have
It's all I have
All I own that I can give to you
All I own I can give to you
