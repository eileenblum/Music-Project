The starlit sky offered bearing
My escort through the night
When heavens darkened it dimmed my way
and deprived of my guiding light

I must find my beacon
To let what's dead come back to life
My capsized vessel weakens
The eternal red turns to night

Conformed to comfort
Our sanctuary it was worth the unease
It offered shelter and at bay in silence
the spreading disease

I must find my beacon
To let what's dead come back to life
My capsized vessel weakens
The eternal red turns to night
I must find the beacon
Before dearth of light becomes my blood
And I must leave the forsaken
From the shadows of dusk into the light

The grace of the moonlit sky my sanctum
And the high seas only sometimes pacified
Soon reduced into a final resting
Still I'm soaring
Still I'm soaring

I must find my beacon
To let what's dead come back to life
My capsized vessel weakens
The eternal red turns to night
I must find the beacon
Before dearth of light becomes my blood
And I must leave the forsaken
From the shadows of dusk into the light
