[Music: Danhage, Lyrics: Englund]

Time for a breather let it all sink in
A pause from the deceiver and to reach deep within
I close my eyes if only for a second
To let my courage rise
All I need is one more reason
To fail you as you failed me

Waiting for the waves to break
Hoping for the tide to change
Embracing the awaiting aim
Believing more than ever
Believing more than ever

I've tried too many times to leave you
Just as many times as I've cried to see you
Every road has its end and my end's here
And so does my faith
