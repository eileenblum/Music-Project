[Music: Englund, Lyrics: Englund]

Climbing walls of an endless circle
Walking paths you never heard of
Struggling in an endless battle
Searching for a higher purpose

Drowning in betrayals river
The freezing cold will make you shiver
Join the world of greater learning
Crown me king and be my servants

Mislead by beauty
One you rarely find
So loving and friendly
It's one of a kind

Their arms wide open
Willing to take me in
No doubts in choosing
A world free from sin

All the dreams I had
All my future wishes
Put aside for a greater journey
All the things I planned
Left my friends so coldly
Put aside for a
Higher...

Mislead by beauty
One you rarely find
So loving and friendly
It's one of a kind

One single army
Unite as one
A touch of blessing
Which cannot be undone

Drowning in betrayals river
The freezing cold will make you shiver
Join the world of greater learning
Crown me king and be my servants

All the dreams I had
All my failure wishes
Put aside for a greater journey
All the things I planned
Left my friends so coldly
Put aside for a higher purpose

[Solo]

[x2]
All the dreams I had
All my future wishes
Put aside for a greater journey
All the things I planned
Left my friends so coldly
Put aside for a
Higher
