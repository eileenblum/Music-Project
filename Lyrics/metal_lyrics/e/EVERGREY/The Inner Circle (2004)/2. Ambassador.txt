[Music: Englund/Ekdahl, Lyrics: Englund]

Show your soul for birth of freedom
Leave the cold to share our vision
Will you follow me
Will you walk with me
We'll hold your heart if it bleeds
Let me be your hand of guidance
No more solitude
No more independence
If God weeps he weeps through me
And if God hurts it hurts in me

I am
Light to cast away shadows
The Spirit, Holy Ghost, and even Jesus
God walking earth
Ambassador

Scattering all dark thoughts wandering
I shatter all doubts surfacing
This is my rescue and salvation
Undivided and blessed vision
