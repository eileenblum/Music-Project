[Music: Danhange / Englund / Zander, Lyrics: Englund]

Relentless I'm speechless
I'm fooled by my inner weakness
Enticing Inspiring
Your words were so convincing
Delightful but soulless
Claimed harmless wishes seems less
Exciting
Just frightening

No more dawning days
Only whispers of darkened ways
Forever falling tears
Forever falling
No more screams in vain
No more dreams put to shame
It's only me
Only me

Defenseless and smiling
Her innocence is shining
His own flesh and own blood
His words were so convincing
Delightful so beautiful
Can't stop what he's been told
She's three years old

No more dawning days
Only whispers of darkened ways
Forever falling tears
Forever falling
No more screams in vain
No more dreams put to shame
It's only me who's forever
Falling, sleepwalking, desperate, calling

No more dawning days
Only whispers of darkened ways
Forever falling tears
Lands in the hands of somber fate
