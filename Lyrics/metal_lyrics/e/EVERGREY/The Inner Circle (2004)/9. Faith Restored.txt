[Music: Englund, Lyrics: Englund]

In a moment of clarity
It all became crystal
And now I try to find someone to heal me
I'm broken
Through the mist in a dream where I show you
Through the rain and the dark that holds you
Heal me, I'm broken

Time to discover what lies hidden in the sand
Time for renewal and to be cleansed by the hand
To heal me relieve me
Heal me
Release me while I'm still breathing

And when it all came to clarity
There was no perfection
Dreams where shattered
Hope was washed away

Through the mist in a dream where I show you
Through the rain and the dark that holds you
Heal me, I'm broken

(If you're one of those people who believe that
You cannot be free from the bondage of sin...
I'm not talking about perfection...
But do not believe that you can ever be free...
That there will always be bondage in your life...
I have nothing more to say to you.
This message from now on will mean nothing to you...)

Time to start over
I'm given a new chance
And time to discover
There were no treasures in the sand
To heal me relieve me
Heal me
Release me while I'm still breathing
