[Music: Zander / Englund, Lyrics: Englund]

In depths so deep I can't believe
Confusion conquers and frustration wins
Into where light does not reach
This is where pain and sorrow meets

Into denial
Baptized into a liar
Give me the power
Would you
Could you

Caught in a world where angels weep
Where hatred battles greed
And frustration wins
Chained to a world where all good sleep
This is where pain and sorrow meets

I'm doubting still denying
The truth was more than shocking
I'm doubting I'm hiding, hiding
I'm running knowing they're watching
I'm still in disbelief from what I've seen
Where I'm hiding... hiding.
