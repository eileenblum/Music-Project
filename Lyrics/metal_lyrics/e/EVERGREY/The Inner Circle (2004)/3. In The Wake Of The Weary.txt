[Music: Danhage, Lyrics: Englund]

So high on believing
Not seeing your changing
I carry the weight and I'm weary
We're rounded severely
Despite of your vision
You claim seeing so clearly
Can't respect your decision
In the wake of the weary

Your angels are calling
The aim is rewarding
Through ashes and falling
So helpless and withering

We're wounding severely

Despite of your treason
And a future I'm fearing
I try to run when the walls come down
Try to hide from the feelings I'm fearing but still.
Can't respect your decision

We're wounded severely
Should see it so clearly
And I can't take it no more
A life in a lie where I scream and I cry
But she won't lie no more
