[Music: Englund, Lyrics: Englund]

Leave the lie you got to find a way
Ask yourself why and give yourself a reason to stay
Leave the lie I am begging in vain
We're all left to fight with why
You're not the same.

Left behind we are stranded not free
In silence I cry what went wrong was it me
Led to believe in a truth that was false
Truth built on greed and the faith of the weak

Waking up blind and blind you must be
So stupid of me to believe in your hypocrisy
Gave it all up for life in a dream
So foolish of me to not stop your infidelity

Unfaithful
Unfaithful to life
