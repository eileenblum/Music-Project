I remember your voice and your dreams
Your smile when you laughed
And your pain when you screamed
I'll follow your footsteps let them be my guide
Can you save me from being myself?
It's hard to be strong when you're stuck in a shell
If you don't desert me I won't let down

In remembrance
Of all the things you used to do
In remembrance
Of all the faith I had in you
In remembrance
And when I walk, I walk for you
In remembrance of you

I remember when we used to run
Against any threat united as one
We faced all our fears
And we chased all the clouds blocking the sun
And through the haze my sorrow created
I heard your voice and the promise you stated
And I...
Won't let you down

In remembrance
Of all the things you used to do
In remembrance
Of all the faith I had in you
In remembrance
And when I walk, I walk for you
In remembrance of you

Cause I never saw you deserted
Or you never spoke so I heard it
Cause I would never let you down
Did you call me and I didn't listen?
Did I force you to make a decision?
Did I?

In remembrance
Of all the days we planned
And all the things we said we'd do
In remembrance
Of all the times we had
And the fate I shared with you
In remembrance
You'll always be my truth
Cause what I know I've learned from you
In remembrance of you
Of all the things you used to do
And all the faith I had in you
Cause when I walk, I walk for you
In remembrance of you
