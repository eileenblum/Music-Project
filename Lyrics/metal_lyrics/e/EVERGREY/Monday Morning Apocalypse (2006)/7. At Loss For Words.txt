Here we are once again
Time to choose at the crossroads end
Here we are stuck again
Time to speak or to forever be silent

It comes to a point where I can't take another lie
The day has finally come
Where I demand your silence
Comes to a point where I can't accept another lie
The day has finally come where I would die for your silence

At loss for words
And I'm short of breath
And in fear of truth I came to trust in you
What I demand of you is just to speak the truth
You've got your chance right now
Or to forever be...

It comes to a point where I will know you lived a lie
And I'm the first on my knees to accept my naivety
Comes to a point where I can't accept another lie
The day has finally come for you not me
To be...

At loss for words
And I'm short of breath
And in fear of truth I came to trust in you
What I demand of you is just to speak the truth
You've got your chance right now

Or forever be bleeding...
To forever be believing...
To hide from me...
And leave me alone...

[Englund]

Here we are once again
Time to choose at the crossroads end
Here we are stuck again
Time to speak or to forever be silent

At loss for words
And I'm short of breath
And in fear of truth I came to trust in you
What I demand of you is just to speak the truth
You've got your chance right now
Or to forever be...
