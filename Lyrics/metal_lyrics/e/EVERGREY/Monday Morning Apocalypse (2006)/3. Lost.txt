I have been walking this long dark road
And I have been climbing this tree so old
I have been wanting to let it all fall
It's making me
Turning me...

Inside out
Going outside in
As I lie here
Inside out going outside in

You promised me to leave me be
But I got lost and could not see clearly
Not I'm afraid of whom I used to be
Right now I'm just glad that you found me

Inside out
Going outside in
As I lie here
Inside out going outside in

Can I admit to you that I was wrong?
Will you forgive me for what I have done?
Would you leave me here wounded and bleeding?

[Danhage]

Inside out
Going outside in
Inside out going outside in
As I lie here...
Inside out
Going outside in
As I lie here
Inside out going outside in
