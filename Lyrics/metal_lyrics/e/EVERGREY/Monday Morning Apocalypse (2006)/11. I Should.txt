Remind me of what you said life had made you do.
What did you do to make all you had fall through?
What forces you to make the choices that you do?
Are we to blame for all the failures that are you?
Or should we blame you?
Should we blame you?

I should blame you for the falling rain.
I should blame you for all my constant pain.
I should be there to remind you every day.
I should...

How come we hear the cross that you should?
How come we wear the wounds that you should?
I am confused.
Why is it me who's bleeding?
We never had the chance to make the choice you had.
We were all too young to understand.
Not like you.
Not like you, dad.

I should blame you for the falling rain.
I should blame you for all my constant pain.
I should be there to remind you every day.
I should.
I should walk you through the halls of my own fate.
I should let you taste the tears that fell in hate.
I should be there to remind you every day.
I should.
