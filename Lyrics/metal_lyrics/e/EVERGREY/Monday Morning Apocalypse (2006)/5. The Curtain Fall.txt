I have tried, I have fought, but for nothing
And I have touched, I have reached, just for something
I can't breathe, I can't sleep, but I'm fighting
Before the curtain falls

Step in and walk along
Breathe in and let it come
Sit down and watch the curtain fall

Step in and walk along
You've got to give into let it show
How to beat the wake to become
And praise the strong

Step in and walk along
Breathe in and let it come
Sit down and watch the curtain fall

You took my trust for granted
You shook my hand and smiled
I walked away believing
In a world that never was

You'll never walk alone
I'll mark your words and follow
You'll never be alone

So step in and walk along
Breathe in and let yourself go
Sit down and watch the curtain fall
