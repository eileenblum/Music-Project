This is how we try to keep warm
And trust me you'll need it when it's cold
One more thing just so you don't forget
Don't wake him when he's sleeping
Try and hide before he sees you
You can try but I'm that you won't
Don't you cry so that he hears you
I am sure that you won't

And you'll despise yourself for dreaming
Hate yourself for believing
Lie to yourself in obedience
For how long will it be this dark?
The light's been gone since ever
How are we supposed to carry on?
Are we here forever?

And you'll despise yourself for dreaming
Hate yourself for believing
Lie to yourself in obedience
Obedience
And you will cry yourself to sleep
Fight yourself to not give in
Lie to yourself in obedience

Does anybody miss her?
Can anybody hear her?
Does anybody scream her name?
Does anybody miss her?

[Englund]
[Danhage]

Try and hide before he sees you
You can try but I'm that you won't
Don't you cry so that he hears you
But I am sure that you won't
And you'll despise yourself for dreaming
Hate yourself for believing
Lie to yourself in obedience
Obedience
And you will cry yourself to sleep
Fight yourself to not give in
Lie to yourself in obedience
Obedience...
