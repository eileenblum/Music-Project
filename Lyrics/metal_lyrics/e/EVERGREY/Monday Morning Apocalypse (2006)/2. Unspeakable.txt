In a time and a place where I had to bit my lip
To not be crying
Through the embers of the 2nd phase I had to
Chose another way of dying
And in dreams they come for you
Have they not come to see you too?
In silence flying through the room
Lonely thoughts try to conquering you

I want to help you but you never ask
And I want you to and I told you forever that
Why won't you tell me why you never laugh?
Cause I've told you forever you have to believe in me

Hand in hand through the worlds I try to conquer
I have fate walking beside me
And through halls of forgotten bliss I have to
Make a choice or die trying
And in dreams they come for you
Have they not come to see you too?
In silence flying through the room
Lonely thoughts try to conquering you

I want to help you but you never ask
And I want you to and I told you forever that
Why won't you tell me why you never laugh?
Cause I've told you forever you have to believe in me
Believe in me...

Why would you ever...

[Englund]

I want to help you but you never ask
And I want you to and I told you forever that
Why won't you tell me why you never laugh?
Cause I'll always hear you
I want to help you but you never ask
Cause I want you to and I told forever that I
Would always help you guide you when you're blind
Forever and ever
I want to help you but you never ask
And I want you to and I told you forever that
Why won't you tell me why you never laugh?
Cause I've told you forever you have to believe in me
