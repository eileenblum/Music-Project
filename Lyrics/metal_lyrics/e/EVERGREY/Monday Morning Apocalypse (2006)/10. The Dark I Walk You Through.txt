He walked her down the street
And stopped where he always left her
He kissed her on the cheek and said
- Honey, I'll see you later...
And little did he know
That the words he said would never happen ever
He waved to her and turned
And that was the last time he saw her

I'm sorry for the times I screamed
And the times I made you lonely
I'm sorry for the times I made you cry
And the times I didn't hold you
I'm sorry for the doubts I brought to you
I'm sorry for the dark I walk you through
I'm sorry for the times I put you through
Forgive me...

Did not walk far
Before I heard the sounds of sirens
Did I reflect at all when they stopped?
And everything turned silent?
Did you scream at all?
I wish I would have been there
Did you scream at all?
I wish I would have been there

I'm sorry for the times I screamed
And the times I made you lonely
I'm sorry for the times I made you cry
And the times I didn't hold you
I'd never lie
It's you and I
But I failed to keep my promise

If I could I would do anything to change it
I would spend all my time to make sure you would all be safe

[Danhage]

I should have done it all so differently
I should have followed you like you wanted me
If I had known what fate would do to you
I would have prayed to her to take me too
I'm sorry that I didn't walk with you
I'm sorry that I did not listen to you
I should have done it all so differently
But I'm just me...
