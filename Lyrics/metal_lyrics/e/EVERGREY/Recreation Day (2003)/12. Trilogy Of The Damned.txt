In a garden of sorrow
Among the mourning of souls
A silent whisper you must walk alone
Even though my tears tells me not to
I must walk alone
I seek shelter
Cause I am hiding

As light is our darkness
We seek the day
But when the shade of the night comes
It chases my strength away

My steps echoes
In this chapel of fall
And I see my past being
Being left behind
I hope I beg
Can't someone come and take my soul
And take my soul...

My sanity has left me
My trust died with you
What is left are only pieces
My tears fall for you

I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna roll
I'm gonna thunder

So I place the roses
So gently on your grave
And I still remember
I can feel the flames
And I know I have failed
and my promises nothing worth
I see it all so clear
But my words mean nothing

I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna roll
I'm gonna thunder

My sanity has left me
The trust I once had has died
What is left are only pieces
All my words been proven lies
Been proven lies
If I could I would
Fly roll thunder
All for just another chance to speak with you
Show you
But my words...
But my words mean...
Nothing

All the battles that I've fought and lost
When I'm asleep they come
All the screams that I've screamed unheard
A weak wounded soul

Dare I open my eyes and see
How much more can they possibly harm me
The frustration
The hurt
The fear
Of a weak wounded soul

They're watching me
They're touching me
Moving so quick they're all around me
Ain't got the right
But say they do
The Shocking Truth

A weak wounded soul
A deeply wounded soul
