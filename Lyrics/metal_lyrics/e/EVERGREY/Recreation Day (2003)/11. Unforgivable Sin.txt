Lonely thoughts from a lonely mind
He fights for recognition
Desperate tries only
Increasing the pressure
Falls blind unseen forever
The children of today
The children of tomorrow
Forced out of a life of their own
We are the sinners of these days
And only bringers of sorrow
We're only bringers of sorrow

Unforgivable sin
Temptation too big
Unforgivable sin
Temptation too big
Unforgivable sin
Unforgivable...

Wounds inflicted a bloodstained soul
Distinct marks of violence
Skin fragments under nails
And a God forsaken fate
No holy water can save him now
A false prophet, a deceiving smile
Arms open - here's trust to find
A man of God, a temptation too big
Unforgivable sin

No holy water can save him now
And no prayers can cleanse the lust
He used, abused, &amp; he raped the trust
The innocence of a life is lost

Unforgivable sin
Temptation too big
Unforgivable sin
Temptation too big
Unforgivable sin
Temptation too big
