In a future not so distant
The sun &amp; moon will still rise
But mother Earth shall force us to listen
I have seen it written
And so it shall it be done
I have a gift, some even call it a blessing
I'm caught in a dream
A dream where I can't run

Where I can't run...

Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Wish I was caught in a dream
But I'm not so I'm
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Wish I was caught in dream
But I'm not...

I try to hide my visions
Throw'em in &amp; lock'em up
In a room with just four walls
I did not choose this mission
Who pointed me the prophet?
With a crystal ball
I have a gift, some even call it a blessing
I'm caught in a dream
A dream where I can't run

Where I can't run...

Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Wish I was caught in a dream
But I'm not so I'm
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Wish I was caught in dream
But I'm not...
