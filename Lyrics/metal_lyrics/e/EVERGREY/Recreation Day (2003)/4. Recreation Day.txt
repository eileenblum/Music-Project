1 step at the time
Small progess seems futile
But is as valuable as life
I'm engaged to longing
With sorrow as the ring
Controlling me, denying me
My every mourning is in every way
The beginning of a recreation day
Time heals, but still the mourning reigns
I still breath when the loss reminds me again
I am here
Life is fear &amp; sorrow's all I know
Am I in dept cause so it seems
But what I owe
I don't know
Devoured by guilt &amp; cursed beyond control
My every morning is in every way
The beginning of a recreation day
