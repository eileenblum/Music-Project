Compelled to speak when not to speak
My words lead &amp; I follow
I must talk or else I'm weak
Let no one know my shell's hollow

False world created
I just watch it come to life
Your faith's my weapon
And your trust by my side

Lost all my senses
Can't feel, can't hear, I'm
Blinded
Lost all my senses
Emotionally numb
Blinded

Nothing's sacred &amp; no one's safe
I'm feeding on denial
Getting careless soon bound to fail
Fooled by my own betrayal

Are you lost in fury?
Fearing to fail
Are you aching for vengeance?
And got lost on the way
Are you hiding your anger?
Fearing truth will prevail
Ashamed of the present
And what you've become today

False world created...

Lost all my senses...
