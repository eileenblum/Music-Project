Feel free to question me
Let out the hate you feel
Blame all your doubts on me
And your caving reality
I will not judge, I cannot judge
So feel free to question me

I would hold you when you're sleeping
I would guide you when you're drifting
I'd be the light you seek in your darkest hour

I will show you how to leave it
Out of the darkness &amp; into the light
Leave it
I will show you how to leave it
To find a new day &amp; a vision in bright

Feel free to question me
Let out the hate you feel
Walk throught insanity
And awake into crystal clarity

I will show you how to leave it
Out of the darkness &amp; into the light
Leave it
I will show you how to leave it
To find a new day &amp; a vision in bright
