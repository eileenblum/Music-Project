I've been searching for so long
For someone to lead the way
And I've been searching for someone
Someone to ease the pain
And I've been searching for someone
Anyone to help me cure my shame
Madness caught another victim
And the victim's name is blame

What are my options?
When the road I'm walking ends
What are my options?
When all my ambitions fails

The words you now are reading
Are meant for your eyes only
I hoped for strength but now I'm leaving
Cause I fear my feelings
And to not do you justice
Is too much for me to bare
And as courage is my weakness
I choose the cowards path

What are my options?
When the road that I'm walking ends?
And what are my options?
When the last ship of hope have sailed
What are my options?
When the road that I'm walking ends
So what are my options?
When my words are all that remains
