I am your temptation
Your every vicious thought
Lacking self-confidence
Deception in it's purest form
I am your hesitation
When you wander in circles
The hand you reach for when no one's there
In a charade so perfect

Come walk this way
And I'll have you
I'll show you
Yearning, dreaming
Your humble servant
Your trust so precious
I'm the user, the abuser
Haunting, serving
The great deciever

I am your false beauty
I am your hidden hate
THe hideous face of sloth
What makes you degenerate
And I am the shadow
What you sense when no one's near
Discomfort &amp; pleasure
'Til your chapter ends

Come walk this way
And I'll have you
I'll show you
Yearning, Dreaming
Your humble servant
Your trust so precious
I'm the user, the abuser
Haunting, serving
The great deciever
