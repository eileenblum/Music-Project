I place my foot on the first step
That leads me down into my fate
So father please forgive me
As I cannot see it end
I am now up on the table
It trembles under my weight
I wipe away the cold sweat
Close my eyes &amp;...

Falling out of what I know is true
Falling come shelter me as I lie here bleeding
Falling away from what I thought was you
Falling come shelter me as I lie here bleeding

So speak &amp; I listen
I'll take the time to hear you out
So scream &amp; I sure listen
I just need a little time

Gathering the pieces of a stronger me
Helpless weak &amp; battered
My wounds are bleeding

Falling out of what I know is true...

Gathering the pieces...

Falling out of what I know is true...
