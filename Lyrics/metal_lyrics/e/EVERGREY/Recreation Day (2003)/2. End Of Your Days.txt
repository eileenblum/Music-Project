I've tried it all
It's gone too far
And the worst of all
Is the promise that I can't keep

I have emptied every source
I have learned all there is to know

To stand by as you wither
To watch your spirit drain
I just wish hope could last forever
Last forever

So here we are
The end of your days
So here we are

So here we are
I have lost, I have failed
My promise not kept &amp; I'm sorry

I have emptied every source
I have learned all there is to know

So here we are
Holding hand at the end of days
Your eyes slowly shuts
You hand lets go &amp; I kiss you farewell
Farewell...

So here we are
The end of your days
So here we are

So here we are
I have lost, I have failed
My promise not kept &amp; I'm sorry
So here we are
I promised hope forever, but I'm sorry
