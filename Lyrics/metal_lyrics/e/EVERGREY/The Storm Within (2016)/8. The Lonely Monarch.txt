I dwell in your shadow
I dare not wake what's asleep
I grew in your shadow
I never defied the resting beast
But when you dress in your black wings again
When you turn your back on me again
Still not denying you
Still not denying you

I've tried a thousand times
And bowed a thousand more
And I fought through eternal nights
To keep us from falling
It's written across the sky
It offers clarity
It is not you, it's only me
Who keeps us from falling down

I always felt a burden
It was always hard
Always felt uncertain
You never meant no harm
Raise that head again
Wake that will again
Solution could be tranquil
And absolution so close
Don't fear to turn inside
Leave that path behind
Cross the inner lines
Change your ways to end
Where are your reasons to extend
The lonely monarch's war again?

I've tried a thousand times
And bowed a thousand more
I fought through eternal nights
To keep us from falling
It's written across the sky
It offers clarity
It is not you, it's only me
Who keeps us from falling

I've tried a thousand times
And bowed a thousand more
I fought through eternal nights
To keep us from falling
It's written across the sky
It's clear for all to see
That it's not you, it's only me
Who keeps us from falling down
Who keeps us from falling
Who keeps us from falling down
