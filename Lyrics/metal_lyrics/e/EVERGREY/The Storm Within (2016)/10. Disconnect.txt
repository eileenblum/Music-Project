Gone
She's gone
How am I suppose to make it alone?
Don't leave this
Don't leave me
I'll disconnect
Before it takes me over
I undress and fall
Wish to leave it all
I disconnect
Before it takes me over

Is this, if this is all I have now
then I, then I need to disconnect now
I never meant to be indifferent
Never wanted you to feel irrelevant
You were
You were never insignificant

So don't leave this
Don't leave me
I'll disconnect
Before it takes me over
I undress and fall
Wish to leave it all
I disconnect
Before it takes me over

[Solo: Englund]
[Solo: Danhage]

Don't leave this
Don't leave me ...
