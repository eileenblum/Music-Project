This is not for me
I can't persist or breathe
That which poisons me
My angels are falling and I lie bare
Felled by the arrows of a different calling
Urging me to look
Look the other way
Faith's amiss and I'm astray
This was never meant for me
So why would I stay?

The winter
Once brought me this sorrow
Since everything seems to hurt
Just let me go

Got doubts enough to fill
An emptiness, a void
I'm on the other side of life
Where I don't belong
I threw myself in heaven's arms
Wore my open wounds to see
You swore yourself to me
So join my hands in search of truth
Please take the giant leap with me
This world is not for me
So why should I stay?

The winter
Once brought me this sorrow
Since everything seems to hurt
Just let me go
I used to be stronger
I used to want this more
Is everything meant to hurt?
It won't leave me alone

[Solo: Danhage]

Layer after layer
I need to keep this hidden
Brick after brick
Buries it deeper and deeper
Leave it in the cold
To be forgotten to grow old

The winter
Once brought me this sorrow
Since everything seems to hurt
Just let me go
I used to be stronger
I used to want this more
Is everything meant to hurt?
Just let me go
