Ten years from now I'll watch from far away
Ten years from now I might have found my way
Ten years from now I'll see through different eyes
Better, wiser and not as blind

Always looked for acceptance
And understood what it's like to be different
Did not believe in transcendence
This life gave birth to independence

Does no one see it like I do?
Does no one know that we're just passing through?
No one feel what I do?
We're passing through

These silhouettes remain, they're not the sum of me
No longer represent who I used to be
They just remind me of where I used to wake
How I used to think, how I used to ache

Ten years from now I'll watch from far away
Ten years from now I should have found my way
Ten years from now I'll see through different eyes
Better, wiser and not as blind

Does no one see it like I do?
Does no one know that we're just passing through?
No one feel what I do?
That we're just passing through

I always looked for acceptance
I understood what it's like to be different
Did not believe in transcendence
Just independence

Does no one see it like I do?
Does no one know that we're just passing through?
No one feel what I do?
That we're just passing through

Does no one see it like I do?
Does no one know that we're just passing through?
No one feel what I do?
We're passing through
