I'm caught here in this vacuum
I'm falling from a sunless sky
I'll rid myself of value
And leave this emptiness behind

So I run before it's over
I run but still never leave it seems
Run but not getting closer
I run to get away from this dream

I have been watching you from a distance
I have been monitoring you from cloudless skies
I've been calling your name just to ease your resistance
But nothing seems to shift your darkened sky

Run before it's over
Run but still never leave it seems
Run but not getting closer
I run to get away from this dream

I'm in orbit
Stars exploding when I call your name
Here's too dark and lonely
You're my compass
My only reason to stay sane

[Solo: Danhage]
[Solo: Englund]

Run before it's over
Run but still never leave it seems
Run but not getting closer
And I run, to get away from this dream

Run but not getting closer
Run but still never leave it seems
Run!
