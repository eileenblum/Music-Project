[Lyrics: Englund]

See my sorrow
My tears when they fall
Feel my anguish
Where's my shelter when I am cold
My eyes seek something
But finds nothing at all
My souls screams for mercy
Where's my guidance when I'm lost

The will I had ain't strong enough
The strength I seek ain't there
And my world is dead
My future's broken
Cause it all stays the same

They're coming
They're coming... here
