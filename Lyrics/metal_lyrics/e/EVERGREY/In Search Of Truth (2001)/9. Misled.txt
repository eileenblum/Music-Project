[Lyrics: Englund]

Strapped in a bed with no clothes
The room has no windows
I try to remember last night
But there's nothing
It is cold and my body starts to shiver
I try to fight it but trying makes me nauseous
I'm having a hard time deciding
If this is where they take me
Where they take me

I'm crawling back to sleep
And i still can't believe
Howcome you lost your faith in me
I spoke with nothing but honesty

I don't recognise the silence
I can feel it the reality of it scares me
Sounds of steps outside
Keys in the door-lock
White robes they're human
I've been misled

I'm crawling back to sleep
And I still can't believe
Howcome you lost your faith in me
I spoke with nothing but honesty

[solo danhage]

I'm crawling back to sleep
And I still can't believe
Howcome you lost your faith in me
Why did you lose your faith
