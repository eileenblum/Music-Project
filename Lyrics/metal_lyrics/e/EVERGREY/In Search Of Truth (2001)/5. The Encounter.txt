[lyrics: Englund]

Like leaves on trees in fall
I'm shivering I'm falling
Like the screams from a new-born child
So innocent so fragile
Screaming struggling trying
I want to see what the future holds
This life in fear is no life at all

The will I had ain't strong enough
And the strength I seek ain't there
My world is dead
My future's broken
And it all stays the same

They're coming
They're coming here to stay
They're coming
They're taking me away...

I beg for a helping hand
I'm reaching I am searching
But no...
And i pray for an ear that listens
My hope's washed away
I'm here alone

[solo danhage]

I hear them
They're coming
Quickly through the hallway
The door opens
Helpless again

The will I had ain't strong enough
The strength i seek ain't there
My world is dead
My future's broken
Cause it all stays the same

They're coming
They're coming here to stay
They're coming
They're taking me away...
They're coming
Only to leave me in shame
Simply leave me...
