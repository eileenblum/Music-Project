[Lyrics: Englund]

The sun is back again the day is here
Try to recall try to remember
What night brought upon me this time
There it is I've seen it before recognise the shape
I'm scarred but not sore
Recognise the shape i recognise the shape
I've been marked by the triangle

Screams for answers
Lost beyond control
And I
I try to find a reason
But here I am a hollow soul
Here I am
I've been marked by the triangle

The night has come
It brings the fear
It's never-ending everlasting
What was that sound
Is somebody here
I can sense their presence
The room is getting colder

Screams for answers
Lost beyond control
And I
I try to find a reason
But here I am a hollow soul
Here I am
I've been marked by the triangle

[solo englund / danhage]

It's getting harder to breath
Please go away
You've already taken my dignity
And what more could you possibly need
The darkness is gone
It's day...

Screams for answers
Lost beyond control
And I
I can't find a reason
So here I am a hollow soul
Here I am
I've been marked by the triangle
