[Lyrics: Englund]

You can't possibly know me
What I feel cause even I don't
A strange sensation of never being lonely
Has made me question the essence of existence
...of life

Are we parts of a puzzle
Small pieces in a major plan
Fuppets on a string being run by a master
Formed and shaped like clay

[solo englund / solo danhage]

I'm trying but failing unanswered cries unites
The struggling of finding the truth behind the lies
I'm trying they're laughing my rulers of the mind
I'm trying ...I'm trying

Their constant presence deceives me
I can't tell when i'm awake or when i dream
And my hiding is useless
My anxiety reveals me
Gives me away

I'm trying but failing unanswered cries unites
The struggling of finding the truth behind the lies
I'm trying they're laughing my rulers of the mind
I'm trying ...I'm trying...
