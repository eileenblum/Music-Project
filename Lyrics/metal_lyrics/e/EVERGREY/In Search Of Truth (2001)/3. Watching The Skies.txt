[Lyrics: Englund]

Time has come to ask myself
What future lies ahead
The weakness of my soul
Awakes the fury that was dead
And what is it that brings out the shame

In my dreams i travel
Lost confused
Still searching
Watching the skies
All my sleep is wasted
Awake or not
Still waiting
Watching the skies

My home is no longer
A place where safety can be found
Constantly looking over my shoulder
Forced into the darkest corner of the mind
I find myself not trusting anyone
And distrust leaves you lonely
The hiding from the fear
Brings me closer to despair
Feelings of doubt joins me

I fight to keep myself above the surface
I try but the waves i swim are just growing stronger
The light's getting distant and i am drifting further 
i'm being swallowed by the night

[solo karlsson]

In my dreams i travel
Lost confused
Still searching
Watching the skies
All my sleep is wasted
Awake or not
Still waiting
Watching the skies

Please be the eyes
That guides me through
Please be the hands to lead me
In search for the shocking truth
Please be my courage
My will to win
Please understand and listen
Please be my friend
