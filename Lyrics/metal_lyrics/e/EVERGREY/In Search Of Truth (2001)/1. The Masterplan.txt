[Lyrics: Englund]

Look at me
And tell me if there's something
Strange you see
Am I special - something's wrong
- can't be the only one
Talk to me stare me in the eyes
And say you know it too
It really doesn't matter
I know your fear - seen it all
The truth

We are all a part of
Forced to live within
A conspiracy for ages
The masterplan

Tell you about my theory
Cleanse myself from secrecy
Prove it's not all fantasies
All to live in decency
My quest for answers
The truth of what lies behind
The search is over
And I'm in shock of what I've found

We are all a part of
Forced to live within
A conspiracy for ages
The masterplan

[solo danhage / englund]

We are all a part of
Forced to live within
A conspiracy for ages
The masterplan
