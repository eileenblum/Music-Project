[lyrics: Englund]

Twilight
Still not dark
The snow on the ground sheds some light
A silhouette not taller than a child
Appears in the doorway
Too strange to be real yet too real to be a dream
Immense fear grabs a hold of me
I'm paralysed numb and naked
Branches passes me I see treetops beneath me
A floor in grey below me slowly shuts like an iris

Activity - and all turns black once again
Lunacy - my weakness force me to follow
Encountering a depth of hate never seen
Blood runs cold I cease exist and my soul is hollow

Deprived of all pride
I've been stripped of all value
I'm worth nothing here
And I know no-one

She stares at me
At least I perceive her as a she
And she speaks to me I can hear her
Her lips doesn't move
Why can't I be left alone to live my life in harmony
The visitors by night makes this a living nightmare

Deprived of all pride
I've been stripped of all value
Worth nothing here
And I know no-one

[solo englund]

Deprived of all pride
I've been stripped of all value
Worth nothing here
And i know no-one
Deprived of all pride
I've been stripped of all value
On the other side
Of the dark waters
