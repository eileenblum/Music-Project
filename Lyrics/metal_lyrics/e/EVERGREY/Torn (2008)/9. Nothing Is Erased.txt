Been poisoned in the blood-red sea
I've fallen out of reach
It's coloured by the mix of tears and the open wounds of thousand
Devoured by the strength of waves that feels like flames of fire
Enslaved by years in nothingness
I surrender to the silence

And when I'm reaching
you're just turning
Your hands are gone when I try to reach for them

Today you died for me
Today you set me free
But the scars you caused will stay
Nothing is erased, no nothing
You claim it's not your fault
You say you're not to blame
But even though you died today
Nothing is erased
No nothing

Did you really think that we would cope forever
Maybe you never stopped to think at all
The scars that we wear were not self-inflicted
It was your words that caused our fall

Today you died for me
Today you set me free
But the scars you caused will stay
Nothing is erased, no nothing
You claim it's not your fault
You say you're not to blame
But even though you died today
Nothing is erased
No nothing

And when I'm reaching
you're just turning
Your hands are gone when I try to reach for them

Today you died for me
Today you set me free
But the scars you caused will stay
Nothing is erased, no nothing
You claim it's not your fault
You say you're not to blame
But even though you died today
Nothing is erased
No nothing

What if I would say I'm different
What if I would say I've changed
Would it really doesn't matter
I'm just asking for some faith
And if you'd give your heart I'd take it
To never ever break it
But the scars you caused remains
and nothing is erased
