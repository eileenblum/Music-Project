It's like when kingdoms fall and you're left without a lender
It's like when dreams your all and all you dream is to see her
And everything reminds you of when you were safe in slumber
And the circles you wander grows greater and bigger

So falls the wintersnow
So vivid yet lifeless out of control
Dark days and all that comes with it
what feels like a lifetime mourned
And how I awaited deliverance for what seemed a lifetime lost
And days turn to years

Just like when kingdoms fall and the world feels like the deceiver
Their words of comfort still wont reach me, can't touch me
Inside this self-created shelter where no one sees
Where no one hears
I allow myself to break and really reach to touch the ache

So falls the wintersnow
So vivid yet lifeless out of control
Dark days and all that comes with it
what feels like a lifetime mourned
And how I awaited deliverance for what seemed a lifetime lost
And days turn to years

Shadow casts regrets on the wall
I stand alone when my empire fall
As I complete another lap
I hope I find the day when it all
leads me to my final resting place
Leaves me alone until I feel safe
Opens me up until I confide
in a world where I don't collide

So falls the wintersnow
So vivid yet lifeless out of control
Dark days and all that comes with it
what feels like a lifetime mourned
And how I awaited deliverance for what seemed a lifetime lost
And days turn to years
