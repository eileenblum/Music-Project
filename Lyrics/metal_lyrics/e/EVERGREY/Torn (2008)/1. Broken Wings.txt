From loss into your embrace
I fled the fear and the dark of day
Like an angel of fallen grace
My broken wings can't hold my weight
I came so close that I felt the flames
I came so close that I'll never be safe again
I'd give anything to find a way to leave the fear and evacuate

Come reach inside my inner fear
Come feel my sorrow and my tears
My broken wings can't hold my weight
through the dark of day

Leave that guilt-stained cross behind
Free your arms do it one by one
It's not your fault you are not to blame
Your wing-clipped past should not bring you shame
And the years that you still endured
should work as strength to see past it all

Come reach inside my inner fear
Come feel my sorrow and my tears
My broken wings can't hold my weight
through the dark of day
All hope's been burnt to ashes
And I'm so tired of hiding the bruises
My broken wings can't take me
through the dark of day

Deep cuts will not help you heal
The pain inflicted's just false relief
Precious moments where you can dream
of a day when you too can feel

Come reach inside my inner fear
Come feel my sorrow and my tears
My broken wings can't hold my weight
through the dark of day
