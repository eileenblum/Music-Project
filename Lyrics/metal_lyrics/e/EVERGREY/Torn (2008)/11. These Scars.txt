I walk towards the setting sun
I'll prove to them that I am one
enslaved by their hearts so torn
Cause their demands needs more than so

And when I'm weak then I can't run
must prove to them that I'm strong
Considering what I've been through
Another cut another wound

What's the point of touching it
So close you almost taste it
What's the point of reaching for it
when all doors are closing
And I wish I could feel it
that feeling of belonging
Instead I'm sentenced to solitude
and all doors are closing

Through endless nights of anguished sleep
with no one there to hear her screams
She's gone beyond where they can't reach
The bell of freedom sets her free
And when I'm weak then I can't run
must prove to them that I am strong
Can't hide these scars
Can't hide these wounds

What's the point of touching it
So close you almost taste it
What's the point of reaching for it
when all doors are closing
And I wish I could feel it
that feeling of belonging
Instead I'm sentenced to solitude
and all doors are closing

I too have fallen helplessly
Spent a thousand nights sleepless
Had every hope of light shattered before me
Preventing me to reach outside
Stopping me from leaving the blind
Keeping me locked inside
and all I can ask is why

And when I'm weak then I can't run
must prove to them that I'm strong
Considering what I've been through
Another cut another wound

What's the point of touching it
So close you could almost taste it
What's the point of reaching for it
when all you get is more distant from surface
And what's the point to be strong enough
gather strength and rise above
To be brave and see it through
When all you get is more distant from surface
