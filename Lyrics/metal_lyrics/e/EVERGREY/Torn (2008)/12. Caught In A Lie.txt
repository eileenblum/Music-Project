[Bonus track]

Never been so unsure.
Never felt so torn.
In a way, I've been blind.
Should have seen, should have known.
The shallow myths of you.

Can't believe I put my trust in you.
Can't believe I opened up for you.
In a way, I've been blind.
Lost my words, lost my way.
But I was led...

Did you think it would pass unnoticed?
With the hope I'd be caught in your lie.
Was your wish that I'd be the only?

With the nails sinking in through my palms.
And the weight of deceit on my arms.
Gazing out at a sky, that pains me just like fire.
And I know, salvation reached the liars.

Won't confront the reasons behind the failure.
Cause they're trying to make me find the way you are behind the...
Deceiving eyes pretending...

Your not it, you're not him.

Did you think it would pass unnoticed?
With the hope I'd be caught in your lie.
Was your wish that I'd be the only?
Who's worth your sacrifice?

Inside...I'm naked.
Inside... is all a vacant field.
