I have forsaken you
and all I ever felt was true
To take that step and fall to aim beyond these walls
With hope that the stars align
to get a glimpse of my goal defined
I stare the eyes of my biggest fear
Swallow pride I'll persevere

I fear my heart
Fear my soul
I fear I'm weak
I'm fearing you
I fear the cold
That the world is yours
That I drown your shores
I fear I'm wrong that I don't belong
I fear the cold

All nights of fallen grace
All nights where I lost the trace
All I need is that single hour
Where all doubt's erased
If I could I'd crown myself each day
If I could I'd let myself know I'm okay
If I could I'd throw myself into the flames

But I fear my heart
Fear my soul
I fear I'm weak
I'm fearing you
I fear the cold
That the world is yours
That I drown your shores
I fear I'm wrong that I don't belong
I fear the cold

I wish for dreamless sleep
For something that will keep all thought silent
All screams of inner fear makes control impossible
Tears me open

If I could I'd crown myself each day
If I could I'd let myself know I'm okay
If I could I'd throw myself into the flames

But I fear my heart
Fear my soul
I fear I'm weak, I fear I'm wrong
I fear the cold
That the world is yours
That I drown your shores
I fear I'm wrong and I fear the cold
