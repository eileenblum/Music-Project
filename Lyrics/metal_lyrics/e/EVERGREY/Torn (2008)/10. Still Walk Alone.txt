I know you see me
you always did
As you close your eyes
you make me fade
Do you ever wonder if I sleep at night
If I sit in silence
or think you're right

I can not share your feelings
Your feelings of belonging
Never pretend I'm something
even if all doors are closing

Try to shine as much as you can
Don't be a burden and they will understand
I've tried to be just as much as I could
Tried not to scream as loud as maybe I should

I can not share your feelings
Your feelings of belonging
Never pretend I'm something
even if all doors are closing
Won't deny that if I had the strength to
I'd be one of you
Even if the world was different
Even if my heart was made of stone
Even though I know I'm different
I'd still walk alone

I can not share your feelings
Your feelings of belonging
Never pretend I'm something
even if all doors are closing
I can not share your feelings
even if all doors are closing
I still walk alone
even if all doors are closing
