Was your wish that I hadn't seen you
When they came to take you away?
Was your wish that I would believe you
To make you stop and make you stay?
Did you think that I'd never leave you?
That I'd be there from dusk till day?
Did you think that I'd always save you
And carry you on my arms through the falling rain?

And how can you deny me hope and ...
And how we should rise to see you walk the water?
Can you deny my hopes when ...
Cause all you really did was just to make it hurt

Did you think of all the blame that you left me with?
Did you think of all the guilt that I now feel?
I thought that I was as close as someone ever get
I was so wrong to think that I knew you
So now I relive that moment every day
Asking forgiveness for the things that I never got to say
And how will I ever rid the thoughts or even make them fade ...
Away?

How can you deny me hope and ...
And how we should rise to see you walk the water?
Could you forsake all hope to fail?
And all you really ever achieved was to make me fall into the water

[guitar solo]

And how could you give up the chance to make this work again?
And why, cause all you really did was just to make us fall ...
Into the water

Would you not offer me a chance to prove I'm changed?
And how... cause all you really did was just to make us fall ...

[ending guitars]
