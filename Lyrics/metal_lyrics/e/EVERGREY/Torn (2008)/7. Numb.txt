Give me a reason why I'd follow you
One single hour where I become you
Unjust prophecies
Uncalled for enemies
And all those nights of anguished sleep
Where you wish that someone heard
You've become numb to the world
But you're not alone

So have you ever
felt like I feel
Wounded and never
got a chance to heal
And have you ever
been through what I've been through
Still breathing...

So please hear my words
as I'm begging you to heal my wounds,
heal my wounds I'm bleeding through
I never saw it in the eyes of you
and what I felt was always true

Unjust prophecies
Uncalled for enemies
And all those nights of anguished sleep
Where I wish that someone heard
I've become numb to the world
and I've become you

Have you ever
felt like I feel
Wounded and never
got a chance to heal
And have you ever
been through what I've been through
Still breathing, still breathing

Unjust prophecies
Uncalled for enemies
And all those nights of anguished sleep
Where you wish that someone heard
You've become numb to the world
But you're not alone
No you're not alone
So have you ever stood where I stand
My only wish is you'd understand
And have you ever gone through
what I've gone through
Still breathing, still breathing
