I'm walking through fields of the fallen alone in silence
I'm praising their courage I envy their loss
My steps leaves marks of another forsaken soul
My choices might haunt me forever
Until I'm gone

With so much lost in anger
Too much built-up fear and all these thoughts colliding
Making my wounds seem fatal
Pushing my head under water
Making me tired and torn
If only things were different, only things were different

My soul and my inside's been coloured
and there is no silence
Not distant from courage I'm wearing the loss
My eyes sees the dawn of another horizon
My battle it rages forever

With so much lost in anger
Too much built-up fear and all these thoughts colliding
Making my wounds seem fatal
Pushing my head under water
Making me tired and torn
If only things were different
If only things were brought to me in a different shade
Shown to me so that I could relate
Lock all doors that would make me stray
and offer me a brand new day
Never claimed to be someone I'm not
and always feared to be forgotten
So led astray that I lost all worth
So torn by wounds in a world of hurt

With so much lost in anger
Too much built-up fear and all these thoughts colliding
Making my wounds seem fatal
Pushing my head under water
Making me tired and torn
If only things were different if only things were
If only things were different if only things were ...
