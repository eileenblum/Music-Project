Was it just a phase
Was it all a lie
Your first mistake
Have I been blind
When words mean nothing
lack value and weight
All we have is nothing
what does nothing weigh

Lost my will to see it clear
Lost my sense of clarity
I'm standing in ruins and watch us fade
All just because of a lie

I told you in confidence
and trusted you'd never sacrifice our silence
I rise from the ashes and remains of your broken promises

Don't know if you ever were
Don't know if you ever will
be someone I could trust
there's too much doubt to kill
So was it just a phase
was it all a lie
My first mistake
but last being blind

I told you in confidence
and trusted you'd never sacrifice our silence
I rise from the ashes and remains of your broken promises
Cause I would never betray my trust and words no never
I rise from the ashes and remains of your broken promises

Lost my will to see it clear
Lost my sense of clarity
I'm standing in ruins and watch us fade
All just because of a lie

I told you in confidence
and trusted you'd never sacrifice our silence
I rise from the ashes and remains of your broken promises
