[Lyrics: Evergrey]

[my faith in you has always been there]
[I thought my trust in you would always last]
[but since you've deceived me]
[now that has to change]
[I'm on a mission built on vengeance]
[and I'll never forget the past]

Here I stand
I see your name carved in stone
I can almost hear your laughter
But yesterday's gone
This loneliness so cold
this emptiness so cruel
God has forsaken me
And my faith too

God you were my Judas
Your deception killed my belief
God you were my Judas
Your deception...

Your nails hammered in
You made me wear your crown of thorns
With your hands by the hammer
You made me take the fall
Where are your angels now
When darkness all I see
What are your blessings worth
When all left is A Scattered Me

God you were my Judas
your deception killed my belief
God you were my Judas
your deception

[solo.Englund]
[solo.Bronell]

God you were my Judas
your deception killed my belief
God you were my Judas
your deception
