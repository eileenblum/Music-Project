[Lyrics: Englund]

All is gone
And my soul screams sorrow
All is lost
As I shiver for tomorrow
Tomorrow

I want to see this sorrow end
I want to feel joy again
The demons inside are here to stay
And life as know it fades away

Will the wounds in me never heal
The scares you left always be
Dare you turn behold the hurt you've done
All I wish for you is Damnation

I want to see this sorrow end
I want to feel joy again
The demons inside are here to stay
And life as know it fades away

[solo.Bronell]

I want to see this sorrow end
I want to feel joy again
The demons inside are here to stay
And life as know it fades away

Fades away...
