[Lyrics: Englund]

Cold is the air that I breath
sleepless
but I don't mind the rain
With fear I strive
but still enjoying the pain
I'm awaiting the dawn
as I welcome the end

If you ever felt the way that I feel
helpless
and help is all you need
In tears you try
but there is no way
no way you can win
Solitude Within

Cold
but I don't mind the rain
Fear of...

My heart is pounding
never so frightened
My body's trembling
I'm dying
Dying

Cold
but I don't mind the rain
Fear of
Being alone again

All I ever wished for
was a vengeance on solitude
And all I ever longed for...
The presence of you

Cold
but I don't mind the rain
Fear of
being alone again
Cold
but I don't mind the rain
fear of
Solitude Within
