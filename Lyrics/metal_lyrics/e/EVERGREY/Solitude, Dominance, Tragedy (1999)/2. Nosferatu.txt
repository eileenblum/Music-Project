[Lyrics: Englund]
[Solo: Englund]

Where ever you'll go I'll be
Where ever you'll be I'll find you
I am despair
I am the cries of the abandoned child
The pain of the battered beast
The screams of the soul you keep
I am
Nosferatu

I appear as mist and I come as fog
I fall as rain and I rise like dawn
Dawn
I plant dark seeds to harvest...
to harvest the souls
To harvest the souls

Call of your angels or I'll make them stay
My fate is written and I'll make you fall from grace
You must leave your breathing life
Only to be reborn in mine

All the stories you've heard are true
The tales of my darkness too
I am the myth
I am the legend but your father too
I grant you my kingdom son
Don't you long to be what I've become
I invite you in
To live this life of immortal sin

Your birth has made you the chosen one
Your innocence so perfect for a darkened son
You'll live a life where death means no harm
You'll feed on others seduced by your deadly charm

Call of your angels or I'll make them stay
My fate is written and I'll make you fall from grace
You must leave your breathing life
Only to be reborn in mine
