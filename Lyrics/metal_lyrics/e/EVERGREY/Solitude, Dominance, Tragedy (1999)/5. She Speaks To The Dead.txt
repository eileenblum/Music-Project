[Lyrics: Evergrey]

[father I've seen her through the window]
[she's been summoning spirits]
[she's brought a curse on us all]
[and for that she has to be punished]
[and I got these voices in my head]
[telling me I got to stop her]
[cause she speaks to the dead]

Darkness casts upon us all
Gone is the light that used to fall
Darkness casts upon us all
Dead is life buried since old

Sorrow voices
I'm being embraced by the dark black hole

[solo.Englund]

Watched you your blasphemy
Your filthy soul must be cleansed by me
I'm your salvation
I'm your christ
But instead of me you'll be crucified

Father
She speaks to the dead
And I'll crave her confession
Cause she speaks to the dead

[solo.Bronell]

There she is
Lighting the candles
I'm watching her again
Becoming at one with the shadows
She must be punished
And I am the one
To exorcise the demons
Make sure it's done

Father
She speaks to the dead
And I'll crave her confession
Cause she speaks to the dead

[solo.Englund]
