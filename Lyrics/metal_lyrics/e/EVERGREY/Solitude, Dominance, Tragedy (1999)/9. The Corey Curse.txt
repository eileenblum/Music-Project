[Lyrics: Englund]
[Solo: Englund]

Can you feel the cold
The chill around your neck
Dare I touch your skin
And wake you up again
In the light of the moon
I begin to sow the seeds
My seduction
My dominance
Your tragedy

I can taste your fear
And I can seal your fate
With your death as my altar
And your soul as my aim
You can't rid the pain
Your weakness feeds me strength
Cause I've been born again
In malevolence

To eternity
Of guilt and remorse
To the vengeance of a tragic
A tragic soul

The Corey curse

Brick after brick
The weight of the stones
all for a confession that I my soul have sold
You've come to cleanse our Salem
Your work of God not much worth with me
My silence will kill me
But I'll haunt you for infinity

[solo.Englund]

To eternity
Of guilt and remorse
To the vengeance of a tragic
A tragic soul

The Corey curse
