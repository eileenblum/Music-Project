[Lyrics: Evergrey]

[I have now made her repent her sins]
[she confessed to me she came to reason]
[she now knows the consequences of her deeds]
[I showed her the way and she struggled but followed]
[I feel grateful every time when the voices calls]
[and I gladly surrender When Darkness Falls]

Several hours past now
My hands still trembling
From that rush so divine
I need my medicine
Look at your eyes they seem so cold
As if there's nothing there
Wash your bloodstains of my shirt
Oh lord I've done it again
I've done it again

Enter moonlight
I come from demonseed
When darkness falls
Cursing your blasphemy
When darkness falls

No remorse what so ever
That is how sick I am
It all falls into oblivion
I have forgotten you
All alone and I'm craving for more
as the darkness falls in me
Only the shadows brings me comfort
There is no stopping me
There is no stopping me

Enter moonlight
I come from demonseed
When darkness falls
Cursing your blasphemy
When darkness falls

[solo.Englund]

No remorse what so ever
That is how sick I am
It all falls into oblivion
I have forgotten you
All alone and I'm craving for more
as the darkness falls in me
Only the shadows brings me comfort
There is no stopping me
There is no stopping me
