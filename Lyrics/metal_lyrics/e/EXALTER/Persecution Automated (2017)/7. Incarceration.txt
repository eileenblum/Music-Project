When power defies all its boundaries
Freedom strangled, dissent inactive
Distorted conscience drowned in quandaries
Zombies walk free, minds held captive

Greed, poison in the sphere
Demonic forces rise
Proclaims state of dread
Satan in disguise

Panic, terror, blindfolds, night raids
Death's worshipped, destruction's cheered
Vacuous platitudes gather accolades
The just is reviled, unjust revered

Greed, poison in the sphere
Demonic forces rise
Proclaims state of dread
Satan in disguise
