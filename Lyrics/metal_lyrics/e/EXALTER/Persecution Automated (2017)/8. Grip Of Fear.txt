When they extinguish hope
When they paralyze you with fear
When they hold your life hostage
When your pleading invokes jeer

They carry on relentless
And you cling onto false hope
Until you can't hide any longer
No longer you can cope

Torturing
Murdering
Killing Is
Going On

Kill with impunity, advocate cruelty, right to life revoked
Imprisonment without trial, the hunted go underground, compassion mocked
Fabricated reality put in place and the blinded mob obey demagogue

They carry on relentless
And you cling onto false hope
Until you can't hide any longer
No longer you can cope

As they break down your door
You can't stop their march
Inside your domicile
You can't stop the search

The crushing force dominates, your life ends here
Your loved ones crumble in panic and fear
As you're degraded and dragged down by force
A sick society looks away and quietly endorse
