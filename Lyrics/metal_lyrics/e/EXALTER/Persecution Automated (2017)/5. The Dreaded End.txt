The ghastly noise rattles me, I wait for it to stop
The silence is sickly and it shakes me up too
I know that I exist, I can tell by my heartbeats
What is ahead no one knows; this is the dreaded end

Death

Globalised world order
Casting its darkest spell
Capitalistic utopia
Dragging me to hell

Citizenry abolished
Surveillance through and through
Presumption of guilt
This world under curfew

Trembling ground
Keeps me wide awake
Life is lost somewhere here
I feel its hapless twitching
