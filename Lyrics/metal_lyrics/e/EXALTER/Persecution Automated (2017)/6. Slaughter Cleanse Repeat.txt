Horror descended upon them
From the depths of human sickness
Terror visited them
Satan bears witness

Bodies of sub-humans piled
Stench carried by fumes
"God! They burned my child!"
Tribalism consumes

Mankind;
Jingoism rules.
Mankind,
Self-exalted fools

Digital hallucination
Conveniently lit
Hiding from our eyes
Slaughter, cleanse, repeat
