Pictures of children stare at the sky
Collateral damage was their name
Machines donât understand truth or lie
Explosions carry out the empire game

Cluster munitions hide
Participatory screams
People give consent in
Disintegrated limbs

Clandestine drone warfare

From both ends of the lifeless fiends
Tormented souls meet in the sky
Their demons will haunt them to the end
Like the unmanned devil they fly

How easy it is to press on a button
And turn people into stats
Silent images fill their vision
Human beings fleeing like rats

Clandestine drone warfare
