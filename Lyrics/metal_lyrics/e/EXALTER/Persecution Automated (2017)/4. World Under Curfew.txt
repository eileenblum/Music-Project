A world under curfew
Is where we're headed now
We've been handed what we earned
For we've failed revolt somehow
Conformity is now our minimum wage
Freedom of movement was granted within our cage

Relief is for the dead
The living must keep fighting,
Against the death parade
Of power, we keep inciting

In the bloodied streets
Stains of their plight
In the silent seas
Humanity capsized

Relief is for the dead
The living must keep fighting,
Against the death parade
Of power, we keep inciting
