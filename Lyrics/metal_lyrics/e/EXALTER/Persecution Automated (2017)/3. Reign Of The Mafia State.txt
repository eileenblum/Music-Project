Life, children, home, freedom
Confiscated by a covert decree
Time has vanished, clocks don't tick
In the terror republic

No wind flows from this place
Stifled cries go unheard
As the sick lords raise savage cheer
All the non-persons disappear

Listen the hyenas cackle, carnivores rule this world
Host gets overtaken, parasites unfurled
