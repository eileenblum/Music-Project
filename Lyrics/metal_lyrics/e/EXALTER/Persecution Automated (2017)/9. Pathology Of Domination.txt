Pretension will halt
If the slaves revolt
The ugly rage of death
Bloody the asphalt

Assembly line slaughter
Hypocrites remember
History gets repeated
The Earth its new gas chamber

Hair trigger alert; stacking the stockpiles
Monkeying with existence few gluttonous imbeciles

Mother Earth
Capitalized
(Her) offspring
Cannibalized

Assembly line slaughter
Hypocrites remember
History gets repeated
The Earth its new gas chamber

Hair trigger alert; stacking the stockpiles
Monkeying with existence few gluttonous imbeciles

Defy, force that enslaves you
Intoxicates you
Decimates you
Until nothing's left

Resist force of death
Persist to contend,
Sanctity of life
Defend till the end

Hair trigger alert; stacking the stockpiles
Monkeying with existence few gluttonous imbeciles
