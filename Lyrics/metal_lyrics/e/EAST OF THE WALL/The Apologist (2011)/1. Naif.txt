As naive as Iâve always been, I lose my way amongst the din and I give in. The will to try will fade away. I give my life in vain today. I give in. Watch the spine collapse at the first sign of pause. As savages come rushing in they find no flesh worth digging in and I give in. A carrion call for all to see, they gnash their teeth in ecstasy. I give in. Watch the mind collapse, and the body crumble.

Tarp the walls for blood, keep your edge clean. Weâve caught the scent of hunts- now we kill. Theyâve pranced in sweetly, and theyâve suckling hide. Now what eager weaklings have stepped, unawares, blindsided?
