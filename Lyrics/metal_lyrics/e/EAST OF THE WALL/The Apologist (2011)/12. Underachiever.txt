One might still sway on one road, a straight course. So what wreck unfolds a jagged knotted pile?

I donât even know the way. Was the exit sign just a photograph of mine? When we marked the lines, were we all just drunk?

One might creak and shudder away. Just pave the blood to the road.

Thereâs no blame without records. No malice, no blame if thereâs no past.

No malice, no blame, with no past and no memoriesâ weight. No malice, no blame, with no past and no name. No words, no deeds. Just smoke to cloud and dissolve.
