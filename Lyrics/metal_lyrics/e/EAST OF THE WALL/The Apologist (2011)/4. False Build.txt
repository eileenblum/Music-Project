The wandering stranger assaults you with guilt, not with guile.

The spoken word, spurious. It likely wouldnât push one to sway. With doubtful experience, it plotted us a path that wound back again.

The halls are cavernous and twist the sound as bait. Quickly drawn away, open jaw. Dig the hook inside while we bray.

Now the hornsâ blows have carried away and weâre remorseful for the call. When the very life of you is swept away and reverent then what worth have you? The air we breathe is the air weâll be bellowing. How loud claps the storm? What fury will we swallow away?
