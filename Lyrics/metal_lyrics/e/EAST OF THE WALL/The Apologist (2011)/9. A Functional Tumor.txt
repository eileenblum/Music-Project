The visage crumbled, but ignore the wreckage. Itâs worth was loaned.

As with mange brought by the flea, as with stares brought by the gangly, weâre all marked by the path of our births. As with mange brought by the flea, like the call of the unclean, weâve been pulled, and the only direction is down.

The reek of our kin betrays the stain weâve hid.

Iâm the hold. Iâm a mark, a lock. I wouldnât have lost my breath for lack of a cause. Good god, I couldnât break free in time from the grasps of stragglers. Grounded and shamed, dragged kicking back through the dirt. Weâre all marked. Always.
