Thereâs more than wind through here. Itâs all mid-stream. Maybe once Iâd kept abreast of movement until my nerves ached and dilated in the strain. So now Iâve earned my salt.

Drink another drink that heavy roots wonât hold. Creak, only to branch again, but scorn the take. This blighted a yolk only turns. Stay hidden beneath the earth. In turn, Iâve plowed my salt. Iâve earned my salt.
