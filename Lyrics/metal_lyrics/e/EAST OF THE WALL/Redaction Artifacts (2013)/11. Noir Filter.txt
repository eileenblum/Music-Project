Thereâs a clock that you covet. Whoâs counting up all the days stored? Letâs hope youâve earned a score that goes up and up. Look alive; hide your shudder. Was it you that would recall today? So look above like theyâre upset youâre not on the up and up.

Tip-toe in. Bash it all up, nonplussed by the noise. âIâm just out, with a case of the shakes. Donât mean it. Iâm sorry.â

Venture forth. Itâs blocked. Find a way. Venture forth. Itâs blocked, chained. Back and forth, the light dies away. Left the scene unchanged. Only footprints left behind.

Thereâs no culprits, no one to aim the barrel down and squeeze. So take a shot. Maybe someone near wears guilt, perchance.

An act worth what it seems. A line queued to take it on. They trusted what was imbued. We take a lot on faith here. Too few, their names obscure. It seems they might be anyone.

Hereâs more souls. They know me in truth. Iâm cut from the mold. Now itâs just us who gave up on youth to be something old. Itâs enough to be this fruitless if Iâm extolled. Iâm aching for meaning as the aches have grown. Who will emboss where weâve been to, or tend to the moss where weâve stepped? Thereâs a film weâve made thatâs overlong. And when we expire, wait for their cut.

Hereâs all souls. Weâre taken in truth, in debt through the goal. Itâs enough to be less than the ghosts who all shunned the flesh and the bone. Itâs about to end anyway. Though you may have had more to show, itâs ending. Itâs enough to be almost done, perpetually.

See the crowds of no one in line. You were lied to. Thereâs nihil to reach for in time, or any way else you tried. You wonât control this light once it leaves you. Its life and yours must divide or any worth it loaned is slight.

Thereâs nihil to reach for in time, but every time you reach feels right.

Now Iâm through, and possibly I didnât offer up enough. I have a pulse for coffers in the end times. Why not? Time is up.
