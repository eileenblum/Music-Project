If the first light left me seen, then by the first strike Iâve been struck. God help me. Iâd stumbled upon the crowd, at first, in jest. But I remained, if only out cold.

I once told you my scars burn like hot iron. Iâve endured the dayâs tolls, and held my back to ills. But if Iâm to bear this load, then let me craft of it the hand that grips my throat.

If I put in all my fears, then at least whatâs stored is kept, albeit locked in this room.

Grab hold, and you wonât let it go. I might choke out a phrase thatâs honed with bile. Safe journey on you. Youâll run in a maze cut from my lines. A strong word rings out like a shot. I knew its aim would hit the mark.

This golem Iâve made wants me dead. Itâs been programmed blow for blow. Surpriseâyou bought it. Hell, I did.

I need one shape. I need one place for aim: one rock and chisel, hewn into place, and resting atop the thinnest strawman stand.

It seems weâre going anywhere but where I win, or anywhere at all.

Grab hold, and I wonât let it go. Iâve called out a name thatâs robed in time. Safe journey on you. Youâll run in a maze thatâs all mine. Safe journey onward. Iâll call on the walls down around us both.

A hidden ghost forms, and cleaves right through me; drawn as familiar, drawn to my call.
