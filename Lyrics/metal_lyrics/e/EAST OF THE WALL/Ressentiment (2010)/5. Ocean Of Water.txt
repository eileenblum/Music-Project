This horizon ties your hands. Pray for mercy as you sink below.

Through the thunder, until the rain falls, weâre alone.

Look at the way she stares. You want to make her suffer. Bury your face in sand. Keep it smothered. Hurry, avert your eyes and hold them still. Dig deep your lines. Stop your breathing.

No words, only sound. Slow steps. Heed no one. No heat, only shrouds.

The elders sway. The cowards fall. They couldnât find a way. No hope or fear of floating. No one for you to know. They couldnât find a way.

Through the thunder, until the rain falls, weâre alone. Through the sandstorm, until the soil floods weâre as bone. Iâm an island. I built my wallâs stone too tall. Wait upon your shore. Maybe there sails an escape for you.

So you race to the end, and then you hurtle towards another one. So you pray for the wind. Then you race to the end. Iâm through counting.
