This crowd: a fleshy lake. The throngs as smallish waves, folds like skin upon the sow. A faint din as spit and speech caw- the rank broth that stews while boiled alive.

âWho are you to cast your net so wide, and deepen the maw? Cannibal, your hooks blood deep in hide. This too shall pass. Youâll find yourself at last.â

Couldnât anyone else have tried to carve their hold? The mark of hands. Couldnât anyone else have climbed the bones of old? The bridge of man, its steps cobbled stones from sand. One way mirror, cracked and leering, watch us crawl.

A coarse ascension, a vulgar dream dragged kicking back to the floods. A crass intrusion: the eyesore tower was crashed by swarmsâ¦ a herd of cackles, a school of flesh that scorns the touch.

âThe only face that scorns this fate is ours: self same, ripe to faint. Once down, the stench, the taint. So raise the eyesore tower. Weâll raze the rows we felled. When stayed the hand of storms, down poured the fruit of arms.â
