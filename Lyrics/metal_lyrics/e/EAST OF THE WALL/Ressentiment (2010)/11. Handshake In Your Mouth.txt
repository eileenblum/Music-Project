The distant mock of warmth: an aftertaste of the bodiesâ greeting collision. Youâll never feel that again.

I thought I saw a rising tide dissolving the streets, and leaving blank shores. I strained to hear the distant waves encroaching, eroding wood and home.

I canât recall the sound of footsteps, the scent of skin. It washed away with the taste of ashes. I grind my teeth but itâs gone.

As we walk, weâll pass through the last of night, sick with dust and smiles. The mock of warmth: youâll never feel that again.
