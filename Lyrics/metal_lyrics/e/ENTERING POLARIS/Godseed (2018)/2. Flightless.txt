Welcome to a gray day on the sunless side of me
A place where I never learned to fly
Waiting for sullen clouds to clear
For you to swoop down out of the sky

A lifetime I'd give to live one more day
In wait for a wider way to walk
To somewhere a sky-born just may
To a wingless soul belong

Hold on
How do I begin to tell you of where I've been?
Ghosts I gathered, the sable shores I have seen
Here we'll remain, locked in flight, my sweet Selene
O'er the fields of gold
