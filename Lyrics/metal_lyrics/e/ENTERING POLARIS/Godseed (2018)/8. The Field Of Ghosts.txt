The Vehement Summer:
We robbed the sand of time by glint of smiling moonlight
That sunk us in its cheery cellar and buried us in turn
Where churn the wicked and wild; the steady, fast and slight
By brightly burning chestnut eyes that sightless 'I's do spurn

The Frugal Autumn:
We crawl through dungeons dark and dreadful
In quest for seas of dull desire
The ocean forgiving of our long remembered vice

The Vehement Summer:
Caught climbing the ramparts of heavens denied
Parapets of songs we wore and woes we sang

The Frugal Autumn:
The gust of time but blew us yonder
How sweet still the Amontillado's taste
When walled in by the pressing ages

And for fabled forgiveness, look you to the sky
To pantheons past, lost to wind and war
On our way to golden fields, to castles in white
We must've strayed, can't find the way anymore
Locked outside the door

We grow old before our time
For Time's impatient of our folly
And hearts beat only briefly
Through blunt and bloodied rhymes

The Vehement Summer:
Regal are not merely crowned brows
As happy pawns 'fore kings unthroned may stand unbowed and proud

And we shall suffer the smallest share
The shortest thread that Clotho spun
Engines failing in the sun

And we tread the field of ghosts
Abandoned long before our time
By webbed foot or sandal
Or cloven hoofs of beasts of war

The Frugal Autumn:
We may weather the winter, or it may weather us
'Til the bulwarks burst and we're shut in by the sea
Day to day we pit ourselves 'gainst the hum-drum of the day
As the hours are wrest from our hands
Too soon the end impends

The gust of time but blew us yonder
How sweet still the Amontillado's taste
When walled in by depressing ages?

The Vehement Summer:
And we are always "almost there"
Idle the words we play upon
Angels flying in the sun

And we tread the field of ghosts
Abandoned long before our time
By banner man and squire
And muddy tracks of engines stalled

The Frugal Autumn:
For as nesting birds in snowy white
In whiteout winds that sap their sight
Running mares on amber planes
Or cautious hares that dread the chase
Cow'ring low before the gun
We scamper heedless into the long run
