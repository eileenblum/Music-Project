[Narrator:]
And so we begin with another tragedienne's tale
In Rome's pleasant land
Where summer saw the rains
And her flowers green wilted in the gale

[Persephone:]
And I'm a world away

[Hermes:]
For you failed to wake, my love

[Persephone:]
And I was led astray

[Hermes:]
Whoever said that this life could last?

[Persephone:]
And I am so afraid

[Hermes:]
But this could've been our heaven

[Persephone:]
And darkness took the day

[Hermes:]
And so I seek out the Stygian shore
Charon my trusted friend of old
The great collector of passages paid
Then I land where Cerberus stands, open the way with sleight of hand
This patron of thieves has some tricks up his sleeve
Tartaros awaits!

[Hermes:]
I returned from the war in Heaven, but took some Hell with me
'Til I am ashes I'll writhe in the cross of a rose's thorns
The penalty divine for he who desired you

[Persephone:]
I pray, and call out your name along night's Plutonian coast in the cold
Won't someone hear me plea for my life 'fore my hope doth grow old

[Hermes:]
I returned from the war in Heaven, but took some Hell with me
Are we running out of time?
I reel on the razor's edge, and have done all my days
Seems it's the way things must be

[Persephone:]
Sweetly I recall when you and I were one, and all the world was Spring
Now you're a world away, and time cannot allay
And frost all things reigns

[Hermes:]
And you're a world away

[Persephone:]
For all ways must part, my dear

[Hermes:]
It shouldn't be this way

[Persephone:]
Whoever said that this love could last?

[Hermes:]
I'll carry you away

[Persephone:]
Yea, this should be our heaven

[Hermes:]
We'll fly unto the day

[Hades:]
And the flames will rise
Out of the depth of my scorching soul
Unto the sky

[Hermes:]
One step in the sunlight, one leap in the dark
You're worth all the ache I bear
One step in the sunlight, a leap out of the dark
On winged soles we fly

[Hermes:]
We returned from the war in Heaven, but took some Hell with us
Yet from our ashes we rise
I'd walk from the mortal land to somewhere far beyond
In quest for merely your smile
We're all on our way to Heaven, from lives contrived and short
For we all run out of time
And we fly along to the distant end of how far it may bear us
'Neath only bluest of skies
