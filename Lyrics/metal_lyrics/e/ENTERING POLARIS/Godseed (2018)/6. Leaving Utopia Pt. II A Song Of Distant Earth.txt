[Thalassa, A.D. 3865]

Far away from old, earthly shores
We're migrant souls without a home
Kind hearts caught in the cold
Vagrants in the vastness of the void

Rowing out from shore, I wish that I could linger
The sea knows but forgives my sins

And I know beyond recall
My days will see me ache for somewhere I once soared
In a different sky

Tarna's sand is warm between my toes
As perfect days are drawing to their close
If I have to sleep, I don't want to wake
For I know now even the sky has an end

And I don't want to wait, for centuries or longer
Waiting for my life to begin

And I'm wondering what for
I am to remember somewhere I lived more, to the end of my days
At times it's more than I can bear
This weary, star-crossed voyager with nothing more to share
Than I did with you

[Sagan 2, A.D. 4135]

And I so longed for somewhere I could be free
A home where I could hear the music of the spheres
And I waited for someone I could believe
And found her in a place I had to leave

And I'm wondering what for
I had to journey onward, when paradise was warm beneath my tread
And I'll live forevermore, dying to remember somewhere I lived more
On the other side of the sky

And now I trudge a foreign shore, trying to move forward
For better or for worse, and the future of our kind
