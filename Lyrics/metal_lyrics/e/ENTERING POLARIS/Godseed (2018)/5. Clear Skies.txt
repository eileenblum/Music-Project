Dawn's breaking
Engines are failing
Too far in
Into Sol we're reeling

Someone show me the way out of here
Don't wait, don't run, just fly

Say you will shade me from summers too sheer, too bright
Yea, so it all began
In clear skies

And we flew with the wind
And let us be carried away from somewhere I could never live
The irony of Icarus, of iron shields in diamond days
A platitude of watchers in the wings

Stay what we learn today, lest we are mislaid; displaced
And so our plight began
In clear skies

Say that you'll shade me from summers too sheer and much too bright
Some day, in merry months of May, there we may meet again
In clear skies
