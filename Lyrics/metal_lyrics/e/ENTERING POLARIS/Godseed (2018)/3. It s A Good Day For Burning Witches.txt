So our lives are rent by the fire in the sky
By the treason of the Nine
Swept wayward as the world turns to ashes again
A funeral pyre

I'll take no less than to what the gods might aspire
In these seasons of plague
Our ships lie burning in the bay and an armada's on its way
As flames rise higher

Flying from the villages, driven and all but insane
Is it all of them or just me?

We bow to the fire within
All thoughts inside my head find their way to extremes

Run as you may from a fiery fate and into a watery grave
Wrench the wheels of the watch as you will
Turn they do only one way

We bow to the fire within
Existence on a whim we redeem
Carpe Diem

We grow to the tune of Dis
All the ails inside my head fly away and leave me be
Today's a good day
