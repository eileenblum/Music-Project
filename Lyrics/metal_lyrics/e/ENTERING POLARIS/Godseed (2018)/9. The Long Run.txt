[Part 1: Soldiers and Vagabonds]

And when we return from heaven's grey
Valiant or victorious, triumphant and tired
Warriors wary of a gathering storm

What of the roads not taken
Did they lead us away from harm?
May we remain unshaken through futile fury or a peddler's charm?

Here we are â soldiers and vagabonds, on quests for empathy
And we move in awkward symmetries
Where we are beggars and bon vivants
Youthful eyes may see
The good in you and me

[Part 2: Heroes and Siren Songs]

Drunk on the wine of tribulation
Of tiring flights in olden fancy
From henchmen hidden in ticking thickets, time's retort

And so we look to the future
Filled with sound and feral rage
Ecstasies of ancient afterlives in the thick of time

Here we are â soldiers and vagabonds, in quest for great glory
And we move in old mythologies
Where we are heroes and siren songs
It leaves me mesmerized
Olympus is our prize

[Part 3: Miasma and Mirage]

Remember the way we were
In olden gusts of time; we'd all the world to see
As I recall the way it used to be
The fire unrefrained; now old souls in twain

[Part 4: The Fire Unrefrained]

[Instrumental]

[Part 5: Dust and Bone]

Buried in a land unknown
It's a fate that awaits us all, my friend
Was all that came to pass really worth the time?

We sing
No one may know why
We sing
Ere we're cold as a stone

No way out, you're along for the ride
Do all good things come to an end for reasons we don't know?
Time remains a mystery
And leaves us all alone in the end
For in the long run, all we're left are dust and bone

So we sing
No one may know why
We sing
Ere we're cold as a stone

We sing
Our lives are but loaned
But we sing
From our thrones we're thrown

[Part 6: Echoes and Elegies]

And so we return from heaven's grey
Vile and vilified, torrid and tragic
The warrior weary from the weight of war

Remember the way you were
Wondrous as a child
A grace in you that died

Here we are â soldiers and vagabonds, in search of sympathy
And we're left but frightful effigies
Here we are â echoes and elegies
Miasma and mirage
A tired, old adage

[Part 7: Reprise and Epilogue]

We returned from heaven's grey
Terrified and tired
Lost in the midst of time, the raging surf that swept us away

Here we are â vagrants and vagabonds
And we are left alone to gather what remains of our thoughts
Here we are â time's reluctant detainees
Down on our knees
Begging help me, please

'Cause we're in it for the long run
And there's no backing down
No batting down the hatches
No unending renown
