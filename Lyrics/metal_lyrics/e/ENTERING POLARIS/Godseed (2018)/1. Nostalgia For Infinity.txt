[Part 1: Entering Polaris]

[Instrumental]

[Part 2: Melancholy Sky â A Rain of Centuries]

Gentle reminders of walking on air
Wisps in a wistful age
Talking about senses, it's high time we shared
The infinities on our minds

Nigh, all things I dread
The reapers arrive

I've to realize I live beyond my years
Burrowing through borrowed time
Mine's a greater guise, a melding of memories
Shrieking through the exosphere of worlds aware their end is here
'Neath tortured stars

And as we rise again, I dub thee Resurgam
It's where we commence
No I won't delay, the future starts today
None shall inhibit my flight
The yonder awaits

I will remember the empathy we shared
Bogged down in breathless earth
Talking about senses, how acute are yours
Through the eager accretion of years?

I am sown back to life
In the fire of spheres

Time to realize I'm too far from home
And missing all that made me whole
Drawn to energies only the star-crossed know
The vibrancy of vacuum states; vastnesses where wonder waits
In vaults of sky

[Part 3: 'Neath Tortured Stars]
