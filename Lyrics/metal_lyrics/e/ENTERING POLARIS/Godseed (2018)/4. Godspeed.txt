We play hide-and-seek in helium fields
And speak without a sound
The Grand Cycle of all things our merry-go-round
Ours is a playground unbound

We slingshot around the Milky Way
On our way to Andromeda or some place further away
It's but a question of time

Godspeed to you in everything you do
And safe returns again
Godspeed to you wherever you may go
And hold your heading true

So we set our dials to Godspeed
And watch the world grow old
As we converse with the quasars
The speed of light a laughing matter
And matter but a question of light and speed

Godspeed to you in everything you do
And safe returns again
Godspeed to you wherever you may walk
I know we'll pull through

Now I'm not afraid to deal with these feelings
'Cause I'd rather go today than I would tomorrow
Even in the dusk of day there still shines a sliver
Of the silver line that lighted my yesterdays

Step right up, to see the world spin on my fingertips! Yeah!

Godspeed to you in everything you do
And safe returns again
Godspeed to you wherever you may go
And hold your heading
