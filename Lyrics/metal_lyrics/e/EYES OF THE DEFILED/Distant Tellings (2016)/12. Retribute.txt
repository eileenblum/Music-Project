Fall from your graces, down to your knees and beg for your valueless existence.
Be prepared to wipe all the tears from your eyes with the cloth aflame!
I won't be afraid to lose my life and join the departed ranks!
The highest honor is to die by my own salvation.
Everything you know has been incinerated only to be given back to you ten-thousand times.
Though I am full of sin, full of pain and full of hell, I know I'm not alone.
I don't know what your Savior sees in me, but I won't stop until He becomes all I see.
I won't be afraid to lose my life.
Feel the space collapse upon your altar, sacrosanct in its holy ending.
Fall from your graces, down to your knees and beg for your valueless existence.
Be prepared to wipe all the tears from your eyes with the cloth aflame!
Everything you know has been incinerated only to be given back to you ten-thousand times.
