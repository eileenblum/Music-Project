A retribution.
The wretch has now taken a turn for the worst.
Paradise for every father in this wasted cesspool of rage.
Judgment upon us and all we know.
We cannot live here much longer now.
We have wrought these lives to the core.
We have forsaken His creation.
We knew this day would come.
An ancient urgent message through the eons, but we went and we hid it away with the boring and the day-to-day.
Enjoying a pathetic existence with the one you call father, yet he knows all by names and covers everything.
Tear us asunder.
There is a life besides the one who caused this.
Stand for yourself and become a child of the one that you call Father.
A dictate issued by the (Father) highest throne (Father) to pass His judgment down and (Father) tear us apart and deliver us!
This has become a nightmare.
Though I am full of sin, full of sin, and full of hell, I know that I am not alone!
