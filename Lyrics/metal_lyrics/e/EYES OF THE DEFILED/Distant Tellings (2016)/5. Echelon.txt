Run from the wrath!
We brought this hell upon ourselves.
The light engulfs this world and scorches all we know.
Gravity pulls us, we're slaves to unseen forces.
We're set for a collision course.
My body transcends itself, and watches its own ruin.
Never part of the protocol. Torn apart, combusted release.
Arrogance of the human disease.
How does this planet survive so close to the sun?
Christ...Judgment's upon us.
Burst asunder landscapes and bring upon your wrath.
Exterminate this species with the hand of boiling rage.
Smash this world into pieces and devour every fragment of it.
Taint this life with envy and let our souls fly.
The mass effect of a living process is inadequate for all movement now.
Exalt my imagination and color this place with accomplishment.
Divine fulfillment.
