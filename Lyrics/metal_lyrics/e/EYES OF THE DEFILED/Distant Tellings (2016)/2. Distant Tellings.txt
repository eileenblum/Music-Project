2064, we venture far out into the abyss.
Our only angel's this vessel,
Our gods created by ourselves.
Solipsistic vigils will guide our course.
All other powers seem superfluous.
The ancient stories, they hold no meaning...
Their spark was silenced long ago.
As we near the parent star,
A barren hellscape lies before us.
No god created this world.
Contact! A sign of life.
Contact! Defying the odds.
