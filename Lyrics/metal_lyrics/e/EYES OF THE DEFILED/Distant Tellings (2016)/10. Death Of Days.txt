Kneel yourself before the death of days.
Mass extermination!
Our violent world begins to boil over.
This is retribution.
All of our senses fully numb so we can suffer in our sorrow.
Life has left us, these eyes are dead.
The light of the world has become a god of horror.
It's in the crosshairs that I set myself apart to live another day.
I know the difference in the path I take.
You worship creation and enslave your Creator into images of your own design.
I saw the light leave your eyes, and escape my reach.
This empire shall fall.
You've got this construct of human perception that has been falsified.
It is a web of lies!
A world without light lives in fear of the dark.
