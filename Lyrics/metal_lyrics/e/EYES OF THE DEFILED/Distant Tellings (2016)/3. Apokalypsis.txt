Extermination of them all!
Let's take away the sings of the fathers and abolish the hate of their sons.
Now no one can be there to witness this unholy gore-ification.
All these lies lay open for all to see.
All these lives lay scattered from sea to sky.
The scorching flames complete this cleanse of heresy.
Light pierces eyes, and blinds them to this culling.
All these lies lay open for all to see.
All these lives lay scattered from sky to sea.
Ascension will solve this, glorifying the state of renewal.
I reach for the stars...sky...
Life after death!
I have found a life after death.
Let's take away the sins of the fathers and abolish the hate of their sons.
Now no one can be there to witness this holy gore-ification.
All these lies...all these lives...
I reach for the stars, and the sky.
I reach for a life after death.
