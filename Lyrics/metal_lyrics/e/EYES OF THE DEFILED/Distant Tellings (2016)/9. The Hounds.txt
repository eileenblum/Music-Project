Life, it has become an animotic, horrific result of state of mind.
I will not be a part of it.
I will continue to carve my own legacy.
The walls, the walls themselves are growing.
I see the lies, the lies beyond your tired eyes.
And if you try to stop me, there's no defense big enough for your problems.
So go forth and criticize!
Make everyone feel right at home.
The walls, the walls themselves are growing.
"The ashes of hell" will bury you alive.
Find somewhere to hide.
I feel the hounds upon me.
I have no choice but to say, "There must be a new way to live!"
If only I'd found it then.
I have found a new way to live!
