I saw you spit in the face and render ruin onto your heart.
I cannot watch, I can't look away.
The threat is real, pain permanent, and it won't stop until you die.
Die, deceiver, the bringer of souls.
I want to see you fall!
Behold your world collapsing into the abyss.
I feel the heat coming off of you...breathe deep!
Enjoy the feeling of soot in your lungs!
(I never wanted this.)
I turn my back and I will decide the direction my life will take.
You can't hold me back, I am alive!
I won't forget you, drowning in dismal sorrow.
I do this in membrance to never be like you again.
Are you still breathing?
Your wide eyes open just to see your death.
The sun rips out your heart and hands it to his father.
Death of life.
