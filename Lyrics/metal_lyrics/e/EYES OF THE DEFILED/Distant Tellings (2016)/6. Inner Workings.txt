Confronted by this new perspective, I have no choice but to accept what I have seen.
This congregation should have never existed.
How could man have been so...wrong? Tear out my eyes.
I fear the worst, for they believed only lies.
My inner workings stop, all that I am completed to fall to the ground.
Fall, fall, fall to the ground.
"So expertly placed..."
We cannot deny the evidence.
Traces scattered throughout the universe.
So expertly placed, everything has a purpose!
I will go against the grain and open myself to this God who created everything.
Tear out my heart, and wash it clean, for it believed only lies.
My inner workings stop, all that I am compelled to fall, fall, fall to the ground.
