2064.
My life confines me.
Limitless prison in an endless vacuum.
Oh, all the horrors I've seen can never be replaced.
I've shut myself inside, stuck away with my tragedies.
Open my eyes and tell me that the pain is real because reality for me has become a dark shadow.
"Seek the dark, find your grace close to your heart. Know your place."
Seek the dark.
This planet cannot think for itself.
It will be torn asunder.
Go find those angel's wings you made out of wax and take a leap of faith that you will not believe.
And from this burning hull of rock, we're cast away like spoiled livestock, broken by the promise of destruction kept.
Swept by inhuman tides of fate into a hell without a way out.
In this hell, you will not live!
Go forth and seek innocence.
Search for a new life that you can call your own.
Seek shelter from the storm that's looming above you.
Disintegrating, apocalyptic side of hell.
It's coming closer to me, it won't stop coming for me...
This is where I give up, let Your will be done!
God, deliver me, I must be set free!
Do not fear the light, your all has washed away.
This journey ends here.
To start anew, let our souls fly.
Divine fulfillment.
