I'll call you out and expose the liar for what you really are.
A failure to the mission and a damnable disgrace to every population.
Eye for an eye, that's what I'll believe tonight and suck these demons right out of your lifeless corpse.
All other life has been extinguished.
His chosen kind has been distinguished and rid of this life for all to see!
Imperium!
How we live determines how we will die.
Forced souls, heart holes will gain control.
This life never had a chance.
Begin to see the blight upon their blood.
