I feel the darkness slowly feeding off of my soul, but there's nothing left of me.
Slowly corrupting every breath I take, feasting on the sin I make.
I'll give you everything, oh Lord, if you take the pain from my rotting heart.
Decomposing of the weakest of souls, give your opposition all His power.
Please stop the malevolent one!
He put a price on my head.
This was never supposed to be.
I had been shown the right way.
There's no excuse for me, but now I realize I am saved!
I am saved, and now I preach the Father's Word in your face.
I was wrong all along, we all were.
It will all come to a head.
Feel surrounding warmth around you as your body shuts down!
It will all be over soon.
Is it worth it all now?
Praise our God.
