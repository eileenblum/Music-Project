I willingly lend you devotion, the essence of what I am
What blinds us is common promotion, given by your hand.
No contradiction, nor disbelief,
All are forsaken, non get relief

By my side you'll be, fear don't ask nor need

I'm pleased with your pure adoration, grasping for all I am
I offer you more than temptation, given by my hand

By my side you'll be, fear don't ask nor need
Enter death with, dead but still you breath
