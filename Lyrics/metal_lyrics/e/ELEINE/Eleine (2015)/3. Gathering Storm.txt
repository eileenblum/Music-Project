Once upon a time
Serenity dwelt within man
We lived in peace with
Ourselves but alas,
A shadow's raising behind
Keeping humanity blind

An oracle and shaman
Forebode the night coming dark
They saw a sadness
Befall everyone
Seduced by emotions within
Bound by the shackles of sin

Run now,
A storm's on the way
Darkness will cover both
Night and day
So close,
Emotions at play
Intentions to lead you astray
So beware of the
Gathering storm

Everyone will cower
But welcome their
Unyielding fate
A love to hate at the
Cost of the soul
Evil will spread its foul breath
Leaving but torment and death

Run now,
A storm's on the way
Darkness will cover both
Night and day
So close,
Emotions at play
Intentions to lead you astray

So beware of the
Gathering storm
So beware of the
Gathering storm.

Come to me...
Come to me...

Run now, a storm's on the way
Darkness will cover both
Night and day
So close, emotions at play
Intentions to lead you astray

Run now, a storm's on the way
Darkness will cover both
Night and day
So close, emotions at play
Intentions to lead you astray
So beware of the gathering storm
