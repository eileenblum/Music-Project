Made mistakes that
Can never be pardoned
Swore and oath that
Can never be broken

Bound to a future
Tied to destiny
I'm cursed to a faith
That spans eternity,
Forever damned,
It is my destiny

Came to terms with
Apparent dishonor
Came to closure with
Whom I've been become

Bound to a future
Tied to destiny
I'm cursed to a faith
That spans eternity
Forever damned,
It is my destiny

Bound to a future
Tied to destiny
I'm cursed to a faith
That spans eternity,
Forever damned,
It is my destiny

Bound to a future
Tied to destiny
I'm cursed to a faith
That spans eternity,
Forever damned,
It is my destiny
