Follow me, hear my voice
Come to me, and rejoice

I decide if you live or die,
I provide you and endless life
Now I own your every soul.
Now I'm in complete control

You've hear the lies,
Now hear the truth
See the harm,
That they produce

Death, closing in,
Brings eternal sin

There's no escape,
From the land beyond sanity
We will prevail
Both present and past

There's nowhere to run
In a world of depravity
Death is a lie
When my children are amassed

Your faith in me,
Gives you relief
Those who fail, do not believe

I decide if you live or die
I provide you and endless life
I own your soul,
I'm in control

There's no escape,
From the land beyond sanity
We will prevail
Both present and past

There's nowhere to run
In a world of depravity
Death is a lie
When my children are amassed

There's no escape,
From the land beyond sanity
We will prevail
Both present and past

There's nowhere to run
In a world of depravity
Death is a lie
When my children are amassed
