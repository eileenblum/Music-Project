Beauty in a way,
The lingering of ones soul,
Though the final stage is set

Still they seem to strain
Discarding their role
Some call it fate,
I call it a story told

All that is, erased
With your last breath
I'm always near,
Feeding on your fear

Annihilation, or cessation,
Dissolution, expiration
Your destruction and extinction
Ever resting, termination
I'm death incarnate

Bound by simple ways,
Many marks on your trail,
Knowing you'll face he same

All that is,
Erased with your last breath
I'm always near,
Feeding on your fear

Annihilation, or cessation,
Dissolution, expiration
Your destruction and extinction
Ever resting, termination
I'm death incarnate
