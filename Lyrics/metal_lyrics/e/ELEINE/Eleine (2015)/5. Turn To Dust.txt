Reality's dream,
And dreams become reality.
As nightmares come to life,
And man begin to strife.

The truth becomes the lie,
When lies distorted bent awry,
The madness that's within
Will stretch your soul so thin

Angels crying,
Hope is dying
Faith will crumble
And turn to dust

Heavens fading,
Darkness shading
Faith will crumble
And turn to dust

Turn to dust,
Turn to dust
Turn to dust...

Humanity is purged,
From everyone I'm passing by,
Corruption to the core,
Forever close the door
Violence ascend,

Rage and fury takes control
Passion is enhanced
At my very touch

Angels crying,
Hope is dying

Faith will crumble
And turn to dust

Heavens fading,
Darkness shading
Faith will crumble
And turn to dust

Turn to dust, turn to dust
Turn to dust...

Angels crying,
Hope is dying
Faith will crumble
And turn to dust

Heavens fading,
Darkness shading
Faith will crumble
And turn to dust

Angels crying,
Hope is dying
Faith will crumble
And turn to dust
