Try, try and make me change,
I'm torn, unable to mend.

I'm marked as being strange
For you, I won't stay the same.

Pretty words,
Though, we all know, I do pretend.

Lost broken
That's how you claim to know me

I rise, defy
What you see,
Is my pride

You'll go from narrow to blind,
Torn apart, 'cause you'll find you're
Living a lie
Living a lie, living a lie.

Lost broken
That's how you claim to know me

I rise, defy
What you see,
Is my pride

Lost broken
That's how you claim to know me

A sin, wicked
Rage, hatred
Building up inside so

I rise, defy
What you see,
Is my pride
