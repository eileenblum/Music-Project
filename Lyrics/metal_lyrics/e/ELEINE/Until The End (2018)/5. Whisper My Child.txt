Some say we have done crimes
Against the gods
Punished for our sins

Tortured in our minds and our hearts
Leaving marks on our skin

Although we feel so dead inside
There lies a beast and when it wakes
You know it will not hide
(Broken down from within)
And so we seem to tear our minds
Awakening the beast inside

Whisper my child
Strike fear into the believers
Stand your ground
Their blood shall never be found

Breathe from the wild
Steal heart from the one who tamed us
Forever bound
Their blood shall never be found

Wicked ones never stray from the halls
They're crawling under my skin
Slowly blood starts to pour from these walls
I'm drowning under my sins

And so we've come to realize
It's time to wake the beast inside

Whisper my child
Strike fear into the believers
Stand your ground
Their blood shall never be found

Breathe from the wild
Steal heart from the one who tamed us
Forever bound
Their blood shall never be found

Whisper my child
Strike fear into the believers
Stand your ground
Their blood shall never be found

Breathe from the wild
Steal heart from the one who tamed us
Forever bound
Their blood shall never be found
