Loving, caring
My mother you saved me
Blood drenched, beaten

Your cries were to set me free

Pictures, fading
Mother, I'm still here
You cried, begging
Your voice still runs through me

I only want you to open your eyes
Please, be the miracle that saves me from my cries
Don't, leave me alone to bare this life
Please, hold me and sing it'll be alright
Please, come back to me

Searing, silence
Slowly, surrounding
I stand, frozen
Your last cry is all I hear

I only want you to open your eyes
Please, be the miracle that saves me from my cries
Don't, leave me alone to bare this life
Please, hold me and sing it'll be alright
Please, come back to me
