Bring songs of fear
Oh, serenade the frail

Some will betray
Will you be saved or slain

God, has poisoned your mind
Though you search you do not find
A sanctuary
Their blood lies right where you stand
By the sage, from the damned
Approved insanity, we all bleed

Tales made of fear
Oh, can you shed, your veil

None shall remain
Will you be saved or slain

God, has poisoned your mind
Though you search you do not find
A sanctuary
Their blood lies right where you stand
By the sage, from the damned
Approved insanity, we all bleed

God, has poisoned your free mind
Though you search you do not find
A sanctuary
Their blood runs deep right where you stand
By the sage, from the damned
Approved insanity, we all bleed
