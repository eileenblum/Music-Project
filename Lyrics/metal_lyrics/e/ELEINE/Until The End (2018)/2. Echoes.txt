I'm trapped by an eerie clench
In his eyes, I see my suffering enhance

Please spare my soul
He won't let me go

Forced to lead a life, forever damned
I'm forced to tell his lies, I want revenge

Prepare your soul
He won't let me go

Demons crawling in your mind
Consumed from inside
An eternal grind
Echoes from ancient times

Held by your own thoughts, under a spell
Struggling through life, it never ends

They tear your soul
You may never know

Demons crawling in your mind
Consumed from inside
An eternal grind
Echoes from ancient times

Crucify, all our sins are paid in full, for the lies we spread
Hell awaits those who defy

Crucify, all our sins are paid in full, for the lies we spread
Hell awaits those who defy

Demons crawling in your mind
Consumed from inside
An eternal grind
Echoes from ancient times

Demons crawling in your mind
Consumed from inside
An eternal grind
Echoes from ancient times
