Another side of me
Sanity
Another side of me

Bend to the will and demands of another
Deny the freedom you had
(Never forget)
Sanity
(Never give in)

Tame and seduce or let hate be your lover
Embrace the darkness you have
(Heed my calling)
(Fear me)
(Regret nothing)

Hatred crawls on my skin
Cracks me but never gets in
I can't loose my sanity
Drowning tortured within
Break me be faced with a grin
I can't loose my sanity

I wash my hands in their blood
I'm their mother
I walk along with the damned
(Never forget)
Sanity
(Never give in)

Hatred crawls on my skin
Cracks me but never gets in
I can't loose my sanity
Drowning tortured within
Break me be faced with a grin
I can't loose my sanity

Hatred crawls on my skin
Cracks me but never gets in
I can't loose my sanity
Drowning tortured within
Break me be faced with a grin
I can't loose my sanity

Another side of me
Sanity
Another side of me
Sanity
