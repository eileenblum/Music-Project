Laid to rest
I lost faith in what was real
What was real

We're laid to waste
Shunned by the ones who gave us creed
Gave us creed

We shall never die
Fear us
Fire claims the sky
You can run never hide

So, here we stand
Unable to reenact
This life
I shall never die

Now you crawl
Raising your flag to those who lead
We shall lead

We shall never die
Fear us
Fire claims the sky
You can run never hide

Our cries echo through the night
Hear us
Under a crimson sky
You can run never hide

Ooh..

We shall never die
Fear us
Fire claims the sky
You can run never hide

Our cries echo through the night
Hear us
Under a crimson sky
You can run never hide

Ooh..

Blood shall rain
The skies will fall

Blood shall rain
The skies will fall
