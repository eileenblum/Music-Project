Enter the fall and decay of me
Surrender a will once was free

Woven from a single thread,
A suit of lies of which you spread (Untold)

You've stolen from those in need
Leaving them behind to bleed

Speak now or forever hold you peace
Illusion is all that I see

You've stolen from those in need
Left behind to bleed

I will awake you fears
Reveal a knife you'll hear
A story untold

Hear us we speak from our arms
Bleed now you'll do no more harm

You've stolen from those in need
Left behind to bleed

I will awake you fears
Reveal a knife you'll hear
A story untold

I will awake you fears
Reveal a knife you'll hear

I will awake you fears
Reveal a knife you'll hear
A story untold
