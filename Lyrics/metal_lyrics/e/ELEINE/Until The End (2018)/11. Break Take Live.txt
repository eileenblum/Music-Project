With each step staggering
An endless dark draws closer

To wish it not so
Will not unbind your fate
Rise together
Bring down hells gate

Close your eyes
Let us leave this state
Open your mind
Before it is too late

Break, take, live
Break, take, live
Break, take, live
Break, take, live

Fear not your mind
Or surely you will fall
From narrow graves
Rise the blind
End comes to all

Break, take, live
Break, take, live
Break, take, live
Break, take, live

Thanks to dark-elemental for sending track #8 lyrics.
