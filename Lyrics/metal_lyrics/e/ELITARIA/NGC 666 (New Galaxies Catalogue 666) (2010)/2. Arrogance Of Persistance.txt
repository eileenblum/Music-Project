We have won â for the brightest world to come
we have won â burning sun of nuclear war
we have won â will and power by our side
we have won â to re-create all mankind

atfer the battle , an upcoming grace
a final solution that everything erase
nuclear warfare as cleaning machine
a purifying shower of gamma rays
nuclear warheads fall from the sky
parasite running, no place to hide
millions of people turning into ashes
is just the begging, rise-up mushroom clouds

arrogance of persistence

from ruins, death and despair
from demise and annihilation
the necessary strain, uncompromised
of renaissance of human race

10.000 thousand years spent to improve
what nature cycles cannot remove
mankind's fears and loathing of herself
but we are ready to kill the defect
multitude of corpses cover the earth
as chemo-therapy of a cancer called man
in our hands the future begins,
standing together to tyrannize

arrogance of persistence

We have won â for the brightest world to come
we have won â burning sun of nuclear war
we have won â hail to the victory
we have won â over the ashes we tyrannize
