I am Silence, Master of them all
I am nothing, I am everything
I am everywhere, in everytime, in everyspace
I shall be forever and ever - alone

from distant planets to small debris
from a cloudy nebula to the brighter sun
from twisted space of massive black holes
from quietly sea of radio waves - I shall be
I
am the last and only witness
I am the last one that this world had seen
in this vast ruin where's no life dwell, (no more)
from this everlasting death, just silence shall be

....AND SILENCE SHALL BE [4x]

from this cold chaos, where's void reign
where's rules and order are meaningless
matter and shape, empty words that time forget
from this cold chaos, just silence shall rule

I am the last and only witness
I am the last one that this world had seen
in this vast ruin where's no life dwell, (no more)
from this everlasting death, just silence shall be

....AND SILENCE SHALL BE [4x]
