on a monochrome screen, I exist
a graphic on a table, is what I am
a single cell, bio- manipulated
forced to exist by technology

I am a clone, selected form of life
I am a clone, prepared to evolve and obey

what I feel can't be described
no fear or hope dwell into me
what I see , a wasteland to defy,
to use, consume and dominate

rising control of self consciousness
roaring into me - soul at zero

deep in my flesh, a superior organism,
desensitized - soul at zero

a cold ,unnatural stigma of priority
proud to evolve - soul at zero

a symbolic icon of necessary path
soul at zero, soul at zero

I am a clone, selected form of life
I am a clone, prepared to evolve and obey
