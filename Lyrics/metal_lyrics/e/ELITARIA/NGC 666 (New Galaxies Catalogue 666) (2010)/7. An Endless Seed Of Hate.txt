The journey turns to an end for life on planet Earth
existence is an overcoming concept and idea
next level of evolution has came , hail to the machine
flesh is unnecessary, nothing shall remain

what we are, pure and cold intelligence
what we are is an endless seed of hate
what we are, a vast, void of eternity
what we are is an endless seed of hate

as a flare of a dying sun, or a quasar out of space
our strength to exist ceases to have reason
when time, space and form become meaningless,
program of continuity just fading away

what we are, pure and cold intelligence
what we are is an endless seed of hate
what we are, a vast, void of eternity
what we are is an endless seed of hate

self destruction activated
â sub-routine of survive stopped
cyber-clones dis-connected
â one mind unites in death
mainframe uncorrupted
â last program launched and active
hybrids form in cryogenic state, frozen and hold on
starship ready and engaged,
moving on the other space
quickly passing the atmosphere,
with the testimony of our race
our last will, our wisdom, our trace on universe
but there's only, at last, an endless seed of hate
