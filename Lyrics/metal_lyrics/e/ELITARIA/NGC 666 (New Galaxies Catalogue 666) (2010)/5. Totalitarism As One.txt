Totalitarianism as one
the final process is done
one mind. one flesh, one soul one aim
in a totalitarianism, finally united as one

rising our brave new world, as a hive of pure clones
unite as one, with heart and soul without moral slags to fright them
- new breed is coming
one mind organized, a multiple element
straight through one way
a single sound, a unison mind
-one voice that roars from the depths
- the new breed is coming
annihilation of individual though complete

we're standing together - with proud and joy
we're choosing forever â to be finally slave

Totalitarianism as one
the final process is done
one mind. one flesh, one soul one aim
in a totalitarianism, finally united as one

cyber-bound, multiple heads wired and connected
step by step, selected brain, controlled and improved
- new breed rising
primary needs aborted,
wishes and desires must be removed
as wasteful jail of obsolete flesh,
we must clone to re-build
- new breed rising
a global connected maelstrom of cyborg, shall be

we're standing together - with proud and joy
we're choosing forever â to be finally slave

new breed is coming
new breed is rising
we must choose now
to serve and obey

we're standing together - with proud and joy
we're choosing forever â to be finally slave

Totalitarianism as one
the final process is done
stronger than hate, forced to evolve
we shall be exactly what future shall be
