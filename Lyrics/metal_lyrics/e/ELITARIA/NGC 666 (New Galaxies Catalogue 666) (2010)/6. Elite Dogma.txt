point of no return, binary harmony
a never ending sea of virtual lives as one
hybrids humanoid, connected into deep
one by one, on engine planet Earth

I, I am, forever and ever my own god
I, I am the last and final prototype

superior elite, elite dogma

cyber apocalypse between existence
a second elapsed as millions light years
time and space collapse, nature rules erased
tera-bytes as soul, machine cycles as tongue

I, I am, forever and ever my own god
I, I am the last and final prototype

superior elite, elite dogma

vertical degree of evolution,
a bio-structure of sylicium
conceptual stage of ubermasch,
without limits than itself
drained of human frailty and physiological decay
beyond the boundaries of quintessence

we are an elite, we are our dogma

cyber apocalypse between existence
a second elapsed as millions light years
time and space collapse, nature rules erased
tera-bytes as soul, machine cycles as tongue
nothing can compared with our supremacy
to force matter and form to our will and use
and now after all, when we have the total control
we rise unite as one, to dominate the Earth
