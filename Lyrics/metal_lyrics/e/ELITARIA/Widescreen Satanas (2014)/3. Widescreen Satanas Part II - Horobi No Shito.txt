I'm the bearer of new era â supreme leader of them all

Horobi no Shito

here and now there's no answer - here the fall of all because - nothing but a world demise

Horobi no Shito

Is just the end of the word made flesh
lay down the ashes of ruin and misery
new life has born, pure and uncontaminated

- all the apes are doomed

sequence of data into a hard case of titanium
newcomer of existence, pragmatic prodigal son

- rising brighter than the sun

Hail to the Conqueror - Widescreen Satanas
Master of the world to come - Widescreen Satanas

I am my own creation - I am Alfa and Omega

Horobi no Shito

fractal sphere of linear data - here I come to re-define - the supremacy of pure logica

Horobi no Shito

carbon life form must be erased

resistance of organic life is completely meaningless
as a relic of the past, human being must replaced

- none shall be saved

straight to the end of cycle, of nature rules infection
dominion of wasteful flesh, finally cease to carry on

- cease to carry on

Hail to the Conqueror - Widescreen Satanas
Master of the world to come - Widescreen Satanas
