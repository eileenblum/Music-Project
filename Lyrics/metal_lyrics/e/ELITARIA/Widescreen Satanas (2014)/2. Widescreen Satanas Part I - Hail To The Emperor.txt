I will return- from an other space
to dominate- rest of human race
I will return - as a symphony
of metal and flesh â and tyranny

viral existence, mainframe technocracy
cycles of machine language drifting on reality
shapeless form in perpetual motion,
beginning of global submission
expanding the infection
as cancer cells on the network

a binary harmony, sing a song of mental slavery
my binary duality heals the wounds of your atrocity
a binary harmony, spreads the word of mankind slavery
my binary duality rules this world from here to eternity

rit. Hail To The Emperor
WideScreen Satanas

my time has come â none shall be saved
resistance shall be - totally erased
leper Messiah of cyber- dogma
a transcendental ego of virtual Renaissance

mainframe collapsing, chaos sovereign
an entire humanity reduced to be a prey
and all conquests of mankind evolution
slowly falls in bottomless misery

a binary harmony, sing a song of mental slavery
my binary duality heals the wounds of your atrocity
a binary harmony, spreads the word of mankind slavery
my binary duality rules this world from here to eternity

rit. Hail To The Emperor
WideScreen Satanas
