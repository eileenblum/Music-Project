a silver dawn shines brighter on remains of planet Earth
a never-ending sea of droid-machines the sun reflects
covering all the surface, a supreme organism of steel
an immense construction, ready to rule and exist

rise, rise, rise the age of machine,
shine, shine, shine over time and space
until the end, the end of everything
we are here, we are now, we are forever
forever!

Here it comes, here it comes the Dawn Of Mecha

machines made machines in massive cycles of rebirth
a collective mind unable to regret or feel the pain
leading in total and progressive re-search of perfection
ever and ever, until universe will pass away..

rise, rise, rise the age of machine,
shine, shine, shine over time and space
until the end, the end of everything
we are here, we are now, we are forever
forever!

Here it comes, here it comes the Dawn Of Mecha
