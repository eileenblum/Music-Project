While the ranks and ramparts rise
One load soul melts away.

When distrust of vastrous size
Makes that realms do decay,
When the dust of kingdoms dies
Guilt and blood lines my way.

The eldest man says that the grace of a dream fades away
Whenever it seems that a part of this dream has come true.
The eldest man says that only the dreams will do
Will darkness arise then the good in your heart will not
stray.

In my darkest days
Anger and disgrace
Overwhelms my brain,
I do curse my strain.

I can't sleep no more
Worms gnaw near the core,
Doubts come through the night
Taking the rests of delight.

When my thoughts go round
They go back to when
Home has been my haunt,
I want myself back again.

In my darkest days
Anger and disgrace
Overwhelms my brain,
I do curse my strain.
