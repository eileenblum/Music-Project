Of wisdom's shadows art thou made for real
To hide what may distinguish or distract
What forces life's existence to conceal
Were it not of mysterious attract

If thou wer'st not for my eyes without shape
And thou wer'st visualized and undeduced

Thy sight would make the uncertain escape
And show the destiny to whom I'll be reduced

The fears, uncertanties and strong suspense
Canst thou create by soaking in the dark
My spirit, my existence in the sense
Of being steady and released of any mark
But for my own relief, I'm surely kept
By wisdom's shadows; and I should accept
