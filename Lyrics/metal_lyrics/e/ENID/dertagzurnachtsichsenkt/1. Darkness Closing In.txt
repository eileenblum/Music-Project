When the rain starts to fall on the dark lands
When the drops are effaching your tears
When the pain grips your heart with her stark hands
When the rain is closing in

When the rain starts to dry on the windows
When laughing returns to your mind
When the wind takes your words the open
The world could dream again

[Ref.:]
There is brightness down on the other side
Where the lightning seems to burn
There is something lost in the darkness to hide
Where's the start of an endless turn
Where's the center of your eternal pride
