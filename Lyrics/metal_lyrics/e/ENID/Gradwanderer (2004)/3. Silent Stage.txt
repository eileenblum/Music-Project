I'm down towards my stage, beloved,
Where splashing voices murmur 
To the nearby distance;
Audible for only my soul's ears.

When all the silent life gets words
To whisper in its ailing tone
Of unheard tales and fears
I'm calming down from life and listen.

"Come and hear my views of another world
Beneath the vestige of truth.
Come and live the myths from the other land
Don't fear to lay down your pride."

The soundless forest breathes time
Like if there'd be no time
In all human progression;
Audible for only my soul's ears.

The voice appears when the mortal past
Has left my humanity,
When I don't feel what binds
My soul; I feel the hidden motions.
