Wistfulness upon our wisdom
Distrustful of our thoughts we lie depraved
From your integrity.
"Go out to the unknown realms of curiosity!"
Should I leave or should I stay?
"Think of tomorrow's equable results!"
There's no guidance on my way.
"Observe the rules of fear
To gain control
Over liberty's destruction
Inside your stagnated self.
Listen to our whispering."
I've always heard.
"Listen to our melody.
Expand dimensions."
I never did.
"Expand dimensions.
Liquidize your life!"
