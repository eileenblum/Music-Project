Child of a fantasy.
Demon of tyrants.
Soil of atrocities.
Mirror of sin.

Once in a while when the drainedaways dream
Of your speech as an eternal truth,
Noone will notice the venomous scheme,
Blinding inside your existenceless youth.

Instable idol of several's fathers,
Deceptive idyll in unseen ideas,
Fatal without being real, a chimera
Of mania in garments of light.
