Thank you
For showing me full moon
Thank you
For the signs in the snow
Thank you
For saving the world with me
Thank you
For lending a hand

Thank you
For the words
I've been rhyming all the time
Thank you
For the inspiration
Thank you
For the lime on your skin
For the lime on your hair
For your songs and your prayers

Thank you
For the tears
You've been crying all alone
Thank you
For all the waiting
Thank you
For the sound of your voice
You've been there in those nights
When I needed assurance
