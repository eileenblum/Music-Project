The faded fields lift their nightly satin
To awake in twice shining gold,
The smoothly risen dawn expands
And will fullfill what has been foretold.

The helmets twinkle in rigid rows
Upon the meadows and hills around.
Behind the visors a thousand pairs of
Anes which stare to where their fears abound.

He did come and you did come
To the valley under two suns...

Tonight you've talked within moonshine's stillness
To the eldest and long time gones.
Your voice spoke flightly and so did they
While their whisperings warned of two lost sons.

He did come and you did come
To the valley under two suns...

The legions march and the springs are fading
As the youth turns from bright to grey
While the battle rises and bloodbrooks run
Fears and whisperings are washed away.

Still as the grave sounds the post-war-anthem
Banneres twice ploughs the ghostship's prow
My words can't tell if you have won
But I know that it's autumn now...

He did come and you did come
To the valley under two suns...
