Faces like ashes
Like leaden loan
Nightness of Brandigan
You've made them moan...

Belrapeire...

Up in the palace
The princess of light
That outshined all others
And silenced the knight

Belrapeire...

Blinded enlighted
He raises the lance
Clamides marshal
He loses his stance

Walls sleets and merlons
With town-dwellers manned
With faith and the red knight
The armies are banned

At the end of the savage
Commander Clamide
Shattered he lies
In the dust of defeat

Belrapeire...

Exhausted the starved
Regather in daze
In victories sweetness
The slain down souls braise
Belrapeire...
