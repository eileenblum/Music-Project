When all time ends
Your soul I send
Beginnings end
On deathbed's hands

When ends begin
When your heart weeps
And hide the truths
Its golden bud

What lie herein
Mine patience keeps
Mine ancient will
Mine shining smooths
Through years of blood

Since any times
While farewells win

Thine surge of rage
A golden chest
Which's kept in gold
To charming rhymes
For ever in

The weight of age
Will lie the rest

Weighs nothing more
In my vein's shrine
Will curse your thrill
Than insight's might
Smooth shape of gold

Inside my core
The cast of mine

When furies fight
Veils in heat's hold

Along my bends
The earthheart's cast

The fight would last
Till all time ends
