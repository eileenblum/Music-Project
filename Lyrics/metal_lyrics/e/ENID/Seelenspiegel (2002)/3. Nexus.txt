This is where I cry my silent longing for your grace,
For the paralysing motion that your moods evoke in me.
All your wonders live inside me,
Fill my heart with life again;
All your rushing pleasures flee
'Round till my time comes.

Now is what I see dissolving through an imprisoned mind,
Ancient thoughts have walled a cell of stone around me.

This is where you catch my conscience for to torture me,
For to live inside my nightmares, rising from the gone days.
If I just could banish
Those who loathe my soul,
Those who once have been my life;
I left their crystal cavern.
