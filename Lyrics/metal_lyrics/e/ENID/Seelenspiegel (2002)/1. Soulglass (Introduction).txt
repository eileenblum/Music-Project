For this very moment
I free my pain,
Images of blisses,
Woebegone.

You will have to show me
My inner despite,
You will have to lead me inside.

For this very moment
Of timeless age
Fears of deeper insight
Surpass me.

For this very moment
Your eye's turning bright,
A solitary lightning
Without a sound.

Desperately I'm trying
For to hear your voice,
But you will stay silently shining.

For this very moment
I free my pain,
Images of blisses,
Woebegone.
