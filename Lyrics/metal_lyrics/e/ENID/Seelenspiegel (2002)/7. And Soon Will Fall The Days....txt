"We are the essence of the world beyond perception,
Force is the outcome of our arms ordained by the unaware,
Blood is the liquid between dreams and life's deception,
No one will know when we'll raise our swords against the days."

Things existing,
Lifelessly living,
They disclose
The world's appearance

Things existing,
Bloodlessly pulsing
In the stream
Of time's procession.

Thoughts forgotten,
Seeming asleep,
They'll awake
In drapes unthought.

Thoughts that vanished,
Ended in smoke,
Will return
And fear they'll stoke.
