How do you whisper out loud?
Be all alone in a crowd?
Well.....

How do you manage to fly?
Breathe like the wind when you sigh?
Sun, burning like fire
She's not feeling the sun, look at her run

Looks like it's starting to rain
Can't quite decide who's to blame

Hey, all right
Mama told me so son you're getting slow
Find a girl to make your own
Women treat you bad everyone you had
Your legs are long but you ain't grown
No no back off Mama I'm just learning, and how
Got to help me light the fuse
I got the rocking chair rock 'n' roll blues
Yeah

Daddy told me no truck it kind of slow
Get your fill of living alone
Women treat you cool, Lord you're such a fool
Your legs are long but you ain't grown
Hey, back off Mama I'm just learning and how
Help me light the fuse
I got the rocking chair rock 'n' roll blues now

All right, oh yeah, oh yeah

Now you gotta back off Mama, I'm just learning and how
Gotta help me light the fuse
I got the rocking chair rock 'n' roll blues, yeah

Oh, oh oh
Oooh, yeah, help me
