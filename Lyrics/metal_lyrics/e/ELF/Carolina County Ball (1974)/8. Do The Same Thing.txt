Crazy little woman go down, go down, go down, go down
Down to where the honey is sweet
Hey sweet baby go round, go round, go round, go round
Got to knock me off my feet
Lord I got the fever
Stop just 'fore I die
....No, do the same thing!
Do the same thing!

Hey little mama don't fall, fall, fall, fall
Baby I'm depending on you
Yeah, hey sweet woman you call me, call me, call me, call
For anything you want me to do
Lord I got the fever
Stop just 'fore I die
....No, do the same thing!
Do the same thing!
Oh hey!

All right
Crazy little woman go down, go down, go down, go down
Down to where the honey is so sweet
Listen sweet lady go round, go round, go round, go round
Got to knock me off my feet
I say Lord I got the fever
Won't just stop 'fore I die
....No, do the same thing!
Oh, do the same thing!
Yeah, do the same thing!
Oh, do the same thing!
Yeah, do the same thing!
Oh, do the same thing!
Yeah, the same thing!

Oh yeah
