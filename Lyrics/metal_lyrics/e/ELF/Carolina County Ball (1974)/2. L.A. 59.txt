It's thinking of you
That's getting me back on the road again
Hey big train you're eating up the ground

Thunder and rain
Pushing the train that I'm on again
Gotta get me back to L.A. 59

Aw, remember it well
And oh, could I tell you about it all
But you know about heaven so Lord I'm going
To leave it there

Now the ladies are good
But nobody could be as good as you are
Oh get me back to L.A. 59

And it's hello, hello sunshine
It's a good day in L.A. it's all right, yeah
Oh, hello, hello, sunshine
My, it's a good day in L.A. 59

Oh right

Thunder and rain
Pushing the train that I'm on again
Get me back to L.A. 59

Hello, hello, sunshine, oh-oh
A good day in L.A., all right

And it's hello, hello sunshine, oh my sunshine
Well, it's a good day in L.A., it's all right, right
yeah

And I talk about
Hello, hello, sunshine
Oh yes, yes, such a good day in L.A., it's all right
Get me back, I sing
Hello, hello, sunshine, shine on me
And such a good day in L.A., it's all right, right, right

I sing hello, hello, sunshine, my close friend
Such a good day in L.A., it's all right, right

I sing hello, hello, sunshine, get me back, get me back
Such a good day in L.A.
