Aggravatin' Annie you're getting on my fanny
And I just can't cope any more
When it gets down to fundamentals
You're a bit confusing

You've got wrinkles on your face
But they seem to be in place
So I wonder well I wonder
Are you leading the young boy on?
Annie New Orleans

You're a hard core woman, a red necked woman
A good old girl from the South
With a negative way of speaking
But you're sentimental

We never speak of life but you want to be my wife
And I wonder, well I wonder
Are you leading the young boy on?
Annie New Orleans

Well didn't think I heard you at all
I was starting to fall
Back it up and try it again
I ain't letting you win, no way, all right

Aggravatin' Annie you're on my fanny
And I can't cope any more
When it gets down to fundamentals
Lady, you're confusing

Well, you've got some wrinkles on your face
But they're all in their place
So I wonder, I just wonder
Well are you leading the young boy on?
Annie New Orleans
Hey, Annie New Orleans
Oh, hey, Annie New Orleans

Yeah
