I'm standing in the shadows now
You think I'm dead and gone somehow
When the morning comes
You'll see around
Baby you know
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you

Feel like your time is coming fast
Keep hanging on you, you just gotta last
You're gonna see I won't forget you now
Oh, you know
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you

Don't let the big world get you down
I'm gonna turn it all around
And when the morning comes
You'll see my face
I know
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you, yes I do
I'm coming back for you

Oh, baby, come down
I'm, I'm, I'm coming back for you
Yeah, come back just for you
I'm coming back, back for you
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back, back, back, back for you
Coming back for you
Lord, good God
Lord, good God, I'm coming back for you
Oh Lord
