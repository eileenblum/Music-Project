Can't remember how I got
From here to there
Isn't any reason
Plain and simple
How I can't recall anymore
Would be misleading
Lead me on

Hell and Fire burning higher
Now I can see the ever after
Clock is moving only
While I see you down here me in laughter
Never more

Clutching to a bundle in the night
Nobody knows
Leaping dogs of winter on the fight
And everyone goes

Clutching to a bundle in the night
Nobody knows
Those leaping dogs of winter on the fight
And everyone goes
