I gotta tell ya about the blues
I gotta tell ya just how I lose
Ain't got no money
But I'll straighten up my head at the Cosmo now

Gambler, gambler
Chicken in the first degree
Gambler, gambler
Chicken in the first degree
I never been a gambler
So please don't messin' me

Hey, jury, jury
I tell you story, true
Ah, listen, jury, jury
Tell you story true
The jury found me guilty
Don't know what to do

I was playing in Boston
Say, up in old St. Lou
Surrounded by the FBI
For something I didn't do
Now my baby left me
Left me all alone
Judge said, "Son, you ain't going home"

Gambler, gambler
Chicken in the first degree
Well, I've never been a gambler
So please don't messin' me
Oh, no, no, no

Oh, gambler, gambler
Chicken in the first degree
Gambler, gambler
Chicken in the first degree
Well, I've never been a gambler
So please don't messin' me
