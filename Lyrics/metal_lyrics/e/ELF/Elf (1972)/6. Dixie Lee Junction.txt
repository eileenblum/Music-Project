These old boots will keep me walking
To a place I long to be
High upon a mountaintop
Down in Tennessee

Said goodbye to New York
Country living on my mind
Crowded streets and hot cement
That's what I left behind

Well, just outside of Oakridge
About a 15 minute ride
Well, all I need is clean fresh air
To keep me satisfied
Satisfied

Big city living got me on the run
Big city living got me on the run
Dixie Lee Junction
Dixie Lee Junction

Well, big city living got me on the run
Big city living got me on the run
Dixie Lee Junction
Dixie Lee Junction
Oh, yeah!

Yeah, big city living got me on the run
Big city living got me on the run
Dixie Lee junction
Dixie Lee Junction
Dixie Lee Junction
Dixie Lee Junction

Alright!
Dixie Lee Junction
Oh, Dixie Lee Junction
Hey, Dixie Lee Junction
Oh!
