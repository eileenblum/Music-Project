Well, she's handsome
She's got everything a woman could need
And she'll dance some
She can't follow cause she only can lead
But she's built good
She never missed a day of school
And her eyes could
Make you stop to feel like a fool

Hey, she go big time
Always got her hand in the pie
She drinks good wine
Never had a reason to cry
She don't smoke much
Always got a natural high
But you can't touch
She'll shake you up so much
That you'll die

She's so good, she's no good at all
She's so good, she's no good at all

Hoochie koochie lady
Trying to beat Park Avenue
Hoochie koochie lady
Trying to beat Park Avenue

Nnnnnnow-now

Let me tell you, she's handsome
She got everything a woman could need
And don't you know that she'll dance some
She can't follow cause she only can lead
But she's built good
But she never missed a day of school
And her black, black eyes could
Make you stop to feel like a fool

She's so good, she's no good at all
She's so good, she's no good at all
She's a hoochie koochie lady
Trying to beat Park Avenue
Hoochie koochie lady
Trying to beat Park Avenue

Oh yeah!
Hoochie koochie lady
Hoochie koochie lady
hoochie koochie lady
Yeah, hoochie koochie lady
