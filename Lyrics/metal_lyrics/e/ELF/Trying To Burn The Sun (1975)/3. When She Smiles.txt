Well ain't she lovely
Whe she's blue
And ain't she lovely
Looking at you

And I'm not one for speaking out loud
But you can't miss her face in a crowd
When she smiles
When she smiles, yeah

She makes me happy
When she's high
She'd even make you happy
Just waving bye-bye

And like some things way up in the air
She's got more than seems to be there
When she smiles
When she smiles, yeah

Well, hey you with your head in the noose
Look like you swallowed your shoes
Don't be called a fool
Ain't you really cool
Won't you even give it a try
My, my, my

Well, hey you with your head in the noose
Look like you swallowed your shoes
Don't be called a fool
Ain't you really cool
Won't you even give it a try
Won't you even give it a try
Won't you even give it a try

She's lovely
When she's blue
She looks so damn lovely, yeah
Looking at you

My baby makes me happy
She's lovely
I'm happy
When she's waving bye-bye
Makes you feel good
She's sure
Everytime I see I'm high
Hey, my my
