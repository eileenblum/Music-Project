Oh yeah
Uh back in the wood
Where it's good
And the days are yellow
Well I saw me a child
She was wild
Like a lady going all out

Dark as the night
She was ripe
For a little conversation
So I pulled her right in
And she said
She had some imagination

Black swampy water
That's where I caught her
Black swampy water
Black swampy water

We didn't speak
For a week
Got tangled up in her hair
So we lay in the grass
What a gas
You can't know that you were there

So then I let it all go
And the show
Was like blowing up a freight train
And round the world I would go
Like jumping on a jet plane

Black swampy water
That's where I caught her
Black swampy water
Uh, what I taught her, yeah

Oh, back in the wood
Where it's good
And the days are yellow
Gotta saw me a child
She was wild
Like a lady going all out

I've been
Black swampy water
All right
That's where I caught her, oh
Black swampy water
Oh all the things that I taught her
Yes, again

Black swampy water, my my
Where I saw here, oh
Black swampy water
What I did when I caught her, oh yeah yeah
