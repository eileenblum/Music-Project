Are there hard days ahead
Should we put it away
For a rainy day
Is my moon out tonight
Should I wake up today
I think I've just gotta say

Life's too complicated
To do much more creating
Waiting for the man to take us down
And you can't have no money
The cloudy days aren't sunny
And all the women that you know
Look just like men
Ah but it's smiling time again
And everybody wins
Good time music Is coming back today

Will the sun shine today
Should we keep it alive
Or lock it all up inside
Can we all find a way
To be happy again
When's it all gonna end

Life's too complicated
To do much more creating
Waiting for the man to take us down
And you can't have no money
The cloudy days aren't sunny
And all the women that you know
Look just like me
Ah but it's smiling time again
And everybody wins
'Cause good time music is coming back
'Cause good time music is coming back
'Cause good time music is coming back today

Oh
Good time music's coming back
Good time music's getting back
Good time music's coming back to stay
