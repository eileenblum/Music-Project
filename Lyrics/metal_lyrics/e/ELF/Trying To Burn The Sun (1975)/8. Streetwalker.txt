Streetwalker
You've been so good to me
Sweet talker
You've sure been so good to me
You make a lonely hearted stranger feel

Magic
There's magic in the way you make me feel like
Magic
I can't believe it's true, no
Magic
So spooky in the way you always get me higher
Voodoo woman you've cast a spell on me

Woman
Woman I know that you're the only
Woman
I believe in you
Woman
You're having everyone who comes your way
You woman
Got me on my knees, what can I do

Gotta get to the well
Before the well runs dry
And shuts me out again
You got something to sell
Beneath the midnight sky
Lady I'm in need of a friend, yeah

Magic
There's magic in the way you make me feel like
Magic
Well I can't believe it's true, no
Magic
So spooky in the way you always get me higher
Voodoo woman you've cast a spell on me, yeah

Streetwalker
You've been so good to me
You sweet talker
You've sure been so good to me
You make a lonely hearted stranger
Feel like he ought to be

Love woman
Dressed like a neon sign, ah, oh, oh
Love woman
Dressed like a neon sign
Just a hoochie-koochie baby
Loving with anyone you find
Remember you're mine

Streetwalker
You've been so good, good to me
Oh, sweet talker, sweet walker, sweet talker
You've been so good to only me
Make a lonely hearted stranger
Feel like it just got to be, ooh, ooh, ooh
