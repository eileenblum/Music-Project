Do-do-doo
Do-do-doo
Do-do-doo
Do-do-doo
Anytime of day
See her on her way
Straight down Liberty Road
Slinky like a cat
Trying to catch a rat
Oh, my

She's got crazy looking wheels
Love the way it feels
Just plain watching her move
Could you let her go
Stop the river flow
Now, now

Well come on, well come on
Down Liberty Road
Well come on, well come on
Down Liberty Road

She's lightning, frightening
Oh, oh, she's lightning, Lord, Lord
Got no way to say
Follow me home
Get on home

She's lightning, frightening
Oh my, she's lightning
Got no way to say
Follow me home
Yes right home, say

Anytime of day
See her on her way
Straight down Liberty Road
Slinkin' like a cat
Trying to catch a rat
Oh, my

Well come on, well come on
Down Liberty Road
Get down down
Well come on, well come on
Down Liberty Road
Set me free
Well come on, well come on
Down, down down, down down, down down, down down
Well come on, well come on
Down Liberty Road
Hey-hey
Oh my soul
Oh yeah
