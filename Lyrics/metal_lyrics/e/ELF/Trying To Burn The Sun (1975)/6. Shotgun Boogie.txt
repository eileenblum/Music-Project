Someone in the front of the shop needed a bar
Heard the boogie-woogie from the back of the car
Rooting, tooting, shooting by the man with the horn
Wailing since the day he was born

To get me on the scheme you gotta keep me alive
Jitter-bugging baby doing nothing but jive
Padded in the shoulders but your front is all wrong
You got me coming can you keep it on going

I wanna reach you baby
Got to put the phone down
And let it ring in my ear
Maybe in the morning
We can see if something's dawning
Am I making myself very clear

Oh, hands come alive
Move from side to side
Hands come alive
Shotgun boogie make it low down
All right, oh yeah
All right, oh yeah
Ooh, ooh, baby

Oh, hands come alive
Move from side to side
Hands come alive
Do that boogie jive

Oh, hands come alive
Move from side to side
Hands come alive
Baby, shotgun boogie make it low down

Hands come alive
Move from side to side
Hands come alive
Do the shotgun boogie make it low down

Hands come alive
Move from side to side
Hands come alive
The shotgun boogie make it low down

Hands come alive
Move from side to side
Hands come alive
Do the shotgun boogie make it low down
Low down, low down
Oh
Shotgun boogie make it l low down
Aaa
