Touch me, I feel
Take me, I'm real
Sail away, into the sun
I'm everyone

Wake me, I dream
I'm what I seem
Drift away, into the night
I'm the light

I am the sky
Help you to fly
Catch your wind
It's love I bring
I'm everything

I am the sea
Always to be
Drift away, into the night
I'm the light

I'm a fire
Burning higher
Trying to burn the sun
But don't you know
The rules just won't apply
Who am I

Wake me, I dream
Now I'm what I seem
So sail away, into the sun
'Cause I'm everyone, yeah

Touch me, I feel
Take me, I'm real
Drift away, into the night
I'm the light
