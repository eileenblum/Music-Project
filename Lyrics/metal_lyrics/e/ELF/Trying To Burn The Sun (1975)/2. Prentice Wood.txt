Watching all the flowers grow
Soon they'll be around
I love to watch the English countryside
Watch the bird with purple wings
Doesn't make a sound
He's waiting for the wind to take a ride

Ain't it looking fine
I wish that it were mine
Oh, feels good
Oh, feels good
In Prentice Wood, yeah

Ah
Men are coming out to play
Hit the ball around
Jump the net and change the sides again, yeah
Feeling foolish splash your name
Look what we've found
Don't you even use another friend

Ain't it looking fine
I wish that it were mine
Oh, feels good
Oh, feels good

Come with me lady, give us a smile
Try to believe that it's real

Watching all the flowers grow
Soon you'll be around
Feeling all the magic in the air
Seems the sun is only mine
Never going down
Love is in the wind it's everywhere

Ain't it lookin fine
Open up the wine
Oh, feels good
Oh, feels good
In Prntice Wood
Yeah
Oh
