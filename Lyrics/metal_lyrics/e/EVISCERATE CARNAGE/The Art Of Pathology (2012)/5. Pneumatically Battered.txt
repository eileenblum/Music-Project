A surge, of hate floods my veins, my sick game begins!
My thirst cannot be quenchedâ¦ I need to kill again!
Ri-tuals, of carnal abuse. Night falls again!
I decapitate to feed my bloodthirst!

Hooks and blades, incyst human flesh!
Profusely debouched. Brutally engorged!
Pneumatically battered!
Pneumatically raped!
Pneumatically hammered!
Pneumatically pumped withâ¦
The Corpse Awakes

[LEAD FILL]

Lead!

Irrational! Thoughts of manic slaughter,
Depraved I sink into my world of unsatisfaction!

Gilded and sliced, surgically diced!
Choirs of death, screams of strife!
Pneumatically battered!
Pneumatically raped!
Pneumatically hammered!
Pneumatically pumped withâ¦
The Corpse Walks

[LEAD FILL 2]

Lead!

Butchery is ensured,
Life is not adorned.
Lacerate with extreme precision,
Your death is now my decision!

Metamorphopsic Sanguine Drenched Corpse

[SOLO]

Psychotic hallucinations of the dead,
Voices of goreastic schizophrenia, infects my head!
My hands tremble, I drop the sawâ¦ and unto the flesh, carnivorously I gnaw!

Exhumed!
Consumed!
Entombed!
Never to be seen again!
The Corpse Disembowels

[LEAD FILL 3]
