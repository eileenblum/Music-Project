You must disengage
Portrait of Lost
Going through the dimension
World will devastate you
Escaping from situation
Will stop time too
Coldest days
Want to take all
The mist of hopes
Is the only one way
To find the notes
Of the last may
Darkest bays
Singing to you
Try to remember all
To feel this rage
Try to remember all
Just let it go
Roots of the corrupted
What lost on the map
Like the god handed
Call us for that
Sounds of war
Ultimate massacre
In the death row
Souls are damned
Destroy the past
And free the serpents
Vengeance will
Going fast
In the mirrors
Bring it into reality
Execute all Judas
Kill the life thief
Coldest days
Want to take all
Sounds of war
Ultimate massacre
In the death row
Souls are damned
Darkest bays
Singing to you
You must disengage
Portrait of Lost
