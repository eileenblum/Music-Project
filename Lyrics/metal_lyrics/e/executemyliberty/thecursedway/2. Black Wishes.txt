The seeds of corruption
That inside me
Are the pollution
For you and me
Collector of souls
Our judge
Can't see the walls
Of damned
The darkest wish
Is immortal devourer
Our sins are almost dead
Your fury haven't feelings
The mind want be mad
We can't be without this
Lord can
See all
Collector of souls
Our judge
Can't see the walls
Of damned
All of your steps
Pray again for
For salvation
Pray
Waiting for execution
Will drill your memories
The sounds of illusion
Put your dreams on kneels
Black wishes are easy way
To see the results
Of your mistakes
Well of sorrows is your last hope
Pray
I feel it
In your eyes
I see it
In the mirrors
