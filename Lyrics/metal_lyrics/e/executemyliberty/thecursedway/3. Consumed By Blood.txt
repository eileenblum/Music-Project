It want to taste your flesh
They want to feel your fear
Your tainted blood will consume you
Blood...consumed...
Doomed
Blood...consumed...
Cursed
Blood...consumed...
Small mistakes are monuments of death
Thousand of poison will bite your body
Then you will burn
The mace of traitor crushed you legs
At know, you can't escape,
In the melody of disfigured corpses
This is our day of corruption
Oceans of sufferings are rise
Drink the plague pain, smell it again
Colour of the man eyes is like ice
Blood...consumed
Feel it, fell it, feel it...feel.
