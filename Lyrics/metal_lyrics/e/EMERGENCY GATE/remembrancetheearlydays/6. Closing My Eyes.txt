In a dark night, Iâm driving with my car
My heart is with you, but you are so far
I think about your pretty eyes,
But your heart is as cold as ice
When I see you I feel so right
I wanna be with you for all my life
For all my life...

I close my eyes
My heart kissing the sky
I love you
Itâs true, oh yeah itâs true...
But I donât wanna die
Without love and without you
No, I donât wanna die
Without love or without you

Let me take your hand
Letâs go to another land
Where the night is bright
And the stars seem to be your eyes
And the moon is going down,
Ashamed heâs giving you his crown
I beg you: always shine on me
Never leave me, never leave me be!
Never leave me be, oh no

I close my eyes
My heart kissing the sky
I love you
Itâs true, oh yeah itâs true...
But I donât wanna die
Without love and without you
No, I donât wanna die
Without love (oh without love) or without you

I close my eyes
My heart kissing the sky
I love you
Itâs true â oh yeah itâs true...
Itâs true â oh yeah itâs true...
But I donât wanna die
Without love and without you
(I wanna die without)
(I wanna die without you)
No, I donât wanna die
Without love and without you
I love you
No, I donât wanna die
Without love and without you

Oh I donât wanna die
Without love and without you
Oh I donât wanna die
Without love, without you
