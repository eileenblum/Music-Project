What can I do to solace you?
Itâs choking me, we died another time
Drown again in this desperate time
This broken way weâve chosen is too wide

I gave my word
I earned your heart
But thatâs not my absolution
I broke your neck
Your eyesight died
As my bride cries blood!

Breathe for me and let me know
That our life is not apart
Breathe from me and swallow life
âCause my heart beats still your name

In this life behind the blackness
Our daylight will soon arise
In this curse we will find anew
Together we will find anew

Breathe for me and let me know
That our life is not apart
Breathe from me and swallow life
âCause my heart beats still your name

What can I do to bring back life?
Donât will deny burying all your burdens

Lost in shame, a veil of lies
I broke the oath but I am still with you

When silence falls youâll hear my voice
A tender echo of your name

As my bride cries blood
I realized
I will die
