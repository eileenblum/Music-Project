Ashes and dust will be where we stand
Our lives decay in our hand
Itâs too late to turn our backs at the dawn
In the blink of an eye it will all be gone

You donât really know how this all started
Iâll show you exactly how it ends
In this very last moment
Youâll see on what your life depends

So you can run for shelter in this barren land
But you wonât come so far âtil man exists no more

Useless landmarks of your cities
All your former gods are faint
An eye for an eye only ends
In making the whole world blind

You donât really know how this all started
Iâll show you exactly how it ends
In this very last moment
Before mankind descends

So you can run for shelter in this forsaken land
You can curse your wealth and your wish for strength
You will try to escape your self-inflicted construct
But you wonât come so far âtil man exists no more

But this is no longer Eden
This is the new garden
Now you have to go and I can no longer wait

So you can run for shelter in this wasted land
In this wasted world, in your wasted heart
Take one last gasp for one last scream
But you wonât come so far âtil man exists no more
