You look at me like itâs my fault to fall out of line
I wasnât blessed with four of a kind
Canât you try to understand what it feels like
To never get to know how it feels right?

Itâs fuckinâ cold inside
Why donât you feel alive?

Am I already dead?
Am I already dead?

Wearing a mask
Covering my mind
Leaving you blind
Too blind to identify me
To hear me, to see
To understand and to feel me

Am I my very own psycholeptic nemesis?
Iâm getting sick and tired of this shit
Can you tell me? Am I the only one?
Who can see the dark side of the sun?

Wearing a mask
Covering my mind
Leaving you blind
Too blind to identify me
To hear me, to see
To understand and to feel me

Wake up in a sea of sweat
Take off âcause it will suck you back
To the dark side of the sun
It ends before it even has begun
Wake up in a sea of sweat
Take off âcause it will suck you back
To the dark side of the sun
It ends before it even has begun

Itâs fuckinâ cold inside
Why donât you feel alive?

Am I already dead?
Am I already dead?

Wearing a mask
Covering my mind
Leaving you blind
Too blind to identify me
To hear me, to see
To understand and to feel me

Wearing a mask
Covering my mind
Leaving you blind
Too blind to identify me
To hear me, to see
To understand and to feel me
