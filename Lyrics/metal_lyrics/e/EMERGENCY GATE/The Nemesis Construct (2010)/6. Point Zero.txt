Save me
Find me
Save me
Or speak to me

You tried to stop me in my darkest hour
I donât consider no more
The reckoning of those consequences
You tried so much to save me once more
A veil of fog
The only thing I saw and nothing more

Oh fuck that shit
Hear me scream:

Save me, find me
When Iâm down and lost at all
Speak to me and hold me
You will never find a guard like me!

Come rape me once more
Come and stab me again
I bless myself to suffer all my burden
Fear my world behind
I burn the mask youâve worn
To strike the end of games
As time has gone by

Oh fuck that shit
Hear me scream:

Save me, find me
When Iâm down and lost at all
Speak to me and hold me
You will never find a guard like me!

I scrambled out of the grave of life
And crowned the fate of my misery
And fled from the shadow of mine
I will never regret, I will never forget
All the time that we had
You stabbed a knife in my back
Tore my heart out my chest
I bent down to my knees
And now Iâm coming back!

When Iâm down and lost at all
Speak to me and hold me
You will never find a guard like me
Save me, find me
You will never find a guard like me
Save me, find me
Speak to me

Save me, find me
Speak to me
