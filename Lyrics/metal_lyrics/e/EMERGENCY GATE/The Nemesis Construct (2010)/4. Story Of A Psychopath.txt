Destroy everything different from you
End up in solitude, presets of being
Drowned in words and fears
The image of feeling slowly disappears

Before!
Before!
Before itâs all over!
Before!
Before!
Before itâs all over!

Before itâs all over
Before we shake hands
The world will be covered in sand

As soon as you throw all your pride aside
Youâll be unchained and let loose into life

Narrow your mind down to the ground
Regret is fucking futile
Replay, rewrite, erase the soul
Possess, process, lose all control

Before itâs all over
Before we shake hands
The world will be covered in sand

As soon as you throw all your pride aside
Youâll be unchained and let loose into life

Narrow your mind down to the ground
Regret is fucking futile
Replay, rewrite
Erase the soul

Before itâs all over
Before we shake hands
The world will be covered in sand

Before itâs all over
Before we shake hands
The world will be covered in sand

As soon as you throw all your pride aside
Youâll be unchained and let loose into life
