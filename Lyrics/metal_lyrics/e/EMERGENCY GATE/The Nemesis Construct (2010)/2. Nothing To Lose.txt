You break down
Down to the floor
You black out
Lose all control
You give up
Once and for all
The higher you climb
The deeper you fall!

The deeper you fall!

Youâre the victim 24/7
A conspiracy like 9/11
About to take âem down any second

As time keeps passing by
You slowly realize
No compromise
You got nothing to lose

Youâre sick of this life in a trashcan
Now the Apocalypse is part of your plan
So many reasons but no reason at all
The higher you climb
The deeper you fall

The deeper you fall!

See me, hear me
Feel the insanity
Forget reality
Say goodbye and follow me!

... and follow me!

Youâre the victim 24/7
A conspiracy like 9/11
About to take âem down any second

As time keeps passing by
You slowly realize
No compromise
You got nothing to lose

As time keeps passing by
You slowly realize
No compromise
You got nothing to lose

Youâre the victim 24/7
A conspiracy like 9/11
About to take âem down any second

Youâre the victim 24/7
A conspiracy like 9/11
About to take âem down any second
