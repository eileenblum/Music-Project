You always think I am, I am the one to bear the blame
But you donât even admit youâre the leader of the shame
I canât tell you how much I hate you right now
I hope youâll find out, someday, somehow

You showed me that all my deeds where in vain
I offered my life, my thoughts, my fear
I walked back to the roots of this hell
To freak out myself

Did you ever know whatâs right or wrong?
I wish that I could fly out of hell
And from destinyâs fall

How could Iâve been so blind?
Cheated from behind
Youâve always been with her
You told me youâve been nowhere

I gave you all I had but it seemed not to be enough
âCause you were drunken like times before
All you do is treating, treating me roughly, abject
Do you feel, do you feel a belonging anymore?
...anymore?

You taught me how to hate you
I admit you taught me well
But Iâm tired of hating you

How could Iâve been so blind?
Cheated from behind
Youâve always been with her
You told me youâve been nowhere

You taught me how to hate you
I admit you taught me well
But Iâm tired of hating you
âCause I have enough of going through hell

âCause I have enough of going through hell
Of going through hell

You always think I am, I am the one to bear the blame
But you donât even admit youâre the leader of the shame
I canât tell you how much I hate you right now
I hope youâll find out, someday, somehow

How could Iâve been so blind?
Cheated from behind
Youâve always been with her
You told me youâve been nowhere
Nowhere!
