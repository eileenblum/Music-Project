Seen it all before
Too many times it repeats itself
Again and again
I feel it strong
Stronger than before
My hate grows more and more

Far too long we walked in this direction
This time, this time Iâm gonna be the one
Get ready for the final destruction
This time, this time the one you made me become

Now all this fucking shit
Gives me no choice
Inside my head a silent voice
I canât take it no more
My hate grows more and more

Far too long we walked in this direction
This time, this time Iâm gonna be the one
Get ready for the final destruction
This time, this time the one you made me become

In this world ruled by violence and lust
You can only be betrayed by the people you trust
In this world overflown by disgust
You canât only be betrayed by the people you trust

In this world ruled by violence and lust
You can only be betrayed by the people you trust
In this world overflown by disgust
You canât only be betrayed by the people you trust

Fucking slut!
Youâre lying there
You reach out for my hand
But I donât care
How can you dare?
You fucking whore
My hate grows more and more...

Far too long we walked in this direction
This time, this time Iâm gonna be the one
Get ready for the final destruction
This time, this time the one you made me become
