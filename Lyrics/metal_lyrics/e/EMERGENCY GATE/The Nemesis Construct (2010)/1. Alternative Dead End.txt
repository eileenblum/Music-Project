I am the one whoâll never see the fire
I am your pain and your last sin
How can I live with all my fatal failures?
In this broken world covered in shards

This is the end of all my dreams
I canât reject them!
This is the end of all my hopes

I have no regrets

No more broken hearts
No more waiting and bleeding

This is the end of all my dreams
I canât reject them!
This is the end of all my hopes

This is the end
This is the end

I am the one whoâll never see the fire
I am your pain and your last sin
How can I live with all my fatal failures?
In this broken world covered in shards

I have no regrets

This is the end of all my dreams
I canât reject them!
This is the end of all my hopes

Enter your dead end now!

No more broken hearts
No more waiting and bleeding

I am the one whoâll never see the fire
I am your pain and your last sin
How can I live with all my fatal failures?
In this broken world covered in shards
