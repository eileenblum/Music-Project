This civilization walks world downstairs
The last time with honour
I see your face again

Our world escapes!

We always receive the storm of creed
How can we live without?
And how can I dare your eyes again?
To trace me into my dreams

Our world escapes!

What can we do when this worldâs coming down?
And life is teasing us
Lay down on my grave, a final breath
I know itâs my blame!

Our world escapes!

This civilization walks three ways down
The last time with honesty
I see your face again

We always receive the storm of creed
How can we live without?
And how can I dare your eyes again?
To trace me into my dreams

Our world escapes
Our world has now escaped for you
Our world has now escaped
Our world has now escaped for you

Our world has now escaped...
