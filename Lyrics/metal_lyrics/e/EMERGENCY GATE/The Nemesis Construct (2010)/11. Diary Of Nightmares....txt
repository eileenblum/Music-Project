Welcome to hell...

Oh, dear betrayer
I hope youâre burning well in hell
Caress my word and let me see
What you can endure
Another thought, another day
Another bleeding way
Referred to as route âSick Sick Sickâ to hell
For those who walk behind me
Welcome to an obscure world

Where would you draw the line?
When you are gone so far
Speak my name again and I will fuck you all!

Welcome to hell...

And we are sparking the fire
And weâre beside to see you fall
And we stand tall in the riot
Sneaking up on you to break your neck
Break your neck

To see you fall
To break your neck
To see you fall
To break your neck

I show no mercy and show no fear
But fear my thoughts when I play this final game
I am prepared for every move thatâs coming out
Of your invalid brain
But there is nothing to regret
And there is nothing to forgive
âCause I will never forget that shit
And youâre merciless
Oh dear, itâs time to pay for pain

Where would you draw the line?
When you are gone so far
Speak my name again and I will fuck you all!

And we are sparking the fire
And weâre beside to see you fall
And we stand tall in the riot
Sneaking up on you to break your neck
To break your neck

Where would you draw the line?
When you are gone so far
Speak my name again!
