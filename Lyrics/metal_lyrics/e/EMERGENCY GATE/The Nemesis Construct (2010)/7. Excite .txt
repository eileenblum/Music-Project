This place feels like a dump
And youâre the garbage man
You hate your fucked up life
Shut up and listen:

Every man is a damn fool for at least
24 hours every day
The meaning of lifeâs to live a life of meaning
Thatâs what they say

I donât know where youâre planning to go
But for me itâs not too late to let you know

Feel your life
A fire burns inside you
Stand and fight
Donât let them take you down
Itâs alright
You can do it if you try
Enjoy every single second of your life
Before you die!

Take a deep breath from inside
Stop feeling incomplete
You can walk down a million ways
But you chose the dead end street

You donât know where youâre planning to go
But for me itâs not too late to let you know

Feel your life
A fire burns inside you
Stand and fight
Donât let them take you down
Itâs alright
You can do it if you try
Enjoy every single second of your life
Before you die!

Come on and feel your life
Excite! Discover the beauty deep inside
So bright! Nothing more to say
Just feel your life
Excite! Discover the beauty deep inside
So bright! Feel your life

This place feels like a dump
