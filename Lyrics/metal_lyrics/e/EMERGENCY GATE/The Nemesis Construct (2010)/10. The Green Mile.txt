Iâve been down just for a while
Close my eyes and I am far away
So far away from myself
Take a breath and realize
Iâm too weak and hiding far away
Far away behind my mask

Am I forsaken?
Am I a coward?
Am I a laughter?
All I ever wanted is no more pain
Just a little more brave
Oh, blame, let me be the one...

Have you ever known what itâs like to be?
To bury all mistakes and prejudices

And when I exceed the line
I admit Iâve lost control
No amnesty for daunting and frightening you again

Reprieve me before Iâm adjudged
And save me before I fall
I know Iâm lost
Donât judge me by my masquerade

Have you ever known what itâs like to be?
To bury all mistakes and fuck you

In this time of need youâre gone
It canât rain all the time
Iâll have to stay
Iâll have to die
That I am sure

I have no illusions of immortality
I will await my death
Long before death finds me

I canât recall anything from yester-night
Just a broken bottle right beside my empty bed
My forsaken life is just a broken hell
Insanity is hard to tell

And when I exceed the line
I admit Iâve lost control
No amnesty for daunting and frightening you once again

We each owe a death
There are no exceptions
But sometimes the green mile seems so long
