Wake up in the early mornin'
Something's kinda wrong today
Got no reason to seek shelter
I took a look around in my world
And I saw those empty minds
They stare on me from high above

Pain and emptiness - staring black eyes
Helped me on my misty ways
Walkin' alone - overflowing sorrow
I finished with everything I know

There's no sunshine and no rain
Neither you can hide nor go away
Another day nowhere
These puppets took me by my hand

Another day nowhere

So relax with eyes wide open
Lemme show you a bit around
See the suffer in these grey walls of pain
Look out for those empty minds

Don't know how long I've been sittin'
Seein' visions on the walls
Maybe since the whole beginnin' of time
Anger's gone - only see them smilin'
Like empty puppets with empty eyes

There's no sunshine and no rain
Neither you can hide nor go away
Another day nowhere
These puppets took me by my hand
