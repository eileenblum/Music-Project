I won't bend
I will break
Live or die
That's my fate

I won't lie
Ain't no fake
Not a word
That I could rape

I'll spit... you love to swallow
No matter what... I won't follow

I won't kneel
I will kill
If I bleed
Then you spill

I won't die
I will thrill
Until your mind
Is really ill

I love to spit... you love to swallow
I love to spit... I won't follow

I'll spit... you love to swallow
No matter what... I won't follow

I will break
Ain't no fake
I will kill
I'm a thrill
