The years have fallen
I know my time has come
As I walk the streets alone
Into the rising sun

The devil and the darkness
Always follow me
Dark lightning covers all the sun
You're just too blind
Just too blind to see - what I need

And if I catch you in my dreams
I'll leave everything behind
It's much more real than it seems

And if I catch you in my dreams
And you heal my aching heart
Torn apart 'cause you are far away

Every second... I thought of you
Why don't you take my hand and let my love come true
Give me one reason why not to go insane
My heart is burning... my blood - boiling in my veins

And if I catch you in my dreams
I'll leave everything behind
It's much more real than it seems

And if I catch you in my dreams
And you heal my aching heart
Torn apart 'cause you are far away
