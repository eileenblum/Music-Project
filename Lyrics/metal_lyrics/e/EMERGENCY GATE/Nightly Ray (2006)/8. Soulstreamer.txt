Souls cuttin' outta my flesh
Stars cover my body
As they fall down to ash ...
Like lemmings they fade

I'm a soulstreamer
I'll drown your world in my blood
I'm a soulstreamer
I'll drown your world in my flood
I'm a soulstreamer
I'll drown your world

They're all guzzled away
Just raped and emptied and thrown away
They're all sacred with frost
Of your greedy rush for lust

But I was born stubborn

They're all guzzled away
Just raped and emptied and thrown away
They're all sacred with frost
Of your greedy rush for lust

Souls cuttin' outta my flesh
The flood will drown your world
Raping your lust to ash

I'm a soulstreamer
I'll drown your world in my flood
I'm a soulstreamer
In my pain, in my cries, in my mood
I'm a soulstreamer
I'll drown your world in my flood
I'm a soulstreamer
I'll drown your world in my blood
... drown your world in my blood!
