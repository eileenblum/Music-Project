As I'm watching the rain
Washin' the world
Trying to think about the things I've thrown away
Walkin' the streets towards a dead end

Spreadin' my thoughts but still see your smile
Shining through this cold white night on me I reach
Into the dark trying to feel you ...

Once again

I look and I see
I sin and I'll be
But never drowned in shame

As I face time
The hold in your arms
I'll always call your name

In your eyes - still I can see
Myself deeply sinkin' - free me with your touch
Just don't ask and please don't turn away

I will break all those dark and scary
Tombstones of tomorrow
Bring me light
Carry the storms away ...

Once again

I look and I see
I sin and I'll be
But never drowned in shame

As I face time
The hold in your arms
I'll always call your name
