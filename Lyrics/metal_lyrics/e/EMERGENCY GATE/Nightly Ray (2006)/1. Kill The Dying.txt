I wanna see the crimson tears
I wanna watch 'em running
Running down their skin
See pain and fear crawling

They imprison their souls in their closed down minds
I just can't find a compromise... no

I wanna kill the dying
Blast 'em off their rotten path
I wanna cease the lying
I wanna hunt 'em all to death

I wanna see their eyes reflecting fear
Feel how they're freezing
Their hearts and bones to stone
I would be pleased to watch 'em ceasing

They imprison their souls in their closed down minds
I just can't find a compromise . no

I wanna kill the dying
Blast 'em off their rotten path
Cease the lying
I wanna hunt 'em all to death

It's all their fault

Kill the dying
Blast 'em off their rotten path
Cease the lying
I wanna hunt 'em all to death

It's all their fault
