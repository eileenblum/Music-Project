Where is my private ground
You say every ground is yours
Where can I hide and mind my private issues
Where can I self-express
I think I'm goin' insane
And the wave goes bashing again

Save the world from us - breed evil again
You call me virus while makin' me sick again
I spit on your law - I'll break again
And again and again... again

How can I love to be...
Your forces breed hate
How can I make you stop to wanna-rule my fate
Could you like to be fucked up...
By me and my friends
And the wave goes bashing again

Save the world from us - breed evil again
You call me virus while makin' me sick again
I spit on your law - I'll break again
And again and again ... again

Now stop this bad games you play
We won't go away - we won't go away
Look at the world of today
We won't go away - we won't go away - now

And the wave goes bashin' again
