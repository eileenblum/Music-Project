Feeling like a freehand-line
In a system of patterns
Torturing my surrounding
By my innocent elegance

Dark is my throne of nightly shadows
Never too bright the candlelight
It's time for me to get those...
I ring in the world's last night

Fulminate on me
Full-faced and mean
Fulminate on me
I'll hunt you in your dreams

Feel my war-techs
I put a date on you... and you
I'll teach some whore-sex
To your virgin-crew

It's a dark dream of a darker side to see
It's a nightly ray of a blacker beam in me

Dark is my throne of nightly shadows
Never too bright the candlelight
It's time for me to get those...
I ring in the world's last night

Fulminate on me
Full-faced and mean
Fulminate on me
I'll hunt you in your dreams
