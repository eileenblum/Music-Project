Do we live to die
Do we love to cry
Do we pray
For allowance to obey

I see a blind mankind
Much too poor in mind
To see to hear or to find ... yeah

I don't wanna live without a crown
'cause I'm no clown
Get off my throne
I don't wanna play your games
So burn in flames
I play for my own

Some of you to love me
Some of you to hate me
Everyone of all
To talk 'bout me

Oh deny what you are
Just a perfect score
For the tyrant #1 ... me

I don't wanna live without a crown
'cause I'm no clown
Get off my throne
I don't wanna play your games
So burn in flames
I play for my own

Love me or hate me but know
I feel it more extreme than you

Love me or hate me but know
I feel it more intense than you

Love me or hate me but know
I feel it more extreme than you

I don't wanna live without a crown
'cause I'm no clown
Get off my throne
I don't wanna play your games
So burn in flames
I play for my own
