A look in the mirror
Makes me sure: I can hide
I got no way to
See through my own mask

Come look into my eyes
Just guess what's on my mind
Oh look into my eyes

My inside broke down
Sold it for a bigger crown
My inside broke down
Just sold it for a bigger crown

Come look into my eyes
Just guess what's on my mind
Oh look into my eyes

Watching the surface
As it bursts away
'cause there's nothing
Left inside worth hidin' away

My inside broke down
I sold it for a bigger crown
My inside broke down
Just sold it for a bigger crown

Broke down
