Time is just like water
Try to hold it in your hands
Be the one that understands
There's no vessel to stop time's sands

Sleepless - all these restless nights
I've crumbled down my throne
I'll step into the light
Now I'll never stand alone ... no

Hallucinating the future makes water turn to pearls
Smilingly I weep them into your night
The moonshine's silver curls make 'em glisten bright
They make 'em glisten bright

I'm the guardian of time
Day and night is mine

Can't you see my flame is burnin' away
Can't you see my candle meltin'
