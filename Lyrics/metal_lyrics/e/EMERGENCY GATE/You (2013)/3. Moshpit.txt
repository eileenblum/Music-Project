Let's get moshpit started
In a sea of 50'000 people
You just feel sweat
Another breath, another tension
The adrenaline runs through your veins

Closer â we wanna make you sick!
Crowd â let's form a moshpit!

A moshpit!

I wanna see the crowd diving
I wanna hear you scream:
In legion we stand
No matter who the fuck you are
In legion we stand
In legion we stand
It's time to gather once again
To fill the halls with hate
Come on now â it's your turn

Let's get moshpit started
Let's get moshpit started
Let's get moshpit started
A moshpit!

I wanna see the crowd diving
I wanna hear you scream:
In legion we stand
No matter who the fuck you are
In legion we stand
In legion we stand

One, two, one, two, three, four, go!
Come on and move your heads!

I wanna see the crowd diving
I wanna hear you scream:
In legion we stand
No matter who the fuck you are
In legion we stand
In legion we stand

A last time â a circle-pit
The bodies lost control
1-2-3 â more special moves
Let us quake the ground!

Closer â we wanna make you sick!
Crowd â let's form a moshpit!

A moshpit!
A moshpit!

Let's get moshpit started
Let's get moshpit started
