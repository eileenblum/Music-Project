Yeah

(Oh) all I ever wanted
Is to seed this life with life
United we stand and fall
And raise our fist again

No chance to turn around
Just walk the line
No escape to accomplish the purpose
I found cohesion and faith

And when they call
I will try to be there
(I will try to be there)
Stay by me
All this time
When I fall
You always takes desire
(Always takes desire)
Fly with me
Above the sky

Ooh, and as the years go by
I hope the story is never ending
I would vouch my life for you
I will follow you everywhere you go

Found me
In my darkest hour
Heal me
We are the Force United

And when they call
I will try to be there
(I will try to be there)
Stay by me
All this time
When I fall
You always takes desire
(Always takes desire)
Fly with me
Above the sky

Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly

And when they call
I will try to be there
(I will try to be there)
Stay by me
All this time
When I fall
You always takes desire
(Always takes desire)
Fly with me
Above the sky

(Oh) all I ever wanted
Is to seed this life with life
United we stand and fall
And raise our fist again
