I won't feel this pain again
I'll touch your soul
We have to try to avoid this
But life goes so

I know you're suffering
I know you're bleeding
I know that all my words can't help

In your times of need
I know you distrust me
Once you trusted me
A word to the wise

Lean on my words to see I know you
Lean on my words to feel
I'll always keep you safe
Open your mind and say I need you
Lean on my words to know
That you are here by my side (side)

It's comprehensible that it's hard
I'll try to share the burden
As long as you're satisfied
I try to carry on

It cannot be denied
It's hard to talk about
I fool myself
To try to be the strongest link

Oh, God, what's wrong with you?
Are you stray from the path of care?
Forgive me
I'm in doubt about your grace

But I see the light at the end
And we will fly again
I can see that there's an end
Of heart-aching

Lean on my words to see I know you
Lean on my words to feel
I'll always keep you safe
Open your mind and say I need you
Lean on my words to know
That you are here by my side
