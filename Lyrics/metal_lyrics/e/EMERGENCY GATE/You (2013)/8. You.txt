Tell me, how
Can something change your life
Within the blink of an eye
With a single lie?
I don't understand
I just don't understand

Tell me, how
Can something change your life
Within the blink of an eye
With a single lie?
I don't understand
I just don't understand

Hey, what's there to live for?
Don't wanna play and lose
Don't wanna pay my dues
Don't wanna feel abused
Hey, why should I forgive her?
Don't wanna be the fool
Don't wanna be the fool again

It's you
You make me wanna be far away
At another place
It's you
You keep a chain around my head
That I can't break

But I can break your neck
In a blind fury
I'm a savage
To you and me
I wanna break your neck
Bittersweet pleasure
I'm a savage
Maybe just for you

Tell me, how
Can something change your life
Within the blink of an eye
With a single lie?
I don't understand
I just don't understand

Hey, what's there to live for?
Don't wanna play and lose
Don't wanna pay my dues
Don't wanna feel abused
Hey, why should I forgive her?
Don't wanna be the fool
Don't wanna be the fool again

It's you
You make me wanna vomit
All over you
It's you
You told me you could never
Break your word

But I can break your neck
In a blind fury
I'm a savage
To you and me
I wanna break your neck
Bittersweet pleasure
I'm a savage
Maybe just for you
Just for you

Hey, what's there to live for?
Don't wanna play and lose
Don't wanna pay my dues
Don't wanna feel abused
Hey, why should I forgive her?
Don't wanna be the fool
Don't wanna be the fool again

Tell me, how
Can something change your life
Within the blink of an eye
With a single lie?
I don't understand
I just don't understand
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
