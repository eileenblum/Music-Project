Say goodbye
I'll take you to a better place
We will fight our way out
Leave your past behind
And take my hand
Together alone against the world

I convince myself again
To forgive, to forget
Offer them another chance
No remorse, no regret

And I find myself again
Betrayed and abused
They just blew another chance
Seems like it's just me and you

Come on
Let's burn the bridges behind us

Say goodbye
I'll take you to a better place
We will fight our way out
Leave your past behind
And take my hand
Together alone against the world

I damn well know I told you
But you know I lied
I know you fuckin' hate me
But you know I tried

Poor, wasted, and pathetic
That's me and no one gets it
You keep staring at me
Your eyes tear me apart

Come on
Let's burn the bridges behind us

Take my hand
My little blood-splatted angel
Why don't you just put a smile on your face?
(My little blood-splatted angel)
Take my hand
Put a smile on your face

Whoa

Here I am
Coming back for more
I've been down this road before
Back then you didn't stop me
And you won't stop me now
And you won't stop me now

Let's burn the bridges behind us

Say goodbye
I'll take you to a better place
We will fight our way out
Leave your past behind
And take my hand
Together alone against the world

Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye

And you won't stop me now
