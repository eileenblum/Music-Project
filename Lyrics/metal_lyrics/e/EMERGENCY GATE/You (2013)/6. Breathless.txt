I'll keep all my faith
And open my book
I will find you when you're down and out
Call out my name
And walk down the line
You will find me when you're down and out

I don't know how it feels
I can feel,
When it's over and out

I can breathe, no more alone
I can feel when you break down on your knees
I still fall, I still call
I keep running and running so far

I try to be strong
To be the strong side

But there's nothing in it for you
We have to be there
And carry on
In this times of feels and needs

I am breathless now
Follow my screams and shouts
Trust me my sweetest queen!

For all my words I've lost
Beware the faith I've lost
Show me the white line
C'mon baby - take my hand
