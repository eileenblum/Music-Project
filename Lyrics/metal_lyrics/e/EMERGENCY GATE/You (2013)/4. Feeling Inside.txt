Have you ever been sure of something
Just because you felt it?
Have you ever had that feeling inside you
And you just couldn't figure out why?

You are not the only one
Believe me you're not the only one

A feeling inside me comes to life
Part of me getting sober
Let the conscience take over
A feeling that blinds me, can't defy
Have just one more
And drain the pain

(Forever mistaken)
(Forever alone)
But now I'm starting the war

A feeling inside me comes to life
Part of me getting sober
Let the conscience take over
A feeling that blinds me, can't defy
Have just one more
And drain the pain

Something's wrong
Your body's telling you the truth
That feeling
You're being abused

Rely on emotions
Neglect to be sure
Denying devotions
Oblivion's the cure

You are not the only one
Believe me you're not the only one

A feeling inside me comes to life
A feeling inside me cold as ice

A feeling inside me comes to life
Part of me getting sober
Let the conscience take over
A feeling that blinds me, can't defy
Have just one more
And drain the pain
