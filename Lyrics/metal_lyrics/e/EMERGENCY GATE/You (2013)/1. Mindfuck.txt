Find yourself totally wasted
In your self-created cage
Your dreams are slowly taking
Over your reality

Somebody
Help me get out of this construct
Somebody
Mindfuck, mindfuck
Mindfuck

The walls are closing in
You wanna run away
You wanna run away
Hear the voices from within
You are here to stay, stay

I hope they pray for your soul
(I hope they pray for you)
I hope they pray for you

Yeah

Here we go again
Kill yourself once more tonight
Enjoy the poisoned flavor
Rushing through your mind

Somebody
Help me get out of this construct
Somebody
Get me out of this mindfuck

The walls are closing in
You wanna run away
You wanna run away
Hear the voices from within
You are here to stay (stay)

I hope they pray for your soul
(I hope they pray for you)
I hope they pray for you

The walls are closing in
You wanna run away
You wanna run away
Hear the voices from within
You are here to stay

I hope they pray for your soul
(I hope they pray for you)
I hope they pray for you
