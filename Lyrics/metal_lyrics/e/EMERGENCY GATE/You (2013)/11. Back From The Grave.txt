You rape my heart, I give a shit
You wrap an angel on my pain
Look in my eyes and you see hell
And I hope you're burning well

Don't tell me shit, don't tell me lies
Don't try to give me any advice
You could look into my eyes
And feel the hate

Don't teach me what I have to do
Don't teach me how I have to speak
I am the reason
You're feeling weak

I have to walk my way alone
Was a man before you were born
I know my way, I know it's right
I'll do it also when I fight
I have to walk my way alone
I am here and you are gone
You will regret you're choosing hell
And I hope you're burning well

Am I the reason for your hollow dreams?
But this is only how it seems
I have to reach my aim
It doesn't matter if you walk alone

So fuck you and go away
There's no reason why I have to stay
And I don't want
To be with you
It's sad but true

You will look up to me and see
You'll lose and have to agree
You will try to carry on
You'll wish that I was never gone

You will look up to me
You'll see that I have won

You rape my heart, I give a shit
You wrap an angel on my pain
Look in my eyes and you see hell
And I hope you're burning well

I have to walk my way alone
Was a man before you were born
I know my way, I know it's right
I'll do it also when I fight
I have to walk my way alone
I am here and you are gone
You will regret you're choosing hell
And I hope you're burning well
