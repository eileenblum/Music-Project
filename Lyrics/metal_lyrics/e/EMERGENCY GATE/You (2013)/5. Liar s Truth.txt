Oh

Yeah

Take control
And fear the fire burning in my heart
Lost control
In rage

Lost control
And listening to your sounds of ignorance
I'm your war
I'm the one

I'm the one who shows the truth
And sees the light
I'm
I'm ablaze

I'm the one who breaks the silence
When you sleep
I'm
I'm enraged

Fear my thoughts
I've been beaten up enough, now it's my turn
It's my time
For you

Be prepared
You can run and hide, whatever, I'll find
This is my reckoning

I'm your war
I'm your law
I break you down

I'm the one who shows the truth
And sees the light
I'm
I'm ablaze

I'm the one who breaks the silence
When you sleep
I'm
I'm enraged

Take control
And fear the fire burning in my heart
Lost control
In rage

Well, fuck you now
I am your nightmare when you're awake
Get what you
Get what you deserve

I'm enraged
Oh
