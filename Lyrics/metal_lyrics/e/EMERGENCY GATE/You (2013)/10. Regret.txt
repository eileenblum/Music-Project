(Come down, come down)
Take your time and take a breath
(Come down, don't rush)
Think again before you judge
(Then again this feeling hits me)
Drilled right into my brain
Can't control the situation
Boiling blood shoots through my veins

I gave my life to you
And you threw it away
You threw it all away
You put me through hell
That hell you put me through
But I would, but I would
But I would do it again

(So here I am)
All red up and ready to transgress
(I don't give a damn)
Last chance to turn around
And again this feeling hits me
Drilled right into my brain
Can't control the situation
Boiling blood shoots through your veins

I gave my life to you
And you threw it away
You threw it all away
You put me through hell
That hell you put me through
But I would, but I would
But I would do it again

I'd regret every second that I wasted on you
I'd regret every breath that I took for you
I'd regret every smile, every kiss, every touch
Shit, regret everything, but I can't

I gave my life to you
And you threw it away
Call me insane
But I would do it again

From now on
Trust no one
You will regret
From now on
Trust no one

I gave my life to you
And you threw it away
You threw it all away
You put me through hell
That hell you put me through
But I would, but I would
But I would (do it again)
Do it again
