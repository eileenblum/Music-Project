Apathy, a solution?
You chose the easy way
Federate! Revolution
To win the game they play

Degenerate the shred of life
Esteem will be no more
Humanity must die
It's what we're fighting for

[2x]
Remember, remember
The 5th of November
Remember, remember
Revolution

Living the dystopia
Like we've never had a choice
Walk down a road so long
And let them hear your voice

Revolution
Revolution

Your friends abuse them
Cover them in shame and dirt
Prepare for war
Kill the cancer of this world

Degenerate the shred of life
Esteem will be no more
Humanity must die
It's motherfucking terror

Remember, remember
The 5th of November
Remember, remember
Revolution
Remember, remember
The 5th of November
Remember, remember
Motherfucking revolution

Living the dystopia
Like we've never had a choice
Walk down a road so long
And let them hear your voice

Is it what you really think
Or what they want you to believe?
Is it what you really want?
Try to feel now what you felt then

Remember, remember
The 5th of November
Remember, remember
Revolution
