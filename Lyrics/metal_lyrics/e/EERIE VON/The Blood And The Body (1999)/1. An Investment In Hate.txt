A small investment in blood, such a small price to pay
Layin' down in the cellar for the last forty days

Light the colored candles, and bring rain to my grave
When you live inside a circle of salt, you're near the end of your days

A small investment in blood, such a small price to pay
Layin' down in a circle of salt for the last forty days

'Cause wide is the gate, so broad is the way
When you live inside a circle of blood, you make a great investment in hate
A great investment in hate

All the jealous husbands seek the end of their mates
Wide is the gate
All the faithless ladies seem to wither away
Layin' down inside their circle of thought, nearing the end of their days

So wide is the gate, and broad is the way
Wide is the gate, so broad is the way
Yes, wide is the gate, so broad is the way
When you live inside a circle of blood, you make a great investment in hate
A great investment in hate
A great investment in hate
A great investment in hate
A great investment in hate...
