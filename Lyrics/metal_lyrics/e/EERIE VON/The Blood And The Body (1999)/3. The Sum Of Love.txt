Tortured soul, you, you long for one
Greater than the sum of love
Gone forever is the morning sun
Can it be forever gone

She was lovely once, she was
So much greater than the sum of love
All the things I wanted most
Were much greater than the sum of love

Filled with pride, my life was lost
Denied the joy of the greater good
Lovely was the morning sun
So much greater than the sum of love

I could not search for what was lost
I had to turn my back and walk
Away from all I wanted most
Was much greater than the sum of love

Filled with pride, my life was gone
Denied the joy for the greater good
Lovely was the morning sun
So much greater than the sum of love
So much greater than the sum of love
So much greater than the sum of love
