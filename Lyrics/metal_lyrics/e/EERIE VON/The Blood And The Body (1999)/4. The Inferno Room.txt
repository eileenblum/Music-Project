She trembled like a virgin movin' toward her wedding bed
Stumbled down that hallway like the dawn of the dead
Crept in like a creature, tryin' to crawl right through your soul
She brought in a winter chill that stayed till she was gone
She knelt down to pray like she thought it might be
Something that she could hold over me

Now she crept in like a creature
So sweet you'd love to beat her
Fell down on her knees
Prayin' to the thieves that stole her soul
She was prayin' to the thieves that stole her soul
She brought in a winter chill that just stayed till she was gone

Now she trembled like a virgin movin' toward that wedding bed
Stumbled down the hall like the dawn of the dead
Crept in like a creature, tryin' to crawl right through your soul
She knelt down to pray like she thought it might be
Something that she could hold over me
