Unborn, a fresh young girl
Frail with the weight of the world
Already bent at the beauty of the night
Sent from heaven, unwanted on Earth
She brings her blessing wrapped in a curse
She was sent from heaven, to be unwanted on Earth

Her heart pounds its' terrible rhythm
One second of peace, she ain't gonna give them
Her wheel of misfortune spins 'round again
She's on you like the sun on the sand
Her wheel of misfortune spins your way again

Deep in her darkness lies her greatest fear
Beneath her ivory snow veneer
She promises to take you far away from here
Beneath her ivory snow veneer
Lies her greatest fear
Deep in her darkness, she can take you far away from here

Her heart pounds its' terrible rhythm
One second of peace, she ain't gonna give them
Her wheel of misfortune spins 'round again
She's on you like the sun on the sand
Her wheel of misfortune spins your way again

Her beauty burned right through my soul
Thought I would breathe once more
The search had ended there and now I'd be reborn
Like a pleasure ride through woman fair
I fell without a care
She promised me sanctuary but I found no salvation there

Her heart pounds its' terrible rhythm
One second of peace, she ain't gonna give them
Her wheel of misfortune spins 'round again
She's on you like the sun on the sand
Her wheel of misfortune spins your way again

Her wheel of misfortune spins 'round again
She's on you like the sun on the sand
Her wheel of misfortune spins your way again

She's got a tale, a tale to tell
That she's beautiful, beautiful as hell
Why did you lie, you lied to me
Like the promise of pleasure, never to be reached
Why did you lie, lie to me
Like the pleasure of a promise, never to be breached
She's got a tale, a tale to tell
That she's beautiful, beautiful as hell
She's got a tale, a tale to tell
That she's beautiful
