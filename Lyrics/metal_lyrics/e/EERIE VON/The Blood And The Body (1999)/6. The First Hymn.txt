And so I chose the night to be my dominion
Beauty, hope and joy all lay behind
All things good were no longer my companions
Buried with the soul that I let die

Then I sang the first hymn
And I filled a river red with blood
Drenched my whole world in sin
Left my city in dust

The few believers wanted to be picked
Praying to their God like some pious lunatics
Their sins were deadly, my lies, their truth
I opened up the gates and let them crawl through

To sing their first hymn
Filled their river with blood
Drenched their whole world in sin
Built their cities of dust
Drenched their whole world in sin
River red with blood
Built their cities of dust

I sang the first hymn
And I filled a river red with blood
Drenched my whole world in sin
Left my city in dust

I sang the first hymn
I filled a river red
I sang the first hymn
River red with blood

Once freedom came for me, and for my wearied soul
Prisoner of life I'd be no more
But the taste of blood had grown far too sweet
So I chose to walk the road that I was on

So I sang the next hymn
Filled a river with the death of love
And wallowed in my sin
Left my city in dust
Filled a river red with blood
Left my city in dust
