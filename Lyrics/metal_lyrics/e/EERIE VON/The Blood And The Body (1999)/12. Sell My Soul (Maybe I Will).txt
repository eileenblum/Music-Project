Trade my soul, I'd trade my soul
Give my like to that rock and roll
Down on my knees howlin' like a dog
Prayin' to my God, lookin' for the right road

Won't somebody hear my plea
Somebody help me please

Trade my soul, I'd trade my soul
Give my like to that rock and roll
Down on my knees howlin' like a dog
Prayin' to my God, lookin' for the right road

Trade my soul, yeah maybe I will
Sell my soul, yeah maybe I will
Trade my soul, maybe I will
Catch up with you in Robinsonville

Annie May's dad makes the white liquor
He's got a piano, a floor and a shack
You can stay all night long
Drink and pick out a song
Pick up a dollar if you pass the hat

Maybe I will
Sell my soul, yeah maybe I will
Catch up with you in Robinsonville
Sell my soul, maybe I will
Maybe I will

My neck hurts from throwin' it back so much
My back is twisted in knots from leanin' on my crutch
But I know somethin' that'll make me well
Just forward all my mail to Robinsonville

Maybe I will
Maybe I will
Catch up with you in Robinsonville
