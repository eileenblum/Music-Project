Now I am bound, I am caught
I am tied with a lover's knot
I am bound, caught, tied with a lover's knot
Like a fly, caught in your web
I could break free, or I could wait for death
I am bound, caught, tied with a lover's knot

Bound, caught, tied with a lover's knot

I walked in, to that room
And I fell under the spell of her perfume
And I got lost with that lover's knot

Can't break away
And here I'm gonna stay
Caught in that lover's knot
One day soon, she might let me be
Maybe one day soon, she'll let me break free
Till then I'm bound, I am caught, tied with that lover's knot

Won't someone show me the way
And one day I will be gone
She promised me everything
And she gave it to me
Bound, caught, tied with that lover's knot
I am bound, I am caught, tied with that lover's knot
