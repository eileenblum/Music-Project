Half of me wants to find religion
The other half of me says no
Half of me needs to find a rhyme and a reason
The other half just don't know what for

How can I ever be, all I'm ever gonna be
When half of me wants to be good
When half of me wants to be good

Half of me wants to taste the blood and the body
The other half still has some doubts
Half of me wants to walk the road to salvation
And the other half wants to go south

How can I ever be, all I'm ever gonna be
When half of me wants to be good
How will I ever see, all I'm ever gonna be
When half of me wants to be good

Half of me wants to find religion
But I didn't know it was lost
Half of me wants to burn down the mission
And make off with the poorbox

Half of me wants to be, something I may never be
And half of me knows who's at fault
How will I ever be, all I'm ever gonna be
When half of me wants to be good

Half of me wants to go down the right road
And half of me wants to go wrong
Half of me feels like a goddamned savior
Who only needs a good nail to get crossed

How will I ever be, all I'm ever gonna be
When half of me wants to be good
How will I ever see, all I'm ever gonna be
When half of me wants to be good
When half of me wants to be good
When half of me wants to be good

I don't wanna be good...
