What's the count Jack?

I long for peace of mind
Tortured and thrilled at the same time
Betrayed by a bitch and her kiss
Wait until they get a good look at this

What's the count Jack?
What's the count Jack?
What's the count Jack?
What's the count Jack?
What's the count Jack?
What's the count Jack?

I knock on wood just for luck
The death of hope down a dark alley block
Relieved by the knife left in her back
So ask yourself now, what's the count Jack?

What's the count Jack?

Here's a hook to hang your guilt upon
I left you two rings, two cents, and two combs
All of you fooled by the rapture of man
Ask yourself now, what's the count my friend?

What's the count Jack?
What's the count Jack?
What's the count Jack?

To rip the bitch wide and crawl inside
My heart leaps out into the night
And so the thrill left a mark on her back
So ask yourself now, what's the count Jack?

Here's a hook to hang your guilt upon
I left you two rings, two cents, and two combs
All of you fooled by the rapture of man
What's the count my friend?

Two rings, two cents, and two combs
Here's a hook to hang your guilt upon
All of you fooled by the rapture of man
Ask yourself now, what's the count my friend?

What's the count Jack?
