[Lyrics: Jonathan McCanless]

Lying on a stretcher
barely clinging to life
your body is broken
your mind is weak
stricken by the disease

The Doctor's Verdict is in
A chemically induced slow death
excruciating pain you will endure
Poison is their cure

Experiencing Euphoric high
Chemicals have made it inside
Complete Disarray
Increased toxic state
vital systems deteriorate
Pleasurable agonizing death
bones break from the strain
injections increase prolonged misery
Drug dependency

Self mutilation, amputation, bones have been removed
searing pain, Injected again, relief comes with a price
Brain stem severed, life is ending the organs start to shut down

Come back it's not too late
The practice waits by the gate
Come back there isn't much time
Choose death or hell on earth
Come back it's not too late
The practice waits by the gate
Come back You're dead
live life with us again
give us your life again

Give us your life
give us youlife
give us your life again
