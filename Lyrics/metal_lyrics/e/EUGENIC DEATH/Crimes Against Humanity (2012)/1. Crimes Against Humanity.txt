[Lyrics: Jonathan McCanless]

Expendable human beings
easily reproduced
take who you will and have your fill
implementations to choose

Hanging, drowning
watch as they fight for air

burning, boiling alive
separation of flesh from bone

fearful societies
accepting the ways of the cross
trust in our god, or be branded with irons
the lord is on our side

Temples, destroyed
The ways of old forever lost
Torture, conversion by force
fall to your knees, and pray

Crimes against Humanity
disregard for human life
Crimes against Humanity
there's no wrong nor right
Crimes against Humanity
there's no way we'll be stopped
we're above the law

Inquisition tactics approved
mutilate til there's nothing left
no one is exempt
women, children, the devil has their soul
strappado, gravity attack
Tendons snap as bones start to crack

Iron maiden, Claws of death
make your confession, breathe your last breath

Trial by cruel ordeals
if you live through the test we will set you free
collapse from agony, the evidence we need to prove you're a witch
Impalement, lacerations
no chance for survival, the end's drawing near
Anguish, exhaustion
time has come burn her at the stake

Crimes against Humanity
disregard for human life
Crimes against Humanity
there's no wrong nor right
Crimes against Humanity
there's no way we'll be stopped
Crimes against Humanity
we're above the law
