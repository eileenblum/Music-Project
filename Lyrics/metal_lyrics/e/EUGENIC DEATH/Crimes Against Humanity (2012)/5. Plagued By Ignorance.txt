[Lyrics: Jonathan McCanless]

Brain washing a population
Trapped in a dream
insidious machines
Dictate reality
Evolution placed on hold
Degeneration overload
Mentally decayed the brain withers away
Annihilating a population plagued by ignorance
the military stands by
fire fills the sky
all you had to do was look
alittle common sense it took
the signs were plain to see
future catastrophe
Think for yourself!
Defy ignorance
Think for yourself
Escape
Think for yourself
Defying disgrace
Think for yourself
Defy Death

Human control experiments
self mutilation, shock therapy
Digital codes hypnotize
Destroying the mind, Entertaining Disguise
surgical tools cut through the brain
young girl cries out in pain
innocence is no excuse
data stored for future use.
