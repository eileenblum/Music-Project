[Lyrics: Keith Davis]

The new american order
They're taking away our rights
slowly but surely the end is in their sights
They've locked us up like sheep
now we're in too deep
Believe what you see and be led into dismay

Believe what you see
and think none the less
They tell you what you want to hear
make you believe they'll do their best

It's self proclaimed society
open up and take it in
Indictive deity is where it all begins

Why they want us to die
don't you know it's global homicide
you've got to learn it's up to you and I
So it's our fate to decide

Power determination
death is devastation
come to realization
elite conspiration

The medicare is gone
your money has no worth
they're just bathing in their riches
boasting all their mirth
homes are being taken
taxes will rise higher
wars will be declared
uncontrolled like wild fire

Presidential superstars
maybe on your side
but once they're put in office
you're taken for a ride
nothing you can do when this takes hold
Defy, deny, take charge against
let revolution unfold
