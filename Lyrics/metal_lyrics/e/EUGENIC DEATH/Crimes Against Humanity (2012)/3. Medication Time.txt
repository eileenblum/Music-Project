[Lyrics: Jonathan McCanless]

chemical lobotomies
controls abnormalities
destroying realities
your perception is what they need
They say your problem's real
that's why you need this pill
misinformation they instill
corruption now revealed
chorus
you've got problems
they will treat you
step inside
Medication time

Feeling alittle depressed?
Are you feeling alittle distressed?
Put our products to the test
Just ignore the side effects
Doing just as your told
pharmaceuticals taking hold
Brain function starts to slow
Intelligent life form now a drone
You've got problems
they will treat you
Step inside
Medication time [3x]

fabricating mental disease
The public they deceive
extinguish humanity
Eugenic Death misanthropy
standing next in line
Open up your eyes
those before you have died
chemical warfare genocide
You've got problems
they will kill you
step inside
Medication time
