A storm is waiting
this will be the longest time
for Human kind

Truth will come over us
and only those who can bear it
will survive

The earth shall be a total desert
when wisdom came
there is no peace

Closed eyes will be open to see
what is real

A new philosophical thunder rise
and a new age will follow
