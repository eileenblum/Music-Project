Seeping from the depths of earth
The great evil began it's birth
Within it's hollow shell resides a surreal hell
Fearsome, unrelenting, apocalyptic plague expires

Towering Spire, ominous and fierce
In the hearts of men great fear doth pierce

Mother Earth betrayed by her precious children
Mother War enslaved, Man slays his own brethren
A cleansing is required, the consequences dire
Suffer Eternity
With Evil Born Of Boiling Seas

Blood lust, malevolent in it's core
Once the first knife is swung
They all want some more

The first life is taken
Their false morals, forsake them
Once the first knife is sung,
They cannot wait for more

Airborne, there's no escape
Once inhaled your will is raped
They convulse, they suffer anguish
They emerge in states of languish

Condemned to end it all
As swift as it began
This fragile race will fall
By its own possessed hand

Tonight shall be remembered
By families dismembered
Limb from limb, like father like son
No prayer to God, his will be done

On this eve of man's reckoning
Salvation lies there beckoning
Wipe the knife and start anew
Before some one kills you too

This race will fall

Towering Spire, ominous and fierce
In the hearts of men great fear doth pierce

Mother Earth betrayed by her precious children
Mother War enslaved, Man slays his own brethren
A cleansing is required, the consequences dire
Burn for Eternity
With Evil Born Of Boiling Seas
