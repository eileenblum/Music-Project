I have fought against you
Against the plague
That which infects me
Of definition so vague

Wreaking havoc on my conscience
It's revolting inside of my mind
A hive construed of hatred blind

Defiling habit
Twisted emotion
Dopamine in excess
A hell on earth

Unto a world of suffering I am bound
My bed is dug six feet into the ground
One man's love is another man's fear
The damage is done, your brains undone

I feel no passion anymore
The beauty of life,
Seems to have walked
Right through the door

Vivid images a thing of the past
Metaphysical decay was brought on oh so very fast

This condition leaves you Dehumanized
Schizofrantica
No cure, your life is Ionized
Schizofrantica

Defiling habit
Twisted emotion
Dopamine in excess
A hell on earth

Defiling habit
Twisted emotion
Dopamine in excess
A hell on earth

Wreaking havoc on my conscience
It's revolting inside of my mind
A hive construed of hatred blind

Unto a world of suffering I am bound
My bed is dug six feet into the ground
One man's love is another man's fear
The damage is done, your brains undone

I feel no passion anymore
The beauty of life,
Seems to have walked
Right through the door

Vivid images thing of the past
Metaphysical decay was brought on oh so very fast

This condition leaves you Dehumanized
Schizofrantica
No cure, your life is Ionized
Schizofrantica
