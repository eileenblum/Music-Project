Having fallen in a pit of despair
All loving emotions seeped out of this tear

A god of emptiness is all that is left
He thirsts for my love resorting to feeble theft

I Long
To create my own God
To Have
Freedom of expression
Unrestrained
In how I intend to acquire
Beliefs
That would make them purge me in fire

I see now what I must do
To offer a body
Belonging to my brood

Only in perturbing nature
Can I find true deity
With an act of hell's allure
Echoing my insanity

I run downstairs to my daughter's bed
I streak my hand down her precious head
I must now destroy that which that I have bred
and implant my seed of Him, The Immortal Dead

Thrusting, weeping, death
It nears, her dying breath

To father the antichristal father
Her trust in me I shall therefore slaughter
Unconditional love was all that she had
And now betrayed she's raped by her dad

Stabbing, slicing, death
I give her now her dying breath

Anointed In Incestuous Blood
Oh Malevolent One, I pledge my undying love

The Immortal:
I've been Anointed In Incestuous Blood
Yet with unrewarding pain his life I will flood
