Rotting in filth this race needs to be killed
Putrid beings, from my wrath there is no fleeing

Their Suffering is what I seek
No Salvation because God is Weak

I am the ultimate bringer of Death and Pain

Hacking carving, for their bloody flesh I am starving
To bring death, I am able in a way that was once thought fabled

I am the Harbinger, The Prophesied end of all Life

Now he suffers the loss, as he's nailed to the cross
Led astray is the human sheep
Leave his scriptures behind, in my they will find no redemption
God is Weak
Their minds I will twist, unholy mindset is bliss
Undone creation becomes so bleak
A new era will rise as I open their eyes to the truth:
God is Weak

I am the Harbinger, The Prophesied end of all Life

Their Suffering is what I seek
No Salvation because God is Weak

Led astray is the human sheep
Opened eyes to the truth that God is Weak
