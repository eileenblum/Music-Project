I was craving a midnight snack
I called my dog, unsuspecting my attack
He came to me, he sat on my lap
Then I broke his fucking neck

Cut the guts out, they're so lean
I eat them raw, I watch him bleed
Now to clean this bloody mess
Canine unpleasantness

He now rots in the lawn, doggy food for the plants
There are sun streaks in the sky now

Neatly
I pack the soil on his grave
I bet he wished that he'd behaved,
now he's decaying in a cave

Quickly
I put the shovel in the shed
wash off the flowers what he bled
the smell so pungent in my head

I was craving a midnight meal
I ate the dog and I'm still hungry, whats the deal?
I need some flesh to satisfy my need
so I guess it's my mother's time to bleed

I creep upstairs and my mouth is salivating
With all this sweat, You'd think I'm masturbating
I grab my knife, I hold it tight
Oh I'll rip her apart tonight

That carnage created and emancipated
The macabre hidden, unseen
My soul's definition, my life's premonition,
An Evisceration Matrine

With murder I further, plunge deeper into darkness
Embracing the unfurling madness

That carnage created and emancipated
The macabre hidden, unseen
My soul's definition, my life's premonition,
An Evisceration Matrine

I am bound to lust again for that wretched smell
Death: an acquired taste for smashing a skull into dust

Once ripped apart, I chewed on her heart
Where others would fear death, I feel the passion of a chef

The macabre unseen
Death, an acquired taste for death

That carnage created and emancipated
The macabre hidden, unseen
My soul's definition, my life's premonition,
An Evisceration Matrine

With murder I further, plunge deeper into darkness
Embracing the unfurling madness

Oh that carnage created and emancipated
The macabre hidden, unseen
My soul's definition, my life's premonition,
An Evisceration Matrine
