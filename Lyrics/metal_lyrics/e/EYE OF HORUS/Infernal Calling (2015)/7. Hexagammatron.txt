Come ye unfaithful servants 
The mark you bear, set you free 
Look to the sky and see nothing, 
That's right, tonight we feast 

The grave shall be known 
As the new stepping stone 
Forbidden words hold true 
Let his will embody you 

Hexagammatron 
In satan's name confide 
Hexagammatron 
Speak and end the Bible's lies 

Serve the unholy patron 
The protector of death 
When his unwavering strength Upon your temple brings 
The sheep lost in throes of worshiping 

The church shall be known 
As the devil's stepping stone 
Forbidden words hold true 
As the end's passed down by you 

In Satan's name confide 
Speak and end the Bible's lies 
In Satan's name defile 
Bring the era of the Vile 

And Death 

Domination over he who breathes 
In the thick black plumes 
Deliverance from the lies of Him 
Malevolence strewn on His demon Grin 

Wastelands at your feet 
The hovering sense of deceit 
Rejecting love with a fevered scowl 
Hear the hellhounds howl 

What fate awaits thee? 
With the Crimson Family 
Will He honor the contracts bound 
Or will you end up in the ground 

Hexagammatron 
In satan's name confide 
Hexagammatron 
Speak and end the Bible's lies 

Hexagammatron 
In Satan's name defile 
Hexagammatron 
Brings the era of the Vile 
And Death 

Domination over he who breathes 
In the thick black plumes 
Deliverance from the lies of Him 
Malevolence strewn on His demon Grin 

Wastelands at your feet 
The hovering sense of deceit 
Rejecting love with a fevered scowl 
Hear the hellhounds howl 

Sing, shout, chant these words 
May their echoes Black the sky 
Sing, shout, Scream these words 
Their cadence bestows Him with life 

Verbum Profanus 
Illicitus Vox 

Invito Daemonus 
Infernus Est Hic
