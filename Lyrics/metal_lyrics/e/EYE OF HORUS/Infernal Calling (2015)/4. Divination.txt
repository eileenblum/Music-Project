Keep hush the secrets of the grave 
Unsacred texts dictate how we behave 
Diabolic writing embroidered in our robes 
Join us, spread our society around the globe 

So what you ask is it that we do 
Through oracle bones divine what's true 
Acquiring a freshly severed head 
We boil off the flesh of course 
We respect the dead 

We lend techniques and ancient rites 
Conscription our congregation's plight 
Relinquishing salvation 
You'll join our cursed nation 
We will deliver what you seek 
This we guarantee 

Drop the skull in the ritual pyre 
The cracks reveal a muddled truth 
Purged through fire 
Invocation 
Of all knowledge past 
Divination 
Our binding spell we will cast 

Now payment let's discuss 
No reason to distrust 
We require a simple offering 
A miniscule amount of your suffering 
Such is the price 
Accept your fate you've rolled the dice 
So what you ask is it that we do 
Through oracle bones divine what's true 
Acquiring a freshly severed head 
Oh yes, now it's time to 

Drop the skull in the ritual pyre 
The cracks reveal a muddled truth 
Purged through fire 
Invocation 
Of all knowledge past 
Divination 
Our binding spell we will cast
