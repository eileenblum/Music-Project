Seething, scathing hatred for the flesh 
None could define why I wasn't like the rest 
In throes of lust, foaming at the mouth 
This yearning for some violence will end my penile drought 

Run, I live for hunt 
Hard, I will stab and pump 
Deep, in your fucking cunt 
Sliced in two, I'll come for you 

Raped in half 
No one hears your epitaph 

Raped in Half, 
All alone you're 
Raped In Half 

Now genders reversed as I crave some rectal flesh 
A full grown man, strong and swift will prove to be a test 
Masterfully tracked, in an alleyway he's trapped 
No match to the saw and a bullet to the chest 

Run, I live for hunt 
Hard, I will stab and pump 
Deep, in your fucking ass 
Sliced in two 

Raped in half 
No one hears your epitaph 
Raped in Half, 
All alone you're 
Raped In Half 

Raped in Half, 
Violently you're 
Raped In Half
