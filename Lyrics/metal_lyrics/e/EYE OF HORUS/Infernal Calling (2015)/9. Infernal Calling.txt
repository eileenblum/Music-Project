Of black and foulest urge 
Of fellow man to purge 
Of wicked incantations 
And flesh of freshly birthed 

Find grace within the dark 
And bare Infernal mark 
Heed this Calling ever long 
Towards hellish flames embark 

Pledge your loyalty 
Serve the whims of cruel majesty 
Sinister cursed, the Son of the depraved 
Pleed and praise unholy creeds 

Carve into the skin 
The words of vice and sin 
As demonic ashes cleanse the soul 
Transcend elysian origin 

Black fire burns aloud 
Find solace in the Damning Vow 
As torsos of the dead are cleaved from severed heads 
And drag the pious down 

We aim to halt salvation 
With guidance from our Lord 
Leave hope in dissolution 
For this, he gives his word 
Unholy rapture drags your soul below 
The final penance bestowed 

As angels fall 
Heed the blackened Call 
Crucified, we'll make the Christians crawl 
Now go spread flame and dissonance 
Heed this Infernal Call 

Of black and foulest urge 
Of fellow man to purge 
Of wicked incantations 
And flesh of freshly birthed 

Find grace within the dark 
And bare Infernal mark 
Heed this Calling ever long 
Towards hellish flames we march
