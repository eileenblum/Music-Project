I am the answer 
That all have feared 
The Necromancer 
That draws you near 

To leave you weeping 
Destitute, of life 
Despair for aeons 
As I bathe in the afterlife 

All I know 
As I scour all prose 
The search for Infernal might 

I draw so close 
As The Bloodline Flows 
The descendant of Holy Light 
Shall soon die 

Hymns have sung false praises of your majesty for far too long 
The doctrine of the pedophile is all that you have wrought 
I offer sin, accept and we begin 
A life untainted by the wretched Vatican 

All I know 
As I scour all prose 
The search for infernal might 

I draw so close 
As The Bloodline Flows 
The Heir to the Throne of Light 
Shall be killed tonight 

Tonight, Oh righteous one, 
Thy will be done 
Tonight wallow in sheer Bliss 
As his timid lips soon death shall kiss 

Approaching all I wanted 
Encroaching counterpart 
Dissolving, melting, shredding 
Frail pieces of the heart 

Though never his decision 
To be the Nazarene 
A fitting crucifixion 
A fitting night to bleed 

Oh this hellish flesh 
Shall rise above the rest 
Deeper and Deeper I sink 
My cursed dagger within his chest 

With final breath 
His eyes meet mine 
With frigid death 
Inversion of Divine Birth 

Desecrating, Exterminating 
Dawn of a life most foul 
There's no escape, accept your fate 
I'm the God you won't forsake 

All I know 
As I scour all prose 
The search for infernal might 

I draw so close 
As The Bloodline Flows 
The Heir the Throne of Light 
Has Been killed tonight
