In 1962, tucked away from memory 
An institute in which a boy suffered utmost tragedy 

No one speaks about The Case of Arryn Jack 
Peculiar, unnatural, his mind twisted and black 

The world that he resides, misshapen and obscure 
An irony a child could be entranced with death's allure 

The night he walked the gardens and met a tall young man 
They talked for hours and hours before young Arryn left the lad 

The boy awoke, eager to converse, 
Peered into his friend's room 
The man had split his head in two, 
A horrific sight, though not the last 
Behold Death's point of view 

Caretaker, she makes his bed 
She caught a glimpse of his visage, 
And from his gaze she fled 

Clawing out her eyes 
"I can't unsee his glare" 
With a slipknot, tightly wrapped 
She kicked away the chair 

The Asylum 
Fell into despair 
The Asylum 
A Self-Slaughter Affair 

"Death child" 

He hears them shouting 
Wondering if the voices will take him away 

"They had no chance to survive" 
"No meaning in their suicide" 
"It must somehow be his fault" 
"No signs of struggle or assault" 

Young Arryn knew 
The men will come again 
And lock him up 
Unless he talks to them 

He had no control 
No way he could know 
All he wanted was to speak his mind 

The doctors and nurses, as if snarled by curses 
Had slit all of their fucking throats and died 

The Asylum 
Fell into despair 
The Asylum 
A Self-Slaughter Affair 

No one speaks about The Case of Arryn Jack 
Peculiar, unnatural, his mind twisted and black 

The world that he resides, misshapen and obscure 
The patients who grew fond of him, their lives could not endure
