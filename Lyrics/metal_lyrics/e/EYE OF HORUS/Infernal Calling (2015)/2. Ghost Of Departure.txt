Within the halls of the infirm 
I inject, I slice, I make them squirm 
None can reveal 
dressed in white, ushering their poisoned meals 

Overdosing 
Their grip of life, pragmatically closing 
I hold the blade to their mortal coil 
And they find sleep in the soil 

With syringe in hand 
They'll die as planned 
Their life I cease 
With morbid ease 

Sordid addiction 
The will to defile 
Innate, since birth, 
A carcinophile 

Untraceable, Intangible 

Feeding an infant 
With tainted lead 
Ejaculate 
As the tumor spreads 

A lethal dose of insulin 
Exposure to fatal pathogens 

With syringe in hand 
They'll die as planned 
Their life I cease 
With morbid ease 

The sickness, alluring, 
The foul stench enduring 
The snapping of bones 
A delectable tone 

Of septic necrosis 
And cruel diagnosis 
The Ghost Of Departure 
Is feeding on their helpless cries 

With syringe in hand 
They'll die as planned 
I deliver the sick, 
Now who shall I pick 

Incisions cut so deep 
I bless them with eternal sleep 
And even if I fall 
I've honored Him through Infernal Call
