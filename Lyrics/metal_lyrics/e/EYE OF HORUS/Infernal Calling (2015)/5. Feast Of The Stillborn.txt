Stalking those who ripe with child 
Have become so naive 
To slake the thirst of this necrophile 
The bearer is to bleed 

One by one they're plucked away 
In the shadows he retrieves 
Though they wake alive, can't help but cry. 
Never will they leave 

Shrieks and howls echo through the halls, soon tombs of blood and stone 
Try to dig with fingers, salted tears are shed, for they're grinded to the bone 

Gathered to the chamber, where air smells of rot 
The first one is lucky, as through the spine she's shot 
The second, third and fourth are strangled, ripped and hacked 
The final bearing witness to abortion, and grilling of the fetus 

Feast Of The Stillborns 
From a mother's loving grip, a child is torn 
Feast Of The Stillborns 
To the practice of infanticide his life he has sworn 

An infant, fresh from womb, unspoiled, to be fried 
No other breeds of flesh will do, only one can satisfy 
Onwards he strides, into the night off to find new prey 
Ever searching for most beautiful brides who will meet their end today
