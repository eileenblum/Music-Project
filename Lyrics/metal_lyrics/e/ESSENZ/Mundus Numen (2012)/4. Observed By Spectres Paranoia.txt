I wonÂ´t leave you in ignorance of the gifts of the mind

If I did not have love
I would speak without tongue
Like the formless white or the singing rock

Damned are those who are weakened by the flesh

Towards the light
I disappear from your sense and bringâ¦â¦
The eternal will.

I wait for you
Everywhere
In very glare.
In very darkness
In very noiseâ¦.
Now ye be warned.

Towards the light
I disappear from your senses and bringâ¦
The eternal.
