A crawling hand reaches for my soul
It preaches the verses against the sun
Touching the inner conflict
The epitome of my deepest will

Correspond to nothing
The void of absolute contortion

The questions is posed and lies dormant
Nothing will be told
Nothing will be sold
Nothing is, but gold

Silver lines behind my eyes
Bleed of grief
Grief of freedom
â¦and justice will be told
