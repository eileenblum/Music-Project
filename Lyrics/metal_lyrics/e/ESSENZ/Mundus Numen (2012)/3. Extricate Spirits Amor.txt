In agony,wisdom  becomes the loving friend
Here I am in spiritual awareness
Bowing down to weathered crosses
That fill the shapes of misty figures

In tormenting spells, raising the deep sea
I see,I follow, I feel
The tormenting sea
Samadhi

In agony, wisdom becomes the Holy Spirit
Spirit in essence
Essential bursting harmony
Dissolved

Cut the grain
I say,I pray
The tormenting spells
samadhi
