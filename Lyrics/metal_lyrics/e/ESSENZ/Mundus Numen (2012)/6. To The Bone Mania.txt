I feel darkness, filled with eyes
I sense sins full of might
Awareness beyond sight

Blinding fortune sculpturing wide
Allowed to behold the one-armed bride

Disguise my desires
So I can complete the process
Evoke the leaders: unleash the streams!

Wandering temples inhale my breath
I join them and becomeâ¦
Enshrouded in the fog of the self
Hear is speaking wet
Welt ist wille
