Death appears through the black mist
The smell of the end seeds everywhere the holy mourning
It's one more fading night
But the last one in the sphere of our time

There's no longer a moon to wash the sun
There's no longer a sun to stain the darkness
It's just a withered place
A place forgotten, that no longer lives

I know that now I'll run inside the night
To find the throne of the livings
A path that travels through the old woods
Forgetting the illness of the dead

As a double blade surrounded by darkness
I stand alone, I touch the wind
A dead part of my soul is gone, the chains are broken
I surfaced my thoughts in the name of human blasphemy
And suddenly my body is veiled by nails
Thick as the forests that I stand forth
And old as the hills that give me strength

I call the powers of mother nature
As I see the pure side of domination
My soul is kissing the sickening race
With great irony and pleasure

I am out of the mire of a disorted heaven
Facing the grave of the human world
...the most amazing landscape
Between the edges of time

My blood is your only poison
And your poison is my true life
Helpless, hopeless, dreamless,
Death...
