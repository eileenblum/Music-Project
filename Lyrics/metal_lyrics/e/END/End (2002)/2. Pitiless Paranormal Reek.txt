I curse you in the name of the past,fucking humans
I curse you in the name of the ancient lust
I curse your god,I curse your lies
I curse the way you outlast

I curse the lifes you bring in torture
I curse the childs that eat your tail
Your pitiless paranormal reek
Your way to obscure the emptiness

In the painful world of misery
I find my wrath in everything
and everything feeds my wrath
These pigs enjoy their gasp

Proud scums of emptiness
The fictious reality disappears
In a peaceful moment of splendour
Parasites with no future
Your poor souls are bending
before Infinity

We scream...for chaos to come
Genocide we call our mighty visions
We scream...for chaos to come
The strike of darkness already licks the light
Hail the flames of war and madness!
