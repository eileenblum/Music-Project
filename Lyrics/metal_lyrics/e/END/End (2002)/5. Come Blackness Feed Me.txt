My only black truth
Is still growing inside me
Between "heaven and hell"
My light lives in the dark

Inverted souls are fighting till the end
Even in the false dimensions
Blackness, hold me tight and feed me
So I can clean the truth inside me

The full moon and the mountains
The darkness of the skies
Can give the hope to my spirit
For the eternal life

The full moon and the mountains
A living flame in my heart
A beast that wakes inside me
And holds the horn of might

The black horse will ride away
Through the valley of eternity
To the withered lands of time
One day I'll find my throne

Blackness, hold me tight and feed me
So I can keep raising my faith eternally
And as your cruelty guides me
My target's growing more
The hatred, the love, I deny
My target is growing more and I wonder
When the pain of my revenge will be fey
