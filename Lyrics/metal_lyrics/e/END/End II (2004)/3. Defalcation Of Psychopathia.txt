Neverending hallway of a mind
And of a stoned god
The smile of a conqueror share
In front of your face
Disabled people
Ejaculating plastic
Spanned gravestones
What a night !!!

Defalcation of psychopathia

Have you ever entered chaos?
Have you ever seen or felt it?
Take your brain back
And wash it again
Beyond the growing darkness
I Am the one you hate
You know my words
Devastated cosmos in your head

Defalcation of Psychopathia

I Hang this prideful moment
From the tree of the whipped years
Eat your heart scum
Swallow your eyes

Psychopathia of defalcation
