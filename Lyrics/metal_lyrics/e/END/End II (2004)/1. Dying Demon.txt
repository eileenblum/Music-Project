Look the dying demon in his eyes
You should fear the thousand ways he found to die
Don't try to answer all the questions
A fat Jesus is your food

A pulse of red flows from his eyes
The dying demon crops his lies
To feed the world...
To promise frozen enemies
To feed the world...
To promise frozen enemies

The demon feeds from your misguided minds
Chews you up and spits you out
The demon feeds from your misguided minds
Chews you up and spits you out

When something new is fake and weakened
The dying demon smiles
Because weakness
Is the most cheap material
To build this world over and over again

He fears the blow of truth
He fears the axe of reality

Misconstruction of life

The dying demon was born dead
He is dead with open eyes
