A Terror figure with a black heart
With eight shadows and marvellous dreams
Dispelling screams from untrodden worlds
A Haunting starfog cloaks him

In a great damned forest he lurks
Deep-rooted in a great damned forest
The trees wither by his breath
But are born again by his passion

There is a lake of black waters
A Lake of poison and corruption
The little humans drowned inside
On shore he stands and screams by hatred

Cryptic panic paints the forest
As he seeks for relics of flesh
But the moon of this dimension
Is so cursed that brings damnation

This winter is eternal
Eternal as their death
This desert land is fertile
By pureness, truth and strength

The relics can't remain
