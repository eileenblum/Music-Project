Shockwave of the night
Chaotic is the number of the stars
I Break the ice of my heart
For the nocturnal triumph

The soft light of the sky and the shaped fog
Bring forth the silhouette of the mountains
From the ground, from the woods
And the frozen wind
A Thought becomes a river

Why must i stand the pain of human logic,
When chaos surrounds me?
Once the baneful consequences of life
And once those of death?
I Will not sleep at any coffin
...I Know where i belong

You are absolutely free to rot
To lie down in the same box
With an ancient plague
To die as you fuckin' deserve

Dedicated life to nothingness
...I. a sewer
A Comet on its way to land
On the shelter of humanity
Death has been shared for all
