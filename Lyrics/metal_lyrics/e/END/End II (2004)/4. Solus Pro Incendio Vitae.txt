Clouds now are gathered
The storm is getting closer
The unlimited price of power
Soft light of death

The burning fire is now gone
The wind cuts like a blade
Through the infected filter of life
I Feel the first drops so heavy

The storm is here
Over the deserted land of hope
Nothing can touch me

Oh, breath of the magic night
Oh, breath of the only truth
Give me what i need

I Am not for this world
