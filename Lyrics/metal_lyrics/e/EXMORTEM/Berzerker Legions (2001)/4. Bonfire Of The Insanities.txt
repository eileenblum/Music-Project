The trickster has shown his flag
He is the challenger
Death's winged commander?
A master of disguise

You see witches in my eyes
Dancing high above what is sane
Killing them would be like
Killing myself

Welcome to the land of the wicked
We are living in the shadows
Where darkness bear the crown
We have chosen the chaos path

Shadowlands

Multidepressive visions
Insanity is raging your thoughts
Is it a demon on the inside
Or "reality" that doesn't understand

Bonfire of the insanities
We are living on borrowed time
Navigators in troubled waters
Better living through
Chaos
