Deeds of hatred and treachery
Mankind hunted by demons

A period of bitter and unrelieved cold
The mighty winter
For three years no summer came
To free men from their suffering

Mounting fire and smoke
Rising to the stars
Intense coldness and ice storms
Doomed to destruction

A flood will overwhelm the earth
One ship will sail
Built on the uncut nails of the dead

Evil omens are heard
Major volcanic eruption
Disasters from below
Catastrophic destruction

Man's mortal weakness
A reign of flesh
Fires dominate
Streams of blood will flow

Surt alone is left alive
To fling fire over earth and heaven
As the earth sinks below the waves
Pursued by demons hatred and treachery
