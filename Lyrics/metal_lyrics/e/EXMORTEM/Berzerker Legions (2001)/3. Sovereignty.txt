Admiring the triumphant demonthrone
Sealed with the knowledge of time
Magic runes are carved here
Will you ever find the key
The bound demon in the earth
Is waiting to be released

For nine days he hung... the demon
Who sees it all... with only one eye
Gaining divine wisdom... through tormenting pain

He has travelled beyond the worlds
He has danced with death
Now he controls it all
With strength he suffered

Wandering alone in these halls of divinity
A place of uncontrolled chaos
And uncontrolled wisdom

Find your way through
Release the forces of Fimbulity
And sovereignty shall be your name

Sovereignty!
