Ride the storm of mayhem
Fly with the wings of the damned
Blackwinged Deathknight
Your will is supreme

Praise the fall of the world
I'll show you the way to obscurity
Images of defunct future
A mirror of the underworld

Welcome the nuclear mists
The noble art of self-destruction
Art in divine form
Crawl the fields of death

Dance to the beatings of clubs
Show your victims the way
The smile of a predator
Let them join the cadaver march

Ride the storm of mayhem
Fly with the wings of the damned
Blackwinged Deathknight
Your will is supreme

Praise the fall of the world
I'll show you the way to obscurity
Images of defunct future
A mirror of the underworld

Welcome the nuclear mists
The noble art of self-destruction
Art in divine form
All that is set for you is...
Death!!
