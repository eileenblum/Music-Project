Isolate war scenarios
Rusty iron deserts
Human remains
In the sand and the wrecks

Huge battle machines
Now funerary sculptures
Armoured divisions
No longer a threat

Biolagical warfare
The total cleansing
Manmade Armageddon
Inhale the winds of destruction

Isolate war scenarios
Rusty iron deserts
Human remains
In the sand and the wrecks

Unaffected of the grim disease
I walk these fields of flesh piles
Desolated...Lifeless
Slowly decaying

Huge battle machines
Now funerary sculptures
Armoured divisions
Now plague eaten filth
