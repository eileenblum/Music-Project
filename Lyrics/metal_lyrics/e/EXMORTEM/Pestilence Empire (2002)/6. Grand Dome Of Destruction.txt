Naked chambers so cold and grim
A last gasp for air
A smell of funerals to come
Icecold Ugliness

Here I saw the Lord of Death
And his eyes flashed with rage

Gruesome Icons...Demonic Tokens
Images of a defuct future
Funeral fests...Nocturnal Chill
A mirror of the underworld

Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Hear the storm of the sharpening blades
Mortals sacrificed

Here I saw the Lord of Death
And his eyes flashed with rage

Rusty blabes and cold steel
Blood and dirt in obscure junction
Memories of agony and death
Abnormal creatures silently watching

So endlessly big and powerful
so majestically frightening
These are the halls of death
Welcoming the filthy and the weak...
...as they die!
