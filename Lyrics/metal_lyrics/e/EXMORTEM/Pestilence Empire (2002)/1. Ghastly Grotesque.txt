Clear night of holocaust reigns
All devourer of smoke and flame
Art of self-sacrificing
It's the age of unburying hatchets

Enter self-built machines of death
Vaccines of the black plague
Barbed wire offerings
Human embodiment in terror

Through the pain and suffering
Man will not endure
Now kings in their own hell
Gastly grotesque

Raging death flames
Licking twisted flesh piles
Now demonic virtues
Spirits on fallen idols

Humanity's crystal night
The worlds gravestone
Infant screams drown in blood
Only sounds of razors remain

Through the pain and suffering
Man will not endure
Now kings in their own hell
Gastly grotesque
