Misery at glance
Hellrain over paradise
A flood of misanthropy
Cleansing the world

Listen to the misery
It whispers my name...
"Malus Invictus"

Sick demons
High on pain
Obscure terror
An infernal cycle

As I fell below
I tasted the breath of death
Grim pictures of a tormented god
So cold and ugly these hands of death

Misery at glance
Hellrain over paradise
A flood of misanthropy
Cleansing the world

[Repeat 2nd]

Sick demons
High on pain
Obscure terror
An infernal cycle

Listen to the misery
It whispers my name...
"Malus Invictus"
