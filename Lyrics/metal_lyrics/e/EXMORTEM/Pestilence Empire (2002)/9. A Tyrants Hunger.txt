Theatre Of terror
A gallery of true evil
a kingdom built
On the people I killed

A snapshot of your reality
Mirror yourself in my blade
With bloodstains I paint the walls
I want this night to last for years

A frightening scenario
A playground of fear
And it's me in the center
The tyrant god!!

A snapshot of your reality
Mirror yourself in my blade
With bloodstains I paint the walls
I want this night to last for years

I want to feal the other side
Through your pain
Through your misery
The power of insanity

A gallery of true evil
A frightening scenario
A theatre of fear
Obscure fucking terror!!
