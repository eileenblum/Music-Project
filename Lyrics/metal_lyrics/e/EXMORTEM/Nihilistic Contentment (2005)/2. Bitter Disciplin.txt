[Music by Sigtyr.]
[3:19]

I enter the stage as an evil demagogue 
demanding obedience and devotion 
from the legions of dead. 

Bring them to me, cast them before me. 
I'll stick out their eyes, cut off their fingers. 

Bitter disciplin. 

Thousands of men 
wandering in darkness 
Searching for their God. 
(Here I am.) 
Welcome to Hell. 

Thousands of men 
wandering in darkness 
Searching for their God. 
(Here I am.) 
Welcome to Hell. 

Worship pain, worship Death. 
Onto the dark side, let the damned rise. 

Bitter disciplin. 

Thousands of men 
wandering in darkness 
Searching for their God. 
(Here I am.) 
Welcome to Hell. 

A landscape of fires. 
Crematory smell. 
Burning my followers. 
Pray again.
