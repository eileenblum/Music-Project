My acid burnt eyes
predicting the rise of evil. 
A quick fix of negativity, 
a lifetime in misery. 
Paranoia strikes hard. 

With glass in my eyes, 
I see clearer now. 
Feel a touch of divine suffering. 
I am an angel with bloody hands. 

We live in the noise and the dirt, the real life angst, 
filth and desperation, a portal of misery. 
The ultimate demonic playground. 

With glass in my eyes, 
I see clearer now. 
Feel a touch of divine suffering. 
I am an angel with bloody hands. 

The world is swept in a curtain 
from the rottenness of Man. 
Fixing decadent values. 
Miserable mortals, open your eyes. 

We live in the noise and the dirt, the real life angst, 
filth and desperation, a portal of misery. 
The ultimate demonic playground. 

With glass in my eyes, 
I see clearer now. 
Feel a touch of divine suffering. 
I am an angel with bloody hands. 

Protector of the miserable. 
Master nihilist.
