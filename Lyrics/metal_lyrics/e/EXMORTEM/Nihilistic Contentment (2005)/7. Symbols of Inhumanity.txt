[Music by Sigtyr.]
[3:34]

I see the modern Doctor Mengele, 
the grotesque shines in your eyes. 
Playing the image of vulgarity. 
An octave beyond the extreme.

Perverted talents, bathing in sin. 
Watching you servants sacrificed. 
Flagellation in a new form. 

Pesiferous gifts. 
Master of decay. 
Brutal repression. 
Tremor of anguish. 

Sculptor of agony. 
Satanic death art. 
Hells observatory. 
Take pride in vulgarity. 
Vulgarity.
