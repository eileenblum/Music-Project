[Music by Sigtyr.]
[3:54]

I'll turn the world into Caligula's Rome. 
(Realization of) Dante's "Inner Circle of Hell". 

Collapse of the moral Universe. 
A grotesque and dark beauty. 
Derived sexual gratification. 
Deriving sexual pleasure. 

Grotesque and fantastic scenery. 
Bizarre carnival. 
Absurd posturing of the deformed. 
Harvest festival. 

A carnival of lust, 
carnal lust. 
Selfish lust for pleasure. 
Selfish lust for power. 

Whipping ourselves into greater orgies of destruction. 
The dead... pieces of performance art. 
Passionate dance with Death. 
Perversion spiral out of control. 

I'll turn the world into Caligula's Rome. 
(Realization of) Dante's "Inner Circle of Hell". 

Grotesque and fantastic scenery. 
Bizarre carnival. 
Absurd posturing of the deformed. 
Harvest festival. 

A carnival of lust, 
carnal lust. 
Selfish lust for pleasure. 
Selfish lust for power.
