[Music by Sigtyr.]
[3:42]

Disciple of symbols, 
preaching ignorance. 
Cruel and illogical deity, 
adherent of life denying doctrines. 
A prophecy of genocide. 
Your promise of genocide. 

Lost in streams of insanity, 
craving your dirty piece 
of a Parasite Paradise. 

Disciple of symbols, 
alone in the darkest pit, 
Crawling in the shadows,
(beneath the cross). 
Decayed morals. 

Disciple of symbols,

A prophecy of genocide. 
Your promise of genocide. 

Lost in streams of insanity, 
craving your dirty piece 
of a Parasite Paradise. 

Recycling the body of Christ, 
infected with stupefied manners. 
The rotting blood running your veins, 
eating you from the inside. 

Disciple of symbols, 
alone in the darkest pit, 
Crawling in the shadows,
(beneath the cross). 
Decayed morals. 

Parasite Paradise. 
Parasite Paradise.
