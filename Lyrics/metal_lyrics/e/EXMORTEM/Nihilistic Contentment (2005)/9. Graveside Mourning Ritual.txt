[Music by Andreas and Sigtyr.]
[2:52]

Life in the tomb. 
Rotting coffin. 
The dead rule, 
speaking from beyond the grave, 
urging us forward to revenge. 

Speaking from beyond the grave, 
urging us forward to revenge. 

Hunting the graves
of massacred victims. 
Frantic burial grounds, 
dissolving corpses. 

Hacking through the frigid Earth 
ready to violate the dead. 
Knowing it's rotten, 
knowing it's only waste. 

Solitary funeral commando. 

Hacking through the frigid Earth 
ready to violate the dead. 
Knowing it's rotten, 
knowing it's only waste. 

Life in the tomb. 
Rotting coffin. 
The dead rule, 
speaking from beyond the grave, 
urging us forward to revenge.
