[Originally by U2]

I can't believe the news today 
I can't close my eyes and make it go away 
How long? how long must we sing this song? 
How long? how long? 
Tonight we can be as one - tonight 
Broken bottles under children's feet 
Bodies strewn across a dead end street 
But I won't heed the battle call 
It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall 

Sunday, bloody Sunday 
Sunday, bloody Sunday 

And the battle's just begun 
There's many lost, but tell me who has won? 
The trenches dug within our hearts 
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart 

Sunday, bloody Sunday 
Sunday, bloody Sunday 

How long? how long must we sing this song? 
How long? how long? 
Tonight we can be as one - tonight 
(Tonight) Sunday, bloody Sunday 
(Tonight) Sunday, bloody Sunday 

Wipe the tears from your eyes 
Wipe your tears away 
Wipe your tears away 
(Wipe your tears away) Sunday, bloody Sunday 
(Wipe your tears away) Sunday, bloody Sunday 

And it's true we are immune 
When fact is fiction and TV reality 
And today the millions cry 
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die 

The real battle yet begun 
To claim the victory Jesus won 
On Sunday, bloody Sunday 
Sunday, bloody Sunday
