betrayed by a love. sweet nothings gone forever.
please let me go.
you dont know what this has done to me.
i cry for you.
your words hold true though the stainglass windows of my broken soul.
i will stand up strong, reach the end of this quest, one more time.
hold me up again one more time.
praise. hold me up again.
