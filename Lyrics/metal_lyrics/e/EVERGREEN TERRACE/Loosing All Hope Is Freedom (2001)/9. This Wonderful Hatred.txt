wonderful.
gossip wonders from your mouth to kiss the ground.
did i ask to see you did i ask to follow your words.
its all you want to know.
you let this come between us and your actions break us.
i held onto everyone of your words just to be cut down.
this wonderful hatred finds its way to me
and in your tone i can hear all the lies.
this wonderful hatred towards your words 
are like the embers that burn.
it dosent make a difference you want it all.
they turn to ashes and pass us by like the days we never had.
