im screaming out but you dont hear what i say.
Im grounded now in my dreams i wish to fly away.
i scream with my anger my lungs gasp for oxygen.
when this comes i wont wake up.
i can sleep through lies and infidelity.
i will give all i can.
i will give all i have but i fear its not enough.
im screaming out but you dont hear what i say.
im grounded now in my dreams i wish to fly away
