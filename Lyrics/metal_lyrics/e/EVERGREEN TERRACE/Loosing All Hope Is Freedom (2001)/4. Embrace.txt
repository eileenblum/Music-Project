these walls that we build save me from myself.
in exchange of life for blood i am justified purified made right in your eyes.
for you justified by faith alone in you purified by grace alone.
forgoing the stain of pride with knowing our pain subsides.
we build the walls.
i feel the bite of this world
but i cling to you even under persecution in this world that i hate,
i wait your embrace.
