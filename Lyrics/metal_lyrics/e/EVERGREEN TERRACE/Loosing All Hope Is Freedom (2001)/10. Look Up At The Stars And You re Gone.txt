mans fall, a cause for my hatred.
it turns rage and is repressed inside to strike me blind with my anger stricken with rage.
but in me a passion dwells to give all that i have.
i can no longer hide this hate for the world.
i can no longer hide this hate for what you've done.
you take your broken path but never expect me to follow,
ill take your tired lies and shove tham all back down your throat.
