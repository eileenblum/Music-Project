through preperation and years of screaming.
it has come down, it has come down to this.
i dismiss all the action taken to scar me.
i'll take it upon myself to bear the pain even as the sale covers the wounds.
and you will never know how this has hurt me
i'll take it upon myself to bear the pain even as the salt covers the wounds
