why do i take my anger and hide in in my heart,
for me to manifest it and it to rot my soul.
pushing out all i had for you now i take my life in your hands.
for i am forgiven.
falling down i cry to you in my hour of darkness.
take my life in your hands for i am nothing without you.
tear the walls down i know that you will in these days
i look away from the light that set forth my freedom.
my heart burns from you to take it all.
