[U2 Cover]

I can't believe the news today
I can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long...
How long must we sing this song?
How long? How long...

Tonight... we can be as one
Tonight...

Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday (sunday, bloody sunday)

And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die
The real battle we've begun
To claim the victory Jesus won

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday

How long...
How long must we sing this song?
How long? How long...

Tonight... we can be as one
Tonight...

(tonight) sunday bloody sunday
(tonight) sunday bloody sunday
Lets go

Sunday, bloody sunday
