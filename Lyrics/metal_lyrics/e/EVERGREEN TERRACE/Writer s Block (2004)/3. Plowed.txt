[Sponge Cover]

Will I wake up
Is it a dream I made up
No I guess it's reality
What will change us
Or will we mess up
Our only chance to connect with a dream

Say a prayer for me, say a prayer for me, say a prayer for me
Say a prayer for me, say a prayer for me
I'm buried by the sound

In a world of human wreckage
In a world of human wreckage
In a world of human wreckage

I'm lost and I'm found
And I can't touch the ground
I'm plowed into the sound

To see wide open
With a head that's broken
Hang a life on a tragedy
Plow me under the ground
That covers the message
That is the seed

Say a prayer for me, say a prayer for me, say a prayer for me
Say a prayer for me, say a prayer for me
I'm buried by the sound

In a world of human wreckage
In a world of human wreckage
In a world of human wreckage

I'm lost and I'm found
And I can't touch the ground
I'm plowed into the sound

Will I wake up
Is it a dream I made up
No I guess it's reality...
