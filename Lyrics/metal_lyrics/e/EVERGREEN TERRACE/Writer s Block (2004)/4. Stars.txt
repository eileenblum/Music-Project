[Hum Cover]

She thinks she missed the train to mars, she's out back counting stars
She thinks she missed the train to mars, she's out back counting stars

She's not at work, she's not at school
She's not in bed, i think i finally broke her
I bring her home everything i want, nothing that she needs

I thought she'd be there holding daisies, she always waits for me
She thinks she missed the train to mars, she's out back counting stars

I found her out back sitting naked looking up and looking dead
A crumpled yellow piece of paper, seven nines and tens

I thought she'd be there holding daisies, she always waits for me
She thinks she missed the train to mars, she's out back counting stars

I thought you'd be there holding daisies, you always wait for me
She thinks she missed the train to mars, she's out back counting...
