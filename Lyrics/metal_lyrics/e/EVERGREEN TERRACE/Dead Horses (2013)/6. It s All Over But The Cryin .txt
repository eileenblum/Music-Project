What is this river you want to cross?
You're searching for answers. Was it worth the cost?
No sky, no ground. The illusion of time.
No river, no boat. Another state of mind.

Degenerating, come undone.
As the water fills my lungs.
I'm goin' down and I can't stop sinking.
If I could swim a little more.
I could make it to the shore.
Wishful thoughts can't stop this mud I'm drinking.

Your gods can't hear you. You're still lost in the herd.
I know, I cried out. They never said a word.
Nothing but water. In the sacred pools.
Nothing in their holy books. But fears of an ancient fool.
