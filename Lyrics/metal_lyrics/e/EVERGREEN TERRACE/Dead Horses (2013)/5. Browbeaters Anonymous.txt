I feel it in my bones.

It can never escape me.
There can never be compromise.
Always evading stones.
You can never mistake me.
For someone who can't realize.
The fucking difference.

Between the night and day.
It will never get through your skull.
I feel it in my bones.
It can never escape me.
There can never be compromise.

You can do it all again.
But you won't take me alive.
I'll keep screaming.

Let go of this iron lung.
You know I'll keep breathing.
Let go. Let go.
