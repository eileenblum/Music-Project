I wish this could last forever.
Another face in a photograph.
I try so hard to remember.
Although I know there's no going back.
A broken rung in the ladder.
Another faded photograph.
While all these memories shatter.
I watch it all fade to black.

Godspeed, despite the notion.
I'm done sleeping with my eyes wide open.
Wake me when it's over.

The sooner, the better.
Assimilate as you fall in line.
I try so hard to remember.
When you were you in another time.
A broken bone in the ladder.
Another faded photograph.
And as these memories shatter.
I watch it all fade to black.

Can't stop. Won't stop.
Never looking back.
