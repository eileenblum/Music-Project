End over end I've been living,
Through fire, through dirt, and through stone,
Abandoning all, unforgiven,
So tighten the noose that keeps me hanging,
Under this skin I've been given,
Lie broken, these travelers bones,
Dead horses have always been ridden,
So tighten the noose that keeps me hanging.

Never letting go.

I wanna know, I wanna know
Exactly what keeps me hanging on.
Is it the wind in my face? The reassuring embrace
Of a family that I've never known?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Exactly what keeps me hanging on.

Waiting for life to be quickened,
Ending this war on my own,
Breaking down, breaking down these conditions,
Tighten the noose that keeps me hanging,
Acclimated to size, with the dirt in my eyes,
Drowning in waters unknown,
Weathered and worn, I'm still hidden,
Tighten the noose that keeps me hanging

Never letting go
