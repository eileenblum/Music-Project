Waking up to
The smell of summer
Though it's late fall
We arrived in the morning
After the blood
Had stained the floor

We waited for hours
We had lost it all

The test had shown
What I already knew
What I already knew
Death had come (for a visit)
Late last night
Late last night

Where are all the answers
When everything is wrong?
Everything is gone!
No one has the answers
When everything is gone
Everything is gone...

I hate
The smell of summer
Though it's late fall
We leave
As the sun sets
The car is hot, but I am cold.

I hate
The smell of summer
The smell of summer
The smell of summer

The test had shown
What I already knew
What I already knew
Death had come (for a visit)
Late last night
Late last night

Where are all the answers
When everything is wrong?
Everything is gone!
No one has the answers
When everything is gone
When everything is gone.
