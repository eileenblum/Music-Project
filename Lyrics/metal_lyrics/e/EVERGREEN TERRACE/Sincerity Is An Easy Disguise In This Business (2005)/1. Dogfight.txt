Bring your words to the river
Throw yourself in
There will be no tomorrow
This will be
The end of your poison
From the tip of your tongue
Drowning in the river
You will be
Done with all your lies [x2]

[Chorus]
I want to believe
I want to believe you
I want to believe you,
But I'm letting go.
(Letting go.)

Running your mouth
Only vilifies
Rotting away
Decay will satisfy
Rot away
Rot away.

I want you dead [x4]
We want you dead [x4]

[Chorus x2]
