You say everything comes
If you don't turn your back
And I wait everyday
Sometimes this patience I lack
Because it's just

More of the same
More of the same
And I just need you
To remember my name
More of the same
More of the same
And I just need you.

It takes all of me
To keep my eyes off of the floor
And this makes tomorrow seem
Harder than ever before
Because it's just

More of the same
More of the same
And I just need you
To remember my name
More of the same
More of the same
And I just need you
To remember my

Why does this seem to be
Right in front of me
Intangible dreams we pursue
Why it's so hard to see
Is eluding me
I can't believe that it's true

More of the same
More of the same
And I just need you
To remember my name
More of the same
More of the same
And I just need you.
