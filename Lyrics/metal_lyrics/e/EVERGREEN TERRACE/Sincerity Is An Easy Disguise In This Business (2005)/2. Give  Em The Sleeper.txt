What would you say if receptors quit recieving?
Or if everything you believe, you quit believing?
What would you hold if you fell into the night,
And all the moments of your life flashed before your eyes?

What will save you now?
What grace will you find?
What a wasted life,
Too quick for closed minds
One more pointless breath
As you sail into the night
Take the pain with stride
As we say goodbye

Too quick for closed minds
Just wasting all of your life
Searching for eternity
All you'll find is apathy
