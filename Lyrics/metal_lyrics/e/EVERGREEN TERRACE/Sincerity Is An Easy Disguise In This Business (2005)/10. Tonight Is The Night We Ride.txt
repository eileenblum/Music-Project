We built this life
We love this ride
Leave a stranger's house
Drive through the day
South-bound 95
More broke than we came

Four more shots to the gut
Let it burn
Until we see the sun
Let it burn

[Chorus]
Any given night
Crossing another state line
We know we can never die [x2]

Rolling too deep
(But) living, never gonna die

Riding to another town
We're showing up for another round

[Chorus x4]
