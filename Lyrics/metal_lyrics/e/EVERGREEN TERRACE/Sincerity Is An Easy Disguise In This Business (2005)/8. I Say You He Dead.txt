Blood still flows from an open wound
(In a room) one heart beats where there were two
The killer had a knife and golden blonde hair
Her eyes, black and blue, they had been that way for years
She planned her escape once the beatings begun
But she did not know to use a knife or a gun
Alone again, and a fist to her face
He turned his back.... she attacked.

One to the back
(And) three to the heart [x4]

(After cleaning her blood stained hands,) she got into her car and drove to Mexico.
