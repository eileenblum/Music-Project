Sincerity
You finest act
Preying on
The hopes we had

Broken hearts
Broken homes
Broken feet
Broken toes
We're still crawling
On our knees
Towards our life
Towards our dreams

Disguise yourself
With your words
Crushing smiles
We once had

[Chorus]
We've broken down
We've broken out
But you will never follow
You've watched us drown
You've pushed us out
But we will never follow [x2]

But we will never follow.

We will never follow. [x4]

[Chorus]

We've broken down
We've broken out
But we will never follow. [x2]

But we will never follow.
We will never follow. [x4]
