[Chorus]
Staring back your disposition
Will be the end of you
Laying out this one condition
You're going nowhere [x2]

Break your teeth and pour out the lies
They keep on coming, I don't know why
You'll never get it til you're alone
On an island skipping stones

Staring back
Staring back to nothing [x2]

[Chorus x2]

You're going nowhere. [x2]

Staring back.
You're nothing. [x7]

Staring back. [x2]
