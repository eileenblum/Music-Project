(Don't fade me out again.)

You'll never make it on your own. [x3]

[Chorus]
Don't fade me out again.
I'll still be on.
You'll never make it on your own. [x3]

You always take without giving
Always one step ahead
A sordid life that you're leading
Inside you know you're already dead.

Bleed us dry
One more time
Now you're gone.

[Chorus]

You always take without giving,
Always one step ahead [x2]

Bleed us dry
One more time [x2]
Now you're gone.

[Chorus]

Now you're gone. [x2]

Bleed us dry
One more time
Now you're gone.

[Chorus]

[Overdubbing of Chorus and "bleed us dry.."]
