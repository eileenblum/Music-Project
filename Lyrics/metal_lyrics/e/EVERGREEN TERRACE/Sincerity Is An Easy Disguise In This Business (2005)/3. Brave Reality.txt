See your faith
See the wind
Your sealed fate
It's happened again

[Chorus]
False convictions
Fake intentions
You still think that you get one more time around. [x2]

Sticking hard to your convictions
Convictions of nothing
Lying smiles to your self
Self diluted dreams
Smiling wide, head held high
This is how it seems
Step the plate, accept your fate
Brave reality.

[Chorus x3]

Wake up and choke.
Choke.
Wake up and choke.
