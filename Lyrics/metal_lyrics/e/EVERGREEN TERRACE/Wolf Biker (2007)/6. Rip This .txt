follow fools gold into the darkness not knowing what the light at the end
means, IÂ´m the patron saint of putting it all on black when it always comes up red.

just one taste is all you need

IÂ´m never going home
once you feel it
IÂ´m never giving in
once you taste it
IÂ´m going to find a way
IÂ´m going to make it last

throwing your lies into the throats of unknowing
5 long years meet their end
we were the patron saint of putting it all on black
when it always came up red

the dream is dead!
