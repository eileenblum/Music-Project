somethingÂ´s come over me and I need some answers
my capulet, it seems, is just a step away
we walk, we walk this darkened road
I canÂ´t see, I canÂ´t see at all
this joke is getting older every single day

somethingÂ´s come over me

no place IÂ´d rather be
what are the chances
itÂ´s right in front of me but still a step away
we walk, we walk this weary road
I canÂ´t move, I canÂ´t move at all
this joke is getting older every single day

IÂ´ve heard quite enough

forget, forget it all
starting all over again
regret has mounted tall
over and over again
is this our final call
starting all over again
forget, forget it all
over and over

you canÂ´t take it from me with softly spoken lies
one more mistake may end up costing you your life
