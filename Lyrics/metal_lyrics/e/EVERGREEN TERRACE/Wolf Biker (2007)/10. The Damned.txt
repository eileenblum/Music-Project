itÂ´s OK, itÂ´s OK, itÂ´s OK weÂ´ve seen enough.
staring straight, staring straight, straight into the setting sun.
let the light burn our retinas and our callused skin
all you will have is anger and the money you cash in

wishing to contact, but contracts put us out
you can fool us once but we wonÂ´t be the same again

desperately seeking the fallen, the damaged, and the weakened, and the used
how can you see where youÂ´re going when all these burning bridges block your view

we know what you need
we know what you want

crawling up from the bottom of the list
you have fooled us once but now thingÂ´s have changed

this song will play your death

on and on we go without you


Thanks to morphine.song for sending track #9 lyrics.
