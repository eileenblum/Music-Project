this is a curse

the flies are out for their feast of shit
canÂ´t hardly see with the swarm so thick

how can I love anything and everything in a world so quick to piss all over
another's plate? how can I sleep? when did their blood pump through my tank
and burn the sky? itÂ´s in my lungs as I slowly die away

but I canÂ´t stand here any longer and clench my fists or grit my teeth
when I feel all of my insides, I want to cry and scream

no truth
no rights
no life
no light

thereÂ´s no light, this is a curse
I beat my fist to the bone
