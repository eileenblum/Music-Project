fear your thoughts is what we are taught
fear the gods that are worn and jaded
watched by our own minds
fear the eyes that we created

I canÂ´t stop to breathe until the walls are coming down
I canÂ´t make believe that this is all because whatÂ´s lost cannot be found
I canÂ´t stop to sleep until the walls are painted red
the only time you ever walked on water was to stand atop my head

no real rights, thoughts, or ideas
just safety proof lives for safety proof minds
no sin. no nonsense. time to break free
no worries left about your immorality

you close your eyes and fear the gods
someoneÂ´s watching
fear your thoughts
