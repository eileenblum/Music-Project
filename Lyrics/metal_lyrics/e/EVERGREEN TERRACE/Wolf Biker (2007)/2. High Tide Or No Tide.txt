serrated words
can cut so deep
they slash across my chest
and now they pour into my lungs.
they will never be the same.
have you enjoyed your selfish games

what doesnÂ´t kill me, makes me numb

please donÂ´t forgive me
IÂ´m never waking up
this wonÂ´t mean anything to you
no use resisting
youÂ´ll never get enough
this wonÂ´t mean anything to you

the hole you left
I filled with the stones
you threw and now itÂ´s time to sink
rats will eat all my flesh and lick my bones clean

IÂ´d rather be here than there with you

I need you to say I donÂ´t mean anything to you
I need you to break, I donÂ´t mean anything to you

I canÂ´t breath with you near me
cut so deep, taking over
leave me here dead inside
I canÂ´t breath knowing youÂ´re alive
