through black and blue
through thick and thin
it takes much more to break this skin
looks like weÂ´ve finally made it
this time we finally made it

weÂ´ve had our backs against the wall
and all youÂ´ve said weÂ´ve proven wrong
looks like weÂ´ve finally made it
this time we finally made it

we give and we take
we bend and we break
but thatÂ´s just the life that weÂ´ve chosen
this sinking ship will not be abandoned

weÂ´re under the radar, weÂ´re under the rug
but thatÂ´s just the way that weÂ´ve broken
fall in line to get what youÂ´ve needed
out of time, so take it or leave it now

weÂ´ve lost and weÂ´ve won, but the damage is done
but thatÂ´s just the life that weÂ´ve chosen
this sinking ship will not be abandoned

youÂ´re here and youÂ´re gone
but weÂ´re moving on
nothing is left unspoken
the bottom line is all that weÂ´re after
another dime to silence your laughter now

one more time
one more try

you get what you pay for

bright eyes have fallen far
but hold tight, a black moonÂ´s on the rise
cross lines with battle scars
now you know, you get what you pay for
