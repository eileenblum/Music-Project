I walk so freely among the damned
at time it seems weÂ´re hand and hand
the same weakness; it pumps through my veins
which of our virtues brought us here?
was it laziness? was it fear?
the same desire to see anotherÂ´s pain

you hold me down
making sure I still believe
no common ground
no foundation to play my feet
taking this one thing from me
so watch me drown with only the rocks underneath

hold me down
watch me drown

when a new world is just as likely as the old
the one that you found cruel
the one that left us cold

come on, come on
weÂ´ll make it through this
open your eyes and see that we are halfway home
weÂ´re going home
