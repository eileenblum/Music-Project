you're antagonistic to the idea of being robbed
exploited! degraded!
misery still consumes and depresses you
humiliated! deceived!

ignorance depresses you!
persecution depresses you!
violence depresses you!
slums depress you!

greed depresses you!
crime depresses you!
corruption depresses you!
you depress you!

I stole these words from a rolling thunder anarchist journal of dangerous living
