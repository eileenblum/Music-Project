[DEPECHE MODE cover]

enjoy the silence 
words like violence break the silence
come crashing in
into my little world
painful to me
pierced right through me
can't you understand
oh my little girl
all I ever wanted
all I ever needed is here in my arms
all I ever wanted
all I ever needed is here in my arms 
vows are spoken to be broken
feelings are intense
words are trivial
pleasures remain
so does the pain
words are meaningless 
and unforgettable
all I ever wanted
all I ever needed is here in my arms
all I ever wanted
all I ever needed is here in my arms
words are very unnecessary
they can only do harm 
words like violence 
break the silence
come crashing in
into my little world
painful to me
pierced right through me
can't you understand
oh my little girl
all I ever wanted
all I ever needed is here in my arms
all I ever wanted
all I ever needed is here in my arms
all I ever wanted
all I ever needed is here in my arms 
vows are spoken 
to be broken
feelings are intense
words are trivial
pleasures remain
so does the pain
words are meaningless
and forgettable
all I ever wanted
all I ever needed is here in my arms
all I ever wanted
all I ever needed is here in my arms
all I ever wanted
all I ever needed is here in my arms
words are very unnecessary
they can only do harm
can only do harm
