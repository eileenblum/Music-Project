I hope I never give up.
So afraid I'll break the skin.
Do you feel the pain I own?
Can you see the pain I love?
Wrap my arms around my dreams.
Wake up to an empty room.
When will I have hope?
When will I have hope again for this world I hate?
With every ounce of flesh I will strangle self to a new way, new way of life.
Wrap my arms around this dream of apathy.
Strange lust of self conceived inveracities.
Never give in... never!
