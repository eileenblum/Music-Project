This is everything you know, goodbye.
Take my hand. Here it is.
I will go. I'll be with you.
I will go. I'll stay with you.
See these scars?
They're for remembering.
Priceless mistakes will steal everything.
Who will be your voice?
Who will hear your cries?
Looking back I now know what makes us break.
Fear of all things you don't understand.
Remind me, this numbing has made me see.
Remind me, this numbing has let me sleep.
Remind me now.
Looking back I can see I don't know anything.
I just feel numb.
I just feel numb.
