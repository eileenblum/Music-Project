I gave you everything you needed
(My limbs, my life, my blood, my heart)
Upon my open wounds you're feeding
(its never safe within these walls)
It doesn't matter how you try to fight it
A losing battle that you'll never win (never win)
Its never easy when you run and fight it
Cause know one likes it when you're breaking in

We live through dedication
Year by year (by year)
And every situation
Never good enough
Your echoes resonating
All too clear (too clear)
These were my aspirations
Never good enough

My bitter way won't be conceded
(too much, too soon, too fast, too old)
But bleeding is always believing
(if only I saw what you saw)
It doesn't matter how you try to fight it
A losing battle that you'll never win (never win)
Its never easy when you run and fight it
Cause know one likes it when you're breaking in

Never, never, never enough for you
Never, never, never enough for you
Never enough for you
Never enough for you

Oh!

Not good, not good enough
Not good, not good enough
Not good, not good enough
Not good, not good enough
Not good, not good enough
Not good, not good enough
Not good, not good enough
Not good

We live through dedication
Year by year (by year)
And every situation
Never good enough
Your echoes resonating
All too clear (too clear)
These were my aspirations
Never good enough
