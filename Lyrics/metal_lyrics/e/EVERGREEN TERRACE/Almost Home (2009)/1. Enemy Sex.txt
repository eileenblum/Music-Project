SET ME FREE!

The smell of shit is all around me
Feasting on our fertile grounds
The fire rages all around us
Our eyes are bleeding from the sound

Please just remind me why you came
Watched you rise, watch you fall, enjoy your time it means nothing at all
I'll scream of reasons why we stayed
Through this game, staying the same and we wait cause I know sometimes some things change
Sometimes some things change

Scream these words
Scream these words
Scream these words
Scream these words

SET ME FREE!

Our precious time means nothing at all
Feasting on our sacred grounds
Just like the numbers and the names that we saw
Same as the last time
Pride caused the fall!

Please just remind me why you came
Watched you rise, watch you fall, enjoy your time it means nothing at all
I'll scream of reasons why we stayed
Through this game, staying the same and we wait cause I know sometimes some things  change
Sometimes some things change
