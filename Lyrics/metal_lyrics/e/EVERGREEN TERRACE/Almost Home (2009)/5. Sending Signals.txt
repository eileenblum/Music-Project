I'm sending a signal is anyone there?
There to receive and believe in my words
Its hard to believe when you cant even breathe
Breathe in, breathe out
The pushing and pulling the weight of the world
The world breaks my spirit and crushes my hope
Is anyone out there to help pull me out
Out of this hole?
I know it will be hard
I know it will be rougher than before
Cause life seems to always ask for more and I am giving all I have
But maybe giving's not enough and I just need, need to push trough these black holes.

Separation from the complications
I'm not coming, I'm not coming back
Separation from the complications
I'm not coming, I'm not coming back
Separation from the complications
I'm not coming, I'm not coming back

I'm sending a signal does anyone care?
Care to believe in the ways of this world
Its ready to show you the truth of today
Today I stand out
From the rest of the dying, rest of the damned
I believed in with both eyes shut
I'm sending this signal does anyone care
Care to push on

So give me a reason
To not look away
A reason for trying
A reason to stay
I'm sending a signal, is anyone there
To give me a reason
A reason to care

LET'S GO!!!!

Separation from the complications
I'm not coming, I'm not coming back
Separation from the complications
I'm not coming, I'm not coming back
Separation from the complications
I'm not coming, I'm not coming back
