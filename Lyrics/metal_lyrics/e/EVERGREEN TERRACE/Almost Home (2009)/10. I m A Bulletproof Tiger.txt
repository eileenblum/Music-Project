Oh!
Let's all just face it cold
The wastelessness that gives ties
Let the tower fall
We'll watch the sun of simple rage shine
Now the tired consent of frustration
Block the walls at the plain

We are not dying here!
Cant breathe, cant breathe, cant breathe at all
Cant fight this suffocation
Cant breathe, cant breathe, cant breathe at all
We are not dying here
Cant breathe, cant breathe, cant breathe at all
Cant fight this suffocation
Cant breathe, cant breathe, cant breathe at all

Who's gonna drown in this ditch here tonight?
Some will swim and some will die!
Who's gonna drown in this ditch here tonight?
Some will swim and some will die!

This time, its clear, this time, its clear
This time, its clear, this time, its clear

We are not, we are not, we are not dying here
We are not, we are not, we are not dying here
We're not dead
We're not dead!

Cant breathe, cant breathe, cant breathe at all
Cant fight this suffocation
Cant breathe, cant breathe, cant breathe at all
Cant breathe, cant breathe, cant breathe at all
Cant fight this suffocation
Cant breathe, cant breathe, cant breathe at all
We are not dying here
Cant breathe, cant breathe, cant breathe at all
Cant fight this suffocation
Cant breathe, cant breathe, cant breathe at all
We are not dying here!

I'll choose the center place
The wastelessness that gives ties
Let the tower fall
Let the tower fall!!
