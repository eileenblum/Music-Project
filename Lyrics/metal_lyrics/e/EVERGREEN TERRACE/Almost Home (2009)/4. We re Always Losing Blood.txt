And all the time we've waited
Just to see hope decimated by the setting sun,
And all the while frustrated because a heart that's underrated is always losing blood.
Were always losing blood,
You'll never know what it means to give. Receive. And not forget
Another hole as we bleed it out then breathe it all back in.
If you could only see were dying faster, faster now

And all the time we've waited
Just to see hope decimated by the setting sun
All the while frustrated because a heart that's perforated is always losing blood.
Were always losing blood.
You'll never know what it means to give. Receive. And not forget
Another hole as we bleed it out then breathe it all back in.
If you could only see were dying, if you could only see were dying faster,
Faster now

And all this time we've waited
Just to see hope decimated by the setting sun,
And all the while frustrated because a heart that's worn and dated is always losing blood.
