[Featuring Tim Lambesis]

I can smell your stench from here.
I can smell your stench from here.
I can smell your stench from here.
I can smell your stench from here.

Some quick interest in cleanliness would do you some you some good.
Give me a break from your skin. Your breath is going to choke me out.
Your disease is eating my good times away, go faster and faster
And you're just standing at the end of a short bridge of disaster.

Give me a break, give me a break from you.
Give me a break, give me a break from you.

I can smell your stench from here.
I can smell your stench from here.
I can smell your stench from here.
I can smell your stench from
Your distorted versions of philosophy.
No one is impressed with your long life of self tragedy

And it's no one's fault but yours.
And it's no one's fault but yours.
And it's no one's fault but yours.
And it's no one's fault but yours.

It's no one's fault
