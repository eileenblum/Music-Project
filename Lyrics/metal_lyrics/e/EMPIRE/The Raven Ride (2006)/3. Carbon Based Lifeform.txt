I've seen the light, I got it sussed,
I understand, it's a thing called trust,
You don't treat me right, like I don't belong,
Here on earth, it all seems wrong.
I'm a carbon based life form, and I feel pain
I'm a carbon based life form, I'm not an alien.
There is no future, without some light,
And as you move away, it seems more right,
I've been in the dark, eclipsed by you,
And now I feel some heat, and I see some truth.
I'm a carbon based life form, and I feel pain
I'm a carbon based life form, I'm not an alien.
You talk down to me, as you float around.
You're a shootin star, from a different world.
You're in a solo system, moving away from me,
This space feels cold.
You talk down to me, as you float around.
You're a shootin star, from a different world.
You're in a solo system, moving away from me,
This space feels cold.
You talk down to me, as you float around.
You're a shootin star, from a different world.
You're in a solo system, moving away from me,
This space feels cold.
I'm a carbon based life form, and I feel pain
I'm a carbon based life form, I'm not an alien.
I'm a carbon based life form, and I feel pain
I'm a carbon based life form, I'm not an alien.
I'm not an alien!
