I'm afraid to look, I'm afraid to see
It feels like something is surrounding me,
Looking deep into my soul.
I'm afraid to run, I'm afraid to cry,
It feels like God himself has stepped aside,
And left me here on my own.
My heart has stopped, I can feel my life fading away,
I hear satanic curses, whisper to my soul,
I hear the mystic verses, it's so tempting to just let go.
I'm too scared to hope, I'm too scared to ask,
Just what I'm guilty of that made you so mad,
I just don't know what it is I've done
Here I stand alone, shaking to my bones,
The dreams I used to have, now they're all gone,
is it because I dared to love.
My heart has stopped, I can feel my life fading away,
I hear satanic curses, whisper to my soul,
I hear the mystic verses, it's so tempting to just let go.
I hear satanic curses, whisper to my soul,
I hear the mystic verses, it's so tempting to just let go.
