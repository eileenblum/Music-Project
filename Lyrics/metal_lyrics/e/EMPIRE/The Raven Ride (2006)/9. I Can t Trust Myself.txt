When I'm in your company it's just perfect, you got everything,
Love the way you look at me your eyes just say it, and that's a special thing,
You say things that torment me but it's worth it, tell me anything,
But say you want me, madly, deeply in love, or I'll have to run,
Run away because
I can't trust myself
to leave you alone I can't trust myself no no no,
I can't trust myself to leave you alone
I can't trust myself it's much too much
I wanna touch but it's just too much.
Your smile does things to me, I can't describe it, only wish I could,
Your lips would look good on me, wanna try it, babe I wish you would
I thought that looking wasn't supposed to hurt me, but I'll do anything
Just say you want me, need me, madly in lust, or you'll have to run,
Hide away because
I can't trust myself,
to leave you alone I can't trust myself no no no,
I can't trust myself to leave you alone
I can't trust myself it's much too much
I wanna touch but it's just too much.
From the point of view, of a broken heart,
You're my defibrillator, you jump n I'll start,
You woke me up, when I was dead and gone.
All I have to do, is to make you see,
That if there is no you, then there is no me,
You're the reason why, i do the things I do.
When I'm in your company it's just perfect, you got everything,
Love the way you look at me your eyes just say it, and that's a special thing,
You say things that torment me but it's worth it, tell me anything,
But say you want me, madly, deeply in love, or I'll have to run,
Run away because
But say you want me, madly, deeply in love, or I'll have to run,
Run away because
I can't trust myself
to leave you alone I can't trust myself no no no,
I can't trust myself to leave you alone
I can't trust myself it's much too much
I wanna touch but it's just too much.
I can't trust myself
to leave you alone I can't trust myself no no no,
I can't trust myself to leave you alone
I can't trust myself it's much too much
I wanna touch but it's just too much.
