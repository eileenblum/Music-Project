There's a place where the sun stays low,
And nights when the moon don't glow.
You take a ride into fear,
Have respect for the place you are,
Take stock of your fragile world,
The cliff you hang from is shear.
The friends that you leave behind
Don't have the power to find
What's left of you if you fall
Hold on then to your soul
Climb on, if you're willing to learn
I'll show you how to save your world.
I'm gonna take you on the Raven Ride
We use the shroud of darkness and the power of flight
Like the Shamen, we leave our body behind
We use our souls to fly, The Raven Ride.
Down there where your people fight,
They believe in the freedom rights,
But the more you give them the more they die.
They believe in almighty God
And some that the Devil will come,
But the more they pray for the more they cry.
Up here you can see the truth,
They live by the power of fools,
And believe in the words of a chosen few
Religion is the root of it all,
Believe in them and you lose it all,
And the only question left is why?
I'm gonna take you on the Raven Ride
We use the shroud of darkness and the power of flight
Like the Shamen, we leave our body behind
We use our souls to fly,
The raven ride
I'm gonna take you on the Raven Ride
We use the shroud of darkness and the power of flight
Like the Shamen, we leave our body behind
We use our souls to fly, The Raven Ride.
I'm gonna take you on the Raven Ride
We use the shroud of darkness and the power of flight
Like the Shamen, we leave our body behind
We use our souls to fly, The Raven Ride.
