In the days of creation, you created life,
But you gave us temptation, that really wasn't nice.
You told us we were mortal, then showed us eternity,
In the times of reflection, did you not think how it would be?
You gave us power to reason, a lethal ability,
You made us jealous and evil, and then you made us breathe.
We hate the face you gave us, it's always out of place,
Forever trying to escape, after all, we're the human race,
This fortress you made is faulty, it can't sustain us anymore,
And the legacy is fading, and man has turned to war.
You gave us power to reason, a lethal ability,
You made us jealous and evil, and then you made us breathe.
You gave us power to reason, a lethal ability,
You made us jealous and evil, and then you made us breathe.
You gave us power to reason, a lethal ability,
You made us jealous and evil, and then you made us breathe.
