Thinking back to the times I had when I felt lonely
never felt complete and had the feeling of falling.
Always seemed to recognise other people who felt lonely
I knew them all but you know they didn't know me
Though they never spoke to me or gave me a sign
I could look in their eyes and see that they were the same.
As I walk the street sometimes the feeling returns to me
Oh No, I don't want to go there no more.
Cause I got you now and all my darkness has lifted
And when I think about it, it seems like a curse,
When I look at you I can't believe this gift
Now I keep on waiting for the bubble to burst!
What would I do, what would I do, what would I do.
If you ever gave this gift to someone.
What would I do, what would I do, what would I do.
If you ever gave this gift to someone new.
I feel you with me when I wake in the morning,
I feel you're nearer than the thoughts in my head.
I feel you closer than the body I live in.
When I can't feel anythin at all, It feels like I'm dead.
And that takes me back to the times when I felt lonely
Being incomplete and that feeling of falling,
Then all those people seem to know just how I'm feeling
Though I never look in their eyes or give them a sign.
So I sometimes find myself trying not to think about it,
These days are the best days though it feels like a curse.
When I look at you I can't believe this gift
And I keep on waiting for the bubble to burst!
What would I do, what would I do, what would I do.
If you ever gave this gift to someone.
What would I do, what would I do, what would I do.
If you ever gave this gift to someone new.
Tell me, what would would I do
What would I do
What would I do, what would I do, what would I do.
If you ever gave this gift to someone.
What would I do, what would I do, what would I do.
If you ever gave this gift to someone new.
