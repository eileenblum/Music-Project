Give me more, give me more, for the love of God
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God
I don't believe in small
cause that ain't nothing at all
The more I get the more I want
Turn it on, turn it up, give me more,
Give me everything take it to the end,
Take it to the maximum you can get
Then one more push and you're there, oh yeah.
Give it gas, make it last, kick it's ass,
Whatever it is, if it's on the list
Then you gotta persist, till you got it all,
Cause there's only one life and when it's gone
Y'all done.
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me,
Give it to me, oh.
I want everythin, give me more.
Give me more, give me more.
Give me more, give me more.
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God.
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God.
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God
I don't believe in small
cause that ain't nothing at all
The more I get the more I want
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God.
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God.
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God
Give me more, give me more, for the love of God
