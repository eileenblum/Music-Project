At the end of your days when the time has come for you to die,
Al-Sirat waits for you,
The only way that you can get to the land of paradise,
it's the final test of truth
Only those with a truthful heart can walk the narrow path,
narrower than a spiders thread.
Wicked souls and evil ones they will fall to their death,
below them hell awaits the dead
Sharper than a blade of steel,
It's too late to make a deal,
Below the devil wants you,
Behind your life has left you
Al-Sirat before you,
The bridge to paradise.
As you merge with infinity and you look into the distance,
Al-Sirat appears to you.
Be aware of your first new step from this earthly existence,
to a place intended for the few.
Then the master calls, all the pure souls,
And the exodus begins.
In the time that seems like forever, a thousand more fall down to the reaper,
And you feel the heat beneath your wings.
Sharper than a blade of steel,
It's too late to make a deal,
Below the devil wants you,
Behind your life has left you
Al-Sirat before you,
The bridge to paradise.
He's waiting for your soul,
There's no where else to go,
You gotta walk across the bridge to paradise.
You gotta take the walk of faith,
You're going to a better place,
You gotta walk across the bridge to paradise.
