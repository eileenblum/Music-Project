There is non more evil, than I,
I am supreme evil, they say,
Consider this life, a gift.
Death is nothing at all,
Just a farewell kiss.
But the sun doesn't rise, no more.
And I can't see paradise, no, oh.
Spiraling downward, from your garden of Eden,
Come kings and queens, that spit on their people,
An infinite bleeding, of human remorse,
I've no interest in them, or the worshiping hoars,
We were promised the world, with faith,
And salvation from our sins, if we prayed,
Oh, Sweet Jesus, what did we do?
We gave our souls to you, yeah, I'm beggin you please,
Oh God, we failed again.
But the sun doesn't rise, no more.
And I can't see paradise, No, oh.
We were promised the world, with faith,
And salvation from our sins, if we prayed.
