Everything's going up in smoke
I'm beginning to choke
I can't feel the sun shine on my face.
People fighting for this
People fighting for that
Just another curse on the human race.
And the sea is rising
And the world is warming.
And the stars are fading more each day.
It's a changing world, that we're living in.
It's a changing world, that we're living in.
We pray together and sing
It seems such a simple thing,
But times have changed and no one seems to hear,
Government politician speaks
Says the answers are on the streets
But days are dark and no one seems to care.
Now the sea is rising
And the world is warming.
And the stars are fading more each day.
It's a changing world, that we're living in.
It's a changing world, that we're living in.
It's a changing world, that we're living in.
It's a changing world, that we're living in.
It's a changing world, that we're living in.
It's a changing world, that we're living in.
It's a changing world, that we're living in.
It's a changing world, that we're living in.
