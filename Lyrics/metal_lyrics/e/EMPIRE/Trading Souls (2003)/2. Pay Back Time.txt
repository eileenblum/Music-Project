They said the time is right, for us to start our mission
We're set to kill and fight, one law, one decision.
They created reasons.
Pentagram the devils sign,
In the circle of destruction,
Evil lords are trading souls.
Pay back time, time to pay back mine
We are losing time, killing time we wasted
Lonely souls, Pay back time, time to pay back mine
We are losing time, killing time we wasted
Lonely souls
They put death in hand, they know why we're here
Don't think just believe, we can't win with fear
They created evil.
Pentagram the devils sign,
In the circle of destruction,
Evil lords are trading souls.
Pay back time, time to pay back mine
We are losing time, killing time we wasted
Lonely souls, Pay back time, time to pay back mine
We are losing time, killing time we wasted
Lonely souls
Soldier, is it real? can you feel?
I'm by your side, you can not die.
Pay back time, time to pay back mine
We are losing time, killing time we wasted
Lonely souls, Pay back time, time to pay back mine
We are losing time, killing time we wasted
Lonely souls
Pay back time, time to pay back mine
We are losing time, killing time we wasted
Lonely souls, Pay back time, time to pay back mine
We are losing time, killing time we wasted
Lonely souls
