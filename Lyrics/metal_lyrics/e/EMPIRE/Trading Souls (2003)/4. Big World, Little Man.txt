I was born with nothing, you had everything
I got a cloud that follows me around you got
Everythin you need
You think this world is for free, ain't got time to make you see
I don't care what you got, it doesn't matter to me
You got a lot but one thing you ain't got is
Peace and harmony,
You think this world is for free, ain't got time to make you see, Oh no.
Big world little man life isn't yours to fool with, you'll lose it
Big man little world to much to lose, believe it, I mean it
Time ran out for you, only dust remains
Pickin up the pieces ain't gonna work
At the end of your arrogant games
You think that life is for free, ain't got time to make you see
Big world little man life isn't yours to fool with, you'll lose it
Big man little world too much to lose, believe it, I mean it, alright
Big world little man life isn't yours to fool with, you'll lose it
Big world little man life isn't yours you'll lose it
You think you got all the answers
And money buys you friends
You ain't got no time for reasons
It's a big world for a little man
Big world little man life isn't yours to fool with, you'll lose it
Big man little world too much to lose, believe it, I mean it, alright
Big world little man life isn't yours to fool with, you'll lose it
Big world little man life isn't yours you'll lose it
It's a big world for a little man
