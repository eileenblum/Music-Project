So many places on my way, whatever the price I had to pay
Broken illusions where I stay.
I cried every name but no one hears
I've seen the sunrise through my tears.
I've been waiting so long, for my chances to come,
Endless lonely nights on my own
Then she came into my life
Stars in her eyes, she's one in a million, one in a million,
Stars in her eyes, she's one in a million to me.
How could I know you needed me, I was a fool, too blind to see.
I've been waiting so long, for my chances to come,
Endless lonely nights on my own
Then she came into my life
Stars in her eyes, she's one in a million, one in a million,
Stars in her eyes, she's one in a million to me.
Stars in her eyes, there's no one else, she's one in a million,
Stars in her eyes, she's one in a million to me.
She's got stars in her eyes, she's one in a million, one in a million,
Stars in her eyes, she's one in a million to me.
Stars in her eyes, I was a fool, I was a fool,
Stars in her eyes, she's one in a million to me.
Stars in her eyes, she means so much to me
