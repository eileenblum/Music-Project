Without a doubt I'm hurting, I'm hurting deep inside
So deep the fire is dying, It's giving up its light
The dark is at its blackest, I cried all the tears that I can cry
Till there's nothing left of you
Oh, it feels like I've been drowning in my years
It's only you that saved me from my fears
So pleased to see the morning light again
My world is dead and you killed it with the things you did
My life is better without you in it you're a teenage deadhead.
You've taken all the best things, and made them seem so wrong
I didn't even notice, till all the love was gone
And now I feel so stupid, that I let you make me feel that way
I see it clearly now
Oh, it feels like I've been drowning in my years
It's only you that saved me from my fears
So pleased to see the morning light again
My world is dead and you killed it with the things you did
My life is better without you in it you're a teenage deadhead.
Oh, I feel so lonely don't you know
I've given all I have to give
Oh, I feel that I've been wastin all my years
Oh yeah, Baby Baby Baby Please Yeah!
My world is dead and you killed it with the things you did
My life is better without you in it you're a teenage deadhead
