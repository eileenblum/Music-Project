I remember, how I shared my dreams with you
I remember, that I gave my dreams to you,
Still remember, getting lost inside of you
Still remember, revealing something new
I know you stopped believing and I need to know.
Did you ever love me, did you ever need me, like the way I needed you
Did you ever love me, did you ever hear me, didn't you know that I needed you
Did you ever feel me, did you ever see me, I gave it all, all to you
I gave it all to you
When you're smiling, I begin to feel the pain
I know you're lying, but my love for you smothers the shame
Still believing, I'm feeling somethin new.
I know you stopped believing and I need to know.
Did you ever love me, did you ever need me, like the way I needed you
Did you ever love me, did you ever hear me, didn't you know that I needed you
Please, feel me, see me, You know I gave it all, all to you
I gave it all to you
Did you ever love me, did you ever need me, like the way I needed you
Did you ever love me, did you ever hear me, didn't you know that I needed you
Please, love me, did you ever need me, like the way I needed you
Did you ever love me, did you ever hear me, didn't you know that I needed you
