Back in the light, Black is the night music that kills, can't stand the screaming
Need something new, tired of the view I need to change, the way that I'm feeling
Here in my world, feels like it's turned inside out, downloader choosing
Play me the sound, that I love best music that rocks the world right through
I just need some Rock'n Roll
Don't need crap to stir my soul
LL Cooler leaves me cold
Back in the light, Back in the light
Back in the spotlight
Where the music rocks my soul
Where the music rocks my soul
You know the words, sing till it hurts jump up and down, keep it moving
Give me the night, got music with bite together we stand, keep it living
Show me your hands, get up and dance honey it's now or never
This ain't a joke, we're ready to go let there be Rock forever
I just need some Rock'n Roll
Don't need crap to stir my soul
Crazy music leaves me cold
Back in the light, Back in the light
Back in the spotlight
Where the music rocks my soul
Back in the light, Back in the light
Back in the spotlight
Where the music rocks my soul
Where the music rocks my soul
I love ya, move me, then you, use me, Oh, tease me
Hold me in your arms forever and ever and never let the music go
Back in the light, Back in the light
Back in the spotlight
Where the music rocks my soul
I'm back in the light, I'm back in the spotlight
I'm back in the light
Where the music rocks my soul
I'm back in the light, Oh I'm back in the light
It's the sound that I love oh the music rocks my soul
It's the music that rocks my soul
