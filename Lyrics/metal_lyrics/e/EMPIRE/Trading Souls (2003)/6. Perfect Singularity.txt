Another perfect day, it's me to take the blame again
One more push and I might fall
Another lonely night, I'm crushed to the ground without you
No one is near to hear my call
People like you, pass me by, without a second glance
But that's o.k. I don't cry, you don't get a second chance
I'm no one without you, nobody but me
I'm no one without you, perfect singularity
Another lonely flight, my wings are strained I feel the air rush by
If only I could glide
After all is said, there's only one more thing to do
Find a place to rest my soul
People like you, pass me by, without a second glance
But that's o.k. I don't cry, there's no second chance
I'm no one without you, nobody but me
I'm no one without you, you don't care you don't see
I'm no one without you, nobody but me
I'm no one without you, perfect singularity
I'm no one without you, nobody but me
I'm no one without you, nobody but me
I'm no one without you, nobody but me
I'm no one without you, I'm nobody but me
I'm no one without you, nobody but me
