You keep on telling me your lies
There is no truth behind your eyes
You pray for silence when I scream
I'm always walking by your side
Just like a shadow in the night
Begging for mercy when I'm near.
I will place fear inside you
I'm walking right behind you
My breath is getting closer
Your life I'm taking over.
Don't you know wherever you go I'm here, right here
Don't you know wherever you go I'm here right here
You'll pray for darkness in your dreams
Where you can hide your fears and screams
If only death was on your side
I will place fear inside you
I'm walking right behind you
I'll set your world on fire
and take away desire
Don't you know wherever you go I'm here, right here
Don't you know wherever you go I'm here right here
Don't you know wherever you go I'm here, right here
Don't you know wherever you go I'm here right here
Don't you know wherever you go I'm here, right here
Don't you know wherever you go I'm here right here
