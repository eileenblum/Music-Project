I came to this place, and could not believe you were hiding
I wonder if you listen to me, hear the words I'm saying
Where have you been, so many questions left unanswered
Angel of sin, are you really in my mind.
I need to know now.
You, tell me the truth, tell me the secret of that illusion
Life, is it a dream, is it a fantasy?
You, tell me the truth, hiding the meaning of life forever
Hey, I'm talking to you, can you hear me now.
I'm losing my faith, day after day my world is slowly dying
If I can't ask how do I know you ain't lying
Where have you been, so many questions left unanswered
Angel of sin, are you really in my mind.
I need to know now.
You, tell me the truth, tell me the secret of that illusion
Life, is it a dream, is it a fantasy?
You, tell me the truth, hiding the meaning of life forever
Hey, I'm talking to you, can you hear me now.
You, tell me the truth, tell me the secret of that illusion
Life, is it a dream, is it a fantasy?
You, tell me the truth, hiding the meaning of life forever
Hey, I'm talking to you, can you hear me now.
You, tell me the truth, tell me the secret of that illusion
Life, is it a dream, is it a fantasy?
You, tell me the truth, hiding the meaning of life forever
Hey, I'm talking to you, can you hear me now.
