Don't try to teach me, how to act,
I don't need a teacher, and that's a fact,
I take comfort from simple things,
I get nervous with a stranger in my dreams.
It ain't a lot to ask, I don't live too fast, I need a life to call my own
Let it slide, come along for the ride,
You can help to satisfy my troubled mind
But if you try to hold me or tie me down
Well I just don't need it, I'll survive alone.
It ain't a lot to ask, I don't live too fast, I need a life to call my own
I love your company, I want you near to me, cause you reach inside my soul.
So I, I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Cause I'm tired of being on the road
I get inspiration, from penetration,
But I can live without it, It ain't everything.
We can take some moonlight, and a little wine,
We could just talk for a while, I ain't an unreasonable man
It ain't a lot to ask, I don't live too fast, I need a life to call my own
I love your company, I want you near to me, cause you reach inside my soul.
So I, I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Don't wanna live on my own
I'm coming home, alright
I'm coming home, yeah
I'm coming home, cause I'm tired of being alone
I'm coming home, and I feel good about it
I'm coming home, cause I've been on the road too long
