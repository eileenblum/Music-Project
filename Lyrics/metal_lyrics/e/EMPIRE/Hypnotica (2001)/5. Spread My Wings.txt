Take a look around me, tell me what you see
Broken hearted people, staring back at me
Falling, they are falling, till the walls come tumblin' down

Watch their million memories, watch their broken dreams
Crushed and feeling angry, life ain't what it seems
Waiting, it's like waiting 'til their walls come tumblin' down

I've been to many places, there's nothing really new
Surrender in their faces, gonna reach the simple truth
Dreaming, I'm dreaming, but my walls come crumblin' down

I find myself in sadness, too many tears I've cried
The times is right for changes, I leave it all behind
Screamin', I'm screamin' 'til my walls come crumblin' down

Never look around me, or care about what you see
Broken hearted people, always walking underneath
Headed for tomorrow, reaching for the sky
Grab our stuff together, we will never ask you why...

I'll put a light on me, I'll put a light on you
I'll put a light on the stage, gonna spread my wings and fly
I'll put a light on me, I'll put a light on you
I'll put a light on the stage, gonna spread my wings and fly

Living our future, the best is yet to come
Never stop for red lights, fights have made us strong
Sure we learned our lessons, we promise not to cry
We're ready for tomorrow, we'll leave the past behind

I'll put a light on me, I'll put a light on you
I'll put a light on the stage, gonna spread my wings and fly
I'll put a light on me, I'll put a light on you
I'll put a light on the stage, gonna spread my wings and fly
I'll put a light on me, I'll put a light on you
I'll put a light on the stage, gonna spread my wings and fly
I'll put a light on me, I'll put a light on you
I'll put a light on the stage, gonna spread my wings and fly
I'll put a light on me, I'll put a light on you
I'll put a light on the stage, gonna spread my wings and fly
I'll put a light on me, I'll put a light on you
I'll put a light on the stage, gonna spread my wings and fly
