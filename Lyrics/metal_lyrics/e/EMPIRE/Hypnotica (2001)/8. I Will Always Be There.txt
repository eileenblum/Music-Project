It's not that easy
To believe that there's a fire
It's burning inside me
Like a never ending force
I open myself to you
And I know it makes me weak
But it's my desire
(It's) my passion and my dream

You're one step away
Hear what I say
You can't steel my soul
It's open and it's true

Sure
I will always be there
Just take my heart and take my hand
Sure
I will always be there
It ain't hard to understand
Sure
I will always be there
Straight to your heart and you should know
Hope
That you're waitin' for me
And I'll never let you go

I think it's clever
To defy that wicked game
You better be careful
It's a hard and painful strain
Keep on resisting
It's like laughing through your tears
I know you will make it
So the fire will remain

You're one step away
Hear what I say
You can't steel my soul
It's open and it's true

Sure
I will always be there
Just take my heart and take my hand
Sure
I will always be there
It ain't hard to understand
Sure
I will always be there
Straight to your heart and you should know
Hope
That you're waitin' for me
And I'll never let you go

Sure
I will always be there
Just take my heart and take my hand
Sure
I will always be there
It ain't hard to understand
Sure
I will always be there
Straight to your heart and you should know
Hope
That you're waitin' for me
And I'll never let you go...
