I woke up last night and thought that you were sleeping
I looked around and you, you're not there
The smell of your perfume is fading in the doorway
Now without a word, I'm sure that you're gone

So clear now what I must do
My heart has shown me the way back to you

I'm in love, though I thought it wouldn't last forever
I'm in love, glad to see, it ain't over baby
Fool in love, I don't care if it last forever
Fool in love, I don't care what they say

I watched the stars, tried to stop, thinkin' about you baby
Again I look around, but your, your nowhere to be found
I should have known, without your love, life just ain't worth livin'
How can I face this pain, without you by my side

So clear now what I must do
My heart is showing the way back to you

I'm in love, though I thought it wouldn't last forever
I'm in love, glad to see, it ain't over baby
Fool in love, I don't care if it last forever
Fool in love, I don't care what they say

I'm in love, though I thought it wouldn't last forever
I'm in love, glad to see, it ain't over baby
Fool in love, I don't care if it last forever
Fool in love, I don't care what they say
I'm in love, though I thought it wouldn't last forever
I'm in love, glad to see, it ain't over baby
Fool in love, I don't care if it last forever
Fool in love, I don't care what they say
