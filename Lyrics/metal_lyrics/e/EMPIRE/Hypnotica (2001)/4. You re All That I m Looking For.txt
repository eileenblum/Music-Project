I got the power, I got all the things I need
A big sensation, makes you fall on your knees
I guess I'm a wild, wild one
And you're not the only, only one, but I need you now...
Passion... leads you
Loving... feeds you
Elation... moves you
All that I'm looking for, is so hard to say
You're all that I'm looking for, show me the way

No reason to hide, before the night is through
I wanna be with you, put all my love into you
I've waited so long, dreaming of you every night
Too many phone calls, gonna catch the next flight

I guess I'm a wild, wild one
And you're not the only, only one, but I need you now...
Passion... leads you
Loving... feeds you
Elation... moves you
All that I'm looking for, is so hard to say
You're all that I'm looking for, show me the way

You're all that I'm looking for, You're so far away
You're all that I'm looking for, there's no more to say
You're all that I'm looking for, I need you to stay
You're all that I'm looking for, show me the way
You're all that I'm looking for, You're so far away
You're all that I'm looking for, there's no more to say
