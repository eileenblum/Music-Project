I've been thinkin' about you,
I took a look at your masquerade my friend
I've been walking beside you
I was wasting my time with you
Your a little too late, gonna change your fate

And I know it's not that easy
And I know it's just a game

Never thinkin' about me
You don't care what I see or what I feel
Never lookin' around you,
Too blind to see what is fake or real
I was wasting my time with you
Your a little too late, gonna change your fate

And I know it's not that easy
And I know it's just a game that you play

When you're fallin' down on your knees
Don't come crawlin' back to me
When you're fallin' wish you could see
My laughing face when your beggin' for me

Nothin' special about you
You crossed that line now it's time for something new
Better make it without you
I was wastin' my time with you
Your a little too late, gonna change your fate

And I know it's not that easy
And I know it's just a game that you play

When you're fallin' down on your knees
Don't come crawlin' back to me
When you're fallin' wish you could see
My laughing face when your beggin' for me

When you're fallin' down on your knees
Don't come crawlin' back to me
When you're fallin' wish you could see
My laughing face when your beggin' for me
Hear my callin' now it's too late
One more reason I won't ask you to stay
When you're fallin' down on your knees
Don't come crawlin' back to me
