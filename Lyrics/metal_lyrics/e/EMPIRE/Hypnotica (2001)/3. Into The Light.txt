You prayed for silence
You played the fool
Hidden in the shadows
Of the darkest nights

Stumblin' and fallin'
Slave to their rules
Compelled to promise
A human sacrifice

When I'm falling
I'm still calling out your name
I feel like burning
And I'll shout it out

Take a look in the mirror
Tell me what you see
Your body's tremblin', shakin'
A clown without a name

Runnin' 'round in circles
Lost in their game
Without reflection
Like a puppet on a string

When I'm falling
I'm still calling out your name
I feel like burning
And I'll shout it out

Into the light
Gonna break the chains that bind me
Into the light
Gonna leave the past behind me
Into the light
There's a sign for inspiration
Out of the night

There is a shadow
Walking next to you
Crazy situation
You don't know what to do

Take a look behind you
Ready for the turn?
Take the final step into
A world that eases pain

Still I'm falling
When I'm calling out your name
I feel I'm burning
I will scream and shout

Into the light
Gonna break the chains that bind me
Into the light
Gonna leave the past behind me
Into the light
There's a sign for inspiration
Out of the night
There's a magic force to guide you
Into the light
Where a day could last forever
Into the light
Can't you see it's now or never
Into the light
Wanna reach for something higher
Into the light
