Is there any sense of pain or evil?
Is there any reason to have fear?
Turn your lights off, waiting for the devil
You can't fall asleep while he is near

I will never stand up when he's calling
I will never pray when he's gone

Give me shelter, shelter from the storm
I need shelter, I lost and feeling torn

See him walk through walls like a nightmare
He will never ask you what you think
Never close your eyes, he's always right there
Watch you back feel your stomach sink

I will never stand up when he's calling
I will never pray when he's gone
Trusting in the way the rain is falling
Wipe away the clouds to see the sun

Give me shelter, shelter from the storm
I need shelter, I lost and feeling torn
(lost and feeling torn)
Give me shelter, shelter from the storm
I'm cold and tired of waiting for the dawn

Give me shelter, shelter from the storm
I need shelter, I lost and feeling torn
(lost and feeling torn)
Give me shelter, shelter from the storm
I'm cold and tired of waiting for the dawn
(of waiting for the dawn)
Give me shelter, shelter from the storm
I need shelter, I lost and feeling torn
(lost and feeling torn)
