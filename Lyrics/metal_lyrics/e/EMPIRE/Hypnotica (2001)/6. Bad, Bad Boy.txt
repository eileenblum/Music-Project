You gave me the reason
I hide the truth behind a lie
Every now and then cheatin'
Another day is passing by
You say I'm devoted to treason
Evil from my head to my toes
Oh I'm finally beaten
Who's the one to pay the most

Only the strong survive
How can I survive...tonight

Am I the only one, I guess I'm a bad, bad boy
Is it's the final run, I guess I'm a sad, sad boy
Can it be overcome, I guess I'm a bad, bad boy
Waited for way to long, I guess I'm a bad, bad boy

Oh a change of the season
Gone with the wind and blown away
No more mistreatin'
The ones beggin' you to stay
Now I'm believin'
I'm happier right here than there
Finally achievin'
The love that we long to share

Only the strong survive
How can I survive...the night

Am I the only one, I guess I'm a bad, bad boy
Is it's the final run, I guess I'm a sad, sad boy
Can it be overcome, I guess I'm a bad, bad boy
Waited for way to long, I guess I'm a bad, bad boy

Am I the only one, I guess I'm a bad, bad boy
Is it's the final run, I guess I'm a sad, sad boy
Can it be overcome, I guess I'm a bad, bad boy
Waited for way to long, I guess I'm a bad, bad boy
Am I the only one, I guess I'm a bad, bad boy
Is it's the final run, I guess I'm a sad, sad boy
