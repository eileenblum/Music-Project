Troubles knockin' at my door, still I feel the booze
Jacki-D or open up the door, don't know what to choose.
Phone is ringing loud at noon, voices ringin' in my ear
Time to overcome depression, living behind my fears

I'll shake you up, I'll bring you down babe
It's rising strait before your eyes

Another place another time
(another chance is passing by)
Another place another time
(now it's time to say goodbye)
Another place another time
(time to kiss your love goodbye)
Another place another time
Baby I...Oh yeah that's what I'm talking about

Late at night I find myself, lyin' in her bed
Got to rush away, it's morning the look on her face so sad
Finally I grab stuff got nothin' more to loose
Moving on from town to town, gonna light up like a fuse

I'll shake you up, I'll bring you down babe
It's rising strait before your eyes

Another place another time
(another chance is passing by)
Another place another time
(now it's time to say goodbye)
Another place another time
(time to kiss your love goodbye)
Another place another time

Another place another time
(another chance is passing by)
Another place another time
(now it's time to say goodbye)
Another place another time
(time to kiss your love goodbye)
Another place another time
(another chance is passing by)
Another place another time
(now it's time to say goodbye)
Another place another time
(time to kiss your love goodbye)
Another place another time
(another chance is passing by)
Another place another time
(now it's time to say goodbye)
Another place another time
(time to kiss your love goodbye)
Another place another time
(another chance is passing by)
Another place another time
(now it's time to say goodbye)
Another place another time
