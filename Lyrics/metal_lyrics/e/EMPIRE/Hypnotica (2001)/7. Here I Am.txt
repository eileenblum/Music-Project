I was down and feelin' lonely
I was screamin' out your name
I never did enjoy it
Full of pain and sacrifice
I had a long way behind me
You were never taking care
I was bleeding beside you
So much pain but you didn't see...
That I was dying, I couldn't stand the way you treated me
And I was crying, tell me why you can't believe in me
How can I be strong?
How can I go on?

Here I am
I'm nobody's fool
Here I am I'm back in the race again
Don't you see
I have made it without you
Don't you see I'm finding my way again

You were never believin'
That it hurts the way that you talk
Never care that you're lying
Even lying to yourself see...
That I was dying, I couldn't stand the way you treated me
And I was crying, tell me why you can't believe in me
How can I be strong?
How can I go on?

Here I am
I'm nobody's fool
Here I am I'm back in the race again
Don't you see
I have made it without you
Don't you see I'm finding my way again

Your words speak with power
Ripping down concrete walls
Chilling ache of darkened halls
Warm me with your velvet tears
I was lost in a world of anger
Love seemed to be out of bounds
You gave off a scent of danger
And a love not easily found

Here I am
I'm nobody's fool
Here I am I'm back in the race again
Don't you see
I have made it without you
Don't you see I'm finding my way again
Here I am
I'm nobody's fool
Here I am I'm back in the race again
Don't you see
I have made it without you
Don't you see I'm finding my way again
Here I am
I'm nobody's fool
Here I am I'm back in the race again
Don't you see
I have made it without you
Don't you see I'm finding my way again
