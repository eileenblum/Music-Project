Show me the road to Calvary
I'll show you the cross where I died
I scream life is for ever if you follow me
Anything else is a lie

Ah heavenly

Show me the tomb where my body lay
The stone that rolled away
Walk in the garden of Gethsemane
Mary don't run Mary don't run

Heavenly father my time is now at hand
Heavenly father tell me will I rise

I am (the) Manic Messiah
I feel glorious
I am the Manic Messiah
My light will always shine on you

Here are the nails and my crown of thorns
That caused me so much pain
If I'm not the one who can save them all
Tell me did I die in vain

Heavenly father my time is now at hand
Heavenly father tell me will I rise

I am (the) Manic Messiah
I feel glorious
I am the Manic Messiah
My light will always shine on you

Ah heavenly

The wind that sweeps over the desert sands
The evil that blacks out the sun
The eyes of the blind fall on foreign lands
Pray for the daylight pray for the day
