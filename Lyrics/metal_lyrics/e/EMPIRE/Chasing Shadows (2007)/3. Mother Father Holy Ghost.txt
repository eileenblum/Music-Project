I am made of steel you are broken glass
I can make you feel the echo from the past
Moonlight a serenade daylight the masquerade
Time waits in the wings speaks of love and secret things

The spirit is willing the body is weak cry for the chosen
The passing of time is no friend of mine as we pass down the road

Mother father holy ghost who's the one that we trust the most
When the end comes to call who will be there
Mother father holy ghost who's the one that we trust the most
The cry of the raven fills the air

Sail on silver seas sundown's refuges
With god beside us who can fail holy love, holy hell
Thunder and lightning strikes the wheel turns through the night
Silence as one appears the mirror won't hide the years

The scream of the siren that shatters
The sky and in our hearts
Words that can chill us and freeze to the bone
As we search for a home

Mother father holy ghost who's the one that we trust the most
When the end comes to call who will be there
Mother father holy ghost who's the one that we trust the most
The cry of the raven fills the air

Don't you listen to faded godheads
Don't you listen to word of false prophets
