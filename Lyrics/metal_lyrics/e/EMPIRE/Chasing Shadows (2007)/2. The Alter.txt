Lights in the distance we're travelling over the land and the sea
There's no resistance to the power corruption and greed
Speak with me holy man look me in the eye
Bleed with me holy man today is a good day to die

Kneel at the alter pray to your god
Lambs to the slaughter
Mercy from above
Kneel at the alter
Cast of your sins
Beg for forgiveness now it begins

The cry of the fallen is echoing over the land
One faded godhead intent in destroying mankind
Who then will save us who will pass the test
As evil surrounds us
How long will the suffering last

Kneel at the alter pray to your god
Lambs to the slaughter
Mercy from above
Kneel at the alter
Cast of your sins
Beg for forgiveness now it begins
