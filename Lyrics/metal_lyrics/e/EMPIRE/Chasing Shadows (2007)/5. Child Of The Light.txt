Just look behind you, in the shadows there's a man you cannot see
Just look behind you and you'll see this man is me
Don't trust the starlight on a dark night
Don't believe in fantasy
Don't look for magic in this world of make believe

You're a child of the light, let the light be your friend
You're a child of the light, soon your darkness will end
Child of the light, child of the light, child of the light

They say we're different, point the finger
But to me they are all the same
Don't try to hide it, just embrace it, then we'll win
We'll come together, getting stronger
They can't steal our hearts away
And remember if you need me I'll be there

You're a child of the light, let the light be your friend
You're a child of the light, soon your darkness will end
Child of the light, child of the light, child of the light

Together we are stronger
Together we are standing tall
Child of the light

You're a child of the light, let the light be your friend
You're a child of the light, soon your darkness will end
Child of the light, child of the light, child of the light

Let me guide you let me walk beside you
Child of the light
