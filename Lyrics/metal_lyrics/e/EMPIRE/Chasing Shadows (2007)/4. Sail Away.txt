Don't be reckless don't be foolish
Don't go wasting all the things that you adore
Don't be hasty but don't be nervous
Don't be listening to the voices in the dark
Cause when you call who will listen
Who will catch you when you fall or hold you when you're breaking down

Sail away we'll ride out on the ocean
Far out from the world that means to bring you down
Sail away we'll ride out on the ocean
Far out from the world that means you harm
Sail away, sail away

Don't be anxious, don't seek pity
Don't leave footprints on the sand for them to find
Don't be angry, don't be spiteful
Don't you fall asleep with trouble on your mind
Cause when you scream who will comfort
Who will hold your breaking heart or kiss you very tenderly

Sail away we'll ride out on the ocean
Far out from the world that means to bring you down
Sail away we'll ride out on the ocean
Far out from the world that means you harm
Sail away, sail away
