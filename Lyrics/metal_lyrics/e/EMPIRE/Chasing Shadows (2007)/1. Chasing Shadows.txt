Breathing new life into your world
Can you feel the change?
The fears that you hold, drift into the night
As the daylights ends

You need a reason to love
You need a reason to throw it away
You need a reason to love
Embracing your pain as a friend now
(Give me your hand and I'll lead you)

As I lie down beside you are you afraid
I wont turn away

I am the darkness, I am the light
I'll see you through this storm tonight
Waiting for sunrise to brighten, light the day/way
I am the one to chase the shadows away

We'll walk on the store
Like all those before
As we find our way
Follow your heart
We'll go back to the start
Find when the nightmare began

Give me a reason to love
Give me a reason to throw it away
Give me a reason to love
Embracing your pain as a friend now

As I lie down beside you are you afraid
I wont turn away

I am the darkness, I am the light
I'll see you through this storm tonight
Out of the shadows and into the light
I am the one to chase your shadows away

I am the darkness, I am the light
I'll see you through this storm tonight
Safe from the lightening
Safe from all harm
I am the one who will keep you warm

Safe from the darkness safe in the light
I am the one who will keep you safe tonight
Lost on the ocean lost in the storm
I am the one who will safe you from harm
