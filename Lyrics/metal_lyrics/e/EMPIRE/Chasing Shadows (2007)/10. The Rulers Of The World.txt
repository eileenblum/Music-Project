Look through the glass through the gates to the path
As we search for a world we once knew
Hurt from the sin as our world closes in
And we know we can never return

We turned our backs on all that keeps us safe inside our beds
They feed us lies to feed the greed we listen but never learn
A sympathetic word
Just open your eyes open your eyes

We are the rulers of the world
We bring destruction and pain
We are the rulers of the world
Come follow me come follow me
I can help you learn to live again
Rulers of the world
Rulers of the world
Rulers of the world
Rulers of the world

See how they hide in their lairs out of sight
As the young and the poor go to war
Their children are safe and the dream of a place where
The angels and virgins run riot

They sold our dreams and freedom on the back of blackened gold
Sold us down the river now it's turned to desert sand
Sympathy for the damned
Righteousness be damned

We are the rulers of the world
We bring destruction and pain
We are the rulers of the world
Come follow me come follow me
I can help you learn to live again
Rulers of the world
Rulers of the world
Rulers of the world
Rulers of the world
