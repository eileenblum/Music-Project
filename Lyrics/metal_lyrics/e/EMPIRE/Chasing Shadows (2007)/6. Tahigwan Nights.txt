In a darkened room in the Highlands
So close to the waters edge
Wine mixed with the starlight
What was done and what was said
I could tell that we had a reason
I could feel the majesty in the air
We were there on a wild Tahigwan night

The spirit starts to move
I can't hear my voice it gets lost among the big noise
The fire burned so deep
And if I live a thousand years
They'll be treasures that I keep

Oh thanks for the memories
Seems to be good time pass to soon

In a lonely room in a strange land
Blowing smoke rings in the air
Crushed live like my passion
Lying on the empty streets
Sweet curse of confusion
Now I know my time is at hand
It's getting closer to daybreak
This time I'm moving on

The spirit lost it's way
But don't let us cast the blame
I can still recall your name
And if the timings ever right
We can build the bridge we burnt
Cause I'm sure that we have learned

Oh thanks for the memories
Seems to be good time pass to soon
Oh thanks for the memories
Even though we live on distant shores
