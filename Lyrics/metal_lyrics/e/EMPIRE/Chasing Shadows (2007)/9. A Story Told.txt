Are we the sons of god
Are we his chosen people
Kings of the universe
A challenge to face us all nations will rise or fall
Knowing the time is at hand
Behind the mask lies the tears of frustration
Tears at the heart of every nation

Tell me the story of how we'll save the world
Tell me the story of how we'll save us all
Tell me the story of how to save the world

Are we the sons of god
Are we his chosen people
Living in desperate times
How can we make a choice we don't even hear the voices
A world crippled on her knees
Behind the lies and the tales of confusion
The good things we have
We take and abuse them

Tell me the story of how we'll save the world
Tell me the story of how we'll save us all
Tell me the story of how to save the world

The rivers have dried up the oceans are filling up

Tell me the story of how we'll save the world
Tell me the story of how we'll save us all
Tell me the story of how to save the world
Tell me tell me
