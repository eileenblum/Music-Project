I made my deal with the devil and he dealt my cards
Thought I'd learned my lesson but I pushed to hard
I made my deal with the devil just to buy you one more day
He laughed at me and then he walked away
Walked away nothing left to say

Well I know my soul is burning, burning kinda not
Tears that fill my eyes they fall like rain
And I looking for an answer but it's very hard to find

I am the angel and the gambler but I couldn't save ya

Been sleeping through the long night been wondering where you gone
My emptiness is more that I can bear
I would give my soul to have you here for one more day
Seems to be the world ain't made that way
I'd have given everything to hold you in my arms
Or just to hear you footsteps on the stairs

I made my deal with the devil and he dealt my cards
Thought I'd learned my lesson but I pushed to hard
I made my deal with the devil just to buy you one more day
He laughed at me and then he walked away
Walked away nothing left to say
