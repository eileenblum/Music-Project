[feat. Christian Vidal]Just a night and I can't hold you once
Keep you safe inside my arms
I must slow down
Just a night and I can't touch the pale of your soul
Don't want to let you go 

Who you are? and will you call someday?
Will you stay or we will fail?
I must slow down, I must slow down
Just a sight and I have tasted what others call lust
For I have sinned, this game of love

Here we are
Face to face now
...I've waited for so long.
Us alone, for the night goes by
Take my breath
Lead me through the dark 

You can be Heaven and Hell
Living and killing the thoughts in my head
You can run far... far away
Oh, but tonight
Save my Life

Days are gone, I feel alone again.
I Hear your voice in every pray.
I can't slow down, I want you now.
For a night I'd sell my soul, renounce to all known. 
Oh, would you feel this game of love?

Here we are
Face to face now
...I've waited for so long.
Us alone, for the night goes by
Take my breath
Lead me through the dark

You can be Heaven and Hell
Living and killing the thoughts in my head
You can run far... far away
Oh, but tonight
Save my Life 

I did try and I fear no more
'Cause I will try a thousand times again 
no matter how
(I'll be there for you)
Please don't go
you can save my life

You can be Heaven and Hell
Living and killing the thoughts in my head
You'll have my heart till the end
Take it tonight
Save my Life
