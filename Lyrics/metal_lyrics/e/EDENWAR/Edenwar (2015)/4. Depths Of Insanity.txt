[feat. Chen Balbus, Fabio Lione &amp; Idan Amsalem]Secrets inside of a mind without sleep
Sorrow has turned him aware... conscious being
I will be so lost

Run in the dark so you can stay alive
Drawing the circles to haunt your own back
I will be so lost
Oh I feel so lost

[FABIO LIONE]
Welcome to my forsaken land feel free to come in
(Feel free to die)
I've heard some stories of your past I've heard your calling
(I've heard you mourning)

[ANNA]
Don't know where to run
Don't know who I am
Was lost in the dark
And now here I stand

I'm falling and falling and falling I fall
I'm falling and fooling the fool of my own

[ANNA FIORI &amp; FABIO LIONE]
Voices are drowning me into depths of insanity
No one is coming No one is coming back
You can't escape from fate
You're never coming back to life

[FABIO LIONE]
Reaching the end
you can't pretend to be forgotten
I've wrote your lines I'll take your life

What is mine is mine
Welcome to my forsaken land
No one is coming back
And you will be our guest

[ANNA FIORI &amp; FABIO LIONE]
Voices are drowning me into depths of insanity
No one is coming No one is coming back
Voices are drowning me into depths of insanity
No one is coming No one is coming back
You can't escape from fate
You're never coming back to life
