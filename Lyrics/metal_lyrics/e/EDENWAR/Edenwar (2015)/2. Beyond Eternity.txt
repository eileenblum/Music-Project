[feat. Timo Somers]There is a man
Whose eyes are bleeding
He owns the time 
and he just wants another life

The years go by
He's so aware of it
He's all alone
leading the darkest fate

Screaming in the night
Waiting to sleep and never coming back
Waiting the moment to arise
and lead us through...

Trust in me and stand beyond eternity
Find a reason to survive
Embrace the sprouts of time
beware, prepare for war

Here comes the man
The clock is ticking
He owns the time
and he owns our lives
Screaming in the night
We'll find a way to change what we've denied 

Trust in me and stand beyond eternity
Find a reason to survive
Embrace the sprouts of time
beware, prepare fo war
