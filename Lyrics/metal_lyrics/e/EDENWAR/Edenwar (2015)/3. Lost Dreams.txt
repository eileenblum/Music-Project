[feat. Timo Somers]Once upon a time
I used to be so frail and soft inside
As a drop of light
My innocence devoured every lie

Why I cant go back to the start?
Why I cant be the way I used to be before?

In my lost dreams...

Every morn I try
not to forget my trail, the path of life
crystallized and blind
I have to find myself among the dark

There's no escape when dice are thrown
No, I can't be the way I used to be before

Lost in the pride within
Lost in the Dark
Lost in the eyes of shame 
Eaten alive
My dreams are gone!
My dreams are gone!

Lost in a smile of greed
waiting to bite
Break all the chains to be
The way you are
Don't let them go!
Don't let the go!
