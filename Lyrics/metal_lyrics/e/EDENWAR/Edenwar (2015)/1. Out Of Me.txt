[feat. Gabriel NavalÃ³n &amp; Mario Infantes]Flesh-desguised behind a mask of gold and pride
trapped inside a game of lies
I believe I have much more I canÂ´t deny
I'm on my way out of me

Even though Im not the one you can control
Even though I'm not the one you own
I'm enslaved, lost and denied
I'm on my way out of me

I'm on my way out of me
I'm on my way out of me

Unchain the past
waking the ever-sleeping beast
inside of me

Humanized, Hypnotized
You, fool, can't bring me under
Grieve, leading back, striking back
My heart will always deny you out of me

Now I feel I have the strength to live my life
Live it all the way I want
I've been hiding for a while, it's time to fly
I'm on my way out of me

All this years embraced with dark will meet the sun
Head up high to what comes from
I'm alive, no more disguise
I'm on my way out of me!

Unchain the past
waking the ever-sleeping beast
inside of me

Humanized, Hypnotized
You, fool, can't bring me under
Grieve, leading back, striking back
My heart will always deny you out of me

For everytime I tried
falling dawn is a new chance to live and fight
Prepare to see again the rise of a new day

back down the wrong way, sorrow haunts me, Where all beyond's dead
All is dead inside
Souls of the darkness coming back where all is madness

Get out of me!

Humanized, Hypnotized
You, fool, can't bring me under
Grieve, leading back, striking back
My heart will always deny you out of me
