Waiting for the night to come
Waiting for the spring to rise
we are never satisfied
We are fading in a voiceless dawn, unpronounced

No, no puedo desistir, dejarme ir
El silencio es la razÃ³n para seguir
Es tiempo de volver a Ser
Es tiempo de volver a Ser

I can see it in my eyes, enthralling
I can feel it in my skin, infecting

Silence has the answers for my life

I can touch it with my hands, undressing
I can taste it as a sweet embrace

And a new silence will reborn to change my life
