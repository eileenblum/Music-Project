[performed by Eulen]I chose to revenge
With eyes filled with rage
I will come for you
You'll never leave
Cottage on a mountain
Handful of incense
Evil is what i need
My gate is open
My name has changed
It is dark
I'll make my own fate
Thou art not greater one
I lived without heart
Remade my faith of old
Stone by stone
I carved my name
Walls of prosperity
Red was all around
Twinkles surrounded me
Voices in my mind
Now sky is black
All is silent
Souls will curse the land
The elders pray for mercy
Ancient writings, smell if incense
Holy smoke they come out through
Greeted with unknown tongues
They grant me power of this magic oath
All belongs to me
My grief destroys my past
But that was destined
I am king of grieves
And at last, tears by thousands flows from empty eyes
Sacred gates are burning to ashes
The prayers of misery are spoken by mortal tonques
Judgement day has passed into oblivion
No more sympathy to blind our hatred
Fear conquers all will of life on this bloodied ground
No choice has remained for none of me to complete
Those who fear to climb the mountain will rot in deepest holes
