[originally by W.A.S.P.]I can't take anymore
I have no more wings
I can't take anymore
The gates of heaven sealed
Don't you hear me
Don't you hear me
Don't you fear me
Of never coming back
Do you know what it's like
When heaven's hung in black?
I can't take anymore
The walls are black and bleed
I can't take anymore
No rooms here for your screams..
Don't you hear me
Don't you hear me
Don't you fear me
Of never coming back
Oh no more tears please
Hanging heaven black
Don't you leave me to die
And you'll know what it's like
The weary wall of sighs
Heaven's hung in black
And you'll know what it's like
When paradise is blind..
