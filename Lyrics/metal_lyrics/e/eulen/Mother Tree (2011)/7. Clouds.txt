Sloth and pride
Walls of flames
Discourtesy
Is thy names
Shame is thy shelter
Dark clouds bleeding
Broken briers
Shall tear thy peace
Run to the light
The sun is blinding
Hall of flames
Mothwings and fire
Even the most courageous among us only rarely has the courage to face what he already knows, all truth is simple, is that not a double lie?
In our own wild nature we find the best recreation from our un-nature, from our spirituality
Help yourself, then everyone will help you
We hate lies and hypocrisy because our sense of honor is easily provoked but the same hatred can arise from cowardice, since lies are forbidden by divine commandments in that case, we are too cowardly to lie

Grey faces, forgotten shades
Yellow leaves mixed with blood
The demon's laugh nightmare
Had you paralyzed
Hyenas feeds on the king's trash
Little mice survives on smithereens
The zombie inside impels you
Dust on your minds
Thou art mischosen
Ghost of all the lies
My forthcoming curse
The beast is blind
If these cold words stings you
Clear skies are unformed by clouds
