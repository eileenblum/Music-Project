Pushed outside by the tides of stinking memories
Closing doors of no return
Screams of extortion and grief from justice's agora
The heart of purity slayed at every sunrise
Children of emptiness feeds on trash
The blind greed devours itself
Naked mothers swallows bitter bread
Death's ghost roaming around
Migrant birds tearing old men's flesh
And i am lost in this desert of free

Now on this old edge
Breathing, mourning
Whispering voices from behind
Joyful eyes through his windows
This gate, i rejoice with horror
Tempting smiles and warm hands
Yet so cold and dark
I am mesmerized again
Stepping inside
With fear and pride
Becoming the phantom memory
A secret of happiness
I found love in this desolate house
