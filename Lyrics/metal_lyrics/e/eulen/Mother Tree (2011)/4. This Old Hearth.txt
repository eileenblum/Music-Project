Humid wood in a forgotten hearth
You never let the truth finds you
Overlaid eyes fail to look aside
Your thoughts falls shorter than your steps
Your sick pale mind misunderstands you
Do you know the reason
Of songless birds

Unlock the open door
Let the moon explain the whore
The elixir of the beautiful
The reflection of fetor
