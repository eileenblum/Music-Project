All That I See Around The World
Makes Me Feel Sad
Children With Guns In Their Hands
Shooting Everyone
For Many Years They Have Seen
Oh!!! This Nation
Dying Day By Day
Why Don't They Stop It ?

People Kill, But They Don't Know The Truth
Jesus Christ Never Wanted Wars !

What Could I Do ?
What Should We Do ?
With The Psychos Of The New Millennium
What Could I Do ?
What Should We Do ?

[Solos]

When Will We Be Free
Will We See The Sun
With The Peace Of God ?
When Will We Be Friends
Will We Laugh Again
Like An Angel In The Shy ?

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
