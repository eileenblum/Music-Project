A Nation Of Past
That Believes' in Life After Death
Always Making Some Constructions
Long Majestic Funeral
And Wide Tombstones
In a Deeper Lake
Ruins Of The Ancient Memories

On The Table Of Sacrifice
There Are Flowers
There's Wine...

To Learn With The Rivers
With The Mountains
With The Trees
And Learn To See With The Eyes Of Soul
Make An Essence To Life
To Be The Natural Light

[Solos]
[Bridge]

[Chorus]
