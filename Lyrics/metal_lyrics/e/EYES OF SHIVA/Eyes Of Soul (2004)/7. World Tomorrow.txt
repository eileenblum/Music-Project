A Rebel Of Fire - Has Power
To Complicate The World
It's Like A Devil - From Deep Hell
Who Burns Down Souls
Always So Laughingly - So Crazy
He Never - Nevercares
It's Like A Game - Unbelievable
Why Being Surprised?

The Unfinished Wars
Have Taken All The Warriors

Memories Have Gone...
And Nations Are Done...
It's So Sad All The Way
Who Will Be In The World Tomorrow?
Maybe We Can Trust The Unknown
World Tomorrow

[Solos]
[Bridge]

[Chorus]
