There Is A Revolutionary Man
No Laws To Him
Called Insane Forest King
But Helping Civilians
Killing People With His Crew
(They) Don't Really Care
Sacking Some To Give To Others
Shows No Mercy

Nothing Matters - No Soul
Matters - Along
Always Along
Galloping His Horse He Comes With No Laws
...Through The Drought

Hated - Adored
Dead Or Alive
He's Called Lampiao

[Solos]
[Bridge]

[Chorus]
