The Darkness Of The Long Days
When The Moon And (The) Sun Disappered
Then The Gloomy Skies
With No Future
'Cause Of The Attack Signs
This Is The Age Of Anguish
Oh No!!!
Everyone Will Be Razed

The Battle Will Begin
Carrying Millions Of Lives (Away)
From The Lands
Thru The Air
All Of A Sudden!

The Future Is So Near
Just Like The Land Of Fear
Just Like The End Of Days...
The End Of Days

[Solos]
[Bridge]

[Chorus]
