Over The Hills
Shadows From The Wings
Cover The Sky
Thru The Air I Shake My Arms
Flying Is My Life And Lord's My Light

I Fly For You
Oh My God... Help Me Now
I Shout For You
Please Father, Help Me Now

Flying Away
Flying High With Pride
Like An Eagle Of The Sun
Like An Angel In The Sky

[Solos]
[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Flying High...
Away
Eagle Of The Sun
