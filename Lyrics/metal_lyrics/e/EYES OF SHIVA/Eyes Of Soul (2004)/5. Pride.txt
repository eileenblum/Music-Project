Girl, You're Going The Wrong Way
You Never Listen To My Words Whatever I Say
Now Think About Your Life
'Cause If You Want It's Gonna Be A Paradise

All Of Us Make Mistakes
Someday You'll Be Awake

Oh...Now It's Time
To Show You Are
The Shine Of Pride
Maybe We Can Try
Try To Realize The Price Of Life

Girl, Remember Us In The Shore
I Felt So Happy To See My Smile And See Yours
Now Forget All The Past
Think Of (The) Future And Do The Best You Can

All Of Us Make Mistakes
Now You're Gonna Be Awake

[Chorus]

[Solo]

...Open Up Your Eyes
See The Ashes Left Behind...

[Chorus]
