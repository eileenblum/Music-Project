Blood Tears Cause Diseases
Eyes Open Wide
They Feel No Fear
Deep Meaning Of Nation
From This Nation
Have Gone Away
Children Taken By The Pain

Someday, Somehow, The World Will Change...
Dedication From All Of Us Is The Way

Scared Faces Don't Even Whisper
A Shy Smile Waits For Some Help
All The Old Culture
Old Culture
Have Gone Away
And Men Cry And Say

[Bridge]

Look (At) The Sea ( The Waves Falling Down)
Don't You See? ( People Smile Around)
Try To See
It's Just A Miracle !

[Solos]
[Bridge]

[Chorus]
