A face that doesn't define me anymore. I have to leave it where it belongs.
It was bringing me questions I had already solved.

Transformation of what I mean.
Meaningless is just a few words ahead but it's not the same at all.
Alteration of emancipation is not an alternative.
My reality, it's a cube running over me.

My dimension, it's a cube. Nothing to touch, no side.
My reality, it's a cube. Nowhere to move, to hide.

Passing from mould to mould in regard to the situation.
I'm a full of shapes chameleon.
Rejection failed, sabotaged by the commodity.
My reality, It's a cube running over me.

My dimension, it's a cube. Nothing to touch, no side.
My reality, it's a cube. Nowhere to move, to hide, cover!

Grab my hand! Follow two leaves in a cold fall breeze!
Play their game... A careless dance...
Make your moves really slow.
Shadows can't do it on their own.
Your touch makes me forget there is nothing more to grab.

Save the last tango for me and make me forget there is nothing more to grab.

Moments of total devastation.
Nothing is worth or stable.
Nothing is forever.
The world is feeding me with fear.
I'm doing it to myself.
Nothing to posses or have.
Nothing is to grab.
So, why be so scared?

Feeding, feeding me with fear
just to have me near.
To sell assurance you don't have.
Give stability to my life 'cos scare
demands something to grab.

Grab my hand!
Follow two leaves in a cold fall breeze!
Play their game... A careless dance...
Make your moves really slow.
Shadow can't do it on their own.
Your touch makes me forget there is nothing more to grab.
