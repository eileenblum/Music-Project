Civilization of animal for the last rapid era
has led us to misty, disheartened yet prosperous times.
We all languish for oblivion.
Autocratic narcissists desire to gain immortality
to rise us from the earthly dust.
We've concocted a story of supreme race
under a creator with a human face.

We don't even allow worms to make a hole into our forehead.
Reject the axiom: Dust to dust!

Do you believe she lets us lead?
She is leading us into a new ice age when we are going to be extinguished.

Man's narcissism derives from the naive conviction we will survive.
