You said you were not doing it again.
Follow the thoughts. Get caught in between.
Two poles make you undefined.
Is it worth to try again?
You are weaving still the same.
Composing the opposite.
There is something you've done
until it collapses and falls down.

Wind is blowing through your veins.
This is the edge.
Just a step ahead.
Are you gonna try...

... just a step ahead into nothing?
Be prepared for anything.
Riding the wind with a pleasant idea.
Riding on. Do you dare? Do you dare?

Wind is blowing through your veins.
This is the edge.
Just a step ahead.
Are you gonna try?

...until you touch the ground.

These are your few seconds in a lifetime.
You are falling now! You are flying now until you touch the ground.
It's a wonderful. it's a wonderful life.
You are flying now! You are dying now
until you touch the ground.

Fly! Fly to the ground!
The point of view is unchangeable,
History irreversible, situation critical, solution specific.
Confront the two poles! Re-collect the rest!
Re-classify what you have! Re-define your name!
In the end, you are weaving still the same.

You are falling until, until you touch...
You are falling until, until you touch...
You are falling until, until you touch...
All it's clear now until, until you touch the ground
