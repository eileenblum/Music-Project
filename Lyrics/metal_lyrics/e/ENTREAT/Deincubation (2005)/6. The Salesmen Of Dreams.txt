Conscious of worlds. Being in.
Melting one into another, into me.
In need of a place to hide.
The question is above your head.
How can you hide the neck from the hands?
The mind is confused by senses.
No reality is common to all.

Open the door!
You are going in,
Welcome in!
In a dream you got it from us, divulged in you.
Is it wrong to have an illusion that has been taken from a stranger's mind?
Conscious illusion gives us that little bit of peace of mind, not to go wild.
It's conscious escape to act in these subjective worlds.

We don't hold any truth!
We are the salesmen of dreams!

We don't hold any truth!
We are the salesmen of dreams!
Selling you the illusion of sailing on a fantastic weaves with us.
Come with us!

Conscious of worlds. Being in.
Melting one into another, into me.
How can you hide the neck from the hands?

It's a pill to go through you everyday life.
The conscious illusion makes you feel fine.
Take it before you wake up.
Suppress the pure sense that drags you to abnormal pain.
Take a conscious illusion.
Fool your mind.
It's the sweetest addiction in your life.
