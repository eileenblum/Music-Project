Ride on the way through the desert of our lives
Ride along the way to the point where the sun shines bright.

Riding but never get there.
Is it allowed just to watch?
Catching the balance. Straight to where I want...
The destination may be unknown
if you presume the sun is just another mirage....
to get that feeling when it's almost like drinking with god.

Tonight! I want to get that feeling.
I want it tonight!
Yeah, right!
I want to get that feeling when it's almost like drinking with god.

Drinking with god!

I want to confess him with a glass of wine in my hand to forget.
People seem so small, no importance to things at all.
Questions disappeared although nothing seems more clear.
Looking defined with devotion to the unknown.

Life is worthless and nothing is worth to be alive.
No more fight, no languishment for life.
Death is the last one to give us the sense of life.

Drinking with god!

Tonight! I want to get that feeling
I want it tonight!
Yeah, right!
I want to get that feeling when it's almost like drinking with god.

Tonight!
