Words!
A word, an idea brought into life to be disdain.
It's a skill of our tongue.

The better you lie the better you are!
Words don't give the truth,
able to lie on every occasion they find.

The better you lie the better you are!
Game! A play is not.
Smile! What a feeling to have?
Cry! What a feeling to express?
Smile, cry! What a joy for those who have something to show!

What can a word mean coming from a tongue, a tool to survive?
What can it mean?

The better you lie the better you are!
Game! A play is not.
Smile! What a feeling to have?
Cry! What a feeling to express?
Smile, cry! What a joy!

To represent an idea vs. to manipulate,
A net of expressions and lies.
Which is which?!
Just moral causes give us a no trespassing line.
What happens when all falls apart?
