Der Verstand macht frei!
Everyone is in a line.
We are going through places and times.
Standstill but moving in ordered chaos.

All kind of things we experience at once.

We are pilgrims of time.
We are part of a current of faith.

We are turning the inside to outside and outside to inside.
We squeeze present, future, past in a moment it has no place.
We compress earth and universe in a point it has no mean.

We are pilgrims of our minds playing with space and time.
Leave the line behind.
We are pilgrims of our minds. Jump back in a black hole of time.
Erase every trace of self - restraint.

We are pilgrims out of time.
We are part of a current of faith.

This trip as a gate out of our logic world.
It makes you insane.
Dreadful feeling about being just a dream is a response of artificial time and space.

We are pilgrims of our minds playing with space and time.
Leave the line behind.
We are pilgrims of our minds. Jump back in a black hole of time.
Erase every trace of self - restraint.

We are turning the inside to outside and outside to inside.
We squeeze present, future, past in a moment it has no place.
We compress earth and universe in a point it has no mean.

All you need is faith in yourself!
