Thinking about the moments and things that use to be
All that unimportant stupid little things that make my past,
Make me and all the people I lived with some are by me or around me,
Others somewhere along the way...

Forgotten palces, not worth a single hello but I can recall it all
The things we've done together, grew up together
We spent so special times expressing our motions, ourselves together
Do you remember the times when we dared to rebel
We wanted just to be
We thought we were so cool, we were gods and no one could reach to us
Life arranged us a special lesson about life, about the why we already had
We thought we could change the world now we are fighting to change ourselves
We thought we were right and others wrong, now we are trying to see the difference among us
Various ways brought us in different places
Have we became what we wanted to be...
Relations are gone, others will come, some will stay in this chaos called life
We were so proud and many times so damn unfair, it seems that we just didn't want to see

In all this chaos called life
It's eternal this unending changing about present-future-past
An eternal circle that drives me mad
In despite of all who don't dare to stop

It circulates around destroying things that are not presumed to last
It circulates within myslf changing almost everything
