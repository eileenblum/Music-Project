You were like the violin I used to play
To play my own songs I wrote in those days
I let you be next to me
As long as you were thinking like me
As long as you were tinking, feeling like me

But the viloin began to play its own annoying sounds
They lost their melodies
Until it sounded like a (lovely) symphony

I thought that I've lost you but all I've ever lost it's the
Illusion I've ever owned you
I just wanted to help you but I was interfering in your life,
I was destroying your life

How can I stand by your side without hurting you again and again
I just want to help you
And I want you to help me

Why is it so hard not to hurt anyone and especially you my friend
What a paradise we could make if we would tell you sorry in your face
But we fall every day
What a paradise we could make if I would tell you I'm sorry in your face
You were just the little instrument I used to play every day
I thought that the things I did, were right for you like were for me I fault.
