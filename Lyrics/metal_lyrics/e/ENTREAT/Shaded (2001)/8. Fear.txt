You are weeping, tou tremble, you sob, you sweat
Numb, you can't run away
Sweat, sob, tremble
You're scared

What are you terrified of?
Sleeping under an olive tree
You achieved your illumination
Voices, shadows
What could it possibly be?
Don't belive, dont' understand, don't see!
You're losing control, that makes you scared
You achieved you illumination today
The curtain has fallen, illusions broke down
Vocies, shadows are you,
Telling you stories of other places you see sleeping under an olive tree

Instead of illumination you've got a nightmare today
Losing your illusions of possesion domination and total control
Have been built for thousands years
Have been built for your entire life
This hiding turns to be a nightmare
To posses human beings, things, feelings, words, music, colours...
Your property was huge
All was just for rent, to use
To control the world and yourself
You were all the time in other's ahnds
To dominate over... over what? ower who?
You seem too small to me, imprisoned in a crystal space

All that made you stronger
Terrified knowing you are nobody now
You've lost it all, you feel so small
Illumination took from you... buried you
You've lost it all, you feel so small
Sleeping under an olive tree
The curtain has fallen
The show shall begin
