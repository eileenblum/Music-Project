I'm preparing your place to rest
So you can sleep and forget your fear of death
To say thanks is too late maybe my tears will wash everything away
I'm preparing your place to rest
So you can sleep and forget your fear of death
My memories are going back to you.
You are smiling now I'm looking at you and you are dying
Mu memories are going back to you. The rose fades. The leaves are taken to you
My memory hates you and I miss you
My memory is going back to you.
The rose fades, the leaves are falling down.

To say thanks is not too late.
Maybe my tears just say that I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid. No I'm not afraid...
To say thanks is not too late.
Maybe my tears just say that everything's gonna be ok...

I'm waiting for the day we will rest in peace and lie together then and ever
I'm waiting for the day we will look at the stars and sit together then and ever
A falling star lighted the night
Now I know you finally get the wings you dreamt of your entire life
Now I know he is waiting for me, just for me!
I dream the day he and I will live forever, together, then and ever...
