She has lived a wonderful life
She had a great father and also a mother
She wanted to be perfect and have a perfect life
The goal was high but she was prepared to work very hard.

She used to go to the concerts and she couldn't understand
Why people don't hear the music she does, the words she does
She spent nights in her bed thinking,
She spent nights with her friend talking
Desperate over her life she bought a chocolate box
In hope she would find an answer for her life
So she went to the luna park to cheer herself up
And she bought a very nice yellow baloon
But it flew and it blew up like her perfection, her perfect life
She finally figure it out the world is not just black and white
No one to worship, no one to blame
She's all confused now she even doesn't know her name
Patrischa is her name
She knows now life is not wrong nor wright
But just so that everyone can understand it in his very own way
She is trying to understand and listen
But everythying seems to be so hard
She tinks: maybe I work too hard, maybe I should just let it be
And stop thinking what should it(I) be
She guesses she has to do it by herself
Without anyone to worship or to blame
