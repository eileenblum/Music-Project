[5:12]

Every time this year
this dark fog will appear
up from the tombs it comes
to take one more life that can be near
In the middle of Transylvania
All natural life has for a long time ago gone, 
it is thin and so beautiful 
but also so dark and mysterious

Once again the priest is messing
may the God bless us all
The fog is here again
that will complete this funeral
From a place empty of life
Only dead trees are growing here
as it comes from a far
Only dead trees are growing here

Funeral fog. [4x]
