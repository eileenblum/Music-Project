[6:39]

Icaros, I dare you. 
For I possess the wings of faith. 
Though, heavy on my shoulders, 
no measurement can prove their weight. 
Still, a burden are they not to me. 
I am the challenger of gravity. 

The fear is not the fate I seek. 
My destiny will build upon 
the mighty turbulence beyond. 
And if I fall, I will rise... again. 

Some of envy, some of fear, 
admonish by the graves of those who fell. 
Praise the fool that pure of heart 
leaps off your finger into grace. 

Icaros, your voice once melted 
into the choir of the fallen ones. 

I have heard, I have seen 
the purity of their song. 

Icaros, Icaros. 

Icaros, your fate embrace 
a manifold of angels. 
I summon thee from shattered graves, 
and call upon the wind. 
Recieve my bow of reverence. 
Then spread your wings 
and fly into oblivion.
