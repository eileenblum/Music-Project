[4:14]

Into the abyss I fall 
and Dark is the reich of the dead. 
A portal to reach to the side 
where bodies fall from the sky. 

Solitude and Peace of Mind. 
Entombed in Cromlech. 

Yes, flee over the River Styx 
and join the dead with joy. 
An ocean of Blasphemy, Heathenish realm 
and "Do What Thou Wilt" as decoy. 

My Prophecy is true... 
We'll all make it through. 

[Guitar solo]
