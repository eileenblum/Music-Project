[5:56]

Shifting shadows guide my way in the autumn. 
From this fell alliance eternal night shall arise. 
Hear the scream of the wolves calling again. 
Legions are wreaking destruction upon the fortress. 

They must beware his rage. 
Once again he is risen. 
Towns are burning, the gods arise. 
Welcome the nocturnal nightmare 

And suffer again. 
And suffer again. 

He shall suffer. Dying breed of stalwart men. 
We will never deny what you can see. 
In malice. 

They will understand my pain. 

Shifting shadows guide my way in the autumn. 
From this fell alliance eternal night shall arise. 
Hear the scream of the wolves calling again. 
Legions are wreaking destruction upon the fortress.
