[7:10]

Teach me the tongue of fire, 
so that I may set the world ablaze. 
For it is cold, 
and this blindness can no longer give me shelter. 
Teach me the tongue of fire, 
so that I may cry out loud my wrath 
and my passion, 
or else my coil will blister and decay. 

[Guitar lead: Ihsahn]

The tongue of fire. 

The soul is never silent, 
but wordless, held imprisoned in a cursed tomb, 
wherein reflections never fade, never die. 
Slowly maddened by (the) emptiness. 

[Guitar lead: Ihsahn]

Left to perish in the ever-dark coil. 
Yet, always alert it its slumber. 
Scorned by the drops of light 
piercing through the surface, 
and it screams. 

The soul is never silent, 
but wordless. 

Teach me the tongue of fire, 
so that I may set the world ablaze. 
For it is cold, 
and this blindness can no longer give me shelter. 
Teach me the tongue of fire, 
so that I may cry out loud my wrath 
and my passion, 
or else my coil will blister and decay.
