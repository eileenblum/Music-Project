Deep Green Dark Chaos. 
Blinded I run down these paths. 
By heart I know them. 
They lead to the soaring cliffs. 
Stout they stand above the water's edge, 
lifeless. 

And this is my foundation: 
Cold stone. 
Formed only by winds and time. 
How invulnerable, 
lifeless. 

Ahh... I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name

For once I wish to see 
the entity behind the voice. 
The face of this seduction, 
the beauty of my pain. 

Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence? 
What is my crime, what is my deed? 
Is this life my redemption? 
Shall I repent or proceed? 

I hate my flesh. 
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt. 
It made me question 
the essence of the "I". 
Slaves are those of this world 
given freedom to lay chains upon The Master. 
Master, master. 

The wolf is no longer free. 
Release the chains and come for me. 

[The Elder:]
"Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned. Out of the cold mist 
came three enthralling ships. Sails torn by many a storm, and the 
bows adorned by the most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. 
Yet, the crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They stood 
motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns. And from behind their 
shadowed faces the seductive chanting. Bidding him on board. 
Without besitation, he accepted. And away they sailed..." 

Upon these seas, 
wherein I drowned so many times, 
I scatter the ashes of destiny. 
Still my flames are in hunger. 
With fire in my heart 
shall I greet the shores ahead. 
Though, I know not what will burn. 

Desire...
Ahh...
In the distance 
I hear the waves wash over solid ground. 
And in this moment I am struck blind. 

Grant me sight so I can see 
that which lies ahead of me. 
Cursed be my mortal eyes 
for dying in the realm of Death. 

Hear my call...

I return to the soaring cliffs. 
They truly shine of strength. 
Even though, I nothing learned. 
With strength I burn...
