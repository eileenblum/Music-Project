Four eyes as two in one. 
The forward circular view that never ends. 
An orbital voyage throughout this endless sphere of all 
where time is lost and everything transcends. 

A graceful presence
at stolen time. 

As ghosts to the world. 

Four eyes as two in one. Thus appear the truly sworn. 
As ghosts to the world. Thus appear the truly sworn. 
For ice outside, are we apart? Thus appear the truly sworn. 
Cold and eerie mist. Burning. Thus appear the truly sworn. 

Burning. 

To be seen, 
to be feared, 
yet, not to be reached.
