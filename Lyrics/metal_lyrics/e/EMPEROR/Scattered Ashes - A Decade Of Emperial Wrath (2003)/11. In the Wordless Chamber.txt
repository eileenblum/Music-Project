[5:12]

In the wordless chamber 
they feared Death 
desperately. 
Thus they clustered 
to the fruits of the Earth. 
Craving diversion, 
as if to avoid knowing why. 

In the wordless chamber 
they feared life 
desperately. 
Thus they proclaimed 
any given truth 
and swallowed, 
as if to justify their fear. 

He knew that there had been hordes of seers
before him who set out to cure. 
Though, the sick wished not to part with their decease, 
as if it made them feel alive. 

In the wordless chamber 
he accepted desperation 
and the unpredictable manifestations 
of hope.
