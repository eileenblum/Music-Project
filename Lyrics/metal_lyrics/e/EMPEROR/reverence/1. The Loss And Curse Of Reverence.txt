[Words: Ihsahn/ Music: Ihsahn &amp; Samoth/ Arrangements: Samoth &amp; Ihsahn]

Memories of torment strikes me
Attempts were made to suffocate me at birth
Fools
I was already ancient
Thou can not kill what breeds within Thee

Alas, this agony
The emptiness of earthborn pride
Path stirred my faithful heart
Which guided me to darker paths
Far away from their pestilent ways
Cleansed was I from deceitful grace
Yet, put to scorn was I
By those unclean
Enslaved by ignorance
They blindly spat upon the deity of hate
Awake is the darkest fiend

By the fallen one I shall arise

Upon bewildered masses
To whom the indulgence of my soul
Portray as sin made god
I shall revile and quell the source
Whence mockery of my kind derive
This I know
Facile shalt my quest not come to pass
Deathwish be my gift to all at last

Honour
Commended no longer as virtue
Yet, shalt be extolled at light's demise

By the fallen one I shall arise

Believer
Speak not to me of justice
For none have I have seen
By God, I shall give as I receive
Betrayer
Speak not to me at all
You and this world ripped my fucking heart out

Again... and again... and again...
