[6:39]

In an endless maze begotten,
to dead ends led by fools.
I sought a plague for those
who smiled at walls in humble fear.

Yet, belligerent ways came to an end.
No war could ease my hunger.
By craving death I was
to darkness reborn.

No sacrifice too great.
Caught in another maze.
Truly endless.
Still this maze is mine.

No peace for me. No peace I seek.
My quest goes far beyond.

No sacrifice too great.
Caught in another maze.
Truly endless.
Still this maze is mine.

I hail the greatest fall.
Dark is the spirit of my token.
Dark is my call.

Still craving, still torn.
Hear me, master of this realm
to which I was reborn.

"Bearer of my stigma. Thou art of me.
Yet, claim no gift, but guidance.
For I am the giver of temptation.
Thou art the executor of Thy rewards"

Dark is the spirit of my token.
Dark is my call.

The cosmic forces driving me,
more noble, more free.

Take me.

Love and hate and all in between,
I greet them all in ecstasy.
Venus, seduce me.
Mars, possess me.
Tear my soul from sanity.

No sacrifice too great.
Caught in another maze.
Truly endless.
Still this maze is mine
and I am thine.
