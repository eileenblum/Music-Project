Landscapes...
Entrance my mind with thoughts of ancient times.
I wonder...
Did they walk this path?

Open seas...
An endless horizon they seem.
I wonder...
Where did they go?

Nightsky,
source of light and dark.
I wonder...
Did they comprehend?

Did they comprehend?
Did they comprehend?
Did they comprehend?
Did they comprehend?

Seasons running through my veins,
like snow melting on my skin.
They crawl beyond my flesh
and gasp my yearning soul.

Alas!
The force of divinity.
What caused its end?
What caused this?

What caused its end?
What caused its end?
What caused its end?
Oh... the end.

I drown in thoughts.
Yet, answers have abandoned this place
long ago.
Blood runs cold from my arm...

Another one is now to die.
Is he the last to see
the graceful entity of Nature?
Is he the last to have his heart and soul
nailed to Her embrace?

He passes on...
