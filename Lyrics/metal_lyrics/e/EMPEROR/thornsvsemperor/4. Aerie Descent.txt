[Music &amp; lyrics: Snorre Ruch]

By the moons, heist, and all of the light
Above the earth he rode
He seeks that which never was
And never to become

The moon rose it was crimson in color
It lighted some coming form
That once crushed so many of them
It ever comes again

And again, and again
And again, and again
And again, and again

The moon shone with a fuller red
Was it cursed to be drawn to the earth?
What once has been shall be no more
Dead in graves is heist
It is
In graves

[Spoken:]
Oh lord I kneel before the secret council
I form these reckonable words of iniquity
For my enemies be against me
And they have led ways for my soul to be consumed
together
Defend me from he that rises up against me
Save me from he that raids our homes and follows my
path below the frozen moon
For he lay in wait for my soul
And desires to take it down a firey pit

Heist descends to the world
Fed alone by our souls
See your perished form
So by the stone it crushed their faith
Their kingdom lost

The moon rose it was crimson in color
To remain
What once crushed so many, alone
It ever comes again

And again, and again
And again, and again
And again, and again
