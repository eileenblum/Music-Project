... and after years in dark tunnels
he came to silence

there was nothing...

he realised that the cheering cries of worship
were but echoes of his harsh outspoken word
reflecting back at him from cold and naked walls
in hollow circles fled illusions of wisdom he had heard

"From nothing came all I ever knew"

and he beheld the ruins
of an empire torn apart
yet, no grief nor rage did bind him
just silent and bewildered
by the emptiness
he stumbled off his throne

suddenly, the walls around him cracked wide open
and an endless void appeared in flickering, grey light
"What force, but silence, has deprived me of my coil?

No trail to guide me. No point of reference in sight."

"By nothing, resurrection will be pure."

and he beheld the ruins
of an empire torn apart
wiping dust off his shoulders
just silent now
in this emptiness
leaving all behind

step by step
past all past
slowly he approached the surface
nothing left
to sacrifice
the mirrors mocked him on the way
