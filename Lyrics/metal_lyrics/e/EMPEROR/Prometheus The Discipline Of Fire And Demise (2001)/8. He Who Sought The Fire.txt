and again he came to cherish
the comfort of mysteries
inspiring and far away
timeless in the moment
they painted immortality

forever drawn towards the centre
of this ensorcelling flame
yet, still in fear of the sacrifice
it would take to know its name

"Do not despair", said the mystery
"You will always have a friend in me
until the day you break my code
then I will be gone and you are free...
...to manifest another"

towards the heavens he did aspire
now he shall burn who sought the fire
some will mourn the ashes cold
while others behold the inferno unfold

forever drawn towards the centre
of this ensorcelling flame
yet, still in fear of the sacrifice
it would take to know its name

now he shall burn who sought the fire
to manifest another
