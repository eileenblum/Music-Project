[2:54]

When night comes creeping in, 
dark restless shades arise. 
Graveless souls are gathering. 
Seem to ignite the flame. 

Creeping shadows roam the night, 
as a merciless rain is closing upon.
Demons coming to sever the Sun. 
Empty eyes come to life. 

Darkness reigns in the Cosmos. 
Forces of the Devil's lair. 
Innocent or brave, 
they appear to rape your world. 

Children of the evil and demonic
curse his love again. 
Graveless souls awake, 
seem to ignite the flame. 

When night comes creeping in, 
dark restless shades arise. 
Prepare to crawl and run. 
The Black is here tonight.
