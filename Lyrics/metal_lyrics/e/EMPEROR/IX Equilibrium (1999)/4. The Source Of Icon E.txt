[Music: Ihsahn, Samoth]
[Lyrics: Ihsahn]

The land was created
In the name of the chosen
And the waves thrown
For men to see
The one who made men
To be
Prevailed from the source
Of Icon E

The waves of fury
Prevailed from the source
Of Icon E
Were mine to be
Ordered to destroy and bury
No remorse!

The destiny of the wave
Was not to be found
Nor was I travelling
The deadly sea alone
The sun never rose
And my rose
Was not to be

For what purpose
I gave my return
Is stil standing alone
And as the raven dropped
A feather on me
I was again to be
The chosen one...
