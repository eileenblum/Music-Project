[Music: Ihsahn, Samoth]
[Lyrics: Ihsahn]

Reason
This demigod
Unto which you cluster
Sacrilege
You sacrifive the purity
Of the air beneath your wings
A slow and painful ritual
To burn the youth you lost

Demigod
Blasphemers walk among your flock

Despite your blindfold
Proudly you carry the stone on your back
Disillusioned
You plant your feet safely to the ground

Demigod
Blasphemers walk among your flock

As the stone
You have become

Not once did you cry
For the lost ones of your world
Your care is limited
To this demigod
Onto which you cluster

Reason
Decrystallize me
Demigod
I do blaspheme

The fallen you condemn
Your heart even free of hate
Yet, scared todeath by their disbelief
To ordinary common sense

And with autumn closing in
Forcing life away
No mercy wil impale your sin
Dead are your tears
