[Ready for something older? Let Trym introduce this one to you.]

Night of the graveless souls.

When night comes creeping in,
Dark restless shades arise.
Graveless souls are gathering.
Seem to ignite the flame.

Stalking shadows reign the night,
As a merciless rain is closing upon.
Demons coming to sever the Sun,
Bring us the night of yore.

Darkness reigns in the Cosmos.
Forces of the Devil's lair
Give and take our life
To return to the smoking Hell.

A terrible blight declaring revenge
As a merciless rain is closing upon.
Demons coming to sever the Sun,
Bring us the night of yore.

Come on!

When night comes creeping in,
Dark restless shades arise.
Prepare to run for your life,
Or prepare to fade.

Night of the graveless souls.
