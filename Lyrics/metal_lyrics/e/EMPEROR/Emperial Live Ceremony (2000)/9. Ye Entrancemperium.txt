["Ye Entrancemperium"...]

Drawn towards these lands again.
Seeking death and sacred soil.
I ride the longing winds of my blackened soul,
Growing stronger once I enter my empire beyond.

Emperium!
Behold my coming.

The fullmoon rise above me,
Enlightening my realm in a silvery glow.
Yet the shadows crawl beneath my storming sky,
Guarding treasures from forbidden light.

I still remember,
Though ages ago it seems,
The first time I entered the gates,
The revelation of ritual death
By which I became divine.
Sacrifice of the life I had
Among the flesh of the light.

And now I enter again.
Even stronger, yet amazed by what I see.
In ecstasy I mock the world.

Suddenly I memorize,
Asking what I left behind.
Nothing.

Can I ever comprehend?
Will my longing ever end?
Never.

Drawn towards these lands again.
Seeking death and sacred soil.
I ride the longing winds of my blackened soul
Eternally.

[Thank you, London, you've been great.]
