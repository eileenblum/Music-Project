[4:16]

He is an empty shell. Shell-shocked luciferian heart.
He is an empty shell. Drained and sealed.
He is an empty shell. Penetrating cold.
He is an empty shell. Empty luciferian soul.

How furiously and bombastic
He proclaimed his destruction of a mortal coil.
In the end it seemed
This was his only possession.

Long past were his "glorious" days
Of filth and lies.
And he has reached out to stop time
At its end.

He is an empty shell. Shell-shocked luciferian heart.
He is an empty shell. Drained and sealed.
He is an empty shell. Penetrating cold.
He is an empty shell. Empty luciferian soul.

The constant struggle for a moment of quiet indulgence
Eventually stirred and quaked the Earth so hard.
It swallowed him in a dark and heavy cloud,
Slowly and gently starving him into insanity.

An inferno of ice
With an ever-burning, bleeding heart.
