[4:26]

["Curse You All Men"!]

Curse you, all men
Whose coil is strong.
I recognise the sparrows heart
Beneath the theatre of misery.
Disbelivers shalt by dawn
Be forced to forever mourn.

Curse you, all men
That resent my empire.
Cause I have risen again,
At war this time.

The truth I speak is your decease.
My word is your defeat.

And thou shalt not
Be able to hide anymore.
The prophecy will conquer at last
Your sense of reality.

With mission to kill,
The theatre of misery.

He has risen again,
Armed with the source of sin.
And as humans shalt fade,
He shalt inherit their strength.
Men of the damned,
You will reluctantly
Secure His eternal victory.

Curse you, all men
Whose coil is strong.
I recognise the sparrows heart
Beneath the theatre of misery.
Disbelivers shalt by dawn
Be forced to forever mourn.

The truth I speak is your decease.
My word is your defeat.

Yes, you are indeed the few.
I am the one.
