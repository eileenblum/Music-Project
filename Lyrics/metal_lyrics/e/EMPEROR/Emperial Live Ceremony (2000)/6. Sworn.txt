[This next one is from "IX Equilibrium". It's called... "Sworn"!]

Four eyes as two in one.
The forward circular view that never ends.
An orbital voyage throughout this endless sphere of all
Where time is lost and everything transcends.

A graceful presence
At stolen time.

As ghosts to the world.
Ghosts to the world.
For ice, outside, are we apart?
As cold and eerie mist to the hand.
Ever floating on its course
Towards the heights of shadowland.

Thus appear the truly sworn.

To be seen,
To be feared,
Yet, not to be reached.

Four eyes as two in one. Thus appear the truly sworn.
As ghosts to the world. Thus appear the truly sworn.
For ice outside, are we apart? Thus appear the truly sworn.
Cold and eerie mist. Burning. Thus appear the truly sworn.

To be seen,
To be feared,
Yet, not to be reached.

Burning.

A graceful presence
At stolen time.

Thus appear the truly sworn.
