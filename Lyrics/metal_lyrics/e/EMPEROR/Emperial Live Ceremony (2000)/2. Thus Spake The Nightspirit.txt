[This next one is from Anthems. It's called "Thus Spake the Nightspirit".]

Close your eyes and gaze into
This realm that I reveal.
See where eternities are born.
Close your eyes, behold the powers
Of the broken seal.
See the liars bound in thorns.

Fear
And you shall fall.
Weakness suffocates your will.
Dare,
Yet never fail.
Wisdom guides the one,
The strong who can defy
Death.

[Guitar solo]

So I speak, though, am I heard...?
Wasting visions on a world of blinded fools.

Still I scorn
The vacant contradiction of life,
If only to bewilder.
The final truth shall speak my name.

Thus spake the nightspirit.

Nightspirit, spirit,
Spirit, embrace my soul.
[Repeat]
