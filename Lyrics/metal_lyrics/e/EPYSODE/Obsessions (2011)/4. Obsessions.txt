[Music &amp; Words: S. Arkan]

[Back in his motel room, Kallon falls prey to paranoid fears... Seeking relief he goes for a shower, but words appear on a mirror...]

[Esh]
"Kallon!"

[Kallon]
... [surprised]

[Kallon]
Flashbacks or dreams, unreal shapes
Follow me down like shadows on the walls
I don't want to hear their screams no more
My twisting mind trips me again

Mirrors are bending,
Sounds swimming through the ceiling
Paralysed on the ground, I fear the unknown...

[Esh]
Doors from the other side are open,
My words appear for you
Silence is broken, you have to believe

[Kallon]
I am lost in my obsessions,
Can you see me crawling?
Surrounding my world,
They watch me through the night

Strange faces and disturbed stares
Glare at me like hunters seeking their prey
I need them to stay on their shore
My tattered faith won't accept them anymore

[Esh]
Now your imprisoned brain needs trust,
Your senses are learning
Silence is broken, you have to believe

[Kallon]
Glasses are tumbling,
Chairs are sliding through the room
I'm paralysed on the ground, leave me alone!

[Esh]
Doors from the other side are open,
My words appear for you
Silence is broken, it's time to believe

[Kallon]
I am lost in my obsessions, can you see me crawling?
Surrounding my world, they watch me through the night

I am lost in my obsessions, can you see me crawling?
Surrounding my world, they watch me through the night

Lost in my obsessions, come save me I'm crawling
Falling down...
I fall into madness, losing control, ghostly messages fill my eyes

[Esh]
Lost in your obsessions

[Kallon]
Can you hear me calling?

[Esh]
We are not illusions!

[Kallon]
You can keep me from falling
