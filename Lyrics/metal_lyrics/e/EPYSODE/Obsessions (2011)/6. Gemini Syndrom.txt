[Music: J. Spreutels - Words: S. Arkan]

[Kallon and Valma, two friends,
Two beliefs, two linked destinies...]

[Valma]
So many times Iâve asked the sky
Can you tell me why I travel this road?
I couldn't remember all my dreams
Couldn't see the world surrounding me like it is

And sometimes it batters me down
And I cover my eyes
Refusing to see tne truth
But not this time, never again

When I keep my eyes closed
A voice speaks in my head
Like a brother, like another part of me

[Kallon]
I will give it one more chance
Try to believe in all those signs
The time hasn't come for me to leave my mission
My vision now is becoming clear

And sometimes it batters me down
And I cover my eyes
Refusing to see tne truth
But not this time, never again

When I keep my eyes closed
A voice speaks in my head
Like a brother, like another part of me

[Uss]
I know that you hear me,
With you every day upon this earth
The link which binds us is stronger than blood
I haven't come this far
To end my redemption here and now

[Kallon]
This is my road, this is my quest
Challenging the mountains with faith
Aware of the danger that surrounds me
I will give it one more chance

[Valma]
Tty to recall who I am
[Kallon]
Try to recall who we are

[Valma]
Try to remember why I am here
Couldn't remember all my dreams

[Kallon]
Couldn't remember all of your dreams

[Valma]
Couldn't see the world surrounding me like it is

And sometimes it batters me down
And I cover my eyes
Refusing to see tne truth
But not this time, never again

[Kallon]
When I keep my eyes closed
A voice speaks in my head
Like a brother, like another part of me

[Valma]
It's true I can hear you

[Kallon]
Been with me every moment on this earth

[Valma]
The link which binds us...

[Kallon]
...is stronger than blood

[Kallon &amp; Valma]
When I keep my eyes closed
A voice speaks in my head
Like a brother, like another part of me

When I keep my eyes closed
I feel you alive inside me
Like a Gemini Syndrom

[Kallon]
Try to recall who you are
Try to remember why you're here

[Uss]
I haven't come this far
To end my redemption here and now
