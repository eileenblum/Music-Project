[Music &amp; Words: S. Arkan]

[Final Scene...]

[Kallon]
Slowly, comes the whisper of the rain
Faith against anger
It is time to wash away the pain
to pull you under...
Slowly, voices rise through the rolling of thunder
Remember me... you'll remember me!

[Maymos - Esh]
Feel your heart like a stone, slowly broken
Say goodbye to the lives that you've stolen

[Maymos]
Still a cold wind blows for you
Hear their voices singing for you
You've lost your way

[Kallon]
Lost in the March of the Ghosts

[Maymos]
Feel the last pain burn in you
Hear my voice screaming

[Yae]
So cold is the blood running in my veins
Faith is just a lie
It is time to cast away my chains
to take your soul... and see you die
My demons rise up through the screams of my fury
Never forget me... I shall always be!

[Maymos - Esh]
Feel your heart like a stone, slowly broken
Say goodbye to the lives that you've stolen

[Maymos]
Still a cold wind blows for you
Hear their voices singing for you
You've lost your way

[Kallon]
Lost in the March of the Ghosts

[Maymos]
Feel the last pain burn in you
Hear my voice screaming

And Origins are there behind a veil
For everyone I would help or fail
I will escape from this prison of death

[Maymos - Esh]
Feel your heart like a stone, slowly broken
Say goodbye to the lives that you've stolen

[Maymos]
Still a cold wind blows for you
Hear their voices singing for you
You've lost your way

[Kallon]
Lost in the March of the Ghosts

[Maymos]
Feel the last pain burn in you
Hear my voice screaming

[Maymos]
Ghosts won't do you any favours!

[Yae]
Itâs too late to turn back now...

[Esh]
"Valma, the light calls you. It's time to go!"

[Kallon]
"Wait... leave her alone..."

[Valma]
"I will never forget you..."

[Kallon]
"Valmaaaaa!"

[Maymos]
"Disappear forever!"

[Valma]
"I will never forget you..."

[Shawn]
"Am I free?"
