[Music &amp; Words: S. Arkan]

[While searching for dues at the home of young Shawn, the Profiler is observed by Yae / The Killer from afar...]

[Kallon]
Flashing lights cut the night like a blade.
The tortured sounds of sirens
Shatter the silence.

[Yae]
Dancing like marionettes,
Forever moving, so insignificant...

[Kallon]
I walk along dark corridors, analysing all I can.
Curtains, like ghosts, on the wind

[Yae]
Still you cannot evolve and change what you are...
Poor madmen!

[Maymos, Esh, Kallon]
Cross the door of darkness to reach the light
Beyond the fear and without any doubt...
Let yourself be driven by your soul
Beyond the fear... until the end...

[Yae, Esh]
...

[Kallon]
First Blood...

[Kallon]
In the silence of this empty bedroom
The hours darken our vision.

[Yae]
Birth of a bad hero,
The beginning of a decay...

[Kallon]
Nevertheless I sense a presence in this place...
Mocking me!

[Vae]
You'll be betrayed by your naivety,
You fight alone against something
Which is beyond you...

[Maymos, Esh, Kallon]
Cross the door of darkness to reach the light
Beyond the fear and without any doubt...
Let yourself be driven by your soul
Beyond the fear... until the end...

[Valma]
Let yourself be driven by your soul.
If you can look past all appearances,
You will find a road to the truth.

[Maymos, Esh, Kallon]
Cross the door of darkness to reach the light
Beyond the fear and without any doubt...
Let yourself be driven by your soul
Beyond the fear... until the end...

[Kallon]
On every street, your footsteps I shall pursue,
Into the blackest forest I shall follow.
For now I know you are different from any
Other I have chased in my life.

And now you become the prey and I, the hunter.
Whoever you are, you've drawn the first blood.
