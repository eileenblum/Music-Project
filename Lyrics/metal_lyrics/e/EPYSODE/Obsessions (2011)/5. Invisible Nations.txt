[Music &amp; Words: S. Arkan]

[Yae]
"Life around you slowly dies..."

[Valma]
"The doors of silence have opened
Souls and forgotten ones are searching for you"

[Esh]
Behind the walls
Beyond the blackness

[Esh &amp; Maymos]
Another world is watching

[Esh]
Behind the hopes lost on the wind
Beyond the wars draining you

[Esh &amp; Maymos]
Another life is waiting

[Esh]
Don't ever let your fear rule
Never listen to their lies
Don't give their belief what it needs
Never trust their wicked smiles

[Esh &amp; Maymos]
Open your eyes
We rule your lives
From the origins of light
The invisible nations still fight

[Esh]
Behind the calls
Beyond delusion

[Esh &amp; Maymos]
Another world controlling

[Esh]
Behind the words spun by money
Beyond the faith burning you

[Esh &amp; Maymos]
Another life is speaking

[Esh]
Don't ever let your fear rule
Never listen to their lies
Don't give their belief what it needs
Never trust their wicked smiles

[Esh &amp; Maymos]
Open your eyes
We rule your lives
From the origins of light
The invisible nations still fight

[Yae]
Now... only emptiness
The world begins to cry
As the life around you slowly dies

[Esh]
Watch for the signs that light your way

[Maymos]
For millions of years we've been with you

[Yae]
snigirO eht htiw gniyalp ma I, noitpmeder ...I

[Esh &amp; Maymos]
Open your eyes
We rule your lives
From the origins of light

Open your eyes
We rule your lives
The invisible nations still fight

[Esh]
Open your eyes, another life is coming

[Maymos]
We rule your lives 'cause your world is dying
