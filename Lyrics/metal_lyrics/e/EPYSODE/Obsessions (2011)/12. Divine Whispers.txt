[Music &amp; Words: S. Arkan]

[Esh tells Valma of her tragic destiny and of the crucial role she will soon play...]

[Esh]
I have met your future
And your demons just followed me
As well as your last scream through the night
But you are part of the last chapter

[Valma]
My visions draw my horizon
With a tragic line painted on my skin

[Esh]
Be again,
kept awake by aivine whispers

[Valma]
I see me, hidden by the light
Starts the deliverance of a soul

[Valma]
I have seen my fate
Now with your presence behind me
I shall walk until my last breath
Up to the last page of the story

[Esh]
You forged a pure soul in you
And will not leave in vain this world

[Esh]
Be again,
kept awake by divine whispers

[Valma]
I see me, hidden by the light
Starts the deliverance of a soul

[Yae]
You know I will never let you catch me
For ever, your soul will be annihilated
to have dared to stand in my way!

[Esh]
Beyond the silence of the dead,
you will disturb their wandering to face the evil

[Esh]
Be again, kept awake by divine whispers

[Valma]
I see me, hidden by the light
Starts the deliverance of a soul

[Maymos - Esh]
Here comes the truth
Eyes are crying
Visions are clearer
The Origins are, they are a part of us
Since our birth, through our rebirth
