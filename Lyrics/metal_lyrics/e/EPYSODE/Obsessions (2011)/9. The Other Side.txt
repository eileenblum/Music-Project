[Music &amp; Words: S. Arkan]

[The incantations of Valma as she makes contact with the wandering ghosts...]

[Valma]
Tendrils of incense sail through the room
Bathed in the light of the candles
For you, I'll reveal my power
This is not an illusion, but my visions

In a place I can see, I'm watching faces
(Maymos, Esh - In the Other Side)
From another time, I'm hearing voices
(Maymos, Esh - From another time)
Through this crystal stone, I'm connected to the other side

My hands describe circles in the air
The wind is increasingly cold
I can feel the pain they have
Even more the sorrow they carry

In a place I can see, I'm watching faces
(Maymos, Esh - In the Other Side)
From another time, I'm hearing voices
(Maymos, Esh - From another time)
Through this crystal stone, I'm connected to the other side

[Maymos]
You hear words that make you cry, words that make you live
Your heart and your soul will stay forever connected to the Other Side

[Valma]
In a place I can see, I'm watching faces
(Maymos, Esh - In the Other Side)
Through this crystal stone, I'm connected to the other side
