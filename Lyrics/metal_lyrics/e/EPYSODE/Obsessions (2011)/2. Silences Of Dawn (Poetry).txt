[Music &amp; Words: S. Arkan]

[Valma is awakened at night by a vision]

[Valma]
I heard a cry in the night,
Then the sound of footsteps on the ground.
I felt the brightness of the moon
Upon my face and warmth of a family home...

As my body began to tremble,
I heard the scream of a terrified child.
An inhuman coldness seems to surround him,
To take him... Into the silences of dawn.

Kallon where are you going ? Be careful...
