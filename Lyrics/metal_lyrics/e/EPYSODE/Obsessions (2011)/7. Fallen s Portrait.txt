The portrait of Yae/The Bauta Killer...

[Yae]
I'm living in an endless nightmare	1
I don't need your tears, nor your compassion

I am the damned, the one who sows the evil
But however men are involved in my fall

In the darkness I walk in vain
No one can change what I've become
I'm playing with the laws of the Origins...

Eternal are my sins, it's just my war,
I'm not to blame
I have no apologies for my existence

Fools you made me, now you'd want to end this doom
I must have innocence to play the game once more

In the darkness I walk in vain
No one can change what I've become
I'm playing with the laws of the Origins...

In the darkness I walk in vain
No one can change what I've become
Eternal are my sins...

Eternal are my sins, it's just my war, I'm not to blame
I have no apologies (no way) for my existence

[Shawn]
"Where-do we go? Mister?"

[Esh]
"Let him go... End this madness!"

[Yae]
"Never..."

[Kallon]
"I don't feel so well..."

[Valma]
"Can you hear him inside your mind?"

[Kallon]
"No!"

[Esh]
"Stop!"

[Yae]
"Never..."

[Valma]
"I can hear him!"

[Yae]
"Valma!"

[Valma]
"Does he know me?!..."

[Yae]
"Valma... You will pay for your foolishness!"

[Shawn]
"Help me..."

[Yae]
In the darkness I walk in vain
No one can change what I've become
I'm playing with the laws of the Origins
In the darkness I walk in vain
Eternal are my sins...

In the darkness, I walk in vain...
In the darkness, with all my pain...
