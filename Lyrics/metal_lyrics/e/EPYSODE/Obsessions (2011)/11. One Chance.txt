[Music &amp; Words: S. Arkan]

[Kallon draws closer to the child, Yae suddenly feels in danger...]

[Yae]
I can feel your presence in the dark
Maybe you have the light at your back
But you are nothing,
you are just like sand in my hand
You are the pain through my hollow land
You are the crack in my plan

[Kallon]
Your soul has been kissed
by the mouth of madness
You have lost control,
dominated by your sadness
I will find you... I will defeat you
I will chase you into hell...
I will make this your last transgression

[Esh-Valma]
One chance... to let it out
One chance... to save a life

[Yae]
We are the same...

[Kallon-Yae]
One step in the shadow
There's another battle
within the eyes
Two different sides
Hearts made of stone
Only one chance to survive
Only one chance...

[Yae]
I can hear your heart beating in the wind
Surely, you have found me once more
But you are nothing, nothing more than a memory
Trying to destroy my game,
You are the last, the only one
You are just a speck of dust in my world

[Kallon]
Your words are like the poison
that flows within you
You have lost control, led by your hate
I will find you... I will defeat you
I will chase you into hell...
I will make this your last transgression

[Esh-Valma]
One chance... to let it out
One chance... to save a life

[Yae]
We are the same...

[Kallon-Yae]
One step in the shadow
There's another battle
within the eyes
Two different sides
Hearts made of stone
Only one chance to survive
Only one chance...

[Kallon]
You can't escape the truth no more

[Yae]
You can't escape, we are the same
Screams in my head, it's impossible for me to stop

[Kallon-Yae]
One step in the shadow
There's another battle
within the eyes
Two different sides
Hearts made of stone
Only one chance to survive
Only one chance...

One step in the shadow
There's another battle
within the eyes
Two different sides
Hearts made of stone
Only one chance to survive
Only one chance...

[Esh]
One chance... To break it down...
Only one chance, only one chance...

[Yae]
But you are nothing to me
Nothing more than a memory
We are the same, whether you like it or not!

[Esh, Kallon]
One chance... to let it out
One chance... to save a life
One chance... to stop it now
One chance... to be once more
