[Music &amp; Words: S. Arkan]

[The awakening of Maymos...]

[Maymos]
A living spirit disturbs my long anguish
Crossing the veil of darkness
A voice dares to shout of my name
Breaking the peace of the lost ghosts

[Valma]
So many lives been stolen
Hear us, dead hearts
We still need you and your lord
Beyond death, still burns a spark of life

[Maymos]
For centuries we wander here
Loneliness is our burden
We lost our faith and forgot our past
With closed eyes, in silence

[Valma]
So many dreams been broken
Hear us, dead hearts
We still need you and your lord
Beyond death, still shines a spark of life

[Maymos]
So many lives, so many dreams
I heard your call in my sleep
So many times I heard your screams
I felt you needed me

I am the prince of shades
I've been awoken by your calls
To follow the way of my destiny
To break the circle forever

[Valma]
So many lies been spoken
Hear us, dead hearts
We still need you and your lord Beyond death, remains a spark of life

[Maymos]
So many lives, so many dreams
I heard your call in my sleep
So many times I heard your screams
I felt you needed me

[Kallon]
The cries of a child haunted my head
Let him live in peace, let's save this pure and innocent heart before it's too late

[Maymos]
The predator's walking...
Knowing our intention to stop him
He fears nothing, it will be necessary to act quickly
I can feel him, sense his thoughts, the evil one is watching
when you look into the mirror, the mirror looks into you !!!

[Yae]
Fear my anger
And be haunted by my voice
Deep into the nothingness !!!

[Valma, Esh]
So many dreams been stolen
So many lies been spoken,
We still need you
Beyond death, still shines a spark of life

[Maymos]
So many lives, so many dreams
I heard your call in my sleep
So many times I heard your screams
I felt you needed me
