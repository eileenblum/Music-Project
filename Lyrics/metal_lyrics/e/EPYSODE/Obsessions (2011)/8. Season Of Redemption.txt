[Music &amp; Words: S. Arkan]

[To succeed, Kallon must question himself, and his beliefs.
"Beyond your fear, sleeps a freedom..."]

[Kallon]
Walking in illusion
That's how I feel, what I don't see
I fear myself, fear my delusion

The more I believe, the more I bleed
Iâm blinded and jaded by ancient memories

It's getting dark
My conscience tortures me
This non-existence can not be

It's all in there
My emotions torment me, just want to stop it now

[Maymos - Kallon]
Here comes the season of redemption
(Here comes a reason to believe)
The forgotten ones are waiting for your call

[Esh]
Through another dimension
You must find what you can't see
Listen to yourself, complete your evolution

The more you tear, the less you'll bleed
You are trapped by your dark story
It's getting clear
To believe will change your life
Please give us a chance to live beyond dreams

[Kallon]
It's all in there

[Maymos - Kallon]
Here comes the season of redemption
(Here comes a reason to believe)
The forgotten ones are waiting for your call
Here comes the season of redemption
(Here comes a time to reveal)
The forgotten ones are rising from their fall

[Esh]
Find and ask the Shadow Lord, lost spirit
Leader of wandering ghosts

It's getting clear
To believe will change your life
Please give us a chance to live and exist beyond dreams, to live beyond dreams.

[Maymos - Kallon]
Here comes the season of redemption
(Here comes a reason to believe)
The forgotten ones are waiting for your call
Here comes the season of redemption
(Here comes a time to reveal)
The forgotten ones are rising from their fall
