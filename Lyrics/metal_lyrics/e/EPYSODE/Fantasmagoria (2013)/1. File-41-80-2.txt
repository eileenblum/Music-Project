[Shawn]
One more long night, I donât want to close my eyes again.
Donât want to forget about the day Iâve seen it all for the first time.
What shapes theyâll be in next time?
They live into the dark, they come from deep inside of us...
Inner danger!

[Amy]
Dancing, dancing, she is dancing alone...
She is the one... The one who will kill them all...
Dancing, dancing, she is dancing alone...
Dying, dying... the curse of them all...
