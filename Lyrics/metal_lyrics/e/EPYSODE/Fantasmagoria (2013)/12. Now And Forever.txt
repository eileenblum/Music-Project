[Music &amp; Words: S.Arkan]

[Jordane]
With her hands she covers her eyes
Now blind, she wanders as a ghost
Submerged in the dark sea she is cold as ice

[Amy]
Scary voices invade my head, I fear it
My name being called out across the real

[Amy â Jordane]
Now and forever
Walking away from the light
Itâs now or never
Weâre walking down in the neverland

[Amy]
With her hands she covers her ears
Ghost within, she is her own god.
Looking like a haunted body, she is cold as tears

[Jordane]
Scary voices are tricking my soul,
My name being called out from across the real

[Amy â Jordane]

[Chorus]

[Amy]
In the neverland

[Jordane]
Weâre walking down

[Amy]
Scary voices invade my head, I fear it
My name being called out across the real Iâm walking away from the light

[Amy â Jordane]

[Chorus]

[Amy]
With her hands she covers her ears
Ghost within, she is her own god.
Looking like a haunted body, she is cold as tears

[Jordane]
Scary voices are tricking my soul,
My name being called out from across the real

[Amy â Jordane]

[Chorus]

[Amy]
In the neverland

[Jordane]
Weâre walking down

[Amy]
Scary voices invade my head, I fear it
My name being called out across the real
Iâm walking away from the light

[Amy â Jordane]

[Chorus]
