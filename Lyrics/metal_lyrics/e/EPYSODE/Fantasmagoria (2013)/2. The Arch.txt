[Lone]
Black tears are falling on my face
The wind of blindness covers my eyes
But now it is too late... Too late to have regrets
Iâm facing fate and my agony shall linger
I beg for no mercy
My body and soul are torn
Through hills of despair
Thatâs where Iâll wander
Welcome into the Arch
Built with my rage and falls
Welcome into the Arch
Where my pain will be jailed for years
Tainted blood is running inside me
The evil irony infected my thoughts
But now itâs late... Too late to change it
Iâm facing fate and my agony shall linger

[Chorus]
These are my last words
My last words &amp; journey
Evil shall never prevail again
Here inside the Arch

[Chorus]
Built with my rage and falls
