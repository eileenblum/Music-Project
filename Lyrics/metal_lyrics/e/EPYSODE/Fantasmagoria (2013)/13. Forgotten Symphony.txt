[Music &amp; Words: S.Arkan]

[Jarno]
In the eyes of the enemy
Thereâs only a river of cries
Nothing can change for what Iâve done
Can you hear this forgotten symphony

[Lone]
So it burns you with this rage forever
In the silence, yes in the silence...
You will witness my words forever
In the silence, now and evermore...

[Amy]
It haunted me, released me
Itâs my burden, my sacrifice
Chained to its melodies

[Jarno]
In the room of the enemy
Thereâs our blood quietly sailing
Nothing could change what Iâve done
(Now) I can hear this forgotten symphony

[Lone]
So it burns you with this rage forever
In the silence, yes in the silence...
You will witness my words forever
In the silence, now and evermore...

[Amy]

[Chorus]

[Lone]
Every heartbeat let me think thereâs hope
Even if Iâm destined to be forgotten
I have a reason to save my soul
As I lay dying... I understand, Iâm not alone

[Amy]

[Chorus]
It haunted me, released me
Itâs my burden, my sacrifice
It haunted me, my sacrifice
It haunted me, my sacrifice
