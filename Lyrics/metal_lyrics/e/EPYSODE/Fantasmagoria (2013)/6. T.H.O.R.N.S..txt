[Music &amp; Words: S.Arkan]

[Jordane]
Thereâs something wrong inside of me
What Iâm feeling seems so unreal
I have no faith anymore,
What Iâm searching for canât save me
Now Iâm dying

[Jarno]
Obsessed by anger and obsessed by sorrow
Thereâs no reason to this freakshow
Thorns
Itâs to a stream made of sins
That you and i belong
And we will light the dark
Until a new day begins

[Jordane]
Thereâs no place for remorse in me
The pain Iâve inside looks surreal
I have no heart anymore,
What Iâm searching for canât save me
No more creed

[Jarno]
Obsessed by anger and obsessed by sorrow
Thereâs no reason to this freakshow

[Chorus]
Itâs to a stream made of sins
That you and I belong
Obsessed by anger and obsessed by sorrow
Thereâs no reason to this freakshow

[Chorus]
Itâs to a stream made of sins
That you and I belong... Thorns
And we will light the dark
Until a new day begins
Thorns...
