[Music &amp; Words: S.Arkan]

[Jarno]
Silhouettes of ghosts are fading away
Illusions haunt me in my dreams
Iâm sure it will soon be too late
The chains Iâm in wonât break anymore
Out of consciousness
We are leading this living fortress
I am still alive
Trying not to run and hide
But searching for the light
For so long Iâve been blind
Fearing to face and die
Losing this sacred fight
Monsters are coming in like a poison in my veins
Bleeding me dry... They are calling me, calling you
Out of consciousness
We are leading this living fortress

[Chorus]
Out of consciousness
We are leading this living fortress

[Chorus]
