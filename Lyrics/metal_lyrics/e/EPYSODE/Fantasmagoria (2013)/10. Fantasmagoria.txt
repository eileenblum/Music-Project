She is not like everyone
It might take time to understand
Fall has come and things slowly turn in grey

And I tried to believe you
And to make out of you my fight
But it was not enough to keep you
Away from the darkest night

And I've lost my brightest smile
Thus far I have understood
Either way when you're damned, you must burn

And you tried to help me
And to make out of me your fight
To keep my hollow soul away from the night

Winter's come
I can't go on
I can't go on and leave you there
Let me ease your pain
Can't you hear me shouting out your name?

All night long
Fantasmagoria

We are not like everyone
It might take time to understand
Either way when we are damned, so we must burn

No one can help us
We'll never be the same again
But it's not enough to keep us away from the blackest side

Winter's come
I can't leave you there
Leave you there
Leave you there
Let me ease the pain
Can't you hear the sky calling your name?

Must I be cruel?
It'll never be the same again
You had to choose between evil and good
And you decided to turn off your inner light

Winter's come
I can't go on
Let me ease your pain
Can't you hear me shouting out your name?

All night long
Fantasmagoria

We are not like everyone
It might take time to understand
Either way when we are damned, so we must burn

Winter's come
I can't go on
And leave you there
Let me ease your pain
Can't you hear me shouting out your name?

All night long
Fantasmagoria

So winter's come
I can't go on
I can't go on and leave you there
Let me ease your pain
Can't you hear me shouting out your name?

All night long
Fantasmagoria
Fantasmagoria
