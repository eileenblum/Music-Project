[Music &amp; Words: S.Arkan]

[Amy]
Iâm standing here with a white rose in my hand
To stop the fever that leads my head
Walking on the edge of a black hole
This is the shelter where I fell
My eyes turn to the raging raven
I want to leave this Heaven
Too many days with no light
Morning rose is fading inside
Playing a game that feeds my pain
To shed the bleeding ink in vain
Iâm laying down in this fake world that I hate
To please the demon that leads my fate
Walking on the edge of a black hole
This is the shelter where I fell
My eyes turn to the raging raven
I want to leave this Heaven

[Chorus]
Dying leaves are falling on me
I can feel the poison inside...

[Chorus]
âTil the end of time, forever...
