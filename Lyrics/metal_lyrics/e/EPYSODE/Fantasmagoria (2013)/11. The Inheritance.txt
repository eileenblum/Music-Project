[Words: S.Arkan]

[Amy]
I saw a million of my dreams fall
Tasted so many tears of mine
Wish I could hold the nights
Who are you? What did you want?
Sometimes I just wish to burn it all
Iâll be the storm, the dying sun
The one who eats away
I want to lay there in the breeze
And say âNow youâre gone foreverâ
