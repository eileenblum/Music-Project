[Music &amp; Words: S.Arkan]

[Jarno]
Weakened by the lies of men
Following this endless road of pain
Iâm the chosen prophet
Predicting the birth of new demons
Iâll dive under dark seas, Iâd curse for taking me away
And the rain becoming my fury, I will wash the pledge away
Let me be the fire
To burn the evil from inside
Under this bleeding cross
Let me be the venom
Among the shadows of the world
This is my prophecy
Disappointed by the carefreeness
Following the footsteps of the elders
Iâm elected by god
Predicting the end of the dark times
Iâll dive under dark seas, Iâd curse for taking me away
And the rain becoming my fury, I will wash the pledge away

[Chorus]
Silent are my wounds
My fears become my pride

[Chorus]
This bleeding cross
Let me be the venom
My fears become my pride
Iâm the venom
