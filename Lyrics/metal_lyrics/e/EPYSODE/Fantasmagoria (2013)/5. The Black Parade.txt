[Music &amp; Words: S.Arkan]

[Shawn]
We wonât let you go alone
But we have made a tragedy
And our wounds wonât heal
Our world will fade as my eyes
Is earth the promised paradise?
We could rise above the fire
Into this tragic comedy
Since we have the truth
Our world will fade as my eyes
Is earth the promised paradise?

[Shawn â Lone]
We are lost inside shadows
So many times weâve asked the mirrors
To erase the sins weâve made (but)
We are riding this black parade

[Lone]
Weâre standing on the heavenâs threshold
Like slaves we are waiting for absolution
So many times weâve asked the gods for
Why we were riding this black parade

[Shawn]
Twilight will fade into the flames
Itâs all the visions I can see
Sailing the oceans of time
Our world will fade as my eyes
Is earth the promised paradise?

[Shawn â Lone]

[Chorus]

[Shawn]
Our world will fade as my eyes
Is earth the promised paradise?

[Chorus]
