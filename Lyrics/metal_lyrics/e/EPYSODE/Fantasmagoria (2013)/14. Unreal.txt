[Music &amp; Words: S.Arkan]

[Shawn]
Canât you hear them telling your name
Your days are coming to an end
Dark shapes are walking along the same shores
This place is infected by evil, you have to escape
... Your visions
We are lost souls, we keep on walking
In this never ending road, itâs unreal
Canât you feel them tearing your skin
Your flame is going out, itâs the end
Dark shapes are walking along the same shores
This place is infected by evil, you have to escape
... Your visions

[Chorus]
Youâve never seen the daylight

[Chorus]
This will never be the end
In this never ending road
We keep on walking
