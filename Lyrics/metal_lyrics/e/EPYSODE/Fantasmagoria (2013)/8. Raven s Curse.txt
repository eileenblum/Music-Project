[Music &amp; Words: S.Arkan]

[Lone]
All is lost to me inside
And the emotions have killed the light
I stand here with blood on my hands
Disconnected from this reality, I know
Iâm not able to see what will come to be

[Amy â Lone]
Ravenâs curse brings me to hell
Severed ties from all
I tear away from my soul
And this ritual that I do for love
Tear away from my... I tear away from my soul

[Lone]
I dare to dream even if Iâm afraid
Like an animal Iâm pursued
Lost to live this instinct so cruel... So cruel
Now connected to these dark depths, I know
And Iâm not able to stop it until my own death

[Amy â Lone â Jordane]

[Chorus]
Ravenâs curse brings me to hell
Severed ties from all
I tear away from my soul
And this ritual that I do for love
Tear away from my... I tear away (from my soul)

[Lone]
Iâm the shadow you will see crossing burning bridges.
Just feel the curse... Iâm the cure!
Maybe itâs just a bad dream
No one can hear my screams
Thereâs a short bridge between love and hate
So maybe youâll understand
Redemption is in my hands (Redemption is in his hands)
Thereâs no away to escape from my anger
Sadness is the rain that falls from my eyes
