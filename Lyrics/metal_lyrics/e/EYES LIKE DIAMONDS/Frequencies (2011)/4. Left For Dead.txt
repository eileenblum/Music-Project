Iâve given everything
Erase the memories
to see the story thatâs untold
All I know so well I know
we will pay the price for our sins
We will pay the price for our sins
If only I could see the forest for the trees
oh if only I could see whatâs right in front of me
Iâve made my mistakes
youâll leave me for dead
and the sequence is different
Youâve made your mistakes
Iâll leave you for dead
and the sequence is oh so different
Form the walls to be broken
cut the line and made to fail
The last time I waste my breath
Iâm done and gone Iâm made to fail
And I wonât waste my breath
Form the walls to be broken
And I wonât waste my breath
Iâm done and gone Iâm made to fail
Magnificent Flames!
The stars are jealous of my radiance.
Who else but I could?
Produce such a spectacular
display of self ruination.
