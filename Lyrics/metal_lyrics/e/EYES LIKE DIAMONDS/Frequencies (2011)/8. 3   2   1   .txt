Why can't I run?
from the carnage and the damage done
How could I be?
Weâre falling for everything you say
Leave me weightless
Connecting and letting me decay
How could we be?
Revealing the better days
Now how can we relay this if it all falls down to ruins
Now whatâs been done to save us
Now how can we relay this if it all falls down to ruins
Theyâre fighting for the enemy
Oh, No!
Iâve lost another one
Stop doing this to me
Youâre taking them from me
Itâs so unfair, so unfair, so unfair
What is it that Iâve done to you?
Give them back to me
Now!
Iâve been misleaded
So why do I care
This road has taken me nowhere
Iâve been misleaded
So why do I care
This road has taken me nowhere
Thereâs an error in the system, a break in the code
And weâre losing the progress we started before
Weâre counting down the days till we will see your face
Nothing that I could replace
