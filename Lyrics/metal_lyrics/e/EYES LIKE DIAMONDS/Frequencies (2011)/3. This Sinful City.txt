Now help me see the other side
Give up your body
I wonder about all these nights
Give up your anatomy
Without you by my side
I could never find my peace of mind
If I leave it all behind
How much would you take from me tonight?
Itâs all the sinful things
Thatâs keeping my mind from turning to who I used to be
Iâm not here to play these games
Youâre the perfect addiction the drug I can take
Iâve been!
Waiting oh so long
Iâve been!
Doing what I can
Could you be the one?
The only one
The only one
Iâm all messed up and still wanting more
Give me your body
Iâll give you anything you want
To feed this addiction
Itâs all the sinful things
Thatâs keeping my mind from turning to who I used to be
Iâm not here to play these game
Youâre the perfect addiction the drug I can take
Letâs get away
from this sinful city
Letâs get away!
