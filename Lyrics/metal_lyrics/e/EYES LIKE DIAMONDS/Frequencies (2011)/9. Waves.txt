Watch the waves
Wash me off my feet
Why canât you stay
And Iâm getting in too deep
Weâve been blinded by the fears
Now weâre losing everything
Weâve been fighting this for years
And youâve done nothing
Nothing
Please save me Iâm breaking
And youâre holding back sympathy
This world has convinced me that I am alone
Please save me Iâm breaking
And youâre holding back sympathy
This world has convinced me that I am alone
Now how can we get further from the truth
Forgive me father for I have sinned
Weâve been blinded by the fears
Weâve been fighting this for years
And youâve done nothing
Nothing
Take cover it will all be over soon
This lifeless feelingâs taking over
