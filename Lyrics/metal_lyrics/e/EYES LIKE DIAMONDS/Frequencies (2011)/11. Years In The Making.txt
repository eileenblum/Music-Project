Been under the pressure
Iâve seen whatâs coming
In a blink of an eye
I find myself far from all know
Still fighting this endless war
The skies are grey!
Theres no one Iâd rather be
Weâre starting our battles
Weâre ending this war
Been years in the making
Donât hold your breath, donât hold your breath
Donât hold it for me
Donât hold your breath, donât hold your breath
Donât hold it for me
Youâll see me on top of the world
And everyone has their price
If you could see me
(If you could see me now)
If you could see me
(I think youâd be proud of me)
If you could see me
(If you could see me now)
I think youâd me proud of me
Iâm losing sight I cant control what theyâve created
Take the weakest prisoners and leave them all for dead
Now focus on the horizon line
Iâm losing sight of what was right
Now what was right
Now what was right
Now what was right
