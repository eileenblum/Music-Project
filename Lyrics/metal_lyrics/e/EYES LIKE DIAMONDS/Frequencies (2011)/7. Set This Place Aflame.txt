Take notice to the change in the pace
Keep your place in line
before youâre left behind
If I remind you why youâre here
Just seeing the faces you never get to know
It's all the simple things, that keep me awake, yeah!
It's all the simple things, that keep me awake, yeah!
Youâve set this place aflame
Just look at what youâve done
I stand here alone just like before
Just let me go
If I remind you why youâre here
Just seeing the faces you never get to know
Just save your breath for the oceans depth
Just save your breath, for the ocean
Just save your breath for the oceans depth.
Just save your breath, for the ocean
If I remind you why youâre here
If I remind you why youâre here
just seeing the faces you never get to know
