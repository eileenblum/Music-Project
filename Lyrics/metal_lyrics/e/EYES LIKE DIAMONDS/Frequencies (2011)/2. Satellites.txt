Iâm restless, desperate &amp; cold
Just leave it to me
Through the eyes that are still
From the bitter, the upper, the realm
Just take it from me
Itâs the life I lead
The world comes to me
In satellite pictures created in greed
By taking control
Theyâre planting the seed deep into me
And I will now
Expose the sickness
Destroying all the world
Iâll expose the sickness
Destroying all the world
Media! Media!
Make them all run in terror
make them run make them run
Just you wait and see
the seed wonât fall that far away from the tree
Just take control
youâre lifeless and cold, lifeless and cold
Lifeless and cold
Bitter but desperate
Lifeless and cold
Bitter but desperate
We live, we die, relive and repeat!
We live! We die! Repeat!
The dead have come to life
Communicate it to the rest
The living have all come to die
