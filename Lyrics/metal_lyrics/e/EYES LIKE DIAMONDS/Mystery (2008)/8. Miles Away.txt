Was this some sort of secluded action?

Oh, please, don't you go
Are you ready for the eye contact?
Ollie ollie oxen free

Go, wash away what we could have created
You're missing out

If this is so long
Then goodbye, my love
You'll always be remembered
And the impact
That you left on me I swear
And I swear

Baby, you got a long way to go from here

Tell me that it's possible
Anything is possible

Back and back around
We will get caught up in lust
And I'll stay the same

So get, get, get up and let's go
Live our lives and learn to let go
Letting you know you're an angel

I won't be the one to let the fire burn out miles away from here
(I will stay the same)
