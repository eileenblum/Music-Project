Dim the lights now
These seats are too close together
My eyes run dry cut at the lids
When I see lines cut at the wrist

Time's wasting, you slow
No need to unfold our life stories
I'd rather not know

Medic, I'd rather be turned into static

Waste time on air
We're falling in fast
Over and over again
Don't breathe in
Don't breathe in

Lights out, it's over now
Inhale, come on and breathe

Stop wasting your medicine
Turbulence
Burn this plane to the ground
