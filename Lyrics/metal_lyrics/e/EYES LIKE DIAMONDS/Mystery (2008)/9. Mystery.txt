Tension, attention
Is everybody listening?
We've got a case of jealousy
So here we go, dead or alive

Beg on your knees for mercy
I'll show you nothing
Do you hear me clearly?
Do you hear me, do you hear me?

You can only run so far
When home becomes your hell
Don't hold your breath
We know the score
Chicago won't save you

Dead eye sparrow, dead eye
Aiming for your jugular
Gun them down, one by one

Oh, this is too familiar

I've seen this all before
As you stand here burning bridges
One on one, one on one, this is war

The snow goes up your nose
Faster than the wind blows in Chicago

Leave me here
With my back to the wall
I'll test your glass jaw
And leave you here

Mystery, mystery
Oh, mystery

Compare, contrast this mystery
Compare, contrast
This bitter life you lead
Compare, contrast this mystery
