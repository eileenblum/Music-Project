Walk to hear the footsteps
They're calling the trails
Runs deep
So how is this for a mirror image?

We've come in time to hear the noise
a bullet will solve this with determination
we pass as the grass seems
to grow thick and we learn as we're blowing in the mist

From the front room to the front door
This here crime scene seems to lead us into unknown
When misery follows our lives into the night

Leave the body in the ocean

We are untouchable
Oh, untouchable now
So untouchable now

Hold, how easily we let go
We let go
