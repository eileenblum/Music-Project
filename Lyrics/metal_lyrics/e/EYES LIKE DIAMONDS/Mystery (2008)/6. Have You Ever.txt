With all that fire in your eye
You must be burning me down slowly
But have you ever realized
that I'm the only one that can make you, make you, make you, make you
feel the way you feel around me
And does she love you like I do?
Nooo
Can she hold your heart forever,
Nooo
and can she make your dreams come true?
