The temples falling
I've got your neck in my hand with your back to the wall
Pretend to speak as I'm standing and walking alone

The kingdom's falling now, just let me go
This is all I know these false ideals
If it's a problem, then let it be

Bright lights, bright lights are shooting out at me
It will contain a sense of urgency
And we will kill for blood, that stains these sheets
And we will run away with life and dignity
Send in the plague
It may have taken over my chest
The blood will spill with the sun at our backs
And we're just like the rest

The kingdom's falling now, just let me go
Am I being clear? I walk alone
This is all I know these false ideals
If it's a problem, then let it be

Wanting all you know were coming back, back again
It's meaningless when it comes to religion
Patience, I've been living a lie
God help us
