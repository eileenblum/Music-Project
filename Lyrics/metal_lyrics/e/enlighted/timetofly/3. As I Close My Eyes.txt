Lost in the dark
Drowning in my tears
I saw your eyes
Searching for the light

IÂ´ve tried to catch you when you fell
And I still hear in my head

Please save me from the darkness
I am so afraid
Please wake me from this nightmare
I canÂ´t hold on as I close my eyes

Holding my breath
Going back through time
To touch your face
To hold your hand again

IÂ´ve tried to catch you when you fell
And I still hear in my head

Please save me from the darkness
I am so afraid
Please wake me from this nightmare
I canÂ´t hold on as I close my eyes

You said forever soon will come from behind
Now I drift with the time
To be with you once again.
