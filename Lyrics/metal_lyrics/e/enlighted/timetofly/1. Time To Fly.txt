Every night
I close my eyes
Losing track of time
Am I dreaming or awaken?

A different world
Before my mind
Started to reveal
Turning darkness into light

Say itÂ´s time to go
And take my hand tonight

ItÂ´s time to fly
High over the clouds
Feel the winds blowing on you
This is not a dream
Now your mind has been awaken

A different time
Places unknown
Secrets never told
They had always been inside me

DonÂ´t need wings to fly
Just take my hand tonight

ItÂ´s time to fly
High over the clouds
Feel the winds blowing on you
This is not a dream
Now your mind has been awaken

As I leave the ground, I see a line of light
That leads me anywhere, before this night is gone.
