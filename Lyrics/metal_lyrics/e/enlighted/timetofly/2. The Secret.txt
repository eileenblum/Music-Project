The past days had faded into 
Confusion and pain
Lying awake I wonder
What happened to all my dreams.

Searching higher always been denied
Smashing my dreams to the ground
Burning higher I can feel the fire
And now there is no turning back.

My eyes are now opened to see
The answers are coming to me

Raise my head and start again
No limits to go if we dare to fly
When you know the power inside your mind
YouÂ´re ready to find the secret within you.

The gates of your thoughts are opened
To a new life of dreams

Shining brighter your mind has the power
To change your world as you live
Hold on tighter to what you desire
Your dreams, they will set yourself free.
