Centuries of terrestrial life force flowing through our fingertips.
Spirits of our ancestors guiding our hands.
Supernatural entities benevolent and fused with nature, blessing our minds with endearing wisdom and the passion of warriors.
A lone stranger will come to save us.
A brewing tempest in the skin of a man.
Brace for stainless steel, rendered useless by hand carven passion of the arrow wood.
We willing martyrs will die to grant our people their better days.
Wolves behind the masks, provoke conflict on our soil.
Wolves behind the masks, the cowards descend upon the weak.
Wolves behind the masks, walking in our brother's skins, calling our home their nation.
Legendary malevolent creatures seeking souls to devour.
Shaping shifting monstrosities, grinding their teeth.
Warrior bloodlines flow through me.
Brace for stainless steel, rendered useless by hand carven passion of the arrow wood.
An omnipotent stranger appears and pauses battle with thunder in his words.
I am the silence in piercing sound.
Keep me close to you now.
I am the shadow that tames the moon and paints the earth.
When you feel the heat of that crushing moment, stand by me and never feel alone.
I am the silence in piercing sound.
I am the night.
Breaking the walls that barricade our passion crushing fear.
I am the shadow that blackens the moon.
A lone stranger has come to save us.
A brewing tempest in the skin of a man.
The brave warrior cast out the darkness.
His words of thunder now calm as the wind.
I am the silence in piercing sound.
Keep me close to you now.
I am the shadow that tames the moon and paints the earth.
When you feel the heat of that crushing moment, stand by me, and never feel alone.
I am the silence in piercing sound.
I am the night.
Wolves behind the masks provoke conflict on our soil.
Wolves behind the masks.
The cowards descend upon the weak.
Wolves behind the masks, walking in our brothers skins, calling our home their nation.
Break the wall.
Breaking the walls that barricade our passion, crushing fear.
