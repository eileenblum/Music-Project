Indifferent feelings yield a drain of ambition.
Take me back to the days when I felt momentum retract the ground from beneath my feet.
Every step that I took was a long stride toward my destination.
This is a beautiful dream undeserving to be held in smug contempt.
Grasp what you have, value that, and never let it go.
The word repetition becomes the word consistency.
Never let it go.
The word change becomes the word new.
Never let it go.

Bring me back down to humility.
Teach me the value of holding onto.
Bring me back down and show me the safety of letting go.

The loved ones around me who make me the best that I can be
Are the ones who'll solidify my legacy
As a fulfilled human being joyous
And humbled by the gracious gift of love.

The dreams that I have followed are breathing lungs full of air right before my eyes (the safety in letting go).

Bring me back down to humility.
Teach me the value of holding onto.
Bring me back down and show me the safety in letting go.

Drive and compassion are the forces that make living meaningful and instill within you the spark to ignite the flame.
Grasp what you have, value that, and never let it go.

The dreams that I have followed are breathing lungs full of air right before my eyes (the safety in letting go).
