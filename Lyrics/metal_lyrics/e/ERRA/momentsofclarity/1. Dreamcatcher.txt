Nurtured by the spirits of the wilderness
The only mother we have left
She is the web in the willow hoop
Like feathers, we just hang in the air
Open arms to a motherâs gift
Electric sensations pulsating through our ribs
Breathing life into our dreams, while nightmares wear
Wear down the dancing lines, of her woven web

Hanging beneath the nightmare, we fall apart
Hoping youâll call our names, sweet voice weâll follow
In trying to preserve you (we fall apart [2x])
Restore youth

Ghost of the willow trees
The oak, the pines, the bowing mountain peaks bring forth the solace of your breeze.
Open arms to a motherâs gift
Electric sensations pulsating through our ribs
Breathing life into our dreams
The weight of man is crushing me [2x]

Bring forth the solace of your breeze
From looming pines through ocean seas
Oh Mother, I am breaking down
Oh Mother, I call to you

Ghost of the willows
The weight of man is crushing me
I am falling apart, broken into someone less than who Iâm meant to be
I am lost [2x]

Bring forth the solace of your breeze
From looming pines through the ocean seas
Breathe life into these stagnant feet
Restore the man Iâm meant to be

Hanging beneath the nightmare, we fall apart
Hoping youâll call our names, sweet voice weâll follow
In trying to preserve you (we fall apart [2x])
Restore youth
