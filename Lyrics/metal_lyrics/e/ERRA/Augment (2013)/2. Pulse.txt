Embraced by the fluidic abyss I adore.
Engulfed in beauty that I cannot see.
Pressure mounting on its floor.
Granulated rock shifts beneath my feet.

Accepted as a companion to the creatures,
To the creatures of the current.
Their fluorescent glow transcends allurement.
Their fluorescent glow transcends.

Join me, they motion,
With cunning brilliance, brilliance veiled.
I followed this muse under,
Under waters, waters not sailed.

And through the mineral reef beyond
The shallows, into the deep,
This seraph lead me
Into a lapse of time.

A continual electric pulse of life.

Solemnly staring while my eyes were wearing,
The frailty of my being no longer persisted.
This celestial entity that I'd been pursuing
Delivered my spirit that was forever imprisoned.

And through the mineral reef beyond
The shallows, into the deep,
This seraph lead me
Into a lapse of time.

Adrift in a medium aloof from reality,
I gaze into an exalted mirror.
Its reflection left an affection
That had long been absent.

A continual electric pulse of life.

This creature has become my father.
A giant reaping what he has sown.
Absorbed in the darkness of glacial dead water.
This sentient creature has touched the vast unknown.
Touch the vast unknown.

Life is found where it is taken.
A vapor in the wind cycles.
Replaced when the ground is shaken.
Nature is an equal to mankind.

This celestial entity
That I had been (I had been)
Pursuing delivered my spirit
That was forever imprisoned.

A continual electric pulse of life.
