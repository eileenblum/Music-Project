This lackadaisical mind, the cap to my spine, these weighted words for the punishment of all of our crimes.

As graceful as the rising sun at dawn, you open your mouth, but words don't shine out.

Entangled as one (our bodies are two)
Spiritual deviation (yet my heart's inside you).
Entangled as one (you've swallowed it whole)
Spiritual deviation (like a ghost in my home).

You've become mute in the waters.
Trapped inside this aquifer.

Everything with meaning is filtered out, and stopped from streaming.

Entangled as one.
Spiritual deviation.
Our bodies are two,
Yet my heart is inside you.

You've swallowed it whole like a ghost in my home, and I've tried to escape, but my persistence dissipates.

Bring me back home because I've ran and I have roamed.
My erratic agitation leads to hyperventilation (spiritual deviation).
This is neurosis compelled by those I held the closest.

Sweaty palms can't carry on.
Racing heart, you've played your part.

This is the disintegration of my being.

Love has either lost or proved its meaning.

Entangled as one (our bodies are two).
Spiritual deviation.
My heart's inside you.

This is the disintegration of my being.

Love has either lost or proved its meaning.
