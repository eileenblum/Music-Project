We begin the fall of the Omega generation

I'm left gasping for a breath of air in this failing body and fading beauty

I reach for what was never there,
but I'm still reaching for some reason

Teach me to navigate the stars
(and use the wind to guide my way)

If night and nature are my only hindrance
(then let me see the light of day)

Unheard of is the language that lured me in
It's deeper than the surface resting just beneath the skin
Unheard of is the language that lured me in
It's deeper than the surface resting just beneath the skin

Coated by the stratified soil of my settlement

I dream of lives I've lost (and enduringly lament)

Unfinished pillars of our generation
personifying this falling nation

People and animals alike; the people are animals at night
Reverting back to their natural state when law was shapeless and held no weight

We live in caves buried in mountains
Stalactite supports without foundations

We are our fathers' bastard children, evolved from cursed seed, but we are not helpless
We will become the rebirth of hope

This steadfast campaign remains relentless

(We will remain relentless)

Unfinished pillars of our generation,
personifying this falling nation

People and animals alike; the people are animals at night

Reverting back to their natural state when law was shapeless and held no weight

We live in caves buried in mountains
Stalactite supports without foundations

We begin the fall of the Omega generation

Coalescence of Omega children, take my hand
The new world begins

Unfinished pillars of our generation
(Reverting back to their natural state when law was shapeless and held no weight)

Personifying this falling nation
(We live in caves buried in mountains, stalactite supports without foundations)

Unfinished pillars of our generation
(I dream of lives I've lost enduringly)

Personifying this falling nation (falling nation)
