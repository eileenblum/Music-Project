Our hands were holding our fate, but they grew tired. Everything we knew came crashing down in waves of fire.
Strange hands over mouth and in hair. Red eyes from the water, gasping for air, rebirth.
Blurred vision disrupts perception of this present state. Made new in the chilling currents that carry me away.
Follow your heart and leap from the cliffs. Close your divine eyes to reason. Let inertia move you. Cling and be clung to. Speak and be spoken to. How beautiful you find yourself. Remove this scourge from where we dwell. You will be found in a dark place and somewhere through time and space.
Adorned with purity yet blessed with knowledge, contradicting what I've been taught.
Upheld in a pale light that burns my skin.
I am the distorted one. I am a prisoner in this body, bound and chained to flesh. I am the distorted one. I am a prisoner in this body.
A mirror reflecting an honest rendition. A faction following a faithless tradition. Your own body renamed religion.
