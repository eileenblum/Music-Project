In the reflection of the water's stream, I watch the current carry me.
Irresolute and indiscriminate, this liquid flux is transcendent.
A birth to conquered memories of sentimental quintessence.
Learning to let go of oneself converts grievance into lessons.
Your innermost thoughts appear physically. Cataclysm is bound to everything.
The event horizon; there is no escaping, inescapable.
Light speeds, black holes, time lapse; we're unstable.
To contemplate the unthinkable, break free from captivity.
Envelope the atmosphere with magnetized waves of processed nerve activity.
Bring me back to the river's edge to bathe in consequence.
Future events colliding, spoken of in present tense.
The event horizon; there is no escaping, inescapable.
Light speeds, black holes, time lapse; we're unstable.
Misplaced ideals provoke tension. There is no escaping it. Dementia in this dimension.
Our neurologic fortitude has been broken through.
All of the pieces once whole have shattered in contact with you. Dementia.
In the reflection of the water's stream, I watch the current carry me away. Irresolute and indiscriminate, this liquid flux is transcendent.
Carry me away.
