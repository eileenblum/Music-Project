Tossed around the idea of stepping off the edge
Hoping my fall lands into a familiar place
A familiar face, can we leave this space?
It reminds me of all my mistakes
(All my mistakes)

Bite my tongue
Vision spins
Living life from the cutter's skin
Sent to be an ungrateful son
Cant you see my breath is gone?

Bury my head to hide from reality
I'll make a new name for myself
I'm on my own
I just hope I have the strength to move and show fortitude

Bite my tongue
Vision spins
Living life from the cutter's skin
Sent to be an ungrateful son
Can't you see my breathe is gone?

Just let me sleep tonight
I only feel safe inside

Shadows cast and dance slick
These walls expand quick
With every strike
I shudder at the wake

Rippling through my drifting mind
What if I knew the journey this whole time?

Just let me sleep tonight
I only feel safe inside

So I need to be saved?
Do I want to be?
I don't want to be the shell of what these people see

Just let me sleep tonight
I only feel safe inside
