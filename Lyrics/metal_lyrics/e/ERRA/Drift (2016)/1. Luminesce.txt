I'm spiraling out of control, so you illuminate a clean slate.
You're lifting the weight that's diluting inspiration.

I WOKE WITH THE SUN IN MY FACE, MOUNTAINS BY MY SIDE, THE DESERT AIR PULLING THE BREATH FROM MY LUNGS!
I MAKE MY WAY THROUGH A BARREN LANDSCAPE, LITTERED WITH REMAINS OF PAST LIVES AND SHADOWS OF THE SCAVENGERS!

World passing by, leaving traces of shapes, blurring into memory. Dreaming of terrain that sustains, I wake up.

WAKE UP!
I'M LYING PARALLEL WITH THE LANDSCAPE!

There will always be a void to be filled.
Illuminate a clean slate.
Keep lifting the weight THAT IS DILUTING INSPIRATION!

THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A VOID WITH NO PERMANENT FIX! SHIFTING OF PUZZLE PIECES TO SIMULATE A WHOLE!

World passing by, leaving traces of shapes, blurring into memory. Dreaming of terrain that sustains, I wake up (WAKE UP!) to a world that's unfamiliar.
We leave, and then we go back like we never left home (LIKE WE NEVER LEFT!).
We go back like we never left home (LEFT HOME!).

WHEN WILL WE WAKE THE FUCK UP!?

PARALLEL WITH THE LANDSCAPE, I LIE AWAKE WITH DIMINISHING DESIRE TO ALWAYS SEEK ESCAPE FROM A HOME WHERE I FEEL SOUND AND SAFE!

World passing by, leaving traces of shapes, blurring into memory. Dreaming of terrain that sustains, I wake up.
Wake up. When will we all wake up?

DIMINISHED DESIRE TO ALWAYS SEEK ESCAPE!!! to a world that's unfamiliar. We leave, and then we go back like we never left home (LIKE WE NEVER LEFT!). We go back like we never left.
