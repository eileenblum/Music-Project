Every memory recalled is an origin that we've altered
Broken promises to another man's daughter
Endless walk down a dead road as our last breaths begin to falter
We lend our weight to the backs of our broken fathers

Featherweight boy in his arms
Every night he weeps
Constantly drifting in and out of sleep

Palm against transparent skin
Fingers tracing ribs
Reassurance that the heart was still beating

At the helm of death every day like clockwork
Restless nights with trembling hands against transparent skin
But they carry on
Because survival is not a dead end

Whether or not the world is withered away (withered away)
We are each other's world entirely
Whether or not the world is withered away (withered away)
We are ever, we are evermore

Lost ghosts around every corner
On every charred sidewalk
Still trudging through the ash of an endless walk

With bodies cold and weightless
Resilient of death in life
Resilient of death in death
They walk on

Dreaming of a safe haven at the end of the road
An unstable safety
The only kind we've ever known

Oh, we walk along
Dreaming of a safe haven
Oh, we walk along
At the end of the road

Our legs will never fail
We'll carry on

And I swear to you...

Whether or not the world is withered away (withered away)
We are each other's world entirely
Whether or not the world is withered away (withered away)
We are ever, we are evermore

Oh, we walk along
Dreaming of a safe haven
Oh, we walk along
At the end of the road

Resilient of death because life is not a dead end

Whether or not the world is withered away (withered away)
We are each other's world entirely
Whether or not the world is withered away (withered away)
We are ever, we are evermore

Survival is not a dead end, we are evermore [2x]
