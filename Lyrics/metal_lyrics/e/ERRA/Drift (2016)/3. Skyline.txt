Cityscape Skeletons 
Taking shape and growing skin
Layer and layer is peeled away
Exhausted 

From the repetition of always needing to rebuild 
Worn down faces in colorful barren places

City lights and skylines 
Guiding home our wandering minds
Tucking us into tortoise shells
Suppressing the outside sounds of relentless consciousness

Where is contemplative terrain that sleeps with the setting sun?
This nocturnal apathy 
Binging on shadow and smoke
It's endlessly coming undone

When the ground falls out who will take my hands?
When things fall apart, who will take my hand?

I never thought that I could withstand falling short when I'm a broken man
You never knew how much I meant it in love
Every night I'm beside you weeks away when you're sleeping alone
Did you ever know how much I meant it?

Millions of tiny pieces looking in on themselves
Reflected in the water
Unaware of each other
Every piece could find its place back in the puzzle
What was one is shattered into many and longs to be whole again

But nothing ever fits quite the same in the end

I never thought that I could withstand falling short when I'm a broken man
You never know how much I meant it in love

I never thought that I could withstand falling short when I'm a broken man
Every night I'm besides you weeks away when you're sleeping alone
Did you ever know how much I meant it?

When the ground falls out who will take my hand? 
When things fall apart who will take my hand?
