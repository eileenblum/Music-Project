This moment's passing breeze feels like your tender breath I used to know so well
The silence is crushing the white noise that used to call my name

Break down and all my thoughts have escaped me
Except for all the things that show me your face ever so brightly

Poised through a lie that still remains
Such little left that I can say with authenticity
So I...

Close my eyes
And I can hear you calling from behind
Close my eyes
I swear I feel you crawling towards the light

Tell me the words that will keep you close

Poor soul, heart full
Temperature fluctuates
To later be buried in my own personal graveyard of emotion and past mistakes

Close my eyes
And I can hear you calling from behind
Close my eyes
I swear I feel you crawling towards the light

My skin is turning white
Watching your soul in flight
Close my eyes
I swear I feel you crawling towards the light

The bloody beat beat beat in my chest
The coldest chill creeping up my neck
Tell me the words that will keep you close

Life won't feel the same anymore 'cause you're gone
And it's far too late to say the things I'm sorry for

Five fingers gripping the glass
For the last time I'd hope to say
Three nights with no separation
I know too well there's one more thing I could have said

Life won't feel the same anymore 'cause you're gone
And it's far too late to say the things I'm sorry for

I can't take it back
I can't bring you back
Life won't feel the same anymore
'Cause you're gone
And I'm holding on
