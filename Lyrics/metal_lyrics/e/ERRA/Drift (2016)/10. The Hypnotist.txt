These black holes in my hands
So endless
Swallowing everything that I see

This open wound in my chest
So endless
Devour me

Shameful desire
Spreading like a wildfire
You've seen it yourself
Devour me

Sickening shameful desire
Spreading like a wildfire
You've seen it yourself [2x]

My body's breaking down
My spirit is submissive

Broken memories consume me [2x]

Distance grows between you and I
Discord unforeseen
Won't you just say what you mean for the last time?
Say what you mean tonight

This open wound in my chest
So endless
Is rapidly expanding
Broken memories consume me

Time slips away
And we're left here waiting off the memories we saved
I go far away and leave you here writing off the memories we saved

Return to me
Reconciled when we collide
Return to me
With full force in every stride

Life falls fast as time slips away
Return to me
Reconciled when we collide

Sometimes our darker side grows hypnotizing
Pleading for release
Consciences out of touch
With love subsiding
Needing set free

We're writing off memories as time slips away (time slips away)

Welcome to the free world
With consciences out of touch

You know when a love so full fades away
You ponder things lost between time and this hollow space
You ponder what you can't replace
And your mind recalls her face
