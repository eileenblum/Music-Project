Take a breath. Enter the unknown.
Watch your step. Itâs an escape to the world anew.
Flood yourself with colors and senses on overload.
Sink inside yourself.
Watch out for the bottom because there's no turning back once it takes control and you prefer this new creation.

The pain exits slowly, and thereâs nothing left but bliss.
Floating out at sea, away from reality.
It pulls me under, the tide will blow your mind.
I'm drifting in and out of ocean dreams.
It pulls me under, the tide will blow your mind.

My pulse is sent into overdrive. Trying to calm my nerves with an unnatural catalyst.
Agitator, wave maker, incendiary, excite my life.
Floating out at sea, away from reality.
It pulls me under, the tide will blow your mind.
I'm drifting in and out of ocean dreams.
It pulls me under, the tide will blow your mind.

Drifting in and out.

Drifting in and out of reality.
Drifting in and out of ocean dreams.
Drifting in and out of reality.
Drifting in and out. Let your mind drift.
