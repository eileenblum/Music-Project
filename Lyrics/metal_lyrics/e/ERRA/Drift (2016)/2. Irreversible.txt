A sequence of events unfolding in reverse
A sting better stimulated when revealing tragedy first
Reverse perception
Reversing imperfection

Be aware of the darkness that lies beneath the surface of contrived pleasantries
Be aware so as to always hold tighter
Speak softer
There is no failsafe

So now you know
There is no failsafe

So cut ties with the dead weight that is dragging you below

Pull me closer
When silence consumes you I'll speak words softer
Sinking slower
We stimulate the sting
Restrain

I'm not giving up
I'm giving in to the touch
Of every inch of your sea salt skin
But you set me ablaze
And spread me out with waves in the ocean
With every trace of doubt

Black me out
Don't stimulate the sting
Don't let the wrong choices repeat themselves
Don't stimulate the sting of irreversible emptiness

Pull me in close [2x]

It's in the empty spaces
That we find ourselves
It's in the empty spaces
Reaching out and grasping

Searching for what we need to find
Who we are [2x]

There is no failsafe
It's what keeps me hanging on
To what you are to me
You're what keeps me hanging on

I'm not giving up I'm giving in
So let's begin again
(let's begin again)

Pull me closer
When silence consumes you I'll speak words softer
Sinking slower
We stimulate the sting
Restrain

Pulling you closer 'cause after all
You're pulling back farther
And we're sinking slower
We stimulate the sting
Restrain

Don't turn your back on her
Let her her look you right in the eyes
You coward

Don't stimulate the sting
Don't let the wrong choices repeat themselves
Don't stimulate the sting of irreversible emptiness
