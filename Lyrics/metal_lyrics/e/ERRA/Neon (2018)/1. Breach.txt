It comes to fracture vested trust
A love to shatter and turn to rust
I drag my name through waves to wade black water, wallow and drown

A new shade of gray disorients the portrait
Repetitive contusions concuss the allure
Cataract eyes and cloudy minds interrupt a perfect design

Crashing waves come to swallow us
Wallow and drown in it
Shadows wait to devour us
It hurts to surrender

Presentation is everything when you created the play
The audience hypnotised by the imagery, in this vicious cycle of disbelief that the visionless can not conceive
You can drag me down six feet deep, so I can fight for a life that I threw away
In this moment of resurgence, clear the dissonance, and recover me

Fears suppressed exploit our lust, and our memories turn to rust

And when we reach that point, barren of things to say, thereâs nothing left to save, do not resuscitate
Swallow your pride, hide what you feel inside, there are some things that can not be rectified

Crashing waves come to swallow us
Wallow and drown in it
Shadows wait to devour us
It hurts to surrender
Leeches lie in wait, but you're blind to it
A void that you create, you give life to it
It hurts to surrender

It comes to fracture vested trust, a love to shatter and turn to rust
I drag my name through waves to wade black water, wallow and drown

If words could carry my pain through the busy streets and empty alleyways, be the one who hears my cry, like the moon who craves the night
You can drag me down six feet deep, so I can fight for a life that I threw away
In this moment of resurgence, clear the dissonance, and recover me
