[feat. Adam Langston of By Blood and Iron]Unconscious existence that lingers within, forget your inherent pride.
Cling to the concept of perpetual grief and allow yourself to die.
Hand over hand, youâve made your way down to an altitude of disdain.
Without neglect, perseverance became you, and you are now the same.
Two In one, a mutual creature that I will not acquit.
Enfold this gift of reassurance because you will soon have none of it.
This, vowed by the ancestry of those displeased with your conduct.
Disregard the messenger of wisdom, head his words.
Reform and abduct.
A conductor of the visionless will obscure his words to imprison.
The sightless will follow without distraction and blindly innocent.
A Conductor of the visionless will obscure his words to imprison.
His dialect is fortified.
Unconscious existence that lingers within, forget your inherent pride.
His dialect is fortified by misunderstanding and confusion.
Those following will be absolved of their existence, and the survivors living in delusion.
This, vowed by the ancestry of those displeased with your conduct.
Disregard the messenger of wisdom.
Hand over hand, youâve made your way down to an altitude of disdain.
