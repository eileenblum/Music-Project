I will reconstruct this machine to withhold its new direction.
I want to be numb.
I have been destructed, immobilized, buried by our junction.
Reconstruct.
Overwhelmed by my corrupted life.
The bearing I once started has been lost among the animation of what Iâve become.
Collaboration of this being and the architectâs reflection.
Sealed for so long in a tomb of assurance, this structure Is a misconception.
The creator has found a fracture derived from the point of inception.
Its origin so deeply rooted, undetected and unitary.
Every fiber of the carrier tears, the further this is carried.
I have been destructed, immobilized, buried by our junction.
Reconstruct.
I must disengage the Imperfection and begin again.
Determine the source, and undo it from within.
I must disengage the Imperfection and begin again.
The bearing I once started has been lost among the animation of what Iâve become.
I want to be numb.
I will reconstruct this machine to withhold it's new direction.
A collaboration of this being and the architectâs reflection.
I want to be numb.
Among the animation of what Iâve become.
The bearing I once started has been lost among the animation of what Iâve become.
