Children of Anu.
A son born of Tiamat and Abzu.
His motherâs dissected corpse carefully arranged to create the universe.
Marduk, patron God of Babylon.
Marduk is aging.
A city in decline.
Anu Impregnates the Earth.
Birth seven Gods.
Decree their destinies to serve as the weapons of Erra.
The ruins of a city.
The vicious Sebitti.
Fear.
Children of Anu.
Lay low living things.
Fill their hearts with dragonâs venom.
Devastation to Marduk and Babylon.
Ishum lights the way through the darkened city streets.
His body illuminates. Ignite like Gerra.
In the wake of Erra, they decimate.
Devastate a city in decline.
May they lay low living things.
The Igigi will glorify your name.
Mountain peaks bow their heads in terror.
The gods, your Fathers, praise your valor.
Kings kneel beneath your feet.
Countries bring you their tribute.
Demons flee.
Rolling seas hear and stir up.
People are frightened into controlling the noise.
Ishum lights the way through the darkened city streets.
His body illuminates.
Ignite like Gerra.
In the wake of Erra, they decimate.
Devastate a city in decline.
Devastate the city of the gods.
Children of Anu.
Lay low living the things.
The Igigi will glorify your Name.
The Gods, your Fathers, will praise your valor.
