I am a spirit divested of human capabilities
I am a spirit
There are masses alike
Hiding in plain sight
Open your eyes
You can not perceive me
Closed off to the senses that exist
In your reality
There is a ghost in all of us
There are many that try to open their minds
Deciphering the intellect of spiritual design

White noise
Too many have come before you and failed
Causing the constant scientific derail
Open up
Open your eyes

Beyond our world lie parallels between
Our dimensions images unseen

What is this entity
And what does it want of me
It has a hold on my soul
I can't get free.

So many that try to open their minds,
Deciphering the intellect of
Spiritual design.

White noise.
Open your eyes
You can't perceive me
Closed off to the senses that exist
In your reality
Beyond our world
I will abandon myself

What is this entity
And what does it want of me.
It has a hold on my soul.
I can't get free.
Am I allowing my atrophy.
Or can I stop this
From happening?

I will abandon myself.
I will abandon myself

Rebirth in a dimension unknown, unseen
I will leave my body.
Still small voices are resonating.

Beyond our world lie
Parallels between
Our dimensions, images unseen
Amongst the dead.
Sound frequency.
There is a pulse.
Images unseen.
