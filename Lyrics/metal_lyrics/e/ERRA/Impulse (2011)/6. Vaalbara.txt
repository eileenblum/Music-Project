Youâve been torn between opposing forces.
The drag of this contingent event is unbearable because of these tectonics that
shift beneath your feet.
It is arrogant to disregard and foolish to turn away.
An ignorant bliss does not exist in a reality that ceases to live.
You are falling forward while falling back.
Too adorned with blemishes that hide the facts.
This world around you is drifting through an ocean that despises you, and the
continent is not content with being connected, youâre relative.
Until torn and tattered, departed and disgraced.
The life you contrive will have no place.
Beget and begotten, your will erased.
Its geography has been razed.
You are falling forward while falling back.
Too adorned with blemishes that hide the facts.
Youâve been torn between opposing forces.
Until torn and tattered, departed and disgraced.
The life you contrive will have no place.
Left with only soil beneath your fingernails from the potterâs field.
Six feet under lay the vaulted graves of bodies that didnât yield.
This world around you is drifting through an ocean that despises you, and the
continent is not content with being connected, youâre relative.
Six feet Under lay the vaulted graves of bodies that did not yield.
