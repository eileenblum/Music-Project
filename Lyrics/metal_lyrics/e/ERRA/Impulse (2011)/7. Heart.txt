When was the last time you looked at me with adoration?
Iâve only existed by the blessing of your apparition.
I am drowning, falling from the surface.
To lose what is closest to me is the end of my beginning.
Adapting forms consume the thought of this love ending.
I am drowning, falling further from the surface.
You were the constant truth that gave my life purpose.
Conflict resides inside my desperate lungs.
Maintain the oxygen or just fill up.
I feel so close to you again.
Let a scream out and the water in.
This was meant for us to share, an elegy sung for you to hear.
Unending love from a heart thatâs been sinking since you left.
I am the son remembering his fatherâs death.
To lose what is closest to me is the end of my beginning.
Adapting forms consume the thought of this love ending.
Unending love.
