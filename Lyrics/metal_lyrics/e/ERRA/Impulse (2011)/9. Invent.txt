Iâve been built up to be destroyed.
Betrayed myself and my intuition.
Distracted by plagues of common ploys.
Weighing heavy with antagonistic intension.
Now I am frail.
By design, this framework is meant to fail.
Iâll be buried with the bodies of the ones Iâve sent to hell.
Should I be relieved that Iâve been graced with this?
The knowledge of what could be gained and has been missed.
Terrified in reflection, thereâs a mutual objection.
This advantage doesnât justify your cause.
Should I be relieved that Iâve been graced with this?
The knowledge of what could be gained and has been missed.
Reach for my hand to pull you out of this position.
We abide by common laws.
My actions have failed us.
You are not inadequate.
Donât rely on a being thatâs not fully obstinate.
Security for oneâs self can only come from within.
Decide who will be the creator and who will be the invention.
Invent.
