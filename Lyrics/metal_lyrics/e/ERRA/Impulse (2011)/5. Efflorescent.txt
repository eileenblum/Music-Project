My primordial fears have been recognized as the indignation swells within me.
As swiftly as Iâve been denied, Alpha hails Omegaâs ending.
To recreate would break covenants and leave prophecies unfulfilled, but to
hesitate would halt movements and condemn the stronger willed.
Embittered by the haze of the task I must complete, my body recalls initiative
rising slowly to its feet. Nerve endings severed from their controlling host.
A calloused consciousness contorts the mind.
Physicality piloted by an outer ghost, no longer prefaced with a sense of time.
Days become Intertwined and soon months and seasons tangle together.
Embittered by the haze of the task I must complete, my body recalls initiative
rising slowly to its feet. Nerve endings severed from their controlling host.
Alpha hails Omegaâs ending.
A calloused consciousness contorts the mind.
I no longer gaze into the darkened sky that labors and births catastrophic weather.
A time will come to start a new, one that is my recreation.
But as these blighted days ensue, false light will come from an abomination.
To hesitate would halt movements and condemn the stronger willed.
To recreate would break covenants and leave prophecies unfulfilled.
Alpha hails Omegaâs ending.
Abomination.
