Iâve lingered for far too long in the shallows of this water.
A body, cold and constant, embraces the gift of a daughter.
To be wrapped in the arms of a tormenting giant.
She is carried with an air of relentless defiance.
Beautiful beyond comparison.
Her lungs embrace the toxic air.
Knowing this, she takes a breath.
Beautiful beyond comparison.
The experience of reality, to her, was a formality.
Engendered as the giantâs gift, she damned the waters and slowed our drift.
What can we learn from the remains of a goddess?
We must change the pattern before we become godless.
Interrupt this flux that connects the complexities.
Learn to uncover the secrets in subtleties.
Beautiful beyond comparison.
Her lungs embrace the toxic air.
Knowing this, she takes a breath, begging for her chemical rest.
A body, cold and constant, embraces the gift of a daughter.
