I'm crawling out.
This withering world is exhaustive.
Vacuous space will be my coffin.
Drifting weightless, wandering through the void dead and aimless.
Ashes to ashes, freed from the ties that bind.
Defined by lack of connection.
Infinite blackness, ubiquitous and cold.
Enfold, I'm lost in the shadow.

Lost light that has yet to be revealed.
Feel the flow of empty endless spiral, through the void.
What's left to be broken is discarded.
Lost light that has yet to be revealed.
The blood is our reckoning.
I feel the flow of empty endless spiral, soaring through the void.

I am a vessel of the generations, withered and breathless.
A coma chosen true,
The void that followed suit,
The world that we abused.
Eye of God.

No disruption of the rest.
Death was always part of the process.

The eye of God, it is hollowing.
The speckled void, it is swallowing.
Feel the flow of empty endless spiral, soaring through the void.

I step into a narrow consensus,
Walking along the edge of the knife.
With the restless eye ever watching,
Weeping into perpetual abyss.

Lost light that has yet to be revealed.
The blood is our reckoning.
I feel the flow of empty endless spiral, soaring through the void.
The eye of God, it is hollowing.
The speckled void, it is swallowing.
Feel the flow of empty endless spiral, through the eye of God.
