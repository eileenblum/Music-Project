It all started with your conscience.
Something you clung to so tight,
but somehow lost.
It started with your conscience.
Something you clung to so tight,
but somehow lost. (Somehow lost.)
In the midst of your greatness
I gave all I had not to give in.
But your persuasion comforted me.

You changed out of your divinity
and made yourself human -
Something others wouldn't fathom.
You changed out of your divinity
and made yourself human -
Something others wouldn't fathom.

It presented itself to me
and told what I could be.
Now I can see you're changing into a god.
Your will is now your way.
And I remain protected from this.
My sight is still unchanged.

What caused you to be so careless
that you would give up your place?
I thought it would be us forever.
Now that's only in dreams;
only in my nightmares.
You changed out of your divinity
and made yourself human -
Something others wouldn't fathom.
The past has found its place in history
and this chapter of our lives is gone.
Torn from the books, whoa.
