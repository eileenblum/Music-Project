I've seen the eyes of men
turn from blue to gray.
I've felt their hearts
stand still from life to death.
Truth is something lost beyond the grave.
Corrupted thoughts now hold us in chains.
Truth is something lost beyond the grave.
Corrupted thoughts now hold us in chains.
This is our chance,
our chance to rise.

Before the building crumbles,
before we die.
Hand in hand.
Join us together this last second.
Let's reconcile what was this place
and rebuild the bridge that joins us.

We're reaching out
and hoping for something to hold us still.
Searching for something,
an answer to nothing to make this clear.

Your life meant more to me
than this world in its entirety.
Your life meant more to me
than this world in its entirety.

Before the building crumbles,
before we die.
Hand in hand.
Join us together this last second.
Hand in hand.
Join us together, one last time.
Join us together, one last time.
One last time, join us.
Hand in hand.
Forever.
