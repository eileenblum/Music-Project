There is no place for existence
in a world with no hope.
Held hands have come undone;
we're all on our own.

There is no place for existence
in a world with no hope.
Held hands have come undone;
we're all on our own.

So take this gift.
So take this gift.
Is any of this enough?
Turn and face the sun,
without which we'd die.

Is any of this enough?
Turn and face the sun,
without which we'd die.

So take this gift that I give.
Will we ever learn by our pasts?
Will we ever learn by our pasts?

Turn and face the sun.
Is any of this enough?
Turn and face the sun,
without which we'd die.
Is any of this enough?
Turn and face the sun,
without which we'd die.
