I can see for miles across this concrete wasteland
From the tops of the trees and to the seas
I can see for miles across this concrete wasteland
From the tops of the trees and to the seas

They have all grayed with age
The broken will of man has become routine and has stretched beyond the horizon
They have all grayed with age
The broken will of man has become routine and has stretched beyond the horizon

A long path
A long path that was once a destiny
The city streets are a maze in our minds
that was once a destiny
The city streets are a maze in our minds, our minds
A never-ending puzzle lost in a dream

I pray for those who walk these streets
that they may see the tops of the towers
And expand their conscience

I beg they open up their eyes and bear witness to this crumbling city
But some things may never change
some things may never change

The sun sets on the metropolis as only streetlights
Illuminate its collapse
Mesmerized by illuminated skies
The towers linger as if watching us fall.

The sun sets on the metropolis
as only streetlights illuminate its collapse.
I beg they open up their eyes
and bear witness to this crumbling city.
But some things may never change.
Some things always stay the same.
But some things may never change.

Mesmerized by illuminated skies.â
The towers linger as if watching us fall.
