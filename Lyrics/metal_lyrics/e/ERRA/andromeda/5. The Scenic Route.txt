Remove the chains and allow this monstrosity to feed
The floodgates have been opened on the weak
Washing out the inconsistency
Overbearing on the land is the sea
Everything is now saturated with confusion
The waters that once quenched our thirst
Is drowning all that drink of it
Misguided to the point of drought
The earth is swallowing us all
You open your mouth, we open our eyes
I can see what your trying to do
Unfortunate how you live your lives
Mislead by what you think is truth
Heart of a liar, but the face of a leader
Is it that you are confused
Don't pretend like you understand
Remove the chains and allow this monstrosity to feed
The floodgates have been opened on the weak
Washing out all of this noise
We've been in this desert for too long
Now we've been moving in circles
For far too long.
