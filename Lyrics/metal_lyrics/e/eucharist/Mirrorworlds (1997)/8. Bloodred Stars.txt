Led by the lust ot create art
I erase the sun and the sky
with inspiration from deep within
I paint my own universe...in red.

Asd I am watching my hands art performance
I calmly leave my body behind,
thrugh a cold, gloomy mist
I am floating into the land of
stars.

Sleepless nights filled with horror...
evil eyes stares into mine...
faces laughs as they melt before me...
King of red stars - guide me out of this nightmare,
and burn with me in my paradise...burn with me...
