Our minds are no longer present.
They have given place to a new self.
Awake now, from all the blindness
that clouds our sight beyond.

My thoughts became so solemn,
beneath a sky of burning stars.
Lost in a purple mirrorworld
of pure euphoria...I soar...

Awaiting the sweetest release - deliverance.
From my heart the rain of rebith flows free,
as the night finally welcomes me
through the void where time ends...I soar...afar.

Our minds are no longer present.
The have given place to a new self.
