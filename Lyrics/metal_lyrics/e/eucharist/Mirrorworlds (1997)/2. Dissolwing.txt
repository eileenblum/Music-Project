The wind of the end from the abyss so desolate through
my body once fled and closed my eyes... to never be opened
for the life...of me... it blew away

Into the blackened night of my world within,
soaring...through and beyond my mind
and into the void o its universe.

I am dissolwing...as if born again, into an essence so eternal
and oh so nocturnal.

Released... to float afar, and to depart...as the stillness turns
my cries to silence, caressing my wounds to none - with the
colours of its dawn purging through my thoughts. I once again
witness a scarlet sky before my eyes...dissolwing
