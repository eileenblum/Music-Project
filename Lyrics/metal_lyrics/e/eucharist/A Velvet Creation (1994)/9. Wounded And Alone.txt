[Re-release bonus track]

[Music: Johnsson/Erlandsson/Almsenius]
[Lyrics: Erlandsson]

September burns in the grass
The autumn removes a dusty blanket covering my face
And I see that the sunset is coming my way
It is coming to crush me with its dark autumn gloom

Upon the fields of my mind
Death dances to the rhythm of falling hope
The shadows dwell upon my body to leave the soul, without life and
push the day into desperation, wounded and alone

All happiness that once flourished, now withers within the four walls
of the head

[lead: Almsenius]

Upon the fields of my mind
Death dances to the rhythm of falling hope
The shadows dwell upon my body to leave the soul, without life and
push the day into desperation, wounded and alone

All happiness that once flourished, now withers within the four walls
of the head
