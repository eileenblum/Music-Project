[Music: Eucharist]
[Lyrics: Erlandsson]

A diciple of ancient rites
A time when reality
was my only shelter
from the weak and wicked

But now
As time has changed
I sit here on my exalted throne
and king I have now become

Foremost in our march of insurrection
I am the creation and destruction
A purpose of all sacrifies
I am all what was ment to be

I spread the seed of evil
Among the lost I punish
Death I will cause
Generations are entombed in pain

[Lead Markus]

As I have my sword
SLaying, twisting
Plunging through their souls
Come fallen angels, follow me now
On through the path of insurrection
