[Music: Eucharist]
[Lyrics: Erlandsson]

The dissolving of me
The burning fires are within
Looking for no tomorrow
Living only in thoughts of yesterday

Terrifying darkness will meet you
if you try to intrude
The depths of my mind
travel far from here

I speak only for myself
and I blame nobody else
For what I have done
I will always be left to carry my pain

Behold my bleeding tears
that fall
because you will never understand
how I feel

When I am nothing but dust
Do not cry for me
I have caused all of this myself
because the depths of my mind
travel far from here
