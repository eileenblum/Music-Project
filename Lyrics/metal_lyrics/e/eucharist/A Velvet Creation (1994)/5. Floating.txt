[Music: Eucharist]
[Lyrics: Erlandsson]

October sun [Lead Thomas]
Falling calmly down the horizon
Everything looks cold
And the natural beauty surrounds this solemn province
But in my eyes
this blasphemous grace is falling apart

So the mist that I once could hide in
am I now becoming part of

I dissapear
Hide amidst the empty clouds
And in darkness I will remain obscure
Distant from this world of wickedness
Floating my way through infinity

I am flying paralyzed through the depths
and I wonder if I ever shall find peace again

[Lead Markus]

My tears are falling from the wasted generations
Creating rivers
Overflowed with carnal suffering
But from my view
I discover their deserted souls
dissolving on their way to deliverance

Floating my way through infinity

[Lead Markus]
