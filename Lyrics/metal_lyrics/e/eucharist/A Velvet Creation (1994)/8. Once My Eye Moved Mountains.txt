[Music: Eucharist]
[Lyrics: Erlandsson]

Once my eyed moved mountains
My sword could pierce like lightning
and on the back of my horse I travelled

Through eternal voids
withing the timeless sphere

Wolves were running by my side
and they abided by my nocturnal grace
My power was sevenfold
and greater than any exalted form

[Lead Markus]

So I tasted the air of mouldering
The air of mortifying resort
I retired as an illusion
and enshrined in bitterness
