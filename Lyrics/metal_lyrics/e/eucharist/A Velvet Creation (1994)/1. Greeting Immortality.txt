[Music: Eucharist]
[Lyrics: Erlandsson]

Beneath the ground
Where I sleep among immortals
Patiently I rest
Waiting for another day to rise

I gather strenght
To complete my desires
And search in darkness for purity
For a saviour to release me

As I look back at my former livings
Sadness reflects within me
Wounds deep inside my soul
Wounds that never will heal

Tears are falling in despair
And the blood in my veins are frozen
As I realize
That I never will be forgiven
