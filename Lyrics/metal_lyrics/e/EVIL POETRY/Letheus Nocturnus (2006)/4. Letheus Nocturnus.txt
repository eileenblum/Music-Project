[Poetry by Zephiroth, Music by Evil Poetry]

Light of blue fire
I see the ethereal face
In this paradise of darkness.

Across the eternal night
I feel the black winds
Beyond of these vaults of ice.

And so the moon still being
There is a life, a sad feeling.

The moon still there
Still making the loneliness shadow.

The moon doesn't see me
There is a chasm between our eyes.

My silence is a crucified lament,
Only waits the rain of your eyes,
The cry of the moon!

Poetry is the true way,
I spread the blackened words,
Was the language of the forest.
