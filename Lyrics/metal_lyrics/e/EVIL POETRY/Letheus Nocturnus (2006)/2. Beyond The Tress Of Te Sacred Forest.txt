[Poetry by Rockarla and Zephiroth, Music by Evil Poetry]

The internal fire will open the soul,
Will raise the flight to renew itself,
In the spiral of other worlds
And change its serpent skin.

The eagle took our hearts
To offer them to the sun
And its light feed us
At the altar of sacrifice.

Internal fire
Give us strength
Winged sun
Take our souls...
... to their fate.

The nostalgy will be buried,
Will be descended to die
In the earth with our tears.

The lie will be wrecked
It will become lost in darkness,
Slipping to the abysses.

Listen our hearts
Listen our hymn
Beyond the trees of the sacred forest.
