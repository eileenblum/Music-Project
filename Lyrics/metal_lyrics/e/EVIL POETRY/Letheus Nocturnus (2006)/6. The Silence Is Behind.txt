[Poetry by Zephiroth, Music by Evil Poetry]

We'll fly in the nocturnal mantle
with courage,
Between poisonous thorns
And tragic screams,
We'll walk under
The burning infernal sun,
Our souls shine
Between tears and blood.

We'll cross into darkness
Fragmenting worlds,
Driving the wind
With our powerful wings,
We'll fight furiously
As a great storm,
Spiting demons curses
Announcing our cruel prescience.

We'll climb mountains
Of salt and ice,
Timeless space,
Immortality is ours,
Everlasting anxiety
To embrace death
And to play at the risk,
To live live in the limits.

We'll ride together
To the unknown boundaries,
We'll sail together
Between silverplated seas,
We'll invoke the dark dimensions,
The silence is behind!
