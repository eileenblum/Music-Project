[Poetry by Zephiroth, Music by Evil Poetry]

On the brink of the grave...
... the sorrow!
At the end of the lane...
... the hollow!

In the extreme of the death
Glimpses from beyond
Come into my head
Taking me to a place
Where nothing of my own,
At the end of the ages
Iâve find my soul alone.

Moments later I arrive
To a land of desolation,
Into a progressive hardening
Of feelings and emotions,
Until a dispiriting darkening,
The coldest and gloomiest travel.

After death my soul awake,
Suddenly I conquer the kingdom,
Called evil empire.

Iâm the immortal majesty
Of an unlimited strange earth.
