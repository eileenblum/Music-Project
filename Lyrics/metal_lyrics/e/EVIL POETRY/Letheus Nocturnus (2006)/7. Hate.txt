[Poetry by Zephiroth, Music by Evil Poetry]

Furies are consumed by fires,
Texture of pleasure,
Drinking effervence blood,
Spiting fire in the sky.

Engendering larvae,
Incubating hells,
The eyes fading stars
Creating the ashes forest.

Lashing insatiable,
Texture of pleasure,
Drinking effervence blood,
The inert breaths go to nothing.

Procreating snakes,
Opening abyss,
hands destroying stars,
Flagellating mountains.

Hate!
Hate!
Superior feeling!

Hate!
Hate!
God of darkness!
