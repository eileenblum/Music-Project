[Poetry by Rockarla &amp; Zephiroth, Music by Evil Poetry]

Our hearts to the sun,
Our spirits to the moon,
Solar eagle,
Nocturnal jaguar.

Wings of fire,
Star skin,
Shine in the sky,
Frozen wind,
Cosmic energy,
Infinite way,
Storm of war,
Yoalli ehecatl!

The black mirror
Open the door,
The cycle has been completed,
The death will defeat to the time,
The ancient bird
Opens the horizon.

We drink blood,
We drink lunar wine,
We drink leteo water,
We change our skin.
