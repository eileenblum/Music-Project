[Poetry by Zephiroth, Music by Evil Poetry]

When I dream so far away
My soul embrace
the impossible shinings,
She comes in this light of ecstasy.

Show me your colors!

I walk in this colossal
Lake of dreams of hallucinations,
Reflecting my emptiness
To the vortex of tragedies.

I have no name,
Iâm faceless,
But my soul run
To deformed ruins of time.

My spirit descend
In this mysterious dream
An still flying
On the dark clouds of madness.

Oh! Great madness
I?m caressing your black flames,
Strange worlds are coming,
This is the sound from the dusk.

The end of the dream
is so far away
my soul embrace the other side,
she comes in this light of desire.

Show me your colors!

I?m lost in this colossal
Lake of dreams and hallucinations,
Reflecting my tears
To the vortex of tragedies.
