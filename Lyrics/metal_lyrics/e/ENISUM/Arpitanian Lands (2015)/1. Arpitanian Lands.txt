In my lands I can feel the soul/spirit of nature
I would like to dream of better times
In my lands I can see nature's creatures
In my heart I want to protect them

Mountains, forests, rivers
I fight for you

Oh... my forest I'm with you
Oh... my mountain I'm with you

Mother this is the Arpitanian lands
Mother Nature, Arpitanian lands
