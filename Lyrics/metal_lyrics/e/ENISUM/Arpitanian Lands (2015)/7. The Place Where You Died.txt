Pain...
Death...
They took you away
Autumn death, bare trees, the place where you died

Father, this is the place where you died
Father, this is the place where you live

Oh my tree you relive in these places
Oh my tree you relive in these lands

Oh... Oh...

In my heart I have a place for you
In my heart I keep a place for you

Father, pain, strength
Sadness, hope...

Oh... Oh...

In my heart I have a place for you
In my heart I keep a place for you
