Oh...
Oh my mother, when you cry, fauna's souls cry
Oh my mother, when you cry, fauna's spirits cry

Mother nature, men don't understand...
They seek happiness, they have no respect

My spirit... Fauna's souls
My spirit... Fauna's souls

Mother nature... you are alive
Fauna's souls... are alive
