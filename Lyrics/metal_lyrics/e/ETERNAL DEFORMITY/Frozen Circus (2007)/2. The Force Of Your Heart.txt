Spit at the throne of the highest wisdom
Take your sheep into the dark
A taste of his blood is a taste of heaven
Are you sure it's all what you want

I can give YOU my soul
I can give YOU my heart
I can give YOU my heart
I can give YOU my soul

I came down from heaven
I gave you hope and dreams
Just worship me little mice
Til the end of time

I came down from heaven
I gave you hope and dreams
Just worship me little mice
'til the end of time
