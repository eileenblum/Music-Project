So silent
I came into your room
So silent
I unsheathed my knife
So silent
I came into your room
So silent
I unsheathed my knife
So silent [x2]

When the dark wood fell before me
And all the paths were overgrown
When the priest of pride
Says there is no other way
there is no other way [x3]

So silent
I came into your room
So silent
I unsheathed my knife
So silent
I came into your room
So silent

When the dark wood fell before me
And all the paths were overgrown
When the priest of pride
Says there is no other way

So silent [x3]
I came into your room
So silent

When the dark wood fell before me
And all the paths were overgrown
When the priest of pride
Says there is no other way
