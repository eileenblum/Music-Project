You poisoned a holy heart.
You raped an innocent mind
And opened a sealed estate.
Your arsenic instead of my blood
Brought the bitterness in
My quiet world.

You offered illusions
In a cute package of words.
You made me thirsty of what I despise.
I was bandit and banit
Because of you, false.

You poisoned a holy heart.
You raped an innocent mind
And opened a sealed estate.
Your arsenic instead of my blood
Brought the bitterness in
My quiet world.

"Come on,
Zealousy,
Yield the relief to my craving body,
Zone of nothing, zone of fire..."

I wished to overcome you
But I became a victim
Of your unconscious conspiracy.

You offered illusions
In a cute package of words.
You made me thirsty of what I despise.
I was bandit and banit
Because of you, false.

And I was suffering so hard,
But my suffering is a proof of my higher rank.
Thus, finally, I won.
