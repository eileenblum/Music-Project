White cold sea
In the far far north
There's no thrills
Just wind and pain

Come with me
Unholy Divine
Stay with me
Unholy Divine
And take me there
Cry with me
Unholy Divine
Laugh with me
Unholy Divine
And take me there
And kiss me hard
And close my eyes
And say: good night child

Red cold sea
In the far far north
Theres no thrills
Just wind and pain
