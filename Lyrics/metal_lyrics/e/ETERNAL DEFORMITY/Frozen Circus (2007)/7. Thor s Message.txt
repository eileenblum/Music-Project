Die in fire
I don't want to listen to your lies
Die and suffer
Delightful to my ear

My hammer looking for the giants
My hammer waiting for the giants

Angry thunder in his free cold eye
Goats are running through the skies
All these Midgard creatures want to survive
Begging for another day
For one night

Die in water
Dark, stinking as your mind
In deep underground
Die like worms you slut

My hammer looking for the giants
My hammer waiting for... [x2]

Angry thunder in his free cold eye
Goats are running through the skies
All these Midgard creatures want to survive
Begging for another day
For one night
