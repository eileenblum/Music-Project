Crime
Always mine
Always there
Crime is the servant of time
Always mine
Always there

The end of secrets
Is still a lost dream
The tale of wiseman
Smells like a dead lustful old corpse
But you believe and pray
There is no chance to get away up high

Dark nights and mornings
Still strong our faith will die
Dark nights and mornings
So hard to speak without lying

Now all children are free
All churches are burning in the name of truth
The final calling
The light I see in the end
The final calling
It's only a dream it's nothing else

Crime
Always mine
Always there

Meine Damen und Herren
Herzlich wilkommen in unserem Zirkus "Eternal Deformity"
Wir haben Elefanten
Wir haben Affen
Wir haben alles...
