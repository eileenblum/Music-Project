Close to your soul
In pure light
Delicate like wine
From these hills

Red finger tips
Red water
Spinning down and deep
To unknown
To cold dark sleep

It's all you need
The way of your dance is...
So quiet
Bleeding forever
Your wings of fire
Another desire
It's all you need

Never cry
Never ever inside
I feel this endless night
Never cry
Never ever inside
Never cry
Never ever inside
I feel this endless night
Never cry
Never ever inside
