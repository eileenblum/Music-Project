LONG SEARCH WHERE LAY
BLEAK SCOPE OF PRAY
BLESS BLEED OUR TIME
WRETCHED BEAR THE CRIME

SECRETS OF WORDS PASSING BY DAYS
NEW EMOTINOS CAST IN SOULâS FACE
WE WASTE THE JOY AND SENSE OF LIFE
ITâS PUNISHING IN HEART THE PROUD
DEATHâS KNIFE

STRIVE IN YOUR PLEAS
WHEN BOW ON KNES
DEADLY SORROW TORN
JOY AGAIN BORN
