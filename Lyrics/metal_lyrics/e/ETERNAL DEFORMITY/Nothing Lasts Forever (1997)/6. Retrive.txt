TEMTATIONS PUSH IN MY 
HEART LIKE DEATHâS KNIFE
MY LONLEY STRUGGLE
AND THE TIME PASSING BY

THE THINGS IVâE DONE
OR JUST THE YEARS IVâE WASTE
DONTâT COMING BACK
CAUSE BITTER IS LIFEâS TASTE

I THINK ABOUT MY END
WILL YOU BECAME MY FRIEND
THAN SUICIDE BY WRONG
CAUSE WHO WILL WRITE THIS SONG FOR YOU

TRAPPES ON MY WAY
AND MISTAKES THATâS MY LIFE
BUT I FOUND THE CURE 
THATâS QUICKLY CHANGE MY LIFE

BUT ALL THE TIME BEGONE
WORTH SOME THINGS WEâVE DONE
THE FELIURES BRING ME DOWN
THEN THIS BECOMES YOU FROWN

WILL I RETRIVE
MY LOST BELIEF
WILL I RETRIVE
TIME THAT IâVE LEAVE
