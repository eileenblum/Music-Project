I FOUND THE PROUD
WHEREâS GATHER ROUND
AND I CANâT SEE
NO GOOD WITHIN DECLINE

WHORSHIP WHATâS BETRAYED
YOU CANâT BE SAVED
SLOW DECLINE REVEAL
YOU SHALLOW FAITH

ALL PEACE UNTRUE
WRONG PATH WALK THROUGH
RIGHT THOUGHTS TURN BLACK
PLEASE TRY GO BACK

WHEN ALL IS GONE
YOU LAY ALONE
WHATâS RIGHT OR WRONG
IN LIFE DONE

LIFE THORNS IN WOUND
THAT BLEED SO LUOD
BLOOD SPILS THROUGH HANDS
LIKE LIFE BEFORE

BORROW FRACTION THATâS GOOD
WE MUST UNDERSTOOD
THORNY WAY LIFES THORN
NEW TIMES MUST BORN
