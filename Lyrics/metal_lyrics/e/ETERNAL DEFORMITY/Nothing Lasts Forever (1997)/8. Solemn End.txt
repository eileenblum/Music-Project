THEREâS NOTHING LEFT
HERE FOR ME JUST DEATH
MY LIFE HAS BEEN RAPED
BY SORROW

SOUL HEART AND MIND
IN DARKNESS
CANâT YOU SEE THAT THIS IS
MY WITNESS SORROW

SOLEMN END....

BANISHING IN INTERNESS OF FEAR

PARADISE CLOSE AT HAND
I FEEL LIKE BUILT WITH SAND
ALL WE BLIND LOOK FOR SENSE
CHARITY IN EMPTY GRAVES

NOW DEATH TRY
BLESSING THE LIFE
BUT FOR WHAT MINE
LOOK THERES IS NOBODY NOW
WHOâS WONT TO HELP ME
