PATIENCE REFILL THE VIEW
REPENTANCE GHATER NEW
THE HORROR LEADS AND TAKEN OVER

DISGUST AND SORROW TRUE
BECOME MY LIFE UNTRUE
THE HORROR LEADS AND TAKEN OVER

WONY TO BACK ALL THE GOOD TIMES
ONCE AGAIN CREATE LIFEâS RYMES
THEASE YEARS WAS SICK LIKE LIESâS ART
TAKE MY PROMICE CLOSE TO HEART

WHY MY PAIN WILL GROW IN SHADOW
PRAY TO FALIURE NOW IN SILENCE
WHY MY PAIN WILL GROW WHEN YOUâR GONE
I TRY TO BE BACK WHERE OTHERâS...

DROWN OUT SHADOWS
I STAND TO FACE THE DAY
MY DREAMS BECAME NIGHTMARES
IâVE FALLEN PRAY TO FALIURE

MY IMAGINATION OF TIME
ALMOST THERE TRYING TO LEAD ME
MAY MY WORDS BE ENGRAVED
IN THE PLEACE WHERE OUR LOST SOULâS CAN BE
