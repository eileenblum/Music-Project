WHEN WRONG PATH YOU TAKE
FALL IN SAD THROUGHTS LAK
ALL EXPERIENCES ARE TRAP

BREAKE THE SEAL OF CURSE
SEE NOWFATE ALLURES
FOOLS ALIVE YOU JUST CANâT TRUST

WHOâLL STAY TO DREAMING
WHEN MILD THROUGHTS LOST
NOW WE MUST SCREAMING
AND KILL THATâS WORST

WE TRUST IN LAST EMBRACE

SO STRONG BUT FRIGHTENING
BEHIND BARRAGE
CARRES LIGHT HIDING
SHOW THE COURAGE

ARISING FEAR BEFORE THE CHANGE
TASTE THE LOST WITHIN REVENGE
WHOSE LOST THE LIFE NOT MUST BE WEAK
WITHIN HIS HEART FEELINGS ARE SICK

GRACEFULL THROUGHTS AND SMILLE
CAN APPER WHATâS VILE
YOUR LAST EMBRACE WAS FORGET

MIND BLESSED IN DIVERSE
CAN WRONG THINGS REVERSED
YOUR MEMORIES TURN TO GRAY
