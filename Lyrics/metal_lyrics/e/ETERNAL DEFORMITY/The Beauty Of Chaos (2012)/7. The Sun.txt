I see the sun
It slowly comes
It cries for the dark
It calls for the storm
Doesn't wanna live
Doesn't wanna shine...

For how long will you be our torturer and judge?
What is so pleasant in killing life?
Because of you man came up with such nonsense
There would be no religion if you weren't there

Rising
Shining
Giving light
Scorching
Breaking
Hope
Demise
Another day in paradise
