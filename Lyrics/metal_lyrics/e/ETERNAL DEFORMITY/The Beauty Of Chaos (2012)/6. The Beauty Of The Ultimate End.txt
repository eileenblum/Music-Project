Flood everywhere, corpses are rotting
Sins of the world are now forgotten silence
Look at me now, ease my pain with violence
Take what you want, I don't need it
As I'm free in my space
Untouched woods of my freedom between his words
Hidden prophecy between his words
Dark conspiracy

Death everywhere
End of all fears
Just look around
There's no turning back
Minds of all man so corrupted
Unholy guns set to finished them all
Only clouds and no heavens above
Why do you look for the answer up there
Crucified is your tangled soul
No more words just an ironic laugh

Rage
Vile fate
Wretched
Debased
