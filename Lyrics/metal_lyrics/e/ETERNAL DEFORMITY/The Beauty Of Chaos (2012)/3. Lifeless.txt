It's just another fairytale
It's just a feeling of despair
It's growing lifeless gaze

Don't you remember what you said?
Seductive voice... so overwhelmed
It's growing inside of me
Out of faith, out of love, out of life, out of God

Do you remember what you said?
Seductive voice was so intense
It's growing inside me

It's just a feeling of despair
It's just another fairytale
It's growing lifeless
Breath out of faith, out of love, out of life
Without God
