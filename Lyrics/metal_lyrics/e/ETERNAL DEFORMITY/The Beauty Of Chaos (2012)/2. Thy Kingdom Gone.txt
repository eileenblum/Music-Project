Cold emptiness
Dark weeping ruthless void
Will you get enough to go on
Made of your own fears and painful thoguhts
Wild and odd it seems to become

So here I come with torch
To light up your mind
Just say no more
Be prepared you hopeless whore
And now you can't resist me
Get down and praise my name
And now you can not reject me
For this I spread my poison in you

My poison in you
Thy kingdom gone
Thy kingdom gone
