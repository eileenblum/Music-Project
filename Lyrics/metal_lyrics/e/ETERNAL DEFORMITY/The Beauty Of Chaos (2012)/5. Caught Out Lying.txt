Dark distant land
Far away from here
We'll never see these shores
Staggering graves full of wisdom
Holes filled with hope

Caught out lying, caught out lying
Would you saw what it was?
Soil stones and names
Caught out lying, caught out lying

Why should we be so close?
No matter when

Vowel maker's sleeve long tongue
Licks face in the mist
Why it emerges this way?
And your shining endures it's pain
Thy crescendo blinds my ears
Graves full of wisdom
Holes filled with hope
Dark distant land far away from here
We'll never see these shores staggering
