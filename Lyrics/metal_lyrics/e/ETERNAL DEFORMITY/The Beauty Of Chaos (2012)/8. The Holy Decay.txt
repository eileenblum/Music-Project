I know there's nothing in the end
No better life, no second chance
I know my time will come
No gods above, no hells below
Liars, I looked through your rotten souls
Bastards, don't ever trust those dressed in skirts

I know there's nothing in the end
Just be yourself, don't let them play
I know my time will come
New pyres of truth will burn again
Liars, I looked through your poisonous souls
Bastards, don't ever trust those dressed in skirts
Although I knew I'd have to pay
I knew I had to go that way
Leaves falling, I see it again and again
Sea of love fading away
Slipped through the holy decay
Rise and fall in between
Unaware

Although I knew I'd have to pay
I knew I had to go that way
Never go down this way
Trust your own feelings
