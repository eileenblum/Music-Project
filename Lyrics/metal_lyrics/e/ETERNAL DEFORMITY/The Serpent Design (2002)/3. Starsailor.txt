NOW IT'S TIME FOR STARSAILOR

SAILING IN TO THE END
OR IN TO THE NIGHT
SAILING IN TO THE END

MY SILENT FEAR
PHILOSOPHY
GREAT POWER OF LIFE
SEEMS QUIET NOW

SPEAK, BELOVED
UNKNOW FROM SPACE
YOUR STAR SHINES BRILLIANTLY
IT'S THE CENTER OF THE UNIWERSE

SPEAK, BELOVED
GIVE ME A SIGN, BE MY TALISMAN
IN THE CENTER OF THE UNIWERSE

SPEAK, BELOVED
UNKNOW FROM SPACE

IN THE CENTER OF THE UNIWERSE

I AM STARSAILOR
