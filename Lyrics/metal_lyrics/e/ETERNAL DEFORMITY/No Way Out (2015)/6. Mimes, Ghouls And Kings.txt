Of all the nightly ghouls
You were their favourite one
When playing with the needle
You sew up the dreams
In the blue pillows
On your own sky
Moist and wicked
In the black moments fire
Primally craving
At the fountain of suffering nymphs

He lived in delusion
Smelting its silver lining
Entering night at times
To rob the stars of their power
Moist and wicked
In the black moments fire
Primally craving

At the fountain of suffering nymphs

âAnd so he dwells through the agesâ

Deniying the existence
Glorifying destruction
He built and ruined
Killing in silence
Another thousand years
The next will go unsung
Two thousand years that world wonât last

âButâ

All hope lays in those
Who go against the flow
In the fire of their days
They go away, above?
Between the nightly ghouls
They laugh, because so says
The blameworthy mime
