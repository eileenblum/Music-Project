Fear no death or life
Nor everlasting fails
No cold or flames
Take whatâs yours and donât decline
The things you think you think you donât deserve
Why would you give your precious gift away
To those youâve never met
Breaking though walls
Seeing truth
Will set you free
One day youâll breathe
