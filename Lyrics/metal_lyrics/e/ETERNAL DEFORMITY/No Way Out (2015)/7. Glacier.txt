Cold self
Frozen within
Awaiting the storm
I stand on the top of the glacier
Forgotten myself I have
Liming in limbo I am
Becoming a mad man

- Nice to meet you
- Nice to be met
- Let me show you the vastness of your kingdom
- My kingdom is not of this world
- But you have created this one
So rule as a king
Or die as a maggot

Awaiting my death
Iâm going insane
I stand on the top of the glacier
Waiting for whatâs next to come
Is it the cold that makes me feel so anxious
To wake from this vivid dream
I need to get down by melting the ice
By melting the ice
