We donât praise him
We just follow his footsteps
We want to become our own gods
Our path is the path of a loner

There is that god
Who sits in a high tower
And overlooks everything
Who guides and cares
From day one

He still lays low
But the time of awakening is near
We can already hear thunder
The sign of a storm
He still wonât show

But the time of awakening is near

There are secret tunnels
That will take you deeper underground

There are many chambers
Where we organise our meetings
There are secret places
If you know where to look for them
