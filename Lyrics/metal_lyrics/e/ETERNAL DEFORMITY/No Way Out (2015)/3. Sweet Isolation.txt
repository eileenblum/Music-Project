Great creator of my false dreams
Hanging them between two poles
Tastelessness of the magic fruit
Count me in for a big surprise

Days are numbered and all we have
Is just a fear of that light
Why donât you just let me be
Donât want your signs

Great creator of my false dreams
Placing logs for more to come
Bitterness of the sweet delusion
Getting there with no remorse

Long uneven roads
Serpentine steep paths

Ingrowing nails
Dowagerâs Hump

Great creator of my false dreams
Come and get me while you can
Facing death brings me closer
To those shapes I hate
