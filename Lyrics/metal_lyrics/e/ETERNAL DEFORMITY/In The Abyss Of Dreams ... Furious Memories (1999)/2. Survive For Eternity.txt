If i fly for you
If i fly only for you
I'm never gonna fall
If i fall for you
If a fall only for you
I'm never gonna die
When i live for you my dear
I'm never gonna die, cry

In my fantasies
I feel fear
From the gaze of your eyes
You stole my moon
The night is blind
like the rest of us

The greyness envelops me
Darkness breeds darkness
The knife twirls like the snake
The silence serves him
During his spare time
He twirls the robe for us

I will never cry
I will never die
I will never go
I will never fall
