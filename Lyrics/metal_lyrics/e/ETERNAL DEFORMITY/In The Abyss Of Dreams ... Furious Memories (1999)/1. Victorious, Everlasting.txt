Gods what do you see ?
A little king from nowhere
He must serve
Like a slave

See your soul is burning water
Look your eyes are drowning fire

Now the wounds are gone
I don't believe you
I'm immortal now
Like a son of the earth

Gods are you crying ?
Did you lose your kingdom ?
You are lethal now
Like a men

The sword of life in my hand
Will kill every traitor

The power of my mother earth
Stayed with me forever

Gods what do you see ?
The great master in pure light
Your fucking night
Is a day from now
