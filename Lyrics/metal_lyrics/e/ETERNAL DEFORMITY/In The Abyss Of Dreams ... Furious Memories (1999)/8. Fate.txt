Sin is my holy love
When i walk through space
Through the walls of time
With my thoughts
In to the abyss of this love
Your sinful heart is the sun
And the moon

Fate is my name
And you know why it's so grey
Fate is our god
And your last minuote of sadness

Time which heals the scars
Will one day see
That our path shall meet
Time which destroys all
