Day is light, night is shadow, you want
To die 'cause the sorrow wonât stop,
And the agony of this moment, you can feel it
Last forever, youâre alone...
With your soul.

You see, everything is dark and wet
Like an old house, house without a keeper.

With the dust under your arms,
Waiting for the winds to ruin you
Youâre alone... with your soul.

You see, everything is dark and wet,
Like an old house, house without a keeper.

(Garden of souls, fear to live... like a house
Without a keeper, always life hurts.

You want to die, to lie down, getting out
From the back door, but when blood leaves
Your cut veins, suffering will no end.

The one who caused so much pain, doesnât
Have you in his mind, youâre alone...
In the garden of souls.
