Minds in white willing to fly,
I'm feeling death, whispers of fear.
I am out of myself, I donât know if Iâd die
But Iâll still be here.

Feelings of death, whispers of fear,
My crying wont stop, your world
Is unreal, and I cannot be there

Come back soon to my side (come back soon to my side),
Iâm with you my Gothic princess.

Come back soon to my side (com back soon to my side),
Stay with me my beauty princess.

Look my lord the magic of this place,
When I come back I feel like crying.
But now I am glad 'cause Iâm in your arms,
When I wake up.

I'm in the edge between death and life,
My wishes are all on you, come back soon
To my side, or maybe I wonât be here.

My Gothic princess, my beauty princess.

Come back soon to my side (come back soon to my side),
Iâm with you my Gothic princess.

Come back soon to my side (com back soon to my side),
Stay with me my beauty princess.

My Gothic princess, my beauty princess.
