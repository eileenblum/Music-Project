Waste your time with me, you laugh
At my face; I know my lifeâs nothing
For you, no one but me will win.

Iâll rise, youâll go down, selfish
Pride of yours, it means nothing
To me, maybe you think youâve won.

You keep me alive, afraid of myself,
Your anger turns to hate, melodic sadness
Show my memories.

Broken promises, words lost in time
Smiles buried by lies. Unfaithful desire,
Widow and bride, lies rule your life.

Iâll rise, youâll go down, selfish
Pride of yours, it means nothing
To me, maybe you think youâve won.
