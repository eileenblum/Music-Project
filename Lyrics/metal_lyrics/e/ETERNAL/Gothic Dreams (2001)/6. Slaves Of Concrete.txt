A gray giant rises among green prairies
That in a time will disappear
Before its magnificence.

Its foundations are built out of
Human unconsciousness.

Now the trine of the birds is hidden
With the noise of machines and the fog
Is mixed with the smog of factories.

Suffocated by the progress, we defy a
Natural law and she cries for her wounds,
Itâs a concrete jungle.
