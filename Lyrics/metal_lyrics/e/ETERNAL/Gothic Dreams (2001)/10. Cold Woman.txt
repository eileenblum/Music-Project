Teach me your way of loving
Incomprehensible and discreet,
Your kisses are a snowy mountain
That melts in my interior.

I don't understand your claims â my passion is lost in your unmoving body
- donât insult my humanity â my male logic needs an explanation â my
Weakness ties down the freedom to shake the wings of my sex.

Donât think about the rest, you just have a rule, your own freedom.

Tell me your fear cold woman
I fear society.

Cold woman strip yourself before me
And express your most hidden feelings,
Don't keep your passion to yourself for
Foolish restrictions.

Donât think about the rest, you just have a rule, your own freedom.

Tell me your fear cold woman
I fear society.
