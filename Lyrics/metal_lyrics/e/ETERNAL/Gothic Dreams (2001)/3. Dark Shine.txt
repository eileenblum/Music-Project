I see the uncertain future, in the palm
Of your hand, believe in what I say
My word wonât pass away.

Like a heaven without a hell,
Your days will be few, running
The final path, so long, no more sounds...

It's a nightmare with no end, you wonât see
The shine of day, only cold dark souls
Will tell you which road to take.

No more tomorrows, it wonât be the same,
And endless pain is waiting for you,
With no time to change.

Like a heaven without a hell,
Your days will be few, running
The final path, so long, no more sounds...

It's a nightmare with no end, you wonât see
The shine of day, only cold dark souls
Will tell you which road to take.
