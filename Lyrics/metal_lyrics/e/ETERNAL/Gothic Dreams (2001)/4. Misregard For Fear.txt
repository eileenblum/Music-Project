There is no place for love here, hatred
Is taken reason, killing is nonsense...

"The paradise of god is now a hell
Of ambition and selfishnessâ.

...But there is somebody who created it;
Genocides take place everyday before
The regardless look of people.

The paradise of god is now a hell
Of ambition, itâs and illness that science hasnât
Diagnosed is the misregard for fear.

Everyone accuses and points down,
Nobody cares, the world suffers
An illness...

"The paradise of god is now a hell
Of ambition and selfishness".

The paradise of god is now a hell
Of ambition, itâs and illness that science hasnât
Diagnosed is the misregard for fear.
