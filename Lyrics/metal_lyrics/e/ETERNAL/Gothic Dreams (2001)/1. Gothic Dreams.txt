Only in my dreams I know you,
I wake up, I canât remember you.

Are you in my thoughts or wait for me?...
In your agonic existence.

Enchanted nights, by the fantasy of my dreams,
Roads of dust show me the path of a destiny.

Gothic dreams, silent dreams, full of passion and beauty;
Unexplained desire before a face
That weaken my man strength.

I find your wonderful beauty behind
A tender veil, and your naked body
Turns sensible to me.

Naked between white sheets, you are
Pure reflecting sadness; just wait for the day
That Iâll never wake up, I don't wanna wake up
Of this dream.

Only in my dreams I know you
I wake up, I canât remember you.
Are you in my thoughts or wait for me?...
In your agonic existence.
