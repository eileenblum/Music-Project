Last day of your life, it goes
In a second; shadows of your past
Increase your agony.

Emptiness of life, eternal pain that
Shows all truth;
Itâs too late for you, to reach the
Happiness youâre looking for.
Last day of life!

Hear the sounds of your life,
Touch its soft skin; see the sun at the west,
You wonât see it again.

Last breath of life, you try to keep it
But itâs taken from you; watch the colors of your life,
Is the final second.
Last day of life!

Last day of your life, it goes
In a second; shadows of your past
Increase your agony.

Emptiness of life, eternal pain that
Shows all truth;
Itâs too late for you, to reach the
Happiness youâre looking for.
Last day of life!
