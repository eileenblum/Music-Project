Wake up to the new day of a gray
And frightening sky, no sun to shelter you
From the freezing winds.

You will be the breed of the beasts
That will inhabit what is left of earth.

Sunk in the darkness of oblivion,
No matter who you were, anyone that
Knows you, will point at you with his sight!!!

You fight against the vultures
For food, now you get no privileges,
You are trapped and suffocated
By the freezing winds.

The earth now is very fertile,
Now you can sow it, the sky has bathed it
In its acid rain.

Sunk in the darkness of oblivion,
No matter who you were, anyone that
Knows you, will point at you with his sight!!!

You fight against the vultures
For food, now you get no privileges,
You are trapped and suffocated
By the freezing winds.

Wake up to the new day of a gray
And frightening sky, no sun to shelter you
From the freezing winds.
