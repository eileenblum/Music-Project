Set your life on fire
And leave without a trace
Whore of the angels won't save you now

The silence so intense
Blood thicken in rusted veins
No word of hope to keep you safe

Fuck you!

[Chorus:]
Look what has happened to us
We drown in despair
Time won't heal those wounds
Shattered and hollow we are
Follow the dead
Faster in suicide race

Lethal dose of hate
Shoot down the useless clowns
And feed the demon in my heart

Not scared to burn
Smell cold blade - violent game
Stabbing the victimized right now

That's right!

[Chorus]

Sick will to suck you dry
And rape the dawn of perfect day
Straight down to hell is where we go

Self-made bullet hole
This is the final of the ends
Slaughter the innocence inside
