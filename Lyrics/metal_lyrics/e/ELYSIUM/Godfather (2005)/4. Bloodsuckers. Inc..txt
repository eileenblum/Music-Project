Kill the lights!
Just terminate it!
Take a look
Nothing worth to hold there

Ironic
Alone and selfish
Once glamour
Enough is enough

Seconds explode
Bring down your world
Keep on rework
Wrong side of this life

Dumbfounded
No use to pretend
Crestfallen
Too late to get respect

Close to the stamping ground
Feels like there's bomb in your head
Yeah!

Lose forces
Mute and slow the feelings
So fragile
Stuck in private downfall

No time left
Sick disconnection
Hurt deeper
And get what you deserve

[Pre-chorus:]
Need to destroy
Last chance that you were given
Never again
Yeah I've said never again
Will you find the peace in yourself

[Chorus:]
Close to the hysteria
