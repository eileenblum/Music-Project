Suburban devils
The darkening skies
Damaged sanity disciples
The gathering of raging tribes
Believe in nothing
Drained youth brigade

The cruel deal is done

Street hate inferno
We are the cancer - all sins and vermin
This modern death
Create infection - twisted design
Men without eyes
Speak with the dead
Despise the norms - fuel fire for war
We are the blind leading the numb

[Chorus:]
Brand new sickness intoxicates
The poison convulse
Bury your hope and holy cross
We take you back to hell

System has failed
Black dawn disaster - blind race offering
The burning times
Blood superstition - rotten rituals
New killing season
Machine flesh crushing
Chaos extreme - shotgun messiah
This is the haunting - your favourite nightmare
