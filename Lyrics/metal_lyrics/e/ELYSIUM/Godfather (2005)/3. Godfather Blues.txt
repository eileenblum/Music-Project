I'll make you an offer
You're not gonna refuse
Stay loyal to true friends
And protect your family
Respect those fellow men
Don't ever let them down
We're building an empire
Upon this bloodbath mess

Wipe them out
Those well related bastards
Blackmail the opposite
Deny the evidence
Partners in crime supreme
Pride and honour inside

[Chorus:]
Feed the greed
Rattlesnake blues
We've come to reign
Country ain't your blood
Take care of your friends
Season of the dead
All men in black
Godfather

Got stone in my shoes
Trouble in neighbourhood
I'd burn in hell to keep you safe
No compromise - knife in his back
Squeeze the trigger
Like a fucking dogs to me

Keep your friends close
But your enemies closer
See nothing, hear nothing
While keep your eyes wide open
Killing is only a business
Has really no special meaning
And never ever forget
Even the strongest needs friends
