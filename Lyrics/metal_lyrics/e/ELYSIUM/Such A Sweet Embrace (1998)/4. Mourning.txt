Wander the path of the night
Silence comes so sweet to me
clearness beauty of infinity
Majestic landscapes of metal misery
Passionless without meaning
so raven dark, but I find release
from my inner pain
You are the reason of sadness
My forlorn love
The mouring of my soul, nature of
my life
So I fall into oblivion, a good
occasion to die
In the mourning, I see no reason to live
You are my liberty the key to other spheres
the gleam from a falling star
as you died my heart is broken
Wander the path of the night
silence comes sweet to me
clearness beauty of infinity
Majestic landscapes of metal misery
so raven dark passionless
without you there?s no meaning
in my life, so I fall into oblivion
