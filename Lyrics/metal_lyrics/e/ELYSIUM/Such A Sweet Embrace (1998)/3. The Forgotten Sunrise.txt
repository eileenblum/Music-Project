It seems to be a new day
but something is missing
The light of the day
Brightness of the sun
Just a solar eclipse?
An error of mother earth?
No! It?s a hint of our fate
But nobody knows what it means
.....Maybe.....
Good betrayed upon the evil
light turns to black
Darkness overflows our world
and ghostly silence spreads among us
.....But......
What?s the motive?
Where?s the meaning?
The forgotten sunrise
A black day in our thoughts
forgotten, lost in infinity
Please! Never let it happen
Fear and despair occupies me
When I think of this moment
which will surely come...
Sometimes, in the soonest future
The darkest moment in the story
of mankind
It?s the forgotten sunrise
The loosing of the warmth in our life
Darkness and silence rules
