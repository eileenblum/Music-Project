full speed ahead
towards synchronized sunrise
focused in weak eye
deconstruct our memoirs
neurotic human form

negative system report
feel sorry for losers
neither shrink nor struggle
insipid &amp; helpless

no emergency exit
exhausted coexistence

steal the last breath
scratch those shadow mirrors
there's no turning back
as we're ready for new dawn

upcomin breakin' news
sadistic web tentacles

28 already old
stuck in great spirall fall

chaotic killin' spree
none of us will take it's toll

under the surface - the beast well hides
self respect is all we've gained

new world is ours to come
just believe in a splendid failure
digital future anthem
