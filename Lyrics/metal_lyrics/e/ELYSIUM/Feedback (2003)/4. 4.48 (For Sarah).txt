hey little girl
hope you guess my name
let me now
eliminate myself
serial victim - a black sheep
jaded &amp; chronic castaway

well she is all alone
absent, alien, frozen heart
still believes in nothing
in her solid garbage bunker

from the hour zero - damned
polluted neverland
yesterday frames - torn apart
I'll paint the sky in dissonance

no good ever comes of this
as I fuck up old fairytales
intravenous bitter pills
suck the light out from my eyes

stripped of all but troubles
download damaged passion
razorblade - highway to hell
suicidal hollow showdown

hooks in my dried skin
acrid, dready, dull &amp; tied
hide'n'seek - playin' dead now
scavenge silver dazzle

don't need another devil's advocate
encouraged doctors
hope to leave before the dawn
I'd never bite this hand
