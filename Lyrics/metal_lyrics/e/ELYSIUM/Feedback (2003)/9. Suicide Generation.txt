defeated serpents' nation
uder a whip we crawl
strained nerves &amp; superb breakdown
hysterics' uncontrolled

high-graded sweet relief
enter such a peaceful room
eliminated rescue choice
sucked dry - a victim drugged

interactive decadence
insomnia overdose
instincts we follow numb
checkpoint at midlife crisis
grayscale - stain our thoughts
we're dancin' on empty floor
takin' this nowhere ride
indifferent &amp; off-line

join the suicide commando
in constant &amp; slowly chokin'
as good as it gets
proud to be dead man walking

back-seat predators
stiff - freezin' out of love
glimpse sour disconnection
we're the maniacs syndicate

report our departure
revelations soon collapse
deeper shades of grace descending
face the monotonous loss

no wonders at all
driven by the plain impulse
the message so straight
invite you to my breakdown

Line-up:
Maciek Miskiewicz - vocals
Michal Maryniak - guitar
Michal Wlosik - guitar
Roman Felczynski - bass
Maciej Oryl - drums
