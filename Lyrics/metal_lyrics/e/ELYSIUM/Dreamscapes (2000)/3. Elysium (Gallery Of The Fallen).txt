Why the sky red?
Crust of the Earth dead
Flower of life gone
Why do I burn?
Destroy thee
Dust of many fields gone.
Weep no tears at my fallen grace
Temptation of the netherworld
Into the darkness at any given hand.

See the seas of the sword
Black nights
I have on me the blood of death.
Through the gallery of the fallen
Fall of life
Old man's hand over bleak hills
Emerging destiny
Wondering time.

Life does not wait for you
Dead and gone
Nothing to show of your fallen existence
Kingdom gone.
