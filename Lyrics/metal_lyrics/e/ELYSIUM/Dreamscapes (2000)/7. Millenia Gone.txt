A dragon plummets from without the moon
And in the very same instant another star winks out
The soul of the great beast has expired
It savagely beats its falling wings
And speaks coarsely in its hollow, rasping tongue
Of a time, long since passed, when it was young
Gravity latches onto the dragon and drags her cruelly earthward
She can no longer defeat the elements and stay aloft
Screaming, tearing at her breast she plummets headlong
Into a dark chasm somewhere in the south, deep inside a forest
And the nightingale whistles in its shrill, beauteous tongue
Of millennia gone when the great reptilian was young.
