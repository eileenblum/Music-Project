Breath of dawn listening astray
With leaves of singing harps
Their tuns of exhausted dominance
The cry of withering dust
A love affair among the awakening

Overwhelming disturbance fantastic terrors invite
From the one who hides his name
Among the formless allay the flower ashen
Imparting immortality desecrated in horns
Demonstratable throne of the evergreen anthem

Those who dwell there seem dauntless
Great antiquity of grievance recognised
Across the valley flowering by the bay
Austere dormant in grief
Barbaric old hands within the grave

I still lay cold at night lost and betrayed
Longing for the majestic and elegant view
The innocence lying south the crystalline cathedral
Graven Bay
All ones curing madness

On shields of golden knives I sleep
Wondering still searching for my own destruction
I see no other way the night still embracing me
Leaves of forbidden call
On thorns I lay
To the dark I scream; I am
Under the autumn twilight.
