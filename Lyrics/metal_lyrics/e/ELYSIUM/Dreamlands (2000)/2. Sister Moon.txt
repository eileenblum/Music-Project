in the middle of the night I am still alone
in silent journeys to hidden stars
I steal their light
and fly into an open sky
where I shall find
all that is mine

you take me there
where pain slowly leaves my body
caress my hand
the dawn will never come
a lonely wolf I am
with your light I awake
you are my sister moon
shinning so bright

in the middle of the night
I am still alive
in silent journeys to hidden worlds
I steal your light
and sail across the starlit heavens
where I shall find
all that is mine

you take me there
where pain slowly leaves my body
caress my hand
the dawn will never come
a lonely wolf I am
with your light I awake
you are my sister moon
shinning on me

you are the sweetest promise
of an october night
carrying me to the places
nobody ever dared to kiss
as I'm falling breathless into your ocean
in velvet rain I touch eternity
