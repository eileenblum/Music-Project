fire...
the cursed and the blessed
chaotic lightning's yield
burn!
shadows' father
enigma of gods

wind...
the ire from above
forgotten realms reveille
thunders!
bravehearted symphony
the elements to come
break curtains of clouds
awaiting the call
we are dancing under the moon
descendants of storm
renewal harbingers
centuries fall
as we invoke the powers of earth

rain...
the gift from the skies
sorrowful mourners' tears
sad lullaby
for those who have left behind

gaia...
the mother of men
in restless and tired sleep
she dreams
her children arise

united we stand
in brotherhood of our blood
starguardians' fate
for battles to come we're sworn
forthcoming doom
hurricane follow us as we invoke the powers of ear
