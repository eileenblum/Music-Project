welcome and touch the arcana of forbidden arts
a secret alchemy of erotic fantasies
godless mysteries of whispering statues
bittersweet dominions of their cryptic tongues

breathe
this sensual catharsis
under rosy arches of thine wildest desires
thirteen candles dimmed by morning spell
as we approach the nightshore's haven

and if you try
you will stay forever
ruined dreams' cathedral falls
angelic voices' sad elegy
heralds of infinity

I love you
and always will
stripping you of all your pride
im my serpent's arms embrace
you're shinning like a star
