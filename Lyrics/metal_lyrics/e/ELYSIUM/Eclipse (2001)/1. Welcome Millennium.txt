D.N.A. coded aggression
in millenium fever supermarkets
at lowest price sold out
via internet corrosive structures

are we ready to disarm
demons hiding in our minds
neverthless those burning bridges
set the clock on golden age

our tongues bleed black
disconnected scientic centres
crisis, chaos &amp; panic
our electrohearts refuse to beat

no turning back to zero point
2000 years a number too high
on rust covered liquid screen
soon we'll observe the final eclipse

megatowers stained skyscrapers
sunburnt shining forms
in bytes we speak
a lesson is learned

is everything prepared
for the dead earth blast
fasten your seat belts now
we're heading for the end
