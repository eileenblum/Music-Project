from the cold rage of fanatic minds
from the ashes of burning dogmas
on eighth day we've created hate
venomous reptiles - in terror we trust

clandestine dynasties in silence await
hidden structures, engines of control
conspiracy governments
subversive tactics, deconstruct the truth

enemise of the west
desert legions arrive
apocalypse comes silently
dogs of god lead march to war

nevermore to serve despot
dethrone the old crowned man
foul stench of burning heavens
exiled archangels
at the golden gates of eden
ex oriente lux
new age harvest - cruel work
invisible inquisition triumph

blind disciples shall be rewarded
starving hordes of nomads ride
religious cleansing holocaust
onwards first crusade against the god
