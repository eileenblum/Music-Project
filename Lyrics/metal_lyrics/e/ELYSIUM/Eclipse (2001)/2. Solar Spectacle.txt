calm lovers' crash
both swallowing pain
wound &amp; scar industries
intense indifference

I'm a jester puppet
squalid crumbcollector
hard hours' theorist
stiff pattern reactor

and I struggle for the air
in my lunatic asylum
small breathless space
shy irony king
that's what I am
you crawl in loss for words
drownin' in despair
innocence's torn
with pills, drugs &amp; guns

you feel like live on
with storms by your side
at neon flames horizon
there's nowhere to hide

now!
look what you've done
tell me what went wrong

deep under my skin you creep
poison slowly flows
staring at those hollow halls
sliperry shifts,digged out distrust
never wanted this way to end
never thought this heart's so cold

seems everythins we had is gone
all love is dead
we fall

symphaty's lost
display no regrets
hear no honest truths
anger overflow

fragile sunny moments
unfairly erased
half - speed discouragement
toxic shock syndrome

you feel like live on
with none by your side
down on my knees I/ve realised
you're fuckin' waste of time

the winners of a losers' cup
more still come to after the break
