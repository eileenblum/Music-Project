we came here alone
and alone we'll leave
until then I'll light
another ever - burning fire

THY WILL IS DONE

sitting here in this empty room
with rainy thoughts
and dusk in my eyes
(only silence of dead flowers)
I'm all alone... I'm fallen

in solitude I'm fallen
where are you now?
why like a blind man
I do search my way
further into the dark
