Welcome to the real life
Nobody told you it'd be fair
Still heading fast and backwards
Down the nihilist boulevard

The decadence entertainment
And dirty habits soundtrack
Not even close to breakpoint
Dog days are here to date

[Chorus:]
Add my name to your blacklist
I am harbinger of end
Swallow the bullet - right now!
With dust in your teeth

Friday the 13th again
Constant flashback episode
No safe warm hiding place
Mistaken anti- attitude

Hedon outrun eruption
Hard core passion replica
Divided and imperfect
Another real time failure

The demolition pack
Negative emotions strike
Skeletons in a closet
And low-class genocide

The dead end desperation
And infomercial disquiet
It's getting' stronger every hour
'till death will do us part
