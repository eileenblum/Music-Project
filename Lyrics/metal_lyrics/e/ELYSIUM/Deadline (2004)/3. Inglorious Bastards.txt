People like you deserve no sympathy
Gently takin' off while it's pretty nervous
Removin' responsibility from your shoulder
Selling good intentions to the discouraged
Support the indifference with grace
Stubborn and cynic - an instant form
Down, ugly and semi-automatic
Still tryin' to tell me who I want to be

And what if someone asked for a little help
Suddenly confused in your concrete cage

Any given excuse would be good enough
To lose all but interest in me

[Chorus:]
You live in a shallow world
Stealing from the ones that care
Hopin' for a bright new day
You're not so innocent

Repeat worst case scenario
As another issue fails
This talk brings no relief
Everybody knows - we are no angels inside
Hey Mr. goodwill - dismiss the faithful
Still close to nowhere - reset reality

It seems these days are gettin' harder and shorter
How come it's possible - it's not easy to breathe

Senseless chaotic efforts - a drowning man catches at straw
The hole you're stuck in - is just where you belong

Play it again and again
How far could this go?
Would you tell me so
Completely out of hand
I'm forced to be someone else
