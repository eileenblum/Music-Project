Tired of being alive
One with shame tonight
Between mistrust and sadness
Simply can't tolerate this
Affected and impressed
Now tell me what is wrong
Provide the possibilities
But still I won't believe

Let me tell you of brand new trouble
Deconstruct logic foundations
Like a ghost in a sun
Tryin' to explain who I want to be

What if I leave undone
And what if hope was broken
All energy is gone

What if there's no choice
And what if time is not on our side
All love is drained

[Chorus:]
This is everchanging
Perfect fragile images crash
There' no comfort
In silent room of nothing

Think for a moment
Is there any magic between
What did those words mean
How could they hurt so deep

From a corner watching
There's a different scale
Standin' numb and naked
Failure challenger's choice
