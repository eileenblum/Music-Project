Such a beautiful swansong
A frantic grand pursuit
Care freelovers' trip
Natural overdrive

Prime time serial killers
In hit and run joyride
A shotgun masterplan
Loveless and bittersweet

[Chorus:]
Let our enemies bite the dust
On their trail of tears
Don't judge us with the eye of wrath
Fire walk with us!

Dreadful and profane beasts
Damn the corrupted
Ridden with soul disease
An infernal storm we bring

Pain is the right stuff
With finger on a trigger
Private demons' ecstasy
And black widow's choke

Death toll terror
Driven by degradation
Devoted to the thunder
Nothing can stop us now

With evil in our hearts
No happy endings here
Catchin' the missin' train
We're burning down in flames
