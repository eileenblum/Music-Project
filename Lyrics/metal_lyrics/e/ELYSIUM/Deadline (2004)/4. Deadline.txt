Into the aeons of darkness
We shall go
The air is too thick too breathe
And our earth collides

Ethnic cleansing closure
Downhearted and dull mankind
Follow no leaders
New global suicide

Exclude humanity
Evolution is reversed
Combat resurrection
For we are the victory

[Chorus:]
Devoted to false messiah
Disposable crusaders
Dove of peace lies torn apart
The end is close at hand

New age legion
Full metal holocaust
The treason disciples
Snake bullet cruise

Collapse faith structure
Monster phoenix unrising
Venomous fire curtains
As above so below
