Down there we stand
But we won't disintegrate
Once abstract and ugly mass
Regain what's pure

Scenery bleaks
With your shoulder to the wall
Hysteria escapade
We've come for you all!

Sharpen the scythe
Eager for mainstream fall
Let the killing now begin

Hostage hunter
Addicted to the blood
Bring justice for the infirm

Declare the war
Erase the corporate
Against the conformists

Industrial hell
Proud to be renegade
We are the TNT

[Chorus:]
Practice what you preach
And authorise the fall
Instead of bursting out
Press panic button now

The cruel charade
Inspire riot act
Civilisation crash

Fury context
Purgatory extreme
And power to the brave

Down where you stand
There's no turning back
Abridge final chapter
Unbalanced trial

Sores open wide
In your air-tight cabin
No peaceful dug-out
This is the end

Attack with hate
Wolves gather around you
Dedicated to the fight
Enslave severe
Obey power command
A cannon fodder's triumph
