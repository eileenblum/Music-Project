[1st Verse:]
Wait.
Won't you stay.
Don't leave me just lying here.
Fighting all the daemons inside.
All this time.
I've tried to leave my past behind.
All I need is someone to save my life.
Wont you try?

[Chorus:]
And I needed you more now than ever before.
I guess I can't make this on my own.
All I ever needed was someone to save my life.

[2nd Verse:]
Wait.
I'm not the same.
You said you've heard it all before.
Your not trying anymore to change.
All your ways.
I promise that it's over now.
All I need is someone to save my life.
Wont you try?

[Chorus:]
And I needed you more now than ever before.
I guess I can't make this on my own.
All I ever needed was someone to save my life.
And I needed you more now than ever before.
I guess I can't make this on my own.
All I ever needed was someone to save my life.

You won't waste your time on me.
Because I will be there in the end.
You won't waste your time on me again.

[Chorus:]
And I needed you more now than ever before.
I guess I can't make this on my own.
All I ever needed was someone to save my life.
And I needed you more now than ever before.
I guess I can't make this on my own.
All I ever needed was someone to save my life.
