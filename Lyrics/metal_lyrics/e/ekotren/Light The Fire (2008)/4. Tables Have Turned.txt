[1st Verse:]
There Is always some new complication.
In the end I'll take the blame.
Take a step back look at what we have become.
Things ain't pretty.
This is all we have left.

Its safe to say.
I've lost my way.
Gaze at the flame as its burning out.

[Chorus:]
So I'm back again.
And I'm falling in line.
I'm falling in line again.
Is this what you wanna be.
Tell me know what do you want from me.
What do you want from me.

[2nd Verse:]
And now your begging for forgiveness from me.
I've got nothing left to give.
You've taken everything away.

Its safe to say.
I've lost my way.
Gaze at the flame as its burning out.

[Chorus (X2):]
So I'm back again.
And I'm falling in line.
I'm falling in line again.
Is this what you wanna be.
Tell me know what do you want from me.
What do you want from me.
