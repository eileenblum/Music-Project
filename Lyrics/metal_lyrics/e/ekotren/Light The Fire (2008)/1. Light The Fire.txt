[1st Verse:]
No time for communication.
Your bullshit lies are a false invasion.
You can't compensate for the lives you take away.
There will be no more tragedy.
All the lives that you've claimed.
Walking away you will never be saved.

[Pre Chorus:]
Churches with marquees.
Politely fuck these insecure minds.
Of the weak ones we know.

[Chorus:]
Light the fire.
Light the fire.
I'm calling you out motherfucker you're a liar.
Light the fire.
Light the fire.
I'm calling you out.
Burn it down.
Burn it down.
Blow a kiss as the ashes hit the ground.
Light the fire.
Light the fire.
I'm calling you out.

Now close your eyes little girl.
Because there's no use now in this fucked up world.
You can't compensate for the lives you take away.
There will be no more tragedy.
All the lives that you've claimed.
Walking away you will never be saved.

[Pre Chorus:]
Churches with marquees.
Politely fuck these insecure minds.
Of the weak ones we know.

[Chorus:]
Light the fire.
Light the fire.
I'm calling you out motherfucker you're  a liar.
Light the fire.
Light the fire.
I'm calling you out.
Burn it down.
Burn it down.
Blow a kiss as the ashes hit the ground.
Light the fire.
Light the fire.
I'm calling you out.

I'll never try it your way.
