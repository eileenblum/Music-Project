[1st Verse:]
I give up.
I give in.
I'm so sick of trying there's nothing left to believe in.
You can fight your way through your so called life.
I'm here to tell you don't  waste your time.

[Pre Chorus:]
I won't.
I won't compromise.
I won't die.

[Chorus:]
I know your living in a lie.
Your faith is a paper thin disguise.
You feel that I'm suicidal, maybe your just right.

[2nd Verse:]
It makes me sick.
The way that you rob life from your children.
Turning them into a lifeless army.
Watch as they march.
Your so proud.
I'm here to say this ends now.

[Pre Chorus:]
I won't.
I won't compromise.
I won't live a lie.

[Chorus:]
I know your living in a lie.
Your faith is a paper thin disguise.
You feel that I'm suicidal, maybe your just right.
