[1st Verse:]
Keep your head down.
Or else he will find you.
Stay quiet don't you make a sound.
He is coming Behind You

Chupacabra!

I bet your a believer now.
You wish you never had your doubts.
I bet your a believer now.
Now there's no way out.

You'll never get away.
Hell hunt till he dies.
He knows no other way.
Determination in his eyes.
And he will stop at nothing.

[2nd Verse:]
Get up and run now.
Its too late he sees you.
There's only one thing left to do.
Fight for your life.

Chupacabra!

As he inches forward.
There's no one else to save you,  but yourself.

You must destroy the fucking head or remove the brain.
There's nothing left to do now.
Get down on your knees and pray.
(destroy the head or remove the brain)
