[1st Verse:]
Time to take out the maker,
Who drives this down inside.
Time to make a believer.
Its time to open eyes.
There will be no more hiding from this.
I've lost the will to fight.
I give in to this.

[Chorus:]
You see this pain inside.
Its on my face.
Its no surprise.
There's nothing left but time.
Though my light has burned out.

[2nd Verse:].
Did you really think that I would forget this.
Did you really think that I would get used to this.
Time to take out the maker.
Time to make a believer.
I'm sick of hiding behind all these walls that you build up inside.

[Chorus:]
You see this pain inside.
Its on my face.
Its no surprise.
There's nothing left but time.
Though my light has burned out.

My light has burned out.
And I would sell my soul away.
Because my light has burned out.
And I would sell my soul to bring it back again.

Back again.
There's no coming back.
There's no coming back.

[Chorus (x2):]
You see this pain inside.
Its on my face.
Its no surprise.
There's nothing left but time.
Though my light has burned out
