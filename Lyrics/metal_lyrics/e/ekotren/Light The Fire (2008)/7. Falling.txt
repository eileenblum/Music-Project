[1st Verse:]
Contemplate, should I stay.
Or just throw this away.
And leave everything hanging today.
As I find I'm the only one fighting as life passes by.

[Pre Chorus:]
Will you drag me to the edge again.
I cant catch my breath I suffocate.
Suffocate.

[Chorus:]

This time I'm falling.
And I see you.
This time I've made up my mind.
This time I'm crawling just to be with you.
And I don't even know why.

[2nd Verse:]
Lets just take all my mistakes.
And just throw them in my face.
You say you don't know how I hate this place.
As I find all the lies left behind.
How could I be so blind.

[Pre Chorus:]
Will you drag me to the edge again.
I can't catch my breath I suffocate.
Suffocate.

[Chorus:]
This time I'm falling.
And I see you.
This time I've made up my mind.
This time I'm crawling just to be with you.
And I don't even know why.

[Bridge:]
Say that you'll never deceive me.
Whispering words that you'll never leave.

Sorry but I don't believe you.

[Chorus:]
This time I'm falling.
And I see you.
This time I've made up my mind.
This time I'm crawling just to be with you.
And I don't even know why.
