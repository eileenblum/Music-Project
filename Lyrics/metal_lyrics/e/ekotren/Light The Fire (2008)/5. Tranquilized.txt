[1st Verse:]
Day nears end.
The walls are closing in.
Again...again...
Sick of getting by.
No matter how hard I try.
To get ahead.

[Pre Chorus:]
All I need now is to get out of this town.
And get away..

[Chorus:]
You need to tell yourself now.
You can't keep running from.
The ones that let you down.
You play the game to feel alive.
To get by.

Don't want to be
Tranquilized.

[2nd Verse:]
Numb again.
Wondering how I, let it get to this.
Wasting all my time.
In this dead end life.
Tell me now when will this end.

[Pre Chorus:]
All I need now is to get out of this town.
And get away..

[Chorus:]
You need to tell yourself now.
You can't keep running from.
The ones that drag you down.
You play the game to feel alive..
To get high.

Don't want to be,
Tranquilized.

[Chorus:]
You need to tell yourself now.
You can't keep running from.
The ones that let you down.
You play the game to feel alive.
To get by.

Don't want to be
Tranquilized.
