[1st Verse:]
It was the first time I ever decided to say.
Show you all the damage inside caused by all of the
Games you played inside my mind.
Stare at me blankly.
Now there's nowhere for you to hide.
Nothing left to hide behind now.

[Pre Chorus:]
Nothing left to hide behind now.
Now
Noting left to hide behind now.

[Chorus:]
What have I.
(What have I)
Become to you now.
What have I.
(What have I)
Become to you now.
Tell me.
What have I.
(What have I)
Become to you now.
What have I.
(What have I)
Become to you now.

[2nd Chorus:]
It was the last time I ever felt that way.
Told you how I felt.
You chewed me up and spit me out.
And threw me away with all those games you played.
Stare at me blankly.
Now there's nothing left for you to hide.
Why don't you make me now.

[Chorus:]
What have I.
(What have I)
Become to you now.
What have I.
(What have I)
Become to you now.
Tell me.
What have I.
(What have I)
Become to you now.
What have I.
(What have I)
Become to you now.

I'll always remember.
I'll always remember.
I'll always remember.
(At first I was nothing)
I'll always remember.
(Now that I'm something you'll never forget)
I'll always remember.
(At first I was nothing)
I'll always remember.
(Now that I'm something you'll never forget me)

I take everything I said back.
Please don't walk away.
Fuck it.
Fuck you.
Stay away from me.
You fucking bitch.

[Chorus:]
What have I.
(What have I)
Become to you now.
What have I.
(What have I)
Become to you now.
Tell me.
What have I.
(What have I)
Become to you now.
What have I.
(What have I)
Become to you now.
