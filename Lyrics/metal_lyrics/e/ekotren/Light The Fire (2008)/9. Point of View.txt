[1st Verse:]
Decisions made blindly.
But I traded it all away.
As these footsteps, they get stronger now.
I turn my back I see you walking away.
Your so far away.

[Pre Chorus:]
The pistol is lying beside you.
But you can't fire back when you've got nothing left.

[Chorus:]
On the inside of my mind.
I know you'll never be satisfied with my point of view.
On your life.
The inside of my mind.
I know you'll never be satisfied with my point of view.
On your life.

[2nd Verse:]
I've taken all that I can take.
But you claim you see the only way.
As these footsteps, they get softer now.
You turn your back you see me walking away.
I'm so far away.

[Pre Chorus:]
The pistol is lying beside you.
But you can't fire back when you've got nothing left.

[Chorus:]
On the inside of my mind.
I know you'll never be satisfied with my point of view.
On your life.
The inside of my mind.
I know you'll never be satisfied with my point of view.
On your life.

[Bridge:]
You will fucking bleed for me.
You will fucking bleed for me.
Motherfucking bleed for me.
Motherfucking bleed for me.

[Chorus:]
On the inside of my mind.
I know you'll never be satisfied with my point of view.
On your life.
The inside of my mind.
I know you'll never be satisfied with my point of view.
On your life.
