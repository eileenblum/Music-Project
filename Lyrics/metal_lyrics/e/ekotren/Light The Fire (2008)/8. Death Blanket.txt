[1st Verse:]
Reaching out.
But no ones ever reaching back.
You tell me.
Your life is so hard and you got it bad.

You don't now shit about this life.
What its like to be frustrated.
Scraping just to get by.
Hold it inside.
Buried inside my mind.

[Chorus:]
Am I the only one.
Who wants to go down alone inside.
There's nothing you could have done for me.
So tell my friends when I'm gone.
Don't ever shed a tear.
I was never happy here anyway.

[2nd Verse:]
Nooses or needles.
It doesn't matter.
What ever gets the job done faster..
Just light the bullet on fire.
Lock it.
Load it.
I'll show you I'm not a liar.

There's reasons that people like me can't come out.
Say what I need to without being singled out.
Hold it inside.
Buried inside my mind.

[2nd Chorus:]
Am I the only one.
Who wants to go down alone inside.
There's nothing you could have done for me.
So tell my friends when I'm gone.
Don't ever shed a tear.
I was never happy here anyway.

Better off alone.
(You can't help me)
Better off alone.
Was there's  something you could have done?
You can't help me.
No there's nothing you could have done?
Don't try and help me.

[3rd Chorus:]
Am I the only one.
Who wants to go down alone inside.
There's nothing you could have done for me.
So tell my friends when I'm gone.
Don't ever shed a tear.
I was never happy here.
I'm better off all on my own.
