[bonus track, previously unreleased in the U.S.]

Silence
Shadows and dim lights contorting visions inside my mind.
Am I alone?
Night after night close my eyes.
Haunting these visions as fear shoots down my weary spine.
In this bed of mine.
It happens to me every time.

[Chorus:]
And I'm staring at the light.
(Starring at the light)
Will I fall asleep.
Will I fall asleep tonight.
And I'm staring at the light.
Will I fall asleep.
Broken inside.
An emptiness that fills up my mind.

Tell me I'm not the only one whose alone.
Night after night close my eyes.
Haunting these visions as this fear shoots down my weary spine.
In this bed of mine.
It happens to me every time.

[Chorus x2]

Silence
Shadows and dim lights contorting visions inside my mind.
