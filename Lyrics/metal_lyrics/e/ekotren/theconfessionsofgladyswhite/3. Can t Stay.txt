so dead inside
iâve been here before
i see the look upon your face that i just canât ignore
you saw the light
and now itâs gone
so tell me now what do you see in me anymore
and theres a lock over my mouth
and i cant find the key
how can i say
if i cant figure out whats wrong with me
all i needed to say
i canât stay
iâll be laughing as i walk away
all i needed to say
i canât stay
see through the lies
iâve heard before
the words just fade away
and i just donât care anymore
you saw the light
and now its gone
so tell me now what do you see in me anymore
and now i breathe a breath
in my moment of clarity
it all the same
it doesnât matter
you are dead to me
all i needed to say
i canât stay
iâll be laughing as i walk away
all i needed to say
i canât stay
iâll stand alone
with my head held high
i will not back down
this is my last goodbye
things will never be the same
all i needed to say
i canât stay
iâll be laughing as i walk away
all i needed to say
i canât stay
