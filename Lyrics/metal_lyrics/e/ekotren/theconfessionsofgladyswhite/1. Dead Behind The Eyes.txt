make way for daddyâs little whore
shes such a fake she cant stand being ignored
sheâll tear you down and make you forget who you are
and shes taking you home tonight
sheâll sacrifice her halo
iâve been
living in your lie
i have never in my life
seen someone so cold
as the whore you are
brought down by the weight of the word
sheâs not at all like all the other girls
dead behind the eyes without a care in her life
and sheâs taking me home tonight
sheâll sacrifice her halo
but all the ink in the world couldnât hide your pain
iâve been
living in your lie
i have never in my life
seen someone so cold
as the whore you are
shes empty
black inside
shes slowly losing her mind
thereâs a pain that she canât control
an emptiness that she canât let go
iâve been
living in your lie
i have never in my life
seen someone so cold
as the whore you are
