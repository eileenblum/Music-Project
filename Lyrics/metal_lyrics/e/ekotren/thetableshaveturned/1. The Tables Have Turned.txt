[1st Verse:]
Why can't things be simple.
Why does everything gotta be a fight.
I can't take this.
Why can't I break this.
Changes must be made.
So close but I can't seem to get away.
This thing that used to be so damn pure.
I light it on fire just to watch it burn.
Its safe to say.
Ive lost my way.
Gaze at the flame as its burning out.

[Chorus:]
So I'm back again.
And I'm falling in line.
I'm falling in line again.
Is this what you wanna be.
Tell me know what do you want from me.
What do you want from me.

Suffer

There Is always some new complication.
In the end I'll take the blame.
Take a step back look at what we have become.
Things ain't pretty.
This is all we have left.

[2nd Chorus:]
So I'm back again.
And I'm falling in line.
I'm falling in line again.
Is this what you wanna be.
Tell me know what do you want from me.
What do you want from me.

Suffer

So now your begging for forgiveness from me.
Ive got nothing left to give.
You've taken everything away.

[3rd Chorus:]
So I'm back again.
And I'm falling in line.
I'm falling in line again.
Is this what you wanna be.
Tell me know what do you want from me.
What do you want from me
