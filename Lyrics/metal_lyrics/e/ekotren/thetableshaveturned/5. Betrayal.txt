[1st Verse:]
Did you really fucking expect to get away with this.
Saying what you said you mine as well be dead.
When I get my hands on you.
There wont be a motherfucking thing you can do.
Settle the score.
This is the reason I brought you here for.
Can't forget these wounds that are sore.
They wont heal in time.
Ive tried to ignore.

[Chorus:]
You really crossed the line this time.
No more time for you.
So long.
This is what you get.
For lying.
No more time for regret.
So long.

[2nd Verse:]
My heart is pumping.
My veins are jumping.
Sit the fuck down.
Theres no way out of here.
I know you wish now you would have thought it through.
Now theres nothing left for me to do.
Settle the score.
This is the reason that I brought you here for,
You're sick sad pleasure.
For my utter humiliation.

Never want to feel.
The same.
Feel the same.
Feel the same betrayal.

Never again will I
Never again will I trust another inside.
