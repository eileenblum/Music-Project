[1st Verse:]
This person you see.
Is a direct result of everything I was forced to see and believe.
I know I'm not the only one who feels like this.
Follow me.
Come with me.

[Pre chorus:]
This is your life.
No time to think twice.

Now follow me now.
Come to a place where no one can find us.
Wait till the time is right.
No one will expect it.
No one will be prepared.

We'll make our move.
No time to think twice.
Kill everyone in sight.

[Chorus:]
Kill...
Kill everyone in sight.
Die..
You'll never get out alive.

[2nd Verse:]
No more being afraid.
Of anything.
Just because you say I should feel a certain way.
This time I know we are coming out.
This time I know we are going to shut you out.

[Pre chorus:]
This is your life.
No time to think twice.

Now follow me now.
Come to a place where no one can find us.
Wait till the time is right.
No one will expect it.
No one will be prepared.

We'll make our move.
No time to think twice.
Kill everyone in sight.

[Chorus:]
Kill...
Kill everyone in sight.
Die..
You'll never get out alive.

I will kill you..

[Chorus:]
Kill...
Kill everyone in sight.
Die..
You'll never get out alive.
