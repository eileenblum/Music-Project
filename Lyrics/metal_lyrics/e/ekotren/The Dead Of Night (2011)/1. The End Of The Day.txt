Donât care what you want to hear at all
This time we are going to take control

One day maybe youâll realize we are never going to change
Someday maybe youâll realize you cant change me

[Chorus]
Sick of living
Sick of dying
Sick of feeling like there is nothing left

You watch and wait to see us fall
No chance this is your wake up call

One day maybe youâll realize we are never going to change
Someday maybe youâll realize you cant change me

[Chorus]
Sick of living
Sick of dying
Sick of feeling like there is nothing left

At the end of the of day
Whose going to hear us anyway
Tell me who is listening
Did you honestly really think that we would care what you say
No weâre not listening
At the end of the of day
Whose going to hear us anyway
Tell me who

Us thatâs who
Fuck you
Walk away

No I donât care

One day maybe youâll realize we are never going to change
Someday maybe youâll realize you cant change me

[Chorus]
Sick of living
Sick of dying
Sick of feeling like there is nothing left
