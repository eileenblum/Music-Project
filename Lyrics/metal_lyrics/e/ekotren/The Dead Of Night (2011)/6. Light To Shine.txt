Life has got the best of me
Now I see the past is haunting me
I can feel the pain down to the bone
I drown in regret when I'm alone
We see the world through shattered eyes
But in the end youâll find there's never enough time
You can wait for your light to shine
You might wait all your life
You can wait for your light to shine
Did I just waste all my life
Now Iâve been sleeping endlessly
But I wont let it bring me to my knees
We see the world through shattered eyes
But in the end youâll find there's never enough time
You can wait for your light to shine
You might wait all your life
You can wait for your light to shine
You might wait all your life
Iâve been doing this for so long
That I donât recognize myself
Iâm not asking for too much
And Iâve got nothing left
Forever
Forever I will wait
Forever
How much more can I take
We see the world through shattered eyes
But in the end youâll find thereâs never enough time
You can wait for your light to shine
You might wait all your life
You can wait for your light to shine
You might wait all your life
Did I just waste all my life
