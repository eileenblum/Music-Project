So dead inside
Iâve been here before
I see the look upon your face that I just canât ignore
You saw the light
And now itâs gone
So tell me now what do you see in me anymore
And there's a lock over my mouth
And I cant find the key
How can I say
If I cant figure out whats wrong with me
All I needed to say
I canât stay
Iâll be laughing as I walk away
All I needed to say
I canât stay
See through the lies
Iâve heard before
The words just fade away
And I just donât care anymore
You saw the light
And now its gone
So tell me now what do you see in me anymore
And now I breathe a breath
In my moment of clarity
It all the same
It doesnât matter
You are dead to me
All I needed to say
I canât stay
Iâll be laughing as I walk away
All I needed to say
I canât stay
Iâll stand alone
With my head held high
I will not back down
This is my last goodbye
Things will never be the same
All I needed to say
I canât stay
Iâll be laughing as I walk away
All I needed to say
I canât stay
