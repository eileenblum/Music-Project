Over and over again
I see no change in this fight
Just another night filled
With your blank stares and your spite

Back to where it all began
The future's never been looking so grim
Being ripped apart again
As you are dragging me
Down to your hell with you
Down to your hell with you

What am I supposed to do?

She hides behind a mask of lies
(She hides behind, she hides behind)
No one can save you
No one to hear your cries [x2]

Back and forth we struggle
To find a common ground
The chances of reconciling
Are lost and can't be found

Back to where it all began
I'm better off being alone
'Cause I've been ripped apart again
As you are dragging me
Down to your hell with you
Down to your hell with you

What am I supposed to do?

She hides behind a mask of lies
(She hides behind, she hides behind)
No one can save you
No one to hear your cries [x2]

Relapse...
Drag me down
Drag me down

She hides behind a mask of lies
She hides behind a mask of lies

She hides behind a mask of lies
(She hides behind, she hides behind)
No one can save you
No one to hear your cries [x2]
