Make way for daddyâs little whore
Shes such a fake she cant stand being ignored
Sheâll tear you down and make you forget who you are
And shes taking you home tonight
Sheâll sacrifice her halo
Iâve been
Living in your lie
I have never in my life
Seen someone so cold
As the whore you are
Brought down by the weight of the word
Sheâs not at all like all the other girls
Dead behind the eyes without a care in her life
And sheâs taking me home tonight
Sheâll sacrifice her halo
But all the ink in the world couldnât hide your pain
Iâve been
Living in your lie
I have never in my life
Seen someone so cold
As the whore you are
Shes empty
Black inside
Shes slowly losing her mind
Thereâs a pain that she canât control
An emptiness that she canât let go
Iâve been
Living in your lie
I have never in my life
Seen someone so cold
As the whore you are
