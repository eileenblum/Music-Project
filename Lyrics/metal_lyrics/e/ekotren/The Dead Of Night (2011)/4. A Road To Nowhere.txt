I see your life and its a wreck
Crash and bleeding lying left for dead

No one to call out to for help
They just watched you burn
Is your life worth saving?

One shot and youâve hit the bottom
One shot and your going down
One shot and youâve hit the bottom
Never to be found

Just another life
Wasted on the side of a road
Of a road to nowhere I cant seem to find
Well the only thing we have
Is to make this moment last
When your almost dead your feeling most alive

Step back from the aftermath and see
Is this really who you want to be

No one to call out to for help
They just watched you burn
Is your life worth saving?

One shot and youâve hit the bottom
One shot and your going down
One shot and youâve hit the bottom
Never to be found

Just another life
Wasted on the side of a road
Of a road to nowhere I cant seem to find
Well the only thing we have
Is to make this moment last
When your almost dead your feeling most alive

Just another life
Wasting on the side
Of a road to nowhere I cant seem to find
Another life
Just been pushed a side
From the thoughts of all the shallow passers by
Well the only thing we have
Is to make this moment last
When your almost dead your feeling most alive
