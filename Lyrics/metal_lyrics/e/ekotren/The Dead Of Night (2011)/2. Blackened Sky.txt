You've got a feeling, gonna take you over
Now you're shaking, looking for the high
Can't remember last time you were sober
Don't even recognize you anymore

Throw it all away
Throw it all away

You want to waste your life
Throw it away, that's fine
When you're all alone and you realize
You're hanging off the edge of the knife
Underneath your blackened sky
Just to get high

The clock is ticking, now you feel the hunger
Do anything, you're running out of time
Don't really think you'll make it any longer
Don't even recognize you anymore

Throw it all away
Throw it all away

You want to waste your life
Throw it away, that's fine
When you're all alone and you realize
You're hanging off the edge of the knife
Underneath your blackened sky
Just to get high

Nowhere to run this time, it's over
Nowhere to run this time, it's over
There's nowhere to run this time
There's nowhere to run this time

You've got a feeling, gonna take you over
And now you're shaking, looking for the high
The clock is ticking, now you feel the hunger
Do anything, your'e running out of time

You want to waste your life
Throw it away, that's fine
When you're all alone and you realize
You're hanging off the edge of the knife
Underneath your blackened sky
Just to get high, just to get high
Just to get high
