I can't find my way
Through another pointless empty day
No matter how hard I try to
Forget yesterday

I feel so alone, that now I see
I've been here way too long
Just to be forgotten
I've become the dead of night

You can hide your demons
But in the end you'll see
No matter how hard you try
You'll feel just like me

I feel so alone, that now I see
I've been here way too long
Just to be forgotten
I've become the dead of night

Way too long
To be sitting here, waiting here
For something better to come along [x2]
Way too long

Way too long
Just to be forgotten
I've become the dead of night

Way too long
To be sitting here, waiting here
For something better to come along [x2]
Way too long
