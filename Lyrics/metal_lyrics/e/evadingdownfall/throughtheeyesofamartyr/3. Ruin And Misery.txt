A night so cold...desire for more...
Everything that once was turned to dust...

As grey as the ashes under the sorrowful sky
The bodies of our once floating so high...

Divided we fell one by one,
Cries in vain dissapeared together with the Sun...

Everything now haunting me,ruin and misery
And all my eyes see...
Ruin...and...misery...

Your greed-so senseless and deep
Your grief-destroying all dreams

Obsession-feeding our lust
Aggression-turning all to dust

Cursed slaves of our own
Blind in the cages of freedom!

Everything now haunting me,ruin and misery
And all my eyes see...
Ruin...and...misery...

Now painted in colors of ruin and misery,
These blind eyes see...NO MORE...
