They took my mind to a place where time and space are limited
I saw myself changing in their eyes,becoming everything they despise

So why don't they tell me what is my identity?
'Cos underneath this skin is a child without sensity

It's not that one part of me long ago taken
It's the pain in my eyes-the fury awaken
THE FURY'S AWAKEN!

So what do they want from me?
All I am now they made me be
Obscure and neverending-these mazes are just too big for me

It's not that one part of me long ago taken
It's the pain in my eyes-the fury awaken
THE FURY'S AWAKEN!

Never again!
Don't wanna believe!Is this beyond the truth?!
For all that we have done the truth and the lie became one
Lost are the evidence now,together with our souls sold out...
Together with lies...How could I be so blind...?

It's not that one part of me long ago taken
It's the pain in my eyes-the fury awaken
THE FURY'S AWAKEN!

They fill us with lies!
