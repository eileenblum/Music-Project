A sea of souls,no light upon
Crawling through emptiness for so long,
Under darkened stars-a misfortuned paradise
Led to sorrow,free no more

Torn apart from dark pasts,ourselves will be all to succeed
Death of love and blind beliefs are not what we need

Beyond a tragedy for eternities old,
Beyond the remains of a cold world,
A place where angels sleep,fulfilled by the beauty of those who dare to
believe...
...Of those who dare to believe!

Chapters of disharmony,
Saint leaders to fake democracy
Contaminating hearts with cynic honesty
Is that what we need?!
Is that what we need?!

Torn apart from dark pasts,ourselveswill be all to succeed
Death of love and blind beliefs are not what we need

Beyond a tragedy for eternities old,
Beyond the remains of a cold world,
A place where angels sleep,fulfilled by the beauty of those who dare to
believe...

One more tread before all falls...
Before all's gone...
Before all falls...
Before all's gone...
(One tread) before all falls,
(One tread) before all's gone
(One tread) before all falls,
(One tread) before all's gone

Beyond a tragedy for eternities old,
Beyond the remains of a cold world,
A place where angels sleep,fulfilled by the beauty of those who dare to
believe...

One more tread!
One more tread!
One more tread!
One more tread!
