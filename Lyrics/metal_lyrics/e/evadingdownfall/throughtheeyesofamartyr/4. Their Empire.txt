Their empire must fall!

Products of wrong perception,creating this institution
With broken wings we're watching another execution

Heaven in the fields of hell,
Our fathers blood spilt in vain for the starbing hearts of our beholders
Fed by sole illusions to excavate hope for our broken mind,
Like daylight to the faith of the blind...

We must conquer their grounds,
For we defend what's ours,
Ignore your fear or you will crawl
Their empire must fall!

With tears hidden by vengeance we'll turn darkness into day
The rise of  blackbirds will be for all forgotten names

For another tomorrow,for the dawn of a new day
For a new-written destiny we die,we'll pray
And the emperors will bleed...Under the axes of slaves...

We must conquer their grounds,
For we defend what's ours
Ignore your fear or you will crawl
Their empire must fall!

It must fall...Their empire...
It must fall...Their empire...
