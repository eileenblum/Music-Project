Where's justice gone?What happened to our God?
Screams in despair haunting me,
The eyes wide open see something I don't know how to understand
So many histories,so many broken dreams
Vultures,parasites
And all the pictures without frames,there are so many of them I can't
explain...

What happened with words?
What happened with deeds?
Where's the truth unspoken when all the words are broken for you and me...
Where are the words of humanity?!

The future unknown,the past breaking me
It's breaking me
My presence right inside this past-it can't be set free
Set free
My paths gloomy,here,in front of me
In front of me
Take my hands and guide me
Take my hands-cure my disease...

What happened with words?
What happened with deeds?
Where's the truth unspoken when all the words are broken for you and for
me...
Where are the words of humanity?!

Guide us,set us free
Set an end to our misery
This so-called life became all I don't wanna be
Where is humanity...?
