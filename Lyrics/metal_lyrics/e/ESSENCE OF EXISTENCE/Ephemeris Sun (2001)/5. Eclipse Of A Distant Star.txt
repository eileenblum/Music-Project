The light of the only star is gone and the aim of his way has disappeared
He became lost pointless being, existence without sense
So far from home, suddenly alone, is there a reason to survive?
That being seas nothing but darkest blackness,
Heading to nowhere, lost in the immense space
In the place where just one star was known
Supernova burnt the planet where hed grown
The energy is gone after countless years, he revived from cyoslep. His time has come.
Forsaken, forgotten by the dead. Shall he join his brothers?
Can be one of them? The thought of fear visits his mind. Is he immortal?
Is he able to die? He tries to break the dread, tries to open his eyes, to see what he knows
Everything is done. The last of the clan, his lord shall not let him go, extinct but alive,
He shall be imprisoned forever.
Forever buried in a deep star ship, in the one-star, on extinct race universe.
