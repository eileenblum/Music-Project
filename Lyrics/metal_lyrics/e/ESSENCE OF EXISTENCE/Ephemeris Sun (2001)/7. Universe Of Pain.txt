Born into a world of beauty you were brought on the silent hunters wings
Your soul has been incarnated without memories again
Upon a planet of desperation, where a race of hatred had grown
Killing the species of its own, upon a place where no one can leave from
How do you feel when your god leaves you alone?
How do you feel when your faith betrays you?
How do you feel when you know
That you die from very start leaving nothing only dust behind?
Like a nightmare in a dream. I am underneath your skin
Ill change wonderful world to hell you live in
Created me you became puppets in hands of a homemade god
Who moves your steps through your weary mind
You shall die like I never will, my grave is in oblivion
And there is no way you could reach it
On the planet of despair you race shall fade away
Annihilate yourselves, abandon me in pain
