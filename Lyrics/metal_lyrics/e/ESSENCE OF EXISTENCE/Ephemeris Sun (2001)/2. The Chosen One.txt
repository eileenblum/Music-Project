I cam e to pay with my soul, for thee refused to obay.
For thine omnipresent inequity.
Never the less I shall try to save thee
If you feel what I feel it wont be you anymore
With your phobia to know the consciousness
The purpose of the world is a lore demystified by no one.
Neither a few like me do comprehend
Evaluation of the species is a game with given results
I hunger to experience the one of yours
I am the one who I selder than thine universe, who saw its death
Same one as of the others. I am not alone because what lives, dies
I am here forever (of your time). I know the portrait of the world
We're looking for thw wormhole bridges that lead to the
Universes in the sphere of space - time continuum
Lterations of everything imaginable in our hostile multidimensional residence
We lost our very faith for you have betrayed your children
You left our souls abandoned, left all alone
We have strived, we really tried for better lives.
Despite all you havnt arrived through the gate in time
Our soldiers are prepared, deadly weapons are primed.
Foes are awating us, they're about to die
Vanish in killing air, while our army attacks,
Victory is sweet with the scent of blood and tears
There are no true gods for you to pray to, none shall listen to you
You are on your own to realize the truth
I have fought for thee, for thy liberty to see, ye reward is lost, even out of my reach
Fallen, ostracized messiah, I shall be gone now
My exodus to another realm soon shall be done.
