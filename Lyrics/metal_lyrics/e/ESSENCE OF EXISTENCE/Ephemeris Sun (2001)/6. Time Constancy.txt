Alone, I use the vacuity as my habitat.
Here, I cant receive illusions of changes through my frozen mind
Constancy in the focus of never: Magic spheres - the germs of the worlds are buried somewhere.
With my first move I could corrupt the never and let them explode.
To create space and time through the transformation of never
Belonging into elements eternal
Garden of vigour hidden to anyone's visions
The place where stem of all realities shall arise
Spring of space - times infinite possibilities
Silent sleeping beauty of time constancy
Magnification of the germs is conquering the void of the space
The universes in which the evil and good are being built
Chaos and order, gods, demons and inferior beings
But only the chosen ones will find the keys from the gates
To the different states of existences and different realities in the supercosmos
When to destroy is to create
Opens the garden again again all realities will meet to combine
The stream of time shall flow in its own spring
When to destroy is to create
Opens the garden again all realities will meet to combine
Cycle completes in elegance of the time constancy.
