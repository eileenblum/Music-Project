It's a long route towards the end, you cannot turn, theres no use to die today
They throw thyself back to sublife of your blood is on they own hands
You are captured here on gaia
Just in a few dimensions by false gods made by yourselves
They tear they soul apart mutate thy flesh by the dust of fallen fear
Metamorphosis they mind and transfer it to a lethal realm
Virtual illusions of life, memories taken away
Fear comes from dreams suffer in painful tortures - variations of agony
Millenniums are awaiting thee, descendants of stellar travelers
Seek in thy past - for the keys to the future of humanity
Break the circle of ephemeral half-life
Find stolen sencses of your body
And incomplete perception of unknown around thee shall come to an end
"I wish I could only know is this life or final death.
I hope I shall find at least is this the start or the end."
