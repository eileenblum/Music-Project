The essences are on the rise, they devour the void of nothingness
Id set this experiment to enjoy absolute experience
Molestation - the pain illusion. Confusion - unfocused vision
Odium - swallowed feelings. Depression - self pity mourning
Every alternative shall take place in my ultimate construction
To please me, the creator of the universe, the architect of perception
I am the reason, I am the source. I gave birth both thy creators thus thee
I am the beholder hidden in every entity. I enjoy what I have made, pleasures and aches
The world is me, I am eternity, everything that was, is and shall ever be
Love - the pleasure illusion. Certainty - brains adjusted.
Satisfaction - lethargy foundation. Ecstasy - a way to die
I am the destroyer of evenness, the uncertainty bringer, the keeper of existence
The creator of the universe, the architect of consciousness, slayer of unreality, I am the spring
I am the one, and you, you shall depart this life
To know me... maybe.
