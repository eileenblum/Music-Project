Blown by the wind of the universe
An ancient nightmare had risen from the mist of time
Curse of emotionality has been cast upon thee
Thine essences sank in immaterial unreality
The concepts of ultimate truth are just another lies
To keep the balance between the forces of good and evil
The immortals guard the mystery of the flux
'Gainst the generations that shall come - deaf and blind
Through the implication of interactive imagination
The inferiors will never be able to feel the truth
Silence of thy own brains, mouths unable to scream
Nothing moves in magic creation of every dawn
Explosion of a black hole in the center of your galaxy
Burns planetary systems by its deadly mass
Thus all civilizations shall be destroyed
By the infinite wisdom of ye nature.
