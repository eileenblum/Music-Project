[Words and Music By Joe DeGroot.]

Spiraling universal spectrum
Cosmic active sonar mind
We are on a quest for equilibrium
Through caverns that intertwine

Faded-stellar resonance
A sudden flash of delirium
Surrounded by lightless clouds
Castaway into obscurity

Dismal awakening
A diversion from this vertigo
Maze of confinement
Every turn leading back again

In the winding hours
In a manic wave hysteria
The solar storm awaits
Implode to explode
Recycled existence breathes
Dawn under the timeless sun
