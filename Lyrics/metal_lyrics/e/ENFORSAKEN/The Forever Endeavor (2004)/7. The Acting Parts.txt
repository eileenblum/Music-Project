[Words by Steven Sagala, Music by Steve Stell.]

Walking through the shallow-filled escape
As we have seen it many times before
Right on towards the resolution
We fall within the tides of evolution
To mock the tyrants - it's the essence of man
And to conquer it within our hands
Right on towards the resolution
We fall within the tides of evolution

We await the day
For another time where we can fall in line

We are the ones who are in control
It's the reality within the role
All these faces like you've never seen
The acting parts within you and me
Now we are waiting for the sign
It's the truth within the line
All these faces like you've never seen
The acting parts within you and me

Narrow minded the feverish stance
The pseudo-blind romance
Holding on in desperation
We fall within the halls of desolation
Deviate the means until the end
Reverse the sequence and take a stand
Holding on in desperation
We fall within the halls of desolation

The lucid design of a dying race
Tell me where you stand in this great big space
Scripted and obscure with words unbound
Within these words the secrets shall be found

Defy the darkness here
Defy the darkness as it draws near

The struggle now unfolds as the millions in death await
Let's break the silence

[Lead: Stell]

We are the ones who are in control
It's the reality within the role
All these faces like you've never seen
The acting parts within you and me
Now we are waiting for the sign
It's the truth within the line
All these faces like you've never seen
The acting parts within you and me
We await the day
The acting parts within you and me
