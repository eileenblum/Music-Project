[Words and music by Steven Stell]

I've had enough
Of these worthless words you speak
And it's become too much for me to take
Can you reach inside of my dead heart
And restore my faith, because it's lost
Lost in your hopeless, empty eyes
Eyes so blind to all that's real
It's a shame that you will never see
See what you've left inside of me

Take the time to do it right
And cleanse yourself within this light
Disconnect to re-invent
what is it that you lack
that holds you back somehow?
Break me down just once again
You'll find no answers within
One false move unlocks the truth
Who is it that once said
"The past repeats itself"
Who fucking cares!
And so it has to end
There's no reason to pretend
And as the seasons change
We find there's no one left to blame
So when all is said and done
I find I'm not the only one
This lovely misery we shared
Was all for nothing
Love gone wrong
But was it ever really truly right
Who's to know and who's to say
There's no reason to stay true in vain
Say what you will to ease your pain
And I should've seen it from the start
A fake that hides behind a fragile smile
Can you truly build a perfect life
With designs custom made to suit a whore

Take the time to do it wrong
and see what's been missed all along
Talk is cheap and so are you
Whatever will this poor girl do to free herself?
And if you ever do decide
To take hold of your makeshift life
Wipe away all of your tears
And realize that no one cares
you've failed again
You're on your own
And so it has to end
There's no reason to pretend
And as the seasons change
We find there's no one left to blame
So when all is said and done
I find I'm not the only one
This lovely misery we shared
Was all for nothing
Rise....And soar above the rest
And realize you've passed their test
To turn back now
would surely crush all you've gained
and that would be quite a shame
So swallow it as it comes
beacause too much is not enough
And if our paths cross again
don't dare speak a word
I've heard it all before
save your dying breath
I don't care anymore
There's no more you and me
but please don't fail to see
That everything we had
still lives in memories...

[Lead: James Murphy]

And so the cycle continues
Outstretched arms
won't you warm me with your cold embrace
and fuel my hate just once again
Deep inside there's still a part of me
That longs for your faithless, bitter touch
But these feelings never really last
no longer slave to your foul kiss
I have washed my hands of all of this
I've regained my life, you're dead to me
Take the time to do it right
and cleanse yourself within this light
Disconnect to re-invent
What is it that we lack, that holds us back somehow?
And If you ever do decide
to take hold of your makeshift life
wipe away all of your tears
And Realize that no one cares
we've failed again
you're on your own
And so it has to end
There's no reason to pretend
And as the seasons change
We find there's no one left to blame
So when all is said and done
I find I'm not the only one
This lovely misery we shared
Was all for nothing...
