[Words By Steven Sagala. Music By Joe DeGroot]

Once alive - deep inside
Now staring through unforgiving eyes

Guilt in my heart
My fate in your hands
I ask for forgiveness
Now tell me your plans
You speak to your mirror
Speak to your lies
Do you like what you hear?

No cares or worries it's all now behind you
Move on now move on, but let me continue
As you cling to those objects - the ones you hold dear
There will be nobody near

-Unleasing the fury inside-

Watch me now bleed as I stand here before you
In mercy, in love - I'll show everyone here what you do

This is the way the deal has been made

I swallow my pride, get back on my feet
While waiting for you and your life cloaked in need
Feel the cold of a black-hearted soul
So deadly a force that alone it cannot  run its course

Silence replaces your once changing faces
Wretched and reckless - a sorrow now endless
Sick with self-pity you are now growing weary
I laugh as you cry

Take me away from this place you've created
Do you not see I am striving for change?
My hands tied behind me with no ground beneath me

[Lead: DeGroot]

Gather your weapons and gather your friends
Celebrate losing at life once again
Grieve by the bottle
Laugh at the past
Flash us a smile and see if it lasts

The pictures are fading as life takes its toll
Now there is nothing left to show
Take a look and you will see I did what was best
You did all the rest!
