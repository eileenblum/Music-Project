[Words by Steven Sagala, Music by Steve Stell.]

Screaming for mercy
Why can't they hear me?
These nights are filled with heartache
These nights are filled with an empty glass

Just turn us up and step aside
We know you very well
We know what dwells down deep inside
Come see this from the past
'cause the cynics said it would not last
Now watch them disappear
The truth will begin right here

These streets will burn behind you
As tradition breaks tonight
Go forth and tell the world
We have arrived

Our spirits clad in black
This color runs down my back
and leads me to your home
The channel never has it
Shift to automatic
It?s how the cycle goes
Then see what they really know

[Lead: DeGroot]

These are the signs of our times
Take what you want and leave all the rest
Hearken back to reclaim your creation
and break this tradition

[Lead: Stell]
[Lead: DeGroot]

For years we have wandered in dismay
Now here we stand as one
Stronger than you?ve ever known

The loss of innocence became your saving grace

What can we do right now?
What more can we say?

Fuel the rage
Echo salvation

They'll never run us out
We're martyrs in the making
Look deep into their eyes
They're ripe for the taking
Erase all the lines and get back in the fold
This is the day and age
Of monumental growth and change

These streets will burn behind you
As tradition breaks tonight
Go forth and tell the world
You have arrived
