[Words by Steven Sagala, Music By Steve Stell and Eric Kava.]

The lines have been drawn
Mark the ground with ashes
Forget me not
I am the icon of the masses
The tables will turn, another will burn
The blindness now revealing
In darkness defiled, a work in denial
The leper is so appealing

Redemption - crawling in the depths of a thousand scars
Is this what you're dying for?
Redemption - crawling in the depths of a thousand scars
To become the savior

[Lead: Stell]
[Lead: DeGroot]

Cowards! Cowards!
They hide behind their salient walls
Lash out towards the ignorant
No mercy for the innocent

Autocratic?
Democratic?
Or a population overkill?
One by one
The image that will fade away

I stalk you in the night
Without warning and out of sight
I don?t care what?s wrong or right
'Cause it all ends here tonight
Your blood is as good as gold
Another victim waiting to be sold
Watch out, you may be next
Down at my feet just like all of the rest

[Lead: DeGroot]
[Lead: Stell]

Fists in the air march with me
Rebels heed the call
Patron saints of ill-borne sin
I told you once, now for the last time
Give us a chance, give us a choice
Here is the plan to reverse the voice
Redemption - crawling in the depths of a thousand scars
Is this what you're dying for?
Redemption - crawling in the depths of a thousand scars
To become the savior
