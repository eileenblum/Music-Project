[Words by Steven Sagala, Music by Steve Stell and Joe DeGroot.]

[Lead: Stell]

The illusion in us all - a social parasite
Manipulating circumstance or a judgment stigmatized?
The inner revolution, the ruins of the heart
These are tales of bitterness let me take you to the start

I feel it coming down
And waiting at my door
My God so far away
Does he need me anymore?

We travel in this rapid form
Unable to fulfill our dreams
The fleeting thoughts of yesteryear
Impossible for you to breed

Songs of a shattered lifetime - modern day dramatics
Another contradiction is rising through the conflicts
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing stays the same
We are magnificent material exposed to decay

At the farthest reaches of my sight
You're not there

Where are you now?
As I cry for my reprieve
Where are you now?
As I become who I am supposed to be

Tear my heart
Ease my pain
Further below us yet so up high
This paradise will never survive

The wrath of mankind means nothing here
The hands of the liar will seal my fate
I am burning alive

As the angels weep, the prophet decrees
"Withered wings shall befall the kings"
