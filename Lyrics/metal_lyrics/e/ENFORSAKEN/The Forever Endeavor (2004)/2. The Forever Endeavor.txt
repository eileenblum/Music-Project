[Words by Steven Sagala, Music by Joe DeGroot.]

Born upon lies
Deception and strife
Poised to be art
This lifeless heart

Where will we be?
What does it mean for me?

Follow the truth then take it with you
Further and further away
To save humanity
Beyond the realm of time

In my eyes
A reason's demise
This moment of truth
Shall cut all the ties
Say goodbye
Leave it all behind

Curse the word
Let it be heard
Witness the fall
I want it all

Reach for the promise
Hold back the tears
Down on the inside
Nothing left to fear

Behold the mystery
On this endeavor that will last forever
Make a believer in me
On this endeavor that will last forever

[Lead: DeGroot]

Feel the air as two wills collide
Send me away as you look towards the sky
Perpetual existence - a place where nobody goes
The path of least resistance - a place that nobody knows

[Lead: DeGroot]

Born upon lies
Poised to be art

In my eyes
A reason?s demise
This moment of truth
Shall cut all the ties

Where will we be?
Say goodbye
