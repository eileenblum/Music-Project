[Words by Steven Sagala, Music by Joe DeGroot.]

Hear me now and die with me later.....
There is no truth but the end of forever
To solemnly swear to have and to hold
and until tomorrow, the word shall bleed old
(As the heart now grows cold)
For I am one and one in you
An eternity begotten from the earth anew
You sow the seeds, I reap the harvest
and rape the sanctity's gaze

Awakened from this sleepless night without a soul to bear
Please tell me how the story ends before I lose it all... make it disappear
Tranquility and futility, two words stifled in stability
Oh how I am praying for that day... will the nightmare ever end?

Dead Light, Dead Night
Impurity and spiritual bliss
in heaven's chambers by a mere mortal kiss
Dead Light, Dead Night
Loathe me and love me, love me and leave me
As you fall from grace your lord is with thee

I was not trying to make it different
I just wanted control
Don't even try to make me believe
The pain will go right through you

[Lead: DeGroot]

Deterioration, elimination - of our destination
Inferior will in a virtual thrill - as time stands still
No, I won't let you in
Meet me at the turning point as there?s no turning back
The silence is deafening...go in for the kill

Dead Light, Dead Night
Impurity and spiritual bliss
in heaven's chambers by a mere mortal kiss
Dead Light, Dead Night
Loathe me and love me, love me and leave me
As you fall from grace your lord is with thee

I was not trying to make it different
I just wanted control
Don't even try to make me believe
The pain will go right through you
