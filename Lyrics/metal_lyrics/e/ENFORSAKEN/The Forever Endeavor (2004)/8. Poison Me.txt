[Words by Steven Sagala, Music by Steve Stell and Joe DeGroot.]

Call my name
Call my name without regret
And I'll be on my way

What are we doing here?
Why are you asking me?
This red color from the line
A strange sense of sympathy?
I cannot be one with them
Ao I'm standing by your side
Torn between what's real and binding
As those scenes keep rewinding
All I can say and do is surrender to the guilt
That it puts me through

I am the poison fountain
I am the poison seed
I love to poison you
You love the poison me

Beware this twilight creature
This demon of the night
Feed off its energy
Breathe in its frightening dream
Now I am one with them
No longer by your side
Sit back and hold on tight
Get ready for the ride
All I can say and do is surrender to this misery
that it puts me through

I am the poison fountain
I am the poison seed
I love to poison you
You love the poison me

A carnal desire - my life is now at stake
For all that I know, how much more can I take
The battles, the rages, the infinite stages
Where we become the dead

At the hour of my grief
Please tell me what I need
'Cause no one seems to understand
My place in life or who I am
How can I go on like this?

We have faltered again
Beneath the saddest shade of life

[Lead: Stell]

Bring me all your hell

What are we doing here?
Are you still asking me?
Just look right down the line
You will find no sympathy
See me, hear me, know who I am
I am the one with contemptuous hands
This is the name that you wish you could forget
This is the name that you now regret
Tell me what to say and do
Tell me what to say to you
But now it's too late
