27 years I have wasted
Razor to wrist will erase it
Fix me a drink and some pills for relief
As I wait here to die
She'll be by my side
The suicide bride
Death is the new life
Can I get a witness to the fall?
Slitting my past for a better (quicker) tomorrow
'Cause there is nothing in this world that can keep me alive
Thanks for nothing
Into the looking glass a dreamland if you dare
You are going nowhere fast in this shape of despair
Welcome to the fall
We're so glad that we could see you end it all.
