Icon versus Icon
The two shall become one
The prophet so pathetic
Now cast them down in stone
They say 'em in a pit of confusion
They say 'em in a fit of delusion
Face down in the grave your destiny awaits
Bleed to breathe your blasphemy
Down by the gallows
Down by the released
There lies a premonition
Waiting for eternity
Words in red now in your head
These messages exorcised
These messages sent from the dead
Countless martyrs
Brought down by acts of hate
Can't kill what has been said
The words of the living dead
Fear not the wall of suffering
Fear not the pain of dying
Fear not the endless tragedies
Fear for the new beginning
Forgotten is the savior
The icon of the weak
Words in red - save us from hypocrisy
