The end of forever
Your time is now
Full speed ahead
Full speed down
Enter salvation to take your sins away
Exit tomorrow to take away the pain
Steering the course to oblivion
Towards this dead end dream
Facing the fears that have haunted these years
Nothing is what it seems
This moral face
The face of infamy
Reveals the scars
The scars of ecstasy
The silent revolution
A waging war within
Darken all my dreams
Damn my cares to hell
I have never lived before
Never knew what life could really be
This is the human tragedy
If we only knew the power within the mystery
I have never died before
Show me that you are the one
The one to start this over now
Why did you curse me with life everlasting?
Enter salvation to take your sins away
Exit tomorrow and take away your pain
Your time is coming
Here's to forever - a distant memory
This silent revolution
Wage the war within
Darken all my dreams
Damn my cares to hell
So haunt me until the bitter end
Wallow in shame with death my only friend
