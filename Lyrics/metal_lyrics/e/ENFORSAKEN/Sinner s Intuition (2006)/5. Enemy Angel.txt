Wings of the harlot burning the night sky
Sirens screaming through the valley
The dawn of chaos
Spilling the blood of the heathens in the streets tonight
The angel of mercy is laughing
Still holding on to the scythe
Wings of scarlet
Burning harlot
Right through your poison hearts
Into infernal desire
The enemy angel arrives (burning brighter)
Now she's coming to take you away
Into the darkness divine
This enemy angel of mine
The ending was written right from the start
We are tearing down the sacred heart
Scenes from a generation
Waiting for something
Now holding nothing
Right from the start
Tearing the sacred heart
Plague raging
Wrath of the gods
Death - Destruction
The devil's way
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Armageddon holiday
Blood of the heathens
Now begging for mercy
