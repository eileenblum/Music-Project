Freedom is never free in this kingdom of lies
Enslaved by design
Failure figure
Unspeakable cruelty
End of all mankind
Shedding a lifetime for all to see the light shine
Fighting and fleeing
What is there left to seethe in?
Fooled by the style disease
You'll come around, but you know that you'll be waiting there with me
City of sin
Where the end begins
Halo of ruin turns fortune to famine
Sadist executioner
Betrayer of dignity
Cult right down the line
Decrepit conscience
Fading resistance
Lights out for the last time
Breaking the skyline for all to see the dark side
Living and dying
What is there left to breathe in?
I am the enemy
They'll come around, but you know that you'll be waiting there for me
Look at the world through blood-stained eyes
Look at the world and its final demise
Betrayed by design
This is the end of all mankind
City of sin
Halo of ruin
Lights out
Let the end begin one more time
Shedding a lifetime for all to see the light shine
Shedding a lifetime for all to see the dark side
Fighting and fleeing
Living and dying
I am the style disease
You'll come around, but you know that you'll be the enemy
