Creating the tale
Creating the tale
Creating the tale of iskander
She said take the crown take the crown
My birthright I was ordained ordained
Creating the tale
Creating the tale
Creating the tale of iskander
With the clause of the league of Corinth
I was a warrior leader
To keep the Greeks following my noble cause
I crushed the theban heart
I Alexander the king that reached the end of the world
Creating a name that will echo through all time
And it will outlast Egypt's sun
I'll not be matched for a millenia
I am the scale by which you judge a legend
Setting my sights
I will cross the Hellespont
42,000 soldiers of Macedon
I will build an empire
I will be your god
Striding forward
Battle of Isis
Siege of Tyre
Persia will bow before the higher
Master of
The known world that he sees
He will hide so that he is free
