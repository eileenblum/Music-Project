So you lead the band tonight
Play the dice to win their lives
Guide the hand behind the eyes
You design their demise
See a path
To drag them all into the light
The sundered forever spite
The world the dead
Dream the light
Sufferers cover the ground
The keepers of faith have found out the lie
That we set a thousand years ago to revive
To drag them all of the world that has thrived with out a life
We are the ones that rule beneath the crown
To differentiate the dead and down
The ones that caused a populace to drown
The only ones that man attempts to own
I, I was a lord of life's discord
A wandered horde the beggared lord
That carries the tale
And warns the rest that their hope is dead
Cling to the rocks as the seas drown their fate
Of all tonight
Play the dice to win their lives
Take the hand of the hope in their eyes
Lead them to their saviours demise
I am the being that walks the worlds beyond
I will see the end before the universe decides
I am the god who lied
I am the only one that seeks the end design
