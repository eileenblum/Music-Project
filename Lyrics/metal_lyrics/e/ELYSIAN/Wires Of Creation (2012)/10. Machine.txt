Lines, of binary resolve
Embodied situations behaviour based
Nodes of the all the cybernetic code
Complacency will save us the cybernetic code
Do we have a say
In creation
Walking the path of error humanity
The machine will arise
Walking the path of error humanity
The machine will arise
Walking the path of error humanity
The machine
I'm cause of sight cause of might fall of life
I'm end of thought start of naught whats the cause
Nodes of the all the cybernetic code
The path we tread it takes us from gods design of man
Follow the lines
That criss cross inside your mind
Reason self evolve
Error node the heart
Follow the line
