Force those those who choose to receive the world
Dilute their life to a point where they seize to see
We cry and we suffer
Our lot in the world
I look for the reasons
We're encased in gold
Hide the way I see the world
From those that govern me
I've been enlightened above the ghosts
Of this society
Equilibrium
Sense offender
Equilibrium
Sense offender
I was once a cleric
Sought the truth of the light to see
We have lost the essence of living
Offenders this time
Suffering through the world and its beating
Offenders this time
Equilibrium
Sense offender
Equilibrium
Sense offender
Hide the way I see the world
From those that govern me
I've been enlightened above the ghosts
Of this society
Equilibrium
