It burns to look beyond your eyes
So you close the door and love is left outside
I walked with ambition clearly lain
But now I've left the path I'm shunned away

Take away the writings of my heart
It's all I've got left inside
She crushed my pride
And I searched the heights
Forgetting about the depths of my own life
I have made mistakes before
But this one has destroyed them all

Climbing the spire of fear
Climbing the spire of fear

It burns to look beyond your eyes
So you close the door and love is left outside
I walked with ambition clearly lain
But now I've left the path I've shunned away

It's all I wanted in this life
A love who will stand by it all in the hardest of time
we will climb the spire together
Helping each others path to heaven
And she will help life lift
With a soft Consuming kiss

When i learned the truth of all my hurt
i want blood to pay
the sins written on my soul
my blood your curse 

I'm destroying the armies that guard
The spire of my own
I'm destroying the armies that guard
The fear of the climb

I am waiting,
For the call,
That will let me know
If I have traveled far
Enough to see the design of my end
Feeling the wires of Gods creation.

Design of the end
Design of the end
