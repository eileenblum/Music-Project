A journey of shame
My fate is the sentinels breath in the air
I was the sum of all men
But my legends where worthless to those that ride winds of the Devine
Scour my mind free of damnations quests lusts of the flesh
I rose skyward to see all the betrayal begot by me
It's a lie to cry I dreamed that we were the ones to die
Seeping away scrounging whats left
I'm climbing the skies it always evolves from what I was promised and more
A cry
For the feelings I lost
A cry
It destroyed me at last
A cry from the helpless
I fell cresting the sky I begged but I was denied
A cry, a cry from the helpless
Place me near the bones
To the soil till birth and death is oil
Place me near the bones
To the soil till birth and death is one
The suffered horde
Seethes and weaves a constant howl, I begged you all save me now betraying
Place me near
Sufferers calling as one I am the beggar the sun
I was the sword
I had the choice to save the earth
I fell through my own conscious denials
A wave of memory swells
Its my own life that's lost for all
I was helpless alone to beat my carcadians
For I long to sleep
Alone to beat my carcadians
For I long to sleep
