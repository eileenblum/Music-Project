I woke to see
The stars alight my eyes
To know the bounds of time
To suffer for
The curse that killed the sky
We begged to die
Don't you let us live
We have taken lives
I am perfections sum
I hold the power of the sun
I am what needs to be
The guiding hand
Of our eternal demise
The force of the wheel of time
The weaver of the worlds
What was what will what is
Now were out of time
I wove the lace
The age of the pattern weaved a lie
We are the same you will see
We are the ones that saved the turning of the age
Perceive the mind that conceives the world
I will decide how I'm to die
I'm the lord
Of those create themselves heaven is out amongst the stars
I am perfections sum
I hold the power of the sun
I am what needs to be
The guide
I am perfections sum
I hold the power of the sun
I am all that needs to be
Sigma
