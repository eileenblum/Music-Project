I will breath the air of the devout
Why are you so blinded by this light
I decree that I believe
Their is nothing you have been deceived
You cannot shake what I create
They will try cause their incomplete
Failed to destroy
The seeds of all
We are godless creatures in a faithless void
Failed to reduce fear of futility
We are worthless creatures writhing without hope
We failed to understand
The light that we see is the end and history watches from behind with fear
I call out to all the sentient beings where are you
Reason or faith
Why are we not the ones that set the stone
Questions and laws
Why are we not the ones that set the stone
If you don't look to question the world your obstinate
Man blocked the sun to ensure mans design
I wondered for the design of life
Aren't you the one that fought the design of life
Suffering through a worlds disease
Faith was all that was left but it died
And I behold
The distant spires
That shows us mans failed desires
We were born with a withered design
We designed our end
We've fallen of the earth but we consumed the stars
