My cancer came knocking. It was dressed to the nines.
So I peeled back my skin and I let it come inside.
But it won't leave, though the guests have gone.
No, it pours a drink and requests another song.
Now it sleeps in between us.
Splits and doubles in size.
Apes my nuances of desertion, lust and arrogant pride.
And it drags me out of my head.
And it drags me out of my head.
The plague is now empowered.
My cancer waved torches.
Broke the lock on my door,
but I was powerless to refuse it anymore.
Is everyone comfortable? Is everyone having a good time?
My friends are all vampires. Come to drain and transform.
I keep the window cracked and the light on.

Kept the leftovers warm.
...maybe I make myself sick.
Make me give a damn and I will be with you everywhere.
I will open the sky.
I will follow you into hell
Kill everyone in our way.

Open your heart to the snake oil peddlers.
Open your heart to the snake oil peddlers.

"Make me give a damn and I will be with you everywhere.
I will open the sky.
I will follow you into hell
Kill everyone in our way."
Most romantic lines ever.

Snake oil peddlers are people who sell "medicine" but are fraudulent and/or ineffective.
