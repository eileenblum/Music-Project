God knows I've longed to feel something but now's not the time.
I'm caught up in the heartless disorder of a Friday night.
Focused on staying distracted until I lose sight of the tiresome and clinical patterns of my life.
I will cherish this love for the rest of my night.
One day I'll find myself facing the firing line.
Serves me right.
For the record I've written my crimes.
I will cherish this love for the rest of my night.

[Chorus:]
Lord have mercy on my soul.
I've had a good run but I can't run anymore.
Just put me down.
Lord have mercy on my soul.
I've had a good run but I can't run anymore.
Just put me down.
Can't sidestep the long arm for too long with this paper trail.
I've let them devour my heart for some material.
But I'm a drunkard, a coward, a crook. I ought to change my ways.
Face the music. Carry the can. Etcetera. Etcetera.

What's next?
Trust me, I'm still with you somewhere. I just wish it was here.
Someday I'm bound to feel guilty but now's not the time.
I'm sure I'll get what I'm due.
Everything will be fine.
Hell bent on finding the next fix in the fog.
You're in a cab on the way to your house. Change the locks.
I will cherish this love for the rest of the night.

[Chorus]
