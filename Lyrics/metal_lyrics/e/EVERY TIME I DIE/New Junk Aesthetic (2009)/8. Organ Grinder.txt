You've heard the voice of God, solely.
Everything is so clear to you.
Reload for the greater good.
Focus.
Throw us at the feet of the fools.
You don't know how lucky you are that your life is so characterless.
All the worlds a cage and we are animals pounding at the glass.
Housebroken, declawed. Unaware of the threat.
Bull hooks that keep us in line while cameras flash and we play while the trespassers plot to collect on their debts.
There were eyes everywhere that I went.
You'll be found.
Mark my words.
You will be found.
Stripped down and held to the light.
You will be found.
They will narrow their eyes, take aim and bring the world to its knees.
You'll be found.
Mark my words.
You will be found.
Just because you have figured it out.
Doesn't mean it won't happen to you.
Just because you have figured it out.
Doesn't mean it won't happen to you.
All the worlds a maze and they are scientists plotting every move.
Big brother will keep us in line with his snipers on the roof.
Though I'm cautious not to draw the attention of the fiends, I'm the happiest sadist around once surrendered to the drink.
There was fire everywhere that I stood.

There was fire everywhere that I stood.
Just because you're afraid of the dark doesn't mean that its frightened of you.
Just because you're afraid of the dark doesn't mean that its frightened of you.

You've heard the voice of God, solely.
Everything is so clear to you.
Slow down your racing heart.
Steady.
Quickly or it moves out of frame.
We are nothing more than mannequins.
Everyone is put of display.
This will not pass in time.
The moment will not pass.
Caught in the act for our lives.
The moment will not pass.
The dark doesn't flinch.
Take heed.
The moment will not pass.
Cover your tracks.
We're sitting ducks.
The moment will not pass.
We are nothing more than mannequins.
