Yea I know I look worse for the wear.
But I have everything at my fingertips.
I've been infantilized by a pat on the back and an endless go-ahead.
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride.
Ain't nothing gonna slow me down.
Oh no. When there's no one disapproving.

Yet its women not lack of ambition that keeps good men bedridden.
Jesus Christ I am forever making the same mistakes
Yet its women not lack of ambition that keeps good men bedridden.
Jesus Christ I am forever making the same mistakes.

I continue to stumble around as long as everyone cheers me on.
Am I the only one without the weapon to end the war?
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride.
Ain't nothing gonna slow me down.
Oh no. When there's no one disapproving.

Yet its women not lack of ambition that keeps good men bedridden.
Jesus Christ I am forever making the same mistakes
Yet its women not lack of ambition that keeps good men bedridden.
Jesus Christ I am forever making the same mistakes

Deaf men in the city of sirens.
Blind men in the presence of snakes.
But I'm adrift in a sea of temptation.
A newborn with inadequate skills.
Turn the party up, honestly be damned.
How fucking pathetic of me.
I can't go this way.
Not when I have your heart.
Oh what a childish life I have led.
God, what a wicked man I have been.
But ain't nothing gonna break my stride.
Ain't nothing gonna slow me down.
Oh no. When there's no on disapproving
