[Special edition bonus track]

Amidst the most barren scene how are we lost?
Lost?
Lost?
You've got to be fucking kidding me
Shut up
Just give me the wheel and I'll drive
You are not yet fit to speak on my behalf
We deserve to be moved by more than force alone
Instead I've been witness to loss
Upon loss
Upon loss
I'm assailed by the thoughtless who sing to their own
Caught in the middle
I'm pinned between the egos and the drones
Skill has been called to arms
Goddamn kids have grown up to let down
All around us are dissonant sounds
We're misplaced and we'll never be found
All these kids have grown up to let down
I'll be spinning in my grave for the rest of my life
Have I taught you children nothing all this time?
This labyrinth that we're puzzled by
Is nothing but a straight line
But sometimes those are even harder to navigate
We deserve to be moved by more than force alone
Instead I've been witness to loss
Upon loss
Upon loss
I'm assailed by the thoughtless who sing to their own
Caught in the middle
I'm pinned between the egos and the drones
Pride has been called to arms
Goddamn kids have grown up to let down
All around us are dissonant sounds
We're misplaced and we'll never be found
All these kids have grown up to let down
If this is the state of my art
Then I secede
If this is the state of my art
Then I secede
We're walking Spanish down a plank that stretches miles
You are not yet fit to speak on my behalf
What a shame we're forced
To suffer this senselessness and insanity
