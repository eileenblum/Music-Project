[Special edition bonus track]

Despite what you think
I can offer you nothing
I'm seasick and strung out and tired of adjusting
Hands on the dashboard where I can see them
Hands on the dashboard where I can see them
Let me think
Let me think
I'm all backed up
Just let me think
If you would be my bride
The smoke and mirrors of blissful lives
Will throw the hounds off the scent
Learn the lines
Learn the lines
It's all I'm asking
We steal what we need and the rest we call love
We steal what we need and the rest we call love
Take back the night
Drug the captors and run for your life
This is not what it seems
Stockholm syndromes just excessive grief
If you leave me
I'm coming with you I promise you that
If you leave me
I'm coming with you I promise you that
Get out while you're still god's child
We are deer in the headlights
Motionless til we're ripped to shreds
Stop following me around
Stop following me around
Learn to lie
Learn to lie
Learn to lie
Learn to lie
That's all I'm asking
We steal what we need and the rest we call love
We steal what we need and the rest we call love
Take back the night
Drug the captors and run for your life
This is not what it seems
Stockholm syndromes just excessive grief
If you leave me
I'm coming with you I promise you that
If you leave me
I'm coming with you I promise you that
Get out while you're still god's child
Hands on the dashboard where I can see them
Hands on the dashboard where I can see them
Don't look up
The cheap thrill of our impending doom is all I have
The cheap thrill of our impending doom is all I have
The cheap thrill of our impending doom is all I have
The cheap thrill of our impending doom is all I have
