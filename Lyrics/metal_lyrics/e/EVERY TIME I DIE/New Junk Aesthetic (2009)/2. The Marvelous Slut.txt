How ironic
I'm nailed to the cross
while the vultures stuff their mouths.
God and the devil are split by a thin white line

Sixï»¿ feet from an early grave
nine inches from being saved
eighteen hundred miles of skeletons on the interstate

Why do I give myself away
Why do I bleed so easily
Why do I give myself away
To be yours

Sixï»¿ feet from an early grave
nine inches from being saved
eighteen hundred miles of skeletons on the interstate

Why do I give myself away
Why do I bleed so easily
Why do I give myself away

If death's coming it best come quick
If death's coming it best come quick
If death's coming it best come quick
or I'm all yours

Why do I give myself away
Why do I bleed so easily
Why do I give myself away
To be yours

Her clothes will crack and peel off
A hard stance that a habit made soft
I am eaten of worms until I give up the ghost

If death's coming it best come quick
If death's coming it best come quick
If death's coming it best come quick
or I'm all yours

TAKE ME HOME

How ironic
I'm nailed to the cross
while the vultures stuff their mouths.
God and the devil are split by a thin white line

Why do I give myself away
Why do I bleed so easily
Why do I give myself away

I'm worth nothing to me
