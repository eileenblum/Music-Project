I have lived every day of my life
Thinking only of what I should think
When I read back at everything
That I have written
On how I lived my life

And in the process of doing so
I have started the chance to feel alive.
Just to stay an observer of an impartial observer.

Here I go again. I'm chasing my tail around the sun.
Standing beneath a tortoise under an elephant under the world.
The gravity of the battle means nothing to those at peace.
I can't believe I thought my thoughts meant anything.

When we think we've reached the end, we're only back where we begin.
When we think we've reached the end, we're only back where we begin.
Superman. Superman. Superman.

We are starving to death on full stomachs.
Running miles, new hearts on old legs.
If I had known all the howls were false alarms,
Oh just imagine the ammo we'd save.

Here we go again.
I'll come to your party if it goes until 4 question marks at least.
3 or less and it's not worth my time at all.
On nights like those my absence trumps my company.

When we think we've reached the end, we're only back where we begin.
When we think we've reached the end, we're only back where we being.
Superman. Superman. Superman.

I truly believe I'll be remembered and that even this sentence will be studied.
Will you think I am wise because I'm aware of that?
Or am I just killing myself before they get me?
