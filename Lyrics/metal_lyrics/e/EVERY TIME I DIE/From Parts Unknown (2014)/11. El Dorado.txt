you were alone when you came in
you'll be alone when you leave again
and in the middle there's nothing 
that can keep you around when it's time to go home
because everybody I lean on
(since I don't trust myself)
leans on someone else
watch the colonies collapse like dominoes 

I could beg and I could plead
but all I hear is the echo of my own voice begging me

the fossils of the teen age are well preserved in the arctic wasteland
the fossils of the teen age are well preserved in the arctic wasteland

I crawled on hands and knees just to be there with you 
and you moved on without me

scrap the crown, clear the slate
cut off you roots, you're on your own
scrap the crown, clear the slate
cut off you roots, you're on your own

we all need something

I'm a gypsy queen
without a swarm
and the burning bridges keep me warm

I'm a new wave
In a dried up stream
I'm just trying to find my way out to the sea

you were alone when you came here
you'll be alone when you leave again
and in the middle there's nothing
that can keep you around when it's time to go home
because everybody I lean on
(since I don't trust myself)
leans on someone else
watch the colonies collapse like dominoes 

I could beg and I could plead
but all I hear is the echo of my own voice begging me

the fossils of the teen age are well preserved in the arctic waste
the fossils of the teen age are well preserved in the arctic waste

crush your allies
crush your allies
