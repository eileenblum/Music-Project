pay no mind
to the stranger in
the 4 a.m
he's not the one we know

and he knows

I slept through the war
you waged with him
for a little bit
until he cracked your bones

and you had to let go

so I make believe
I've discovered peace
but I'll skin the man alive
and sell the meat

I'll wait in the dirt
where he left you blood
if he returns for it
I can make it right for good

oh how I wish he would

lost you in overflowing fog
that's been here awhile
so I plan to keep watch
as long as the wolves are out
they're always around
and more violet than hell

I have eyes of every color now
and they're vigilant
it doesn't matter who knocks
you don't let them in
there are terrible men
I'm one so I should know

heaven smiles on me now and then
but the devil always had hooks in

all I want is his head
and this horrible fucking world
will be wonderful again

there is so much beauty and love
and when I eat his beating heart
I can bring it back to us

there's nothing that I couldn't do
except cover you
when the slings and arrows came
and I've never been the same.
