from my skin
I emit flashing lights

In my eyes all you find
are flashing lights

from my mouth, every sound a warning bell
fill the room, kill the mood and overwhelm 

break up the crowd
suck the life out

break up the crowd
suck the life out

paralyzed until the flesh crawls right off my bones
I can't push words past the knot in my throat 
water stands where once water could flow
this is not my familiar broken home

hide you drugs
fix your shirt
turn it down

I botched the lines
tongue is tied
get me out

scatterbrained
It can't be fixed
nothing fits

out of film 
out of room
full eclipse 

break up the crowd
suck the life out

break up the crowd
suck the life out

the edges are made out of stone
I built a maze I can not get out of
the edges are made out of stone
this labyrinth I have trapped myself in 

throw me a rope, throw me a rope, throw me a rope 

I'm trapped in a wreck under myself
pinned to an old soul 
while everyone I love
stays forever young

the roads are blocked
the petals closed
they're on to me 
the song is too loud
I cannot dance
they're on to me
the air is weighs a ton
the air is weighs a ton

all I want is for everyone to go to hell
It's the last place I was seen before I lost myself
all I want is for everyone to come to hell
there we can be free and learn to love ourselves.
