Once
God
Gives
You
No-
thing
To fear,
Fear then.

It reads
Your lips.

It reads
Your lips.

We festered in the dark
Flies on the wall had us surrounded.
The almighty eye is inescapable.
All the unknown is manifest.
The gallows are vast and they are vacant.
What was unsaid is understood.
The Lord, he is fierce, but he is patient.
What was undone will stay undone.
Our prayers are delayed and they are makeshift.

The aura is
Around me

There's a spell coming on.
The devils got me, i done no wrong.
I am star-crossed.
Star-crossed.

I have buried all the trash,
But the earth shakes
And spits it back.

It is still here.
It is all here.

Mask it.
Fake it.
But the nature of our selves
Is evident.

The camera was hidden, but it was on us.
Every last word is second-guessed.
Go to the tape and youâll never get back.
What was unseen is obvious.
Carved into fire, forever reaching.
The door has swung wide, it canât be shut.
Those that keep watch remember everything.

Judged
By
All.

Stripped
Of
Flesh.
You canât vomit the apple up.
You can't vomit the apple up.
You can't vomit the apple up.
You can't vomit the apple up.
