blow your fucking brains out
blow your fucking brains out
tune that pale flame out
extinguish the glow forever and,

in will come the sun
in will come the sun
in will come the sun

blindfold your eyes, you are loved
trust in her aim, you are loved
now dance to the grave, you are loved
no one will ever know who they are

so blow your fucking brains out
blow your fucking brains out
tune that pale flame out
crack the egg wide open
and out will pour enough
out will pour enough
once you stop believing in yourself

silence the voice

so raise your antenna towards the sky
put blood in the well if it dries
what is now instead of what is next
our reflections only draw us to our death

tell yourself nothing
tell yourself nothing
tell yourself nothing

let the word come
let the word come
let the word come

all eyes off
all eyes off
all eyes off

drift without sight

all eyes off
all eyes off
all eyes off

drift without sight

blow your fucking brains out
blow your fucking brains out
