peel off the leather and dig out your heart, peel off the leather and dig out your heart, 
peel off the leather and dig out your heart, peel off the leather and dig out your heart, 

right before your very eyes
I slipped off the husk
I mastered the sleight
there's a getaway car
that's been waiting my whole life
the engine has been running since the moment I arrived

a trap door in the gallows let the charlatan out
smoke and mirrors box him in 
the rags and the bones were such a burden
that I though I'd collapse and only when I surrendered them
did I find I had what it takes to burn myself at the stake

did you smell a rat, did you smell a rat
did you smell a rat, did you smell a rat

I had faked everything but my death
across of the plane onto the shore
the strain on my back wasn't there anymore

wisdom teeth have replaced the fangs, wisdom teeth have replaced the fangs

I've been scalped, scalped, scalped 
I've been knocked conscious and I still haven't come around
there was so much trouble on my mind, all the time
call on the ten thieves and tell them I'm ready

I looked up and the desert was everywhere
but insight comes through blackened eyes
I climbed a hill to dig a hole in the ground 
where I could bury the faithlessness and the evidence that I was ever actually right
my skin was on too tight

I could not identify the body
us snakes evolve
it's what snakes do

i could not identify the body
shed the fur and leave the womb
peel off the leather and dig out your heart, peel off the leather and dig out your heart
peel off the leather and dig out your heart, peel off the leather and dig out your heart
