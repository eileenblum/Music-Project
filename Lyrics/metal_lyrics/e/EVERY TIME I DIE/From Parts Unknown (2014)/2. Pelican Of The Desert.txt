server the nerve
the skin
the scale
gather your bones from beyond the pale
come out of the wild and into the world
burn all the books
put out your eyes
lower your sword the end is nigh
sink through the pinewood and into the dirt
out of your body and into the sky
out of your body and into the sky

give in
voices will carry us
turn around.
find your way back to the start.

love is the way
love is the only way
love is the only way out

love is the way
love is the only way
love is the only way out

don't freeze up in the headlights
welcome it in
walk through the storm to the eye
the birth will be calm
the birth will be quiet
but the dark had such long arms
pulling me down
sliding back into my head
where all of it is thought without awareness
where there is no foresight only pertinence
i could scratch at the door
but I will never get in

so I rise above or I sink below
so I rise above or I sink below
either way I am false
at the center is all

I tripped up at the breakthrough
I was scared to die
so the gate locked
the light vanished
now where am I?
I was startled by the great height
I doubted my heart
now the wine turns to water
I am coming apart
