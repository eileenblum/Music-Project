we opened the box, and looked inside
two animals
one's dead one's alive
all we think we know is always wrong
the heavens fell in a thick awful shroud that covered the earth but there wasn't a sound
nobody saw it so nobody heard it
all these equations won't solve the uncertain

everything's dead until its alive
man will exist
and then he will die
just take the ride

see it now? see it now?
shift the absurd and the reasoned around
make it so, make is so
build holy places with towering stones.

open your eyes
it's all there inside
everything gone and forgotten survives
everything we know we think is wrong
all the lead becomes gold
all the squares get circled
all the graves, emptied and covered up.

we toil and we rot
and terrible things happened just like I thought
and the cycle carried on
until I thought nothing more and heartache was gone

love it as it is
whatever the fuck this is
or destroy and start again
what we are is in your head

hell broke loose
the stars unaligned
I looked for a kingdom that I'd never find
all I thought I knew was always wrong
I threw out the map and let go of the reigns
lead by a stranger into the strange
the answer is that there's no answer at all
the answer is that there's no answer at all

everything's dead until it's alive
man will exist and then he will die
just take the ride
