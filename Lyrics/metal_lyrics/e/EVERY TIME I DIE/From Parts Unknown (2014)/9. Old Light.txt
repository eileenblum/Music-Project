[feat. Brian Fallon]I'm a great oasis
yeah I'm a mirage
I'm a beam of old light from a vanquished star and I'll only guide you into the dark
I'm a parasite with a tapeworm
yeah I got a bulletproof vest
knowing my bad luck I ain't ever gonna die so the good will never get any rest

come bail me out of the state I'm in
the drinks I've had are no match for the truth
the crowd down here put it's teeth in us
but the cure's more dangerous than the venom is
so we leave it in 
and we do those things that make us forget that we're dying here
but we're dying here

so love your blood while you can
let it warm your freezing hands

I'm a dog-less master
yeah I'm a master-less dog
when the whip and the tether are put aside forever
I'm an ox that wanders into the swap
I'm a rattlesnake across a braided rope
I'm the demon on your side of the chalk
If I caught them girls who started them fires 
they'll track me down in the fog

come bail me out of the state I'm in
the drinks I've had are no match for the truth
the crowd down here put it's teeth in us
but the cure's more dangerous than the venom is
so we leave it in 
and we do those things that make us forget that we're dying here
but we're dying here

so love your blood while you can
let it warm your freezing hands

you put a hex me women 
you're a thinner, you're a thinner
yeah and these are nuclear winters
atomic black winters 
I kept the fire alive because 
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner
come here and let me boil your blood

I'm a train as long as the track
I am concurrently outbound and just now getting back
they strung me up by a rope as tall as the trees
though I land my two feet I still sway in the breeze
