I should have drown in the flood with the rest
I had the chance
the current was pitiless
and proof of man was wiped from the face off the earth, the song, the dance
i should have gone with it

alas, alas

I'm stranded alone in the wake
now I have lost all sight of the grave
when did I ever say that I want to be saved?
I can see for miles but it doesn't look the same
when no road has been paved,

go up
go up
go up
go up

now how am I gonna get down?

I want a slow death wrought from the dregs
"I want to be sedated'
just like joey said.
I want the heaviest heart

I have eaten my weight in gold
I can see only what I'm shown up here
but in the coals with common men who yearn for ordinary things love cannot find us

so get out of my way
I got out of my own way
better a tramp, than a captive
better alone than lonely with all these "friends"

what in the fuck am I doing here?
why did the rapture not take me in?
it is my curse to carry on.

I should have died when I was young
I should still be burning lung
If i had known what I'd become

I should have drown in the flood with the rest
I had the chance,
but here I am.
