I am the mason
and I am the stone
(believe that the silverware will bend)
I am the knowing and I am the known
(have faith that the lame will walk again)
Tight lips
and we come for it
what it gives
It's all coming back
March! March! March! March!
March! March! March! March!
Hang your head you are overwhelmed
It's all bits of nothing
Until it's a part of yourself
I am the mason and I am the stone
(the trigger is pulled a lifetime in advance)
I am the knowing and I am the known
(into the light we might have stood a chance)
Dead legs
The sight follows him
Now the hopelessness
It is.
Ours! Ours! Ours! Ours!
Ours! Ours! Ours! Ours!
March! March! March!
March! March! March!
Live forever just once
Live forever just once
Live forever just once
Hang your head you are overwhelmed
It's just all bits of nothing
Until it's a part of yourself
I am the mason and I am the stone
You are mine
You are mine
I am the knowing and I am the known
I am yours
The window that's near you has been spun
While you play
Sleep waits
Sensors explode
but the brown acid runs
through your veins
through your veins
