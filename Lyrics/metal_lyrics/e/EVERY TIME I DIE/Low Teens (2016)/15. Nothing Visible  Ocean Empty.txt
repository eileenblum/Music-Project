[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]Erase all the bastards, that gripped her, the vultures
And your sad eyes, that don't flicker
Protect her
Protect her

Turn the world into the wild

There is nothing outside but a mirror and the sky
You're a dream in a dream, you're the only one alive

Try bursting the clouds
Try not making a sound, or leaving the ground

So much space
And all I paint
Are oil spills
On black waves

I used to go easy
Yeah I noticed all the beauty
Now I'm hunch-backed,
It's all heavy
Reflector
Reflector

But the magic isn't real, 'til the magic is gone
If the flame was eternal, then it won't be for long

There is nothing inside, but a mirror and a light
You're caught in between
Mise en abyme*

I'm setting sail but I'm still as the wind doesn't blow
I'm waiting for a train, I don't think it'll show
I'm at party but there's nobody here that I know

I've called together every wolf in the Arctic, then I cried wolf, I cried wolf
I built a house on the grave that you haunted, then I shook, I got shook
I've called together every wolf in the Arctic, then I cried wolf, I cried wolf
I built a house on the grave that you haunted, then I shook, I got shook
I lit a match and threw it into the garden. Yeah and it took, oh it took
Somebody tell me if I'm dear or departed, I can't look, I can't look

Try bursting the clouds
Try not making a sound, or leaving the ground

All I create is empty space
Empty space, empty space

Cheer up
Have you ever thought of smiling more?
You look so good
Try smiling more

[* French. English translation: "within the abyss"]
