I have widowed every woman from the waitress to the queen
Been in and out of wedlocks with an exoskeleton key
I may perish unwept, but at least I'll never swing

I ain't in your crystal ball
You won't remember me but you'll remember our song

You got premonitions, talked to spirits, they approved
That just might mean you're lying or them spirits lied to you
Nothing more is perfect, yeah, but nothing less will do

I ain't in your crystal ball

You looked at what the light shined on not where it's shining from, didn't you?
You find what you need only when you need to find it. Yeah, I did it too

I knew I was alive because I used to want to die, but not anymore
Now I'm trying to be but old hearts won't let me sleep. I hear them in the floor

Standing at the altar with your leather jacket on
Fucked up on some new pills, got you feeling twenty-one
My friends are always pissed off, all your friends dance just for fun

I ain't in your crystal ball

I won't be here for that hangover, but I'll come running to raise a glass
Where'd I get my nerve? Oh, I thought you'd never ask
We clean the slate just to write mistakes, an old flame you can't blowout
You filled the cup, you picked me up, now you've got to put me down
Oh, now you've got to put me down
