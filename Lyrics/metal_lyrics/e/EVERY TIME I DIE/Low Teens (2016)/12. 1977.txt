Melt the glaciers inside my veins
Thaw my eyes, crack the glaze
Trapped under ice at a fathomless depth
But I know I exist I can see my breath

Come up to the surface, the ice age has passed
Hallelujah, it is over at last
A new day will follow a nuclear blast
Hallelujah, it is over at last

Crossed the great divide
To sleep where most would die
I'm on the lam for a fire theft
I wasn't here, we never met

Our shadows spread forever but they don't weigh anything
Shake it off
I can't ever go back but I will take it when I leave
Shake it off
I'll be waiting with a suitcase when the devil comes for me. Shake it off

One if by land, two if by sea
Life isn't ours, we are property of life
Life isn't ours, we are property of life
So, take what you can when you can while you can

Stare at the sun
Look directly into the sun
Stare at the sun
Look directly into the sun
It's over at last
