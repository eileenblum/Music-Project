[feat. Brendan Urie]I brought a rumor when I came down from the mountain
That spread quicker than the fire in your eyes
Heaven won't let me in, I took my medicine
Salt water couldn't quench my thirst at the fountain

Burn slow, there's no rush
You're right, always right

I want oblivion all the time
I want oblivion all the time
Mindless son of the eternal shine
Mindless son of the eternal shine

It snuck up like a desert wind
I got a feeling I won't feel again
When faith abandons me
I hope it does it honestly

I still howl like an animal in the darkness
And I'm reminded by the blood on my clothes
I can't stand what I've become
I'm shivering to spite the sun
We come together and were overwhelmed by the loneliness

I want oblivion all the time
I want oblivion all the time
I want oblivion all the time
I want oblivion...

[Brendan Urie]
Burn slow, there's no rush
You're right, always right

I thought I settled my debts that night on the ride home
But I have still got hell to pay
