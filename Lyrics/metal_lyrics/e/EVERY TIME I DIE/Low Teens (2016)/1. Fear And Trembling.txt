[feat. Tim Singer]Though it may haunt us
And break our hearts
Death cannot tear us apart

I'll wait for an omen
A sign that I'm chosen
Then I'll crack that reaper safe with my bare hands
A trespass
My horror was holy
When I robbed two early graves I was sick with grief
Bruised deep

The desert was lonely
I either took a leap of faith or I jumped ship
I admit I offered my only just to crash those pearly gates
Hands up, hands up

Heaven's been raided
Creator, created
Heaven's been raided
Creator, created

I am sorry, it's not right
But you are mine to sacrifice
I was hopeless, I was tired
And we all kill to survive.

(I'm sorry)
Sacrifice
(I'm so sorry)
Kill to survive

I am sorry, it's not right
But you are mine to sacrifice
I was hopeless, I was tired
And we all kill to survive

Sacrifice
(I'm sorry, I'm so sorry)
Kill to survive
Sacrifice
Kill to survive

Though it may haunt us
And break our hearts

Death cannot tear us apart
