I feel alright but I'm buried alive.
Nothings healed, just covered by time.
I want to pray but I think I'm possessed.
Constant cardiac arrest.
I'm standing in the way again.
I can't see the road ahead.
I have taken too much.
Once a ladder now a crutch.
When all of it is closing in, stop fighting and hold your breath.
So much self-love, so much hate.
Fuck these people.
Fuck this place.
But to an amateur set of eyes, me and the lord look a lot alike.
I might even have a brilliant shine and the strength to make it right.
Unbroken, unscarred.
Back ain't weak, hands ain't hard.
It's the first night in town.
Our first night in town.
Rain comes down, bridge goes out.
The same way its always did.
Now that I'm yours, discover me.
Now that I'm yours, unbury me.
Now that I'm yours, amaze me.
Go ahead and save me.
Go ahead.
When all of it is closing in, stop fighting and hold your breath.
Don't take it back, you're all that I have.
A new goddess emerged from the mist and took the blade from my wrist.
Don't blink back out.
I will aimlessly wander this wasteland guided only by a sickness, not a purpose.
I can't go back to what I was: Metallica without the drugs.
A faith healer without the plant.
Theres no home for a hollow man.
