[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]Got me a voodoo doll [2x]
Untouched, I'll feel it all
Got me a voodoo doll

Show it hell, I've seen it
Take its hope when I need it
I'm breathing for it

Cut it up
I'm dislocated
I'm coming apart
Put it up to the flame
My flesh is charred
Make it feel so ashamed that I wear the mark
I will suffer if it gives you the strength to come back out
Black out

All my bad luck
Got mixed in with your blood
It poisoned our apple
My past life's contagious

Take me instead [2x]
Your place for mine [2x]

Got me a voodoo doll [2x]
Untouched I'll feel it all
Got me a voodoo doll

I'm of no consequence [2x]

The cut's infected and I cannot hunt
I am no provider
On barren land
All we do is want
The cut's infected and I cannot hunt
Bow to the great divider
We scattered her
All we do is want

Everything's coming up roses
Are we expected to feast on a flower?
Everything's coming up roses [2x]
