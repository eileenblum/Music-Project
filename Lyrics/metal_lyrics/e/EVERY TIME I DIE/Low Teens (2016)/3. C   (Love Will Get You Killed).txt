Girl, what are you scared of?
All will be lost anyway.
I see no good reason to wait.
I will meet you.

There's a light where you go.

Don't let a missed exit haunt you.
There will be no air to breathe
A helplessness like you would not believe.
I won't blame you.

There's a light where she goes.
All is right where she goes.

Stay if you think we could pull through
My curse is the strongest there is
And karma collects what is his.

I try to plead with your machines.
I'm at the feet of your machines.
Tell me anything at all.

If it's a false alarm then forget what I said.
If the snake won't bite then I take it all back.
If there's wine in that bottle then bring me a glass.
I'll eat crow, it don't taste so bad.

I try to plead with your machines.
I'm at the feet of your machines.
Tell me anything at all.

The sun is out. Out cold.

When everybody gets a universe they do what they want.
I'm gonna need another universe, I tore mine apart.

When everybody gets a universe they can do what they want.
I tore mine apart. I tore mine apart.

Tried to speak to machines.
Tried to plead with machines.
Pull me from the ledge, I hear them. They're praying
