you'd better shove another piece of what's left into your mouth while the gettin' is good. because you know the highs are running low, and every new is getting old.
lord, I've been down since you've been seeing another boy.
me and my girl are gonna smoke the cigarettes that we find in another man's tray. we're gonna pick all the meat from the big city bones because the hot is getting cold.
lord, I'm not proud. keep you chin up the water will boil, the comet will come for us all. so make amends with anything you've ever loved and open your arms to the swarm.
we have salted the earth. raid hell. raid hell.
you'd better drink up, get your sorrows in, because we're coming upon where the ending begins. the nickel city's new church says "no one allowed" since all the lights are going out. the end is near. I will be delivered. we've filled our bellies with so much repulsive flair I'll explode if I'm not forgiven.
make amends with anything you've ever loved and open your arms to the swarm.
we have salted the earth. raid hell. raid hell.
you'd better get it while the gettin' is good, corner boy. you know the highs are running low. you'd better shove another piece of what is left into your mouth. we need to learn to go without.
there is no plan for the dutiful. we dried the country making room for our grave. but my time is sure taking it's time running out.
