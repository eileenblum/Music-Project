sound the bells and take to the streets in arms.
we're descending fast, a pox on your house of cards.
dry your eyes, your daughters have lost their faith and started feeding upon the bait that we wear on our sleeve.
promise us you won't tell the public the fury with which we despoil.
I've got a wife and kids and a hybrid car. I've got a good life and I can't risk losing.
if you can keep it a secret then me and the boys will bring pale hell to this town.
we're trouble bound and we summon the devil electric.
prey on the faint of heart.
we sing praises of the rebels who went by the book.
gravitate to teenagers artlessness' and sing it aloud.
the content is trivial. its pillow talk is plagiarized by the gadgets of lust.
just go to sleep, leave the gestures and customs to us.
cry fraud and let play the anthem of ear. cry fraud and let play the anthem of war
boys stand your ground. keep the delicate fingers but wrath in your white knuckled grip.
the film is loaded and it's aimed at the whites in their eyes.
you put out to get in. and we slipped right past the guards in the belly of a horse.
we sunk our fangs into the pulp of a desperate angst. we're powerless just until we're invited inside.
if you can keep it a secret then me and the boys will bring pale hell to this town.
we're trouble bound and we summon the devil electric.
prey on the faint of heart. we owe thanks to the revels who went by the book.
don't give up the ship. we'd rather sink than admit it. don't give up the ship.
we only have one night in town.
