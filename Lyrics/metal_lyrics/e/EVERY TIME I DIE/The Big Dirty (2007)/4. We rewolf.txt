turn the lights off, turn the lights off, your daddy better lock up his girls.
say a prayer boy, call on the cross because you ain't got no more when the music comes on.
board up the doors and windows and keep your crying under your breath.
I smell a drop of beer in a ten gallon tank and I'm moving in for the kill.
yea. in the wild kingdom you don't live until you're ready to die.
which one of you sons of bitches is gonna make me feel alive?
which one of you motherfuckers is gonna get inside me heart (attack)?
it's a full moon, denim is tight, and my flannel shirt is freaking out.
run for your life, cover your eyes, I don't want you to see me party this hard.
I've got a bone to pick with the morning sun and the first last call but I didn't put my hair in a pony tail for nothing, so if I'm going home alone I ain't going at all.
yea. I'm the wild kingdom you don't live until you're ready to die.
which one of you sons of bitches is gonna make me feel alive?
which one of you motherfuckers if gonna get inside my heart?
is gonna give me a heart attack?
look away it's too much to bear.
I've been bitten by the party animal.
save yourself.
save yourself.
tell my baby that I love her so.
don't cry. don't cry.

to where are you supposed to escape, from the creature is lurking inside of you?
