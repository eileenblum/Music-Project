we're making habits out of vanities and gospel for the stalls. the less you breathe the more you see of it all.
the lions share is courting the teen one hand holds them back while the other is holding me. we don't connect though we're both disconnected.
oh, oh yea we're so in love or else we're waving unloaded guns in the air. but it's the same thing ain't it?
I'm only here to give you someone to leave when you get bored but the first mistake so good it'll only ensure another.
oh, oh yea you look so good or you're just saving your flaws for the tight lipped lover. it's the same thing, ain't it?
we're lost.
profound.
and we are bound by the secrets we keep from each other.
pick up your heels or dig them in. it don't matter when the void is ravenous.
it's too late for us now anyway. it's too late for us now.
this confession is a lost cause- cause we got dead before we arrive.
we're making habits out of vanities and gospel for the stalls.
so grab your old lady and dance into the breach. yea lets dance one more time into the breach.
oh, oh yea we're so in love or else we're just waving unloaded guns into the air. but it's the same thing ain't it?
divine light speaks from a severed wire, so we hit the town like our parachutes failed.
we're lost.
profound.
and we are bound by the same dichotomy.
