oh lord, I am saved. judge says I'm fit to swing. 'bout time, I have prayed
my woman just might wear my ring.
oh you know I'm no good. you know I'm no good at court ordered goodbyes
but when I'm gone you'll see I'll be a better man yet. for the dispossessed get taken back into your arms
better keep me close to your heart. you'd better keep me close to your heart.
the divine had me cornered in a storm and let me walk out the front door at the scene of the crime.
hang 'em high. keep your vows brief
let him swing. make his swindle an art.
and if you still believe that men guilty of love can survive, then hang 'em high or not at all
oh you know it gets hard. it just gets so hard going limp in your arms.
I am clutching a smoking gun. there's no chance of me walking out of here alive.
this is all very literal. I can't bring myself around to write an excuse this time.
we're liberated by the hearts that imprison us. we're take hostage by the ones we break
throw the book.
you had me strung up by the tail and you put me back.
hang 'em high. keep your vows brief. let 'em swing.make his swindle an art.
and if you still believe that men guilty of love can survive, then hang 'em high or not at all.
where did you get the privilege to pardon me?
