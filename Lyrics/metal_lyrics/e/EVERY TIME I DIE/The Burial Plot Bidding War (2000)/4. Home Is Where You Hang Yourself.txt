sign my farewell with the chimes of clock radios 7a.m. sun reveals a failed 
cherubim dangling from the rafters like a sentimental ghost floating midway 
between the curse of the sky and you this noose carries what atrophied wings 
can't don't you want me disenchanted a deader shade of sorry buried from the 
neck up in a slipknot dragging my feet through the dead air suspended a 
fallen chair length from the ground when you found me when they finally 
found me this halo fit my throat I am your contorted angel writhing at a 
loss for wings swelled tongues tell of brighter eyes a severed spine of 
better days like the deafened clicks of a blue lipped off the beat pendulum 
I just wanted to be something more than enough of my God I don't think I'm 
breathing Jesus Christ when did I stop breathing oh my God I can't hear 
myself breathing this is all I know of flying my eyes set on you like stains 
in memory of romance
