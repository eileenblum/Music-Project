A proud hush had taken hold and you worshipped at its feet, but calm was
not long for this world. I took up arms and you begged I let it be, but reason
don't live here no more. Step aside, It's not worth your life. What is this
"peace" that you sneak off to at night? What sacred spot will I be buried in
when I have covered every inch of land in terribleness? I have declared a war
on the silence before the storm. Don't stop to think. Just end all good things
while you can. Ruin all the love that you have or that god damned thing is
bound to come back. In spades. Step aside, it's not worth your life. I am the
fear that drags you into the light. I've covered every inch of land in
terribleness by leading a war on the silence before the storm. Take the
stillness out back and put it on its knees. Stop your crying, who do you love
anyway? Who do you love? What does he have that I don't except you?
