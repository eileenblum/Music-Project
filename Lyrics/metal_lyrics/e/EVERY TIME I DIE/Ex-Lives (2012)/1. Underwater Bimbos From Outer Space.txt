I want to be dead with my friends.
I want to be dead with my friends.
A wide eyed, brilliant, dynamic rest.
I want to be dead with my friends.
I want to be dead with my friends.
Where the iron sharpens the iron.
Where the iron sharpens the iron.
Where the iron sharpens the iron
sharpens the iron.

I want to be dead with my friends.
I want to be dead with my friends. 
A vulgar, loud, unforgettable end.
I want to be dead with my friends.
I want to be dead with my friends.

Let boredom cease the beating of our purple hearts.
Against this, even gods fight violently in vein.
What chance could we have stood?
We were the last of the lost,
But now we are the first of the fashionably late.

Loved ones decompose
And you'll gather 'round the bones.
But most of us are wholly ghost.
All of us were wholly ghost.
[x2]

We made the scene when we made a scene,
And though it was brief, it meant everything.
Oh what a pity, now they're bound to make us saints
Oh what a pity, now they're bound to make us saints.

Against this, even boys fight violently in vein.
What chance could we have stood?
We were the last of the lost,
But now we are the first of the fashionably late.

I refuse to be the only man
Put to rest in a mass grave.
I refuse to be the only man
Put to rest in a mass grave.
I refuse to be the only man
Put to rest in a mass grave.

You were all there with me.
You were all there with me.
You were all there with me.
