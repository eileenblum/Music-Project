I'd rather beg your forgivenessÂ 
Than solicit permission
I'd rather know that it broke your heart
Than doubt that it will

Every time we divide
We put zeroes under the line Â 
And we publish it as our proof
That nothingness is divine

I can't find a way to grind your heart to a halt
It was probably just the wind
I don't ruin you like I did.

I would rather be a jealous man
Than an off-duty cop
I try to be a babe-in-arms,
Not a bull in a china shop
A sheep in wolfs clothes

I'm a hangman without a rope.
Who am I trying to kid?
I don't ruin you like I did.

When you live your life being scared to death
Then you might as well be wounded.
You spend your nights being short of breath
I keep these shadows moving

(If only you could see me now.)
If you could only see meÂ now
I'll take what I can get even if it's a restraining orders.

Hold
Your
Fire

What do you take me for?
What do you take me for?
Did you think I could garner attention with tact?
What do you take me for?

What am I trying to prove?
What have I done to you?
Left at the altar and asked for a bed.
What did I expect you to do?

Give me an audience
Black loveless eyes
I have hundreds of costumes, but not one disguise.

Places everyone
Fangs out

I'd rather beg your forgivenessÂ 
Than solicit permission
I'd rather know that it broke your heart
Than doubt that it will

I would rather be a jealous man
Than an off-duty cop
I try to be a babe-in-arms.
Not a bull in a china shop

I will seeÂ 
You in the dark
I will seeÂ 
You in the dark

Castrated stranger with candy hearts.
