You got me right where you wanted me.
So what do we do if I canât hold this pose for too long.
So we shoot again, or does this whole operation shut down and we go back to the board.
I practiced all my lines, oh yea Iâd feed every child in the world.
But itâs a one night stand baby.
We gotta keep on.
If you got it all then you got it right.
Iâm gonna do what you say and get way out of line.
Nobodyâs gonna stop me now.
Itâs not how it looks unless you say nothing
We all agree this proposalâs been sentenced to death.
Are we baiting the right hook to get your attention.
The media needs another blackout.
Weâve been calling.
Flooding hotlines.
Weâve applied mascara to the radio but thatâs just a quick fix and we need a little more.
Does it matter to you at all.
Are you listening or have you tuned out.
Weâve gotta get it together.
But first we drink and we take it all apart.
Everywhere we go weâre the local boys and weâre back in town.
Well thatâs the way it is.

It breaks my heart.
Weâve applied mascara to the radio, but thatâs just a quick fix and we need a little more.
Does it matter to you at all.
Are you listening or have you tuned out.
Get by.
Get gone.
Get high.
Get wronged.
