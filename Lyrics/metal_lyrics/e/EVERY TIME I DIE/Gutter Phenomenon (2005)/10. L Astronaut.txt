Drifting on rescue, parade through the town square.
Waving to the families of victims of the flood.
Straddling the front door of a catholic orphanage.

I decorated it myself.
Thank you, youâre too much.
Honestly, it was nothing.

We should all just thank god Iâm alive.
Donât shout I get a little confused sometimes.
I canât make out a word youâre saying.
Iâve got a 21 gun salute playing over and over and over in my head.
Canât it wait.
Iâm on call to be somewhere.
Somewhere Iâm not.
In case the cleaning lady has found my head.

Forgive my delay lieutenant, Iâm the man the whole country requires.
Take your gun out of my mouth.
You are ruining my appetite.
Get your bear trap off of my neck.
Iâm already running late.
Youâre distress is confounding the tightrope walker.
Just so weâre clear, youâre saying weâre all lost.
Maybe Iâm wrong but werenât we just dancing.
Oh, the way that we moved had every marauder curious.
Sniffing at the trash in our shoes.
Sharpening knives on the grindstone watch gears.
I donât miss that much about anything you said.

After all, weâve never met.
Iâll get it right, and stick my tongue down the throat of the moon.
