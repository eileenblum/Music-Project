Stutter step to the beat of a disparaged lover.
Dumb and pulsing we've become.
The bedroom door is an old black lung.
It's arrhythmic.
Uninviting and pliable.
With the noble irreverence of shrapnel she came for us.
Bore into our heads and found thoughtlessness.
Never minded the faithless courage of shame or the bravery of oblivion.
I'm on her mind, I'm never coming back.

If two timing is what it takes, then we both know one take is all we need
We're not equipped to stay, unloved,
But its all we've got and we're not at all alright.
Come on baby and give me the creeps.
Either you and I or both must go.
Either you and I or both must go.
I'm on her mind I'm never coming back.
If two timing is what it takes then we both know one take is all we need
We're not equipped to stay, unloved,
But its all we've got and we're not at all alright.
Theres no difference between being holy and alone.

That's why I'm eagerly fleeing the scene.
Lead footed.
Baby return the favor and leave somebody you love.
If they come back they're drunk and they're lonely.
We all get lonely.
God forbid we indulge when at sea.
Just the tempest, the temptress and me.
Naturally bored thriller.
Nobody knows the trouble I've been or the exacting improvement of sin.
I'm handling myself over.
Iâm turning myself in.
War has no glory like a woman ignored.
So here's to the empires polluted with dead.
And the truckers wives who erected them.
I know the strippers real name.
Stop me if I'm wrong.
