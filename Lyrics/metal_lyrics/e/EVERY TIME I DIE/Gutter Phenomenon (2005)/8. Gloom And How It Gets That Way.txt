Pull the car over youâre frightening the kids.
What did you promise us about grinning in the rear view without your fake teeth in.
Keep your glass eye glued on the end of the highway up ahead of us.
The collision is always licking its lips.
You werenât supposed to open the door.
Just keep the plan from drifting of course.
Weâll attend to the terrified first class convinced thereâs a hoof print on the bow.
All hail the wounded heart contingents
Whoâve given us something more than faultlessness to sing about.
Long live the prosthetic live wires.
The faulty mechanism of hope has disintegrated.

Your captain nailed his feet to someone elseâs ship at the sight of me.
Do what your mother tells you and put down the sheriffâs horse.
The choir on the black box rejoiced splendidly, singing hallelujah the king is dead.
The king is dead.
