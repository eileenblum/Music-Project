Baby you got me all wrong.
And maybe Iâm not at all down and out.
Iâm high and Iâm in.
Donât you know who I am.
Iâm the jaded one with pop insensitivity.
When I finish struggling,
We can make our way to the dance floor and stand like strangers in an elevator
Stuck between stories.
I always find myself in the middle of your stories.
With the cameras as a witness I will suffer.
Everything I do is wrong.
But by god I do it right.

We donât dance no no no.
We got class.
No we donât have any fun at all.
Itâs the new style and we know it.
Weâre not stunning, weâre just stunned and weâre lying for a living.
Donât you know who I am.
Iâm the real thing with low-key sensibilities.
I donât need what Iâve got half as much as everyone covets it.
If loving me is wrong, then god damn you do it right, it turns us on to turn you down.
