Tonight the cinema's the treatment clinic where the perverts seek the cure.
Show me the rape scene one more time for the cause.
And I promise we'll behave like perfect Christians.
We'll sing the glory of the gospel for some whiskey and a skin flick.
Hallelujah.
All rise. Hallow be my name. In this kingdom we came without calling.
Hallelujah.
The violence and the choir, the virgin and the fire. Up to her neck in tongues.
Lovely, so lovely is Ludwig Van. Electronic sonata pumped through the mud of a one-night stand.
The saints in regalia whistling while they rape. Lid clamps in vitamins.
Lift up her skirt and I'll be cured, like a junkie with a methadone addiction thinks he's clean.
I'll be cured.
Sit down and watch closely. All these whores have conceded the war.
She said, "you might be sick, but you feel alright to me."
That's enough. Turn it off. I promise I'm better. It's too much. Healed at the horror show.
