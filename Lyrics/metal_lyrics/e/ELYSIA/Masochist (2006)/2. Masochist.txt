The trap between her legs is her attention grabber.
Just an adaptation, not a reason to stab her.
But why does my mind consider this an evolutionary trait?
Why must she suffer from this fate?
I feel sedated in the frailness of her stature as I capture
the delicateness of her skin, her frailties - my sin.

Oh god she fucked me wild because I'm just a child.
I'm just a child playing a game.
I must be insane if I'm just fucking for the pain.
Why does she receive the blame if I'm just the same?
This is torture as we torch her.
As we torch her this is torture.
This is torture as we torch her.
Torture/Torch her.
How long will she put up with this?
When my kiss turns to piss?
Why do we get off to this?
This simple is not love!
Bitting, scratching, beating, choking, fucking.

A constant cycle, she takes out her aggressions
physically because she's sick of living her life
subserviently.
She bruised me when she sucked me and abused me
when she fucked me.
She bruised me when she sucked me and abused me
when she fucked me.
We all live as masochists!
We all live as sadists, it's madness.
In the midst of all of this sexual bliss affection is missed.

We all live constricted because we're addicted to
the mental pain that's inflicted.
Gratification through temptation and its sensation.
Incapable of relations, we create false elations.
Someone pays for this terrible.
The pain becomes unbearable hard.
We're all full of these scars.
I'll end the hurt with glass shards.
I'll bleed it dry as I gouge my eyes.
I'll bleed it dry as I gouge my eyes.
I'll cut away the pain I despise.
I'll cut away the pain I despise.

Never will I live for sex, pain and lies.
Never will I live for sex, pain and lies.
Never will I hurt from the plague of sex and lies.
Never will I live for pleasure and its lies.
Never will I live for disgust, filth, and lies.
Never will I hurt from you and your lies!
