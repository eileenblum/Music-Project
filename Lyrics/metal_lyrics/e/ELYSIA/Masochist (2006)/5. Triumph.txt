My thumbs are in your eyes and they keep fucking pushing

there's a leach on my neck
the fangs sink into my hips
I burnt alive and the flames were the only warmth you ever showed me.

well tonight I set your bed aflame
I live to watch you burn

face your punishment cause there is no forgiveness
I will watch your tortured existence

I live to watch you burn

your misery will take a blade to your skin
I'll be there to guide you through mutilation
decapitation

from the ground I can touch the sky
despite this fight I will never die

I hope you get FUCKED DEAD

this is hell, your severed body's left to dwell
not a trick just a whore choking on a dick
your desires led to me building fires
in your home, you shouldn't sleep alone

I fucking triumph
SUCK ON THAT
