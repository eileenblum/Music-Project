75 percent approve of this torment, a cement wall so aliens will stop their crawl, so tall they can't climb above.
Shove them back, there's no love here.
Because our fears endless years of tears will fall upon us.

Building a wall to keep them out?
I'm highly in doubt.
More like building a wall to keep us in because we're still judging by skin and so-called "moralists" are blind of the sin.

How can God justify this?
Created to exist not to be dismissed into an abyss of our ignorance.
The wickedness is knowing of their gratefulness.
Suppressing as this nation is regressing.
Stuck in reverse can we inverse this curse?

My family is not accepted in land that was once there's before they were redirected, disrespected, rejected, and infected, dissected to be contrived.
Manifest Destiny has survived and is being revived.
In a nation of all this evil I demand an upheaval!
If this wall was built before I was born I wouldn't even be alive to mourn.
