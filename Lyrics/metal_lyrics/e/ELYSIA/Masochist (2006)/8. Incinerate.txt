YOWWWWWWWWWWwwwwww

In the end you will be laid to rest where you belong
Bathed in the flames
For your hatred, your ignorance
You're the symbol of masculinity, a true King Kong

Eeeeeeee

I WILL STAND UP FOR THOSE WHO'VE SUFFERED [x6]
I will stand up for those who have suffered
Been crucified by your insecurities [x2]

You cant say what love is
When you're castrated!

FUCKERS

HATCHETS CASTRATING THE FUCKERS

THIS VOICE!
That I've been given
I will use to crush bigotry
And defeat intolerance!
With bodies ablaze, bodies ablaze
MOTHERFUCKER
Sadly no ones,
There to push you in the flames
So throw another stick in...

And I swear
With every ounce of strength I have
I WILL BURN YOU ALIVE

In the sticks lays your worthless body
Screaming
Keep fucking screaming

And with your eyeballs boiling...

WHO'S THE FUCKING FAGGOT NOW
