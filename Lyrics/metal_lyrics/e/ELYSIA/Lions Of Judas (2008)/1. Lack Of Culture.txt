American culture doesn't even exist at all
When what we read, watch, and listen to is controlled by corporations
Independent forms of art will never be accessible to those who don't question (why dullness is shoved down our throats and how we are unable to live free without the ability to expand our minds.)
Free from censorship and cultural design
Every aspect of our limited culture was designed to control and put our minds on patrol

Your magazines, books and CDs are worthless and were created by uninspired people to be unstimulating and bore you into submission
Where your only real stimulates serve to numb the pain of capitalist rule.

American culture, or lack thereof
