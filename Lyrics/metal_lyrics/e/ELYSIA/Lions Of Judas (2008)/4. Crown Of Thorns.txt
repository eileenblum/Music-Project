How long will our emperor wear the crown of thorns?
As long as he who sits upon the throne wears horns
How long will it be till we reclaim the throne?
As long as love remains cold like stone.

There is no escape from the chains of oppression
No hope of light outside the walls of depression
The highest peak was overcome by the flood of kings
The final grains of salt, stolen on vulture wings

To those adrift who can't find shore, no land is worth searching for
To those lost who can't find home, no shelter will make you feel less alone.

Heaven's sky will rain
Reign black
Heaven's sky will forever reign black as the notion it's not hours to take back
The power has always been  ours!

When your mind is darkened with doubt, you can't find a way out
When your greatest sea droughts, there's no way out.

Defend the crown
the power belongs to free minds, not those who lead the blind
Defend the crown

But the problem is there's no way out
No way out
