Grim heart
No love, no life, no light
Dismal days  fade
Angel take  flight

Through the hurt she takes and her heartbreaks
She must realize, she is the power of a thousand earthquakes.

Awake
Extinguish t he torch of two thousand years oppression, which burns with her
depression
Cast its remains to the void
Her chains are destroyed
Devour t he  wretched in their own scorn
At last love is reborn
Strolling alone at night in fear, like her freedom disappeared
Devour the swine in their own scorn
At last love is reborn

I will always be there to comfort you, to understand you, and love you
At last love is reborn.
