I once felt your embrace shroud me in bright days, I spent in ignorance, bathed in golden sunrays
But with every light comes a dark gloom, and i sensed cold under the silver glow of the moon
There's no second coming
No hope at all
God watches us crawl and will watch humanity fall.

There's no greater good or strength to gain from a diabetic son
So why has god given my family more than one?

You wouldn't seek answers from ghosts of shepherds
So why are we speaking to ghosts, speaking to clouds, and burying doubt into the conformity of crowds?
I'd rather be in this cold world, all alone than to feel the warmth of drones worshiping the throne.
