Another's reality exhausted all your dreams
I'll scatter your ashes on television screens
Quit living on the edge of your seat when you can live soaring off your feet

Stress, take time to shake it off
Lethargic, gotta  work it off.

(Are you dipping your hands  in the box of needles)

Cause once you do, you can't take it back
Your hands will ache  till you  can't grasp the fact
That once you do, you can't take it back
Too numb to itch because your hope turned black

The scenes change but life stays the same
At the crown of t he flame you're still just a name
Quit living chained to your seat when you can break free and flourish on your feet.

Betrayer, turn it off
They wanna kill us off.

Are you dipping your hand in the box of needles?
Cause once you do, nothing stays gold
Strangers are dangers for you to extol
You sold your heart to the beast ablaze
There's no hope for better days.

No faith and no hope.

Mindless
Gutless
Heartless
Loveless
