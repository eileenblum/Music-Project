No strength to carry on, carry me, carry me
I feel your hand slipping and it's scaring me
All my dreams have died
Push mountains and I'll sing into their valleys and subside

Difference is yet to hold hands
While we swim like fish and fly like birds, we are still yet to hold hands
Our greatness was gathered into an oasis
Which the plagues stirred t he sands and swarmed us in it's barren lands.

The sea of tears swallowed us in its tide
Facing death, no reason to go on
No one tried
You were my waking breath
you were my hope of those facing death

No strength to carry on, carry me, carry me
I feel your hand slipping and it's scaring me
All my dreams have died
Push mountains and I'll sink into their valleys and subside

I am withering life
Angel carry me through trauma and strife
For i am dying faith in love, hope, and life
Carry me in the comfort of angelic wings
I've spent seasons of no springs.

I hope you find new home in dead dreams
Where in fading heart, new light gleams
For when there i s no light, one can't live dreams
The plague of insects swallowed our last screams.

There's no savior in you
There's no savior in me
There's no savior in anything.

There's no savior.
