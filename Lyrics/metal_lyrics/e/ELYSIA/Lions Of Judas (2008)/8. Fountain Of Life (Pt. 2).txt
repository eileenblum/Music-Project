As long as the fountain of life can't flow, no man will ever know  what it's like to have to struggle through life in constant strife.

Where they feel superior and empowered, i feel humbled
And where they see failure and weakness, I see beauty and grace through the bleakness

I will fight for you when their power strikes you down
When on your back and no help's around
When your courage has been so degraded, no hope is found.

Our sisters aren't free
