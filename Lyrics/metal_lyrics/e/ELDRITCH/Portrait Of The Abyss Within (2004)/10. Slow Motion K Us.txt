[Lyrics: Terence Holler, Music: Eugene Simone]

Fog In The Sky, Sand In The Eyes, An Evil Dance
Nowhere To Go, Nowhere To Flow, No Second Chance
People That Come, People That Go, No Permanence
Numerous Times, We Need To Try, Perseverance

I Won't Survive Another Day, I Won't Survive Another
Don't Wanna Waste Another Day, Don't Wanna Waste Another
I Won't Survive Another Day, I Won't Survive Another
We Should Try To Change The Rhythm Need To Calm It Down

Wicked Desire, Sex In Our Minds, Horniness
Walking Too Fast, Eating Too Fast, Dying Young
"Big Men" Pollute, "Big Men" Corrupt, Bringing Death
Children That Cry, Children That Shoot, What Is This?

I Won't Survive Another Day, I Won't Survive Another
Don't Wanna Waste Another Day, Don't Wanna Waste Another
I Won't Survive Another Day, I Won't Survive Another
We Should Try To Change The Rhythm Need To Calm It Down

Slow The Rhythm Hold Your Horses
Slow The Rhythm Give A Chance To Your Breath
Slow The Rhythm Hold Your Horses
Slow The Rhythm Give A Chance To Your Breath

The Tic-Tac Is Melting Away
No More Rushing
There Ain't No Time Left To Pray
No Forgiving...

I Won't Survive Another Day, I Won't Survive Another
Don't Wanna Waste Another Day, Don't Wanna Waste Another
I Won't Survive Another Day, I Won't Survive Another
We Should Try To Change The Rhythm Need To Calm It Down

Slow The Rhythm Hold Your Horses
Slow The Rhythm Give A Chance To Your Breath
Slow The Rhythm Hold Your Horses
Slow The Rhythm Give A Chance To Your Breath
