[Lyrics: Terence Holler, Music: Eugene Simone]

Like A Swim Through Troubled Waters
Like A Picnic In The Dark
Like A Half Step Away From The Border
Like A Rose Without A Thorn
When I Feel She's Getting Closer
Something Wicked Falls Straight On My Head

Dancing All The Night Alone
Dancing All Alone
Dancing 'Til The Break Of Dawn
Dancing All Alone
Erase My Sins And Lay Your Hands On Me...

Never Had The Face To Call Her
Never Found The Reason To...
Never Meant To Hit Her Harder
I Doubt I Ever Wanted To...
But When I Felt She's Getting Closer
Something Crooked Fell Right On My Head

Dancing All The Night Alone
Dancing All Alone
Dancing 'Til The Break Of Dawn
Dancing All Alone
Erase My Sins And Lay Your Hands On Me...

Dancing All The Night Alone
Dancing All Alone
Dancing 'Til The Break Of Dawn
Dancing All Alone
Erase My Sins And Lay Your Hands On Me...
Dancing All The Night Alone
Dancing All Alone
Dancing 'Til The Break Of Dawn
Dancing All Alone
Erase My Sins And Lay Your Hands On Me...
