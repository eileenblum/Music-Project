[Lyrics: Terence Holler, Music: Eugene Simone]

There Ain't No Oxygen For Me
No More Left To Breathe
No Second Chances, Only Dreams
No Overtime To Play
Since That Day Has Come
There Is Something In My Body
That Is Growing Like A Fire Inside
Since That Day Has Come
There Is Something That's Stressing
My Resistence To Swim Against The Tide

Faithless,
The More Things Change, The More I'm Faithless
A Solution Needs To Be Found
A Solution For My Weakness
A Blindfolded Walk On Through
Bridges Of Sand
A Spark In The Darkness Of This Wasteland...

Walking On Bridges Of Sand
Falling Into Nowhere
Walking On Bridges Of Sand
Falling Into Nowhere

Faithless
The More Things Change, The More I'm Faithless
A Solution Needs To Be Found
A Solution For My Weakness
A Blindfolded Walk On Through
Bridges Of Sand
A Spark In The Darkness Of This Wasteland...

Walking On Bridges Of Sand
Falling Into Nowhere
Walking On Bridges Of Sand
Falling Into Nowhere
