[Lyrics: Terence Holler, Music: Eugene Simone]

Getting Used To Running Against The Wind
Haven't Got The Spirit By My Side
Getting Used To Living Alone
With Whom I'd Ever Share The Bone?

Now I Feel The World
I Feel The World
I Feel The World Apart
I Feel The World, I Feel The World
I Feel The World Apart

Strangled By The Rhythm Of These Days
Dodging Words That Would Cut Me Like A Knife
Getting Used To Making A Stand
Who's Gonna Ever Take My Hand?

Now I Feel The World
I Feel The World
I Feel The World Apart
I Feel The World, I Feel The World
I Feel The World Apart
I Feel The World, I Feel The World
I Feel The World Apart
I Feel The World, I Feel The World
I Feel The World Apart
I Feel The World. I Feel The World
I Feel The World Apart

Now I Feel The World
I Feel The World
I Feel The World Apart
I Feel The World, I Feel The World
I Feel The World Apart
I Feel The World, I Feel The World
I Feel The World Apart
I Feel The World, I Feel The World
I Feel The World Apart
