[Lyrics: Terence Holler, Music: Eugene Simone]

How Can You Buy
All The Shit That He Is Selling You Now?
How Can You Take
All The Words When None Of Them Are True?

And When You Cry
No One Will Give You Consolation
And When You Pay
I'll Be There Saying: "I Told You"

You've Got To Pay Your Dues Now
You've Got To Face Your Future
You've Got To Pay Your Dues Now
You've Got To Face Your Future

It's Time To Stay
And Take It To The End Don't Fear
I'll Laugh, You'll Cry,
This Is The Way Things Go Now

You've Got To Pay Your Dues Now
You've Got To Face Your Future
You've Got To Pay Your Dues Now
You've Got To Face Your Future
You've Got To Pay Your Dues Now
You've Got To Face Your Future
You've Got To Pay Your Dues Now
You've Got To Face Your Future

How Could You Buy
All The Shit He Spread On Your Face Now?
How Could You Take
All Those Words When You Knew They Weren't True?

You've Got To Pay Your Dues Now
You've Got To Face Your Future
You've Got To Pay Your Dues Now
You've Got To Face Your Future
You've Got To Pay Your Dues Now
You've Got To Face Your Future
You've Got To Pay Your Dues Now
You've Got To Face Your Future
