[Lyrics: Terence Holler, Music: Eugene Simone]

God Will Hate Me Every Day
For What I'm Doing For What I Say
Lived A Lifetime In The Mud
Like A Torture, Like A Flood

I'm Drowning Every Day
I Won't Let Go
I'm Drowning Every Night
I Won't Let Go
I Won't Let...

People Hate Me I Don't Care
Some Avoid Me, It's Not Fair
No Direction Or Place To Go
Now I'm Losing My Self Control

I'm Drowning Every Day
I Won't Let Go
I'm Drowning Every Night
I Won't Let Go
I Won't Let Go
I Won't Let... Go!

It's Finally Over I'll Close My Eyes
Close The Curtain No More Show Now
No More Breathing, No More Air
I'm Too Exhausted To Despair

I'm Drowning Every Day
I Won't Let Go
I'm Drowning Every Night
I Won't Let Go
I'm Drowning Every Day
I Won't Let Go
I'm Drowning Every Night
I Won't Let Go
I'm Drowning Every Day
(Won't Let Go, Won't Let Go)
I Won't Let Go
(Won't Let Go, Won't Let Go)
I'm Drowning Every Night
(Won't Let Go, Won't Let Go)
I Won't Let Go
(Won't Let Go, Won't Let Go)
I Won't Let Go!!!
