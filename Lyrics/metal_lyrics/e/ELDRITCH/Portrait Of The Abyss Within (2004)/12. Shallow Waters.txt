[Bonus Track]

[Lyrics: Terence Holler, Music: Eugene Simone]

You Lost Control, You Lost Your Faith
You Need To Be Suppressed In Time
The Way You Live, The Way You Talk
The Hearts You Broke, The Words You Spoke

Don't Follow, Don't Follow
Don't Follow, Don't Follow...

Your Dangerous Ways, Torn Me Again
This Strengthless Heart Is Petrifying...
Your Dangerous Ways, Torn Me Again
This Strengthless Heart Is Petrifying...

You're Sinking, You're Drowning Again
In Shallow Waters
You're Sinking, You're Drowning Again
In Shallow Waters
You're Sinking, You're Drowning Again
In Shallow Waters
You're Sinking, You're Drowning Again
In Shallow Waters

Your Dangerous Ways, Torn Me Again
This Strengthless Heart Is Petrifying...
Your Dangerous Ways, Torn Me Again
This Strengthless Heart Is Petrifying...

You're Sinking, You're Drowning Again
In Shallow Waters
You're Sinking, You're Drowning Again
In Shallow Waters
You're Sinking, You're Drowning Again
In Shallow Waters
You're Sinking, You're Drowning Again
In Shallow Waters
