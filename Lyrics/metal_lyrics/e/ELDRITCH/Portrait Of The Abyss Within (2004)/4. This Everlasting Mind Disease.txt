[Lyrics: Terence Holler, Music: Eugene Simone]

I've Been Too Silent,
Here Waiting For Something New
I've Changed My Way Of Living,
No More Giving, I Gave It All
I Kept My Faith And Dreaming,
No Complaining, Here I Am
So Many Colors Changing,
The Most Are Fading Into Grey

My Life's Like A Broken TV
Colors, Stripes And Nothing To See

This Everlasting Mind Disease
It Ain't No Good For Me
The Deepest Toil And Inner Pain
A Useless Agony

Now Times Are Changing,
Consuming A Reaction
Many Days Of Bleeding,
You Treated Me Like A Stepping Stone
Emptiness And Daydreaming
Still Believing In A Chance
Too Many Colors Changing,
Feeling Dizzy, I See Black

My Life's Like A Broken TV
Colors, Stripes And Nothing To See

This Everlasting Mind Disease
It Ain't No Good For Me
The Deepest Toil And Inner Pain
A Useless Agony
This Everlasting Mind Disease
It Ain't No Good For Me
The Deepest Toil And Inner Pain
A Useless Agony

My Life's Like A Broken TV
Colors, Stripes And Nothing To See

This Everlasting Mind Disease
It Ain't No Good For Me
The Deepest Toil And Inner Pain
A Useless Agony
This Everlasting Mind Disease
It Ain't No Good For Me
The Deepest Toil And Inner Pain
A Useless Agony
