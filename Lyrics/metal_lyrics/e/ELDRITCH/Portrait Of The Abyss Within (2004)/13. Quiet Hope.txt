[Bonus Track]

[Lyrics &amp; Music: Eldritch]

Legends To Relieve Poverty And Pain Are Lost In Time
Evil Will Quit The Fight
So Many Men Believe Living On Earth Is The Price
Of A Never Fading Light

We're Inclined To The Divine
Humans Believe But Don't Want To Die
Ingenuous Minds Captured By
Rites Of Amazing Emptiness

Suffering Is Rewarded Prostation Appreciated
Justice Love And Peace Guarantees
Adding Some More Prayers For What Is Done
Devotion's Never Enough
When The Time Has Come Life's Begun

We're Inclined To The Divine
Humans Believe But Don't Want To Die
Ingenuous Minds Captured By
Rites Of Amazing Emptiness

Huge Deception
By Cults And Churches
Growing Wealthy...

We're Inclined To The Divine
Humans Believe But Don't Want To Die
Ingenuous Minds Captured By
Rites Of Amazing Emptiness

Feeling Of Love And Respect
You Can Never Learn
If Not Spontaneously Felt!
You'd Better Keep Tight What You Have Inside...
