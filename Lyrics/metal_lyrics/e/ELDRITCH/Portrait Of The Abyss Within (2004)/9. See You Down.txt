[Lyrics: Terence Holler, Music: Eugene Simone]

I Closed My Eyes But You're Still Here
It Was Wasted Time And Wasted Breath

Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...

Someone Said I'm Wrong Again
All I Need Is To Rid This Filth

Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...

I've Tried So Hard To Erase Your Face From My Mind
I've Tried So Hard To Confine You Away From Me
Far Away... So Far Away... So Far... Away... Down

I Don't Want To See You Down
Down On Me Don't Lean On Me...

Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
Don't Wanna See You Down...
