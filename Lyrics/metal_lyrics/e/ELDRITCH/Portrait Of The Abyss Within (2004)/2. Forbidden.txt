[Lyrics: Terence Holler, Music: Eugene Simone]

She Will Try Again To Bring You Under This Ground
All The Words I Spend Fade Away With No Sound
You Have Lost Your Face You've Got No Ambitions
In Her Wicked Games You Became The Main Star

She Took Your Breath Away
Taking You Under
She Took Your Heart Away
Please Don't Believe Her Now

Forbidden Skies Surround You
Skies Are Turning Red
Forbidden Dreams Invade You
Dreams Will Turn You Dead

You Fell In Love Again And This Is Forbidden
She'll Tear Your Soul And Then Throw It In The Garbage
Try To Comprehend That You're Just "Another One"
I'll Bring You Flowers When You'll Be Six Feet Under

She Took Your Breath Away
Taking You Under
She Took Your Heart Away
Please Don't Believe Her Now

Forbidden Skies Surround You
Skies Are Turning Red
Forbidden Dreams Invade You
Dreams Will Turn You Dead

Make Sure Now You're Recovering
Make Sure Now That She'll Get Away
Make Sure Now You're Recovering
Make Sure Now That She'll Get Away

Here She Comes Again With Her Cruel Intentions
All The Things I Said Plenty Words All Wasted
Don't Come Crying To Me Cause I'll Say "I Told You"
Don't Come Lying To Me Have A Nice Day Under

She Took Your Breath Away
Taking You Under
She Took Your Heart Away
Please Don't Believe Her Now

Forbidden Skies Surround You
Skies Are Turning Red
Forbidden Dreams Invade You
Dreams Will Turn You Dead
Forbidden Skies Surround You
Skies Are Turning Red
Forbidden Dreams Invade You
Dreams Will Turn You Dead
