Escape from reality is a good medicine for my mind
There's nothing to think about in the Garden of Eden I feel fine
It takes all my energy to be able to succeed
I lie, still and kill, then I'll be ready to be the King

Maybe it is too easy, but i don't need anybody to save me
Maybe I'm busy, but everyone obeys me
To be or not to be

It's now the time to make my choice:
To be or not to be God

I wonder if I'll ever answer the question about my life
When I'm not even close to really seeing what we hide inside

Maybe it is too easy, but i don't need anybody to save me
Maybe I'm busy, but everyone obeys me
To be or not to be

It's now the time to make my choice:
To be or not to be God
