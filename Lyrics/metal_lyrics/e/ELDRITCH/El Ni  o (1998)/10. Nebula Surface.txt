[hidden track]

Ravines in front of my eyes
Downcast I look for the rise
Narrow unsteady suspended line
A hung surface spreads a hive

Gambler kills hazy hesitations
My tread is shaking from vulture warning

ThereÂs a twilight above this entry way
let the mirthless epilogue slowly fall
trusty words when I fall into decay
all my fingers subside I lose control

Rustle and fog wrap my wire
Sweet painful trails remind

THEREÂS A TWILIGHT ABOVE THIS ENTRY WAY
LET THE MIRTHLESS EPILOGUE SLOWLY FALL !

Perpetual blast turning point
Sweet painful trails remind


Thanks to tanatos for sending tracks ## 9, 10 lyrics.
