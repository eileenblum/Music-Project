A furrowed face destroyed by grief
Realize this is a useless man
When you feel it is not right to insist
On the things you'd carry out without a chance
Don't loose heart El NiÃ±o is coming in....comes in

To relieve the most shooting pains
When you wish God existed and heard the prayer you may soon be dead
Don't give up El NiÃ±o is coming in

Living in all men's thoughts and failings

For you there's no prize to win
And you keep on running to the appointed place
A hurdle race in which you're first but all your rivals still breathe down your neck
Don't give up El NiÃ±o is coming in

Living in all men's thoughts and failings
