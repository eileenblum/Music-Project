Passion days I cross, growing pains... I fall
Masked faces, lonely shades... I'm guilty
Haunting call I hear, traces of my fear
Someone tries to conspire for a game

Buried old scars deny my rendered circle
Overflow, lay and wait Violator!

Carnal fold I flare, fatal sickness
I can't walk around my happiness
Praying for someone, man without a mind
Let me know how many shelters you hide

Buried old scars deny my rendered circle
Overflow, fertilizing fields of sadness
Buried old master of a clay doll theater
Overflow, lay and wait VIOLATOR!
