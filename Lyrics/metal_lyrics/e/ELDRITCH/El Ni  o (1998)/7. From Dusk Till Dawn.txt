Cruel rays of light tear the dark inside
The new day on the town invades my mind
A crowd creeps in silence, taking hold of the roads
Where I was king 'til few hours before
It breathes the pollution and pisses gray
What they call life's death compared to what Night can give us
With all Her thieves and whores
... Night can give us and always does
We are all Kings, all Queens, not slaves

From dusk till dawn
Living to shine now
Living to shine
From dusk till dawn
We shine till dawn

Now Venus is rising to the west of Void
The old day on the town is fading out
A huge power swells inside of me
as the mob of lost souls thins and turns to the cells
I watch the crowd there and feel mercy
All your dreams are nothing compared to what Night will give us
With all Her sins and love
... Night will give us a crown of thorns
We are all Kings, all Queens, not slaves

From dusk till dawn
Living to shine now
Living to shine
From dusk till dawn
We shine till dawn
