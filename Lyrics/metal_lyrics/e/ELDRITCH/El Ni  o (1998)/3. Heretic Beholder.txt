Embodying shadows, I come in your lake
Barring my dead shows, I crawl on this rendered earth
Young crystal symbol, hung on the wall
Parasite idol, virtual upstanding forge

Recall flaring light
Recall humble lurk
Recall pale mouth
Recall endless run

Acting with my lethargic impulse
Heretic beholder
Answered by barren fake reaction

Forbidden chapter, words I deny
Faithless observer, open my lonely side

Recall flaring light
Recall humble lurk
Recall pale mouth
Recall endless run

Acting with my lethargic impulse
Heretic beholder
Answered by barren fake reaction
