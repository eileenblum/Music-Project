Iâve got nothing to say
Nothing to lose
Iâm searching for my role
You seem outta my reach
Inside my world you are living
Inside my mind I was believing
This sentimental exposure
Turned out to be more than a tortureâ¦
IâVE ALWAYS HOPED LIFE COULD BE EASIER
BUT NOTHING REALLY TURNED OUT
AND IN MY WOUNDS  THE KNIFEâS GETTING DEEPER
TASTING ALL MY TEARS NOW..
Every time that I see
You walking my way
I feel like  paralyzed
No more able to speak
Inside my world you are living
Inside my mind I was believing
This sentimental exposure
Turned out to be more than a tortureâ¦
IâVE ALWAYS HOPED LIFE COULD BE EASIER
BUT NOTHING REALLY TURNED OUT
AND IN MY WOUNDS  THE KNIFEâS GETTING DEEPER
TASTING ALL MY TEARS NOW..
