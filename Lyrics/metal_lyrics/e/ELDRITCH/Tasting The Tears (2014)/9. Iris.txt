When I first saw your eyes, they were so bright
 I felt a strike and the shivers straight down my spineâ¦
I dream of you since that night, and in my dreams
Youâre like the lightning, striking and making me blind..
Two years have gone since that night
But canât get you off my mind
I got this feeling of emptiness
If youâre not by my sideâ¦.
IRIS ALL I WANT IS YOUR EMBRACE
As time goes by I realize that you ainât mine
But far away now, I suffer and pain rips my soul
Why did this happen to me?
What could I say or could do
To see you, breathe you  at least once againâ¦.?
Letâs donât waste this sign of fate
Letâs follow destinyâs line
Letâs give real love a try at least once in this lifeâ¦..
IRIS ALL I WANT  IS YOUR EMBRACE
LETâS GIVE LOVE A REAL TRY, A REAL TRYâ¦
IRIS ALL I WANT IS YOUR EMBRACEâ¦
