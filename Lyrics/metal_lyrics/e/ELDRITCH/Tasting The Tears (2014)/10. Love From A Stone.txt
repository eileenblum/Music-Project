There is no love left inside of meâ¦
Nothing left to care about
Thereâs no way out!
But I donât care
I made up my mind
Everybody loves
But no longer this heart of mineâ¦
NO MATTER HOW YOU SHOUT LOUDER
NO MATTER HOW YOU GET CLOSER
I DONâT CARE ABOUT YOUR PROPOSALS..
NO MATTER HOW YOU SHOUT LOUDER
NO MATTER HOW YOU GET CLOSER
CANâT PULL OUT LOVE FROM A STONE
Only God knows how many times I tried
To find the courage for
Pulling out the love from a stoneâ¦.
But I donât care
I made up my mind
Everybody loves
But no longer this heart of mineâ¦
NO MATTER HOW YOU SHOUT LOUDER
NO MATTER HOW YOU GET CLOSER
I DONâT CARE ABOUT YOUR PROPOSALS..
NO MATTER HOW YOU SHOUT LOUDER
NO MATTER HOW YOU GET CLOSER
CANâT PULL OUT LOVE FROM A STONE
