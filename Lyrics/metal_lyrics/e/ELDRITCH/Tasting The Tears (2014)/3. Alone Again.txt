I see your face as I close my eyes falling asleep
I am  a victim of your big green eyes
Magnetic and magic to me.
Iâm chasing  the hope of being with you
Iâm afraid it will remain a dreamâ¦
You deserve more than a man like this
Keep living for your bright hopes..
Iâm warning your soul to get outta my view again
Trying to build you a big wall of protection (trying to keep you away)
Iâm forcing my heart to get rid of temptations
IâM  ALONE  AGAIN
IâM  ALONE  AGAINâ¦.
Day after day I am struggling for life, defining my identity
My arid heart now is paving my way
Through the path of my ownâ¦
Iâm warning your soul to get outta my view again
Trying to build you a big wall of protection (trying to keep you away)
Iâm forcing my heart to get rid of temptations
IâM  ALONE  AGAIN
IâM  ALONE  AGAINâ¦.
