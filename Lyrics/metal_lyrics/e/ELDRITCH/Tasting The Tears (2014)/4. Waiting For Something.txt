WAITING FOR SOMETHING
Itâs sad but thereâs no future
Nothing to believe in now
No virgin land to conquer
No one could  see me laugh..
I fought my heavy  battles
Facing  the world alone
I am too hard to handle
Depressed deep to the boneâ¦
And suddenly
She walked in my dreams
Then suddenly
She walked away again..
STANDING
STILL STANDING WAITING
FOR SOMETHING
SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN..
Iâve tried and tried to trust her
But nothingâs gonna change me now
They drawed me as a monster
Iâm never gonna back down..
And suddenly
She walked in my dreams
Then suddenly
She walked away again..
STANDING
STILL STANDING WAITING
FOR SOMETHING
SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN..
Still standing here, waiting for something
Still standing hereâ¦
