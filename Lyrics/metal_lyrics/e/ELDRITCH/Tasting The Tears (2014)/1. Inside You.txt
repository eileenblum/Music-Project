Thereâs  barely no way to cure my bad disease
But maybe something could fix this wrong mind
With no one by my side I feel like a castaway
One day you came walking right straight, towards me
And when I saw your face, I said âHey,
Where are you from? Where were you yesterday?...â
I âM, IâM FALLING INSIDE YOU
YOU
HOW COULD IT HAPPEN?
I got struck by  a lightning from above
Every time I try to focus on you, I get a shock that makes me blind
There is no way out, thereâs no sense of shame
I am now falling in love and my heart is the one to blame
And when I saw your face, I said âHey,
Where are you from? Where were you yesterday?...â
I âM, IâM FALLING INSIDE YOU
YOU
HOW COULD IT HAPPEN?
