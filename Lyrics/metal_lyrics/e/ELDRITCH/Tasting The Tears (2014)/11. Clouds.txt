When the clouds start their moving
When the angels are falling straight to the ground
I  gotta find a way to carry onâ¦
I gotta roll the dice to get a match point
 for this game Iâm  playingâ¦
Year by year I kept on growing
Day by day my life kept rolling straight to the ground
I fought hard but nothing ever changed
I tried to search for luck that never  really came
straight towards my wayâ¦
So now I let goâ¦.
Destiny left me lone
Destiny donât care a lot..
LET THE CLOUDS OUT OF MY WORLD
I WANT THE SUN TO WARM MY SOUL
LET THE DARKNESS OFF MY ROAD
NEED THE LIGHT TO LEAD ME HOMEâ¦
Donât wanna make my life a tragedy
Iâll keep on hoping and willing to find serenity
At least I own my full liberty
And Iâm sure one day the sun will shine
Will shine over meâ¦.
So now I let goâ¦.
Destiny left me lone
Destiny donât care a lot..
LET THE CLOUDS OUT OF MY WORLD
I WANT THE SUN TO WARM MY SOUL
LET THE DARKNESS OFF MY ROAD
NEED THE LIGHT TO LEAD ME HOMEâ¦
