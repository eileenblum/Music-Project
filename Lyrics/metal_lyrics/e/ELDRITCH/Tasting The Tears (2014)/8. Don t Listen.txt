Please run to me
Iâll stop and wait
If you want me
Iâm right here
We got nothing
More to lose
Now I see how sometimes love could be
Erasing all the bad thoughts from this wounded mind
THE POWER OF LOVEâS GETTING CLOSER
I SHIVER AT EVERY GLANCE YOU GIVE
THE POWER OF LOVEâS GETTING CLEARER
JUST DONâT LISTEN TO NOBODYâ¦
Now my  arms are
Open wide
Now my heart is
Beating right
Letâs just give love
One last chance
Now I see how sometimes love could be
Erasing all the bad thoughts from this wounded mind
THE POWER OF LOVEâS GETTING CLOSER
I SHIVER AT EVERY GLANCE YOU GIVE
THE POWER OF LOVEâS GETTING CLEARER
JUST DONâT LISTEN TO NOBODYâ¦
