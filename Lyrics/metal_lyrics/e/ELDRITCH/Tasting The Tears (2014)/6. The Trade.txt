Now every dayâs like the last one,
Starting to live from the twilight
When  light fades away  becomes my day
You stepped all over my dignity
 Blowing all my hopes  away
In a friendship I had faith in..
HOW COULD YOU TRADE ME FOR MONEY?
HOW COULD?
WHY DID YOU CHANGE?
We grew up in perfect harmony
With nothing really bad to say
Regarding the points of view of life
As you met her you changed suddenly
Throwing your soul away
The entirety of your mindâs gone
HOW COULD YOU TRADE ME FOR MONEY?
HOW COULD?
WHY DID YOU CHANGE?
Why did you,  why did you change?
And throw your soul away?
