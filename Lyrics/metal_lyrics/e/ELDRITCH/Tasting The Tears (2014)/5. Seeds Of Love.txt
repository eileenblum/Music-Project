I am purging my soul from the mistakes I made
I am breathing new air trusting in destiny
A cool wind in my hair swept  bad thoughts away
If Iâm wrong wake me up from this big daydream
In this world of anger
There is need of love
A vast land to conquer
Where to plant my heart..
NOW I AM WAITING FOR A SIGN
TO BREATHE AND FEED THIS SOUL OF MINE
MY HEARTâS FULL OF SEEDS OF LOVE..â¦
It took a lifetime to me to  realize
That my thoughts were kind of paralyzed
I finally think that Iâm recovering from this state
A state of depression and uncertainty
In this world of anger
There is need of love
A vast land to conquer
Where to plant my heart..
NOW I AM WAITING FOR A SIGN
TO BREATHE AND FEED THIS SOUL OF MINE
MY HEARTâS FULL OF SEEDS OF LOVE..â¦
