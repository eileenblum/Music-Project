I, I  was so lost ,under this ground, because of you real love I finally found
My heart was still, but in my will, there was  a little corner left for hope
So thank you God, for what youâve done, you gave my son to me and lots of hopesâ¦
He  turned me on, and showed me love, I was  sick and tired to be here alone..
You taught me how the real love is
 I feel the vibes coming from inside
My self-esteem grows with your hugging
I am so happy youâre a piece of me
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?
AS YOU CAME INTO MY LIFE
DO YOU KNOW HOW STRONG OUR LOVE COULD BE?
IF WITHOUT YOU I WOULD DIEâ¦
Once, I was like ill, like frozen still,  it was impossible to be me around
But now youâre here, to fix it all, giving me strength to carry on and on
You taught me how the real love is
 I feel the vibes coming from inside
My self-esteem grows with your hugging
I am so happy youâre a piece of me
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?
AS YOU CAME INTO MY LIFE
DO YOU KNOW HOW STRONG OUR LOVE COULD BE?
IF WITHOUT YOU I WOULD DIEâ¦
