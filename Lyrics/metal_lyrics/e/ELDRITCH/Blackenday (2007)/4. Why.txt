I feel that there is something wicked deep in my mind
I feel that there is something hatred that drives me insane
I feel that my soul is polluted and ready to die
I realize that no one could help me to feel alive

Why are you here?
I need no help from you
Why am I here?
There's nothing left to do...

Run, better if you run away from me, get safe for the night
Hope, hope that someone there will save you from me
Turn, turn your eyes away from my sight, I'll make you get blind
I'll hypnotize you and your soul and make you my slave

Why are you here?
I need no help from you
Why am I here?
There's nothing left to do...

Why...still alive?...why?...am I alive?
