I see the walls fall down, fall down upon my head
I feel discourage and pain, someone's more worse than me
Why do I feel like I'm in crime?
I've always tried to be on the right side...

Don't close your eyes, and fall in a deep sleep
Don't cry today, save tears for tomorrow

Some act deaf and some act blind, this happens every day
Even though I try to react, there's like a spell on me
Why do I feel like I'm in crime?
I've always tried to be on the right side

Don't close your eyes, and fall in a deep sleep
Don't cry today, save tears for tomorrow
