When I turn my eyes up, staring at the sky
All I get is something dark, I feel paranoid
Searching for something good to see
Searching for something that could make me change...
Now all the clouds are getting over me
The last rays of light start to fade away...
This total eclipse of my heart will
Make me become what I never meant to be...
When I turn my eyes up, staring at the sky
All I get is something dark that I can't avoid...

If the sun gets black, the sky gets black
Here comes the blackened day
And it's darker more than midnight hour...

If the sun goes down, the sky falls down
Here comes the blackened day
And it's darker more than midnight hour...

When I look around me, dead trees and dead land
Who could ever help me, fix my perfect plan?
Searching for good new air to breathe
Searching for something good to make me see...again
When I turn my eyes up, staring at the sky
All I get is something dark that I can't avoid...

If the sun gets black, the sky gets black
Here comes the blackened day
And it's darker more than midnight hour...

If the sun goes down, the sky falls down
Here comes the blackened day
And it's darker more than midnight hour...
