Riding alone the path of fire, trying to get home safe
Never could rest this soul of mine and finally breathe some air..
I've always kept my promises so I'm coming back home

Back to where?
Will there ever be anybody waiting me?
Right along this broken road?
Everybody should've taste a bit of my life
Everybody should've tried to share with me one night
Riding the broken road...

I built my life brick after brick, following Dad's advices
But never thought it could be so cruel, full of envy and hate
I've always fought very hard for this so I'm coming back home

Back to where?
Will there ever be anybody waiting me?
Right along this broken road?
Everybody should've taste a bit of my life
Everybody should've tried to share with me one night
Riding the broken road...

Riding...riding for nowhere
Climbing...climbing with no air
Broken...broken road and hope
