He's afraid of me
He won't play with me
He's got terror in his eyes
He don't laugh with me
He just cries to me
He's a child that never smiles

How come the child with the candy Cain
Don't ever smile back to me?
Why don't he talk to me more?
What happened to the child that never smiles?

Will he play no more?
With his friends no more?
And turn back to a normal life?
It got tough for him
To get rid of it
Of the torture in his mind

How come the child with the candy Cain
Don't ever smile back to me?
Why don't he talk to me more?
What happened to the child that never smiles?
