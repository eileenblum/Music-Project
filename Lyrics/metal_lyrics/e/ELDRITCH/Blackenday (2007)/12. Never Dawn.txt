Bright seems this day, I hope it would last
I was told that nothing is forever
Gone on my way, the storm looks like past
But the vulture is still over my shoulder..

How come every time it goes better
The black clouds start to cover the sunny day?

Changing road and going straight to hell
And I feel like I'm falling
Who will try?
Who will help me catch a new dawn?

Like a black moon, my night's full of fear
Should I ever give yield to this fate?
The more that I stare, the less I can see
This puzzle has a missing piece

How come every time it goes better
The black clouds start to cover the sunny day?

Changing road and going straight to hell
And I feel like I'm falling
Who will try?
Who will help me catch a new dawn?
