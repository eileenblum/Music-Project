Here comes the day and here comes the pain
Nothing will ever change
No matter of time nor either of faith
My life is surrounded by hate
The morning has come but it still ain't no fun
Dark mood is taken its place
I'm still alive but it's better to die
Than living a life full of shame

A sensation that grows slightly up all my spine
Like a flood growing in my memory

I'm sinking, I'm drowning again in shallow waters

The day that I'll die I'm sure nobody will cry
Growing was my biggest mistake
I sleep all the day and stay awake in the night
Trying to win this inner fight
Where could I hide when the water will flow?
How could I get my ass in safe?
Where could I run when disaster will come?
Tell me where the hell to escape...

A sensation that grows slightly up all my spine
Like a flood growing in my memory

I'm sinking, I'm drowning again in shallow waters
