It starts inside and burns away your faith
The fire coming from below
Pull the trigger make a clean complete
Or it'll never let you grow

Burn, don't speak
Feel the heat
Burn, don't move
Feel the groove...

Does it look like what you dreamed?
Like your life will never fall?
Is it real or just your fantasy?

Your flesh is burning and your blood is boiled
The fire is getting to your soul
Pull that trigger make this job complete
No one has to see you grow

Burn, don't speak
Feel the heat
Burn, don't move
Feel the groove...

Does it look like what you dreamed?
Like your life will never fall?
Is it real or just your fantasy?
