Making up my mind I still haven't found a way to crawl away from Hell

There's no one that smiles in this house of pain, better to move somewhere else
There's no one that tames all these burning flames, I'd really like to disappear...

Oh the silent pain and silent flame
That burns away burns away my anger
Oh the silent pain and silent flame
That burns away burns away my anger

There was something that was never clear
That was crawling in my brain and never made kept me free
I had something that was flowing in my blood
Burning from inside did set my soul free.

Oh the silent pain and silent flame
That burns away burns away my anger
Oh the silent pain and silent flame
That burns away burns away my anger

Burns into me, grows into me
Flows into me, kills me
Burns into me, grows into me
Flows into me, kills me

No one ever tamed all my burning flames, now I have to disappear...
