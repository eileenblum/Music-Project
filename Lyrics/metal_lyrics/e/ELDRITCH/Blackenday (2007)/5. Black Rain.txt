Hear the wind before the storm, better hit the run
Turn your face towards the sky, seems the end will come

Black rain! Pouring on your heart
Black rain! Filling up your soul
Black rain! Mud won't let you run
Black rain! Blackening the day...

Black rain, darkening all your faith
Black rain, dooming the bright day
Black rain, killing your mood today
Black rain, drowning you

You could run but cannot hide, better follow the flow
When the grey sky turns to black, close your eyes and go...

Black rain! Pouring on your heart
Black rain! Filling up your soul
Black rain! Mud won't let you run
Black rain! Blackening the day...

Black rain, darkening all your faith
Black rain, dooming the bright day
Black rain, killing your mood today
Black rain, drowning you
