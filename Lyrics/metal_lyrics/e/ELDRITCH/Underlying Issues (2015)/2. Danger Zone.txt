I see thing that keep my mind on thinking
Keep my body shaking, keep my heart on bleeding
I live things that keep my soul on breaking.
Keep my head on aching, keep my eyes on tearing.

My world needs a hero,
That's what I see.
For my salvation
Need motivations to live a better life.
Who'll be my savior?

I've been living in the danger zone,
Feeling pains that I've never felt before,
I've been living in the danger zone
And now it's time to find a safe way home.

Every morning when I wake up my body seems so heavy,
The head keeps spinning round and round.
When the night comes I'm so scared of sleeping
'Cause I'm scared of dreaming of what I got around.

My world needs a hero,
That's what I see.
For my salvation
Need motivations to live a better life.
Who'll be my savior?

I've been living in the danger zone,
Feeling pains that I've never felt before,
I've been living in the danger zone
And now it's time to find a safe way home.
