Fog in the sky,
Sand in the eyes,
And evil dance.

Nowhere to go,
Nowhere to flow,
No second chance.

People that come,
People that go,
No permanence.

Numerous times,
We need to try,
Perseverance.

I won't survive another day,
I won't survive another,
Don't wanna waste another day,
Don't wanna waste another
I won't survive another day,
I won't survive another.
We should try to change the rhythm need to calm it down.

Wicked desire,
Sex in our minds,
Horniness,

Walking too fast,
Eating too fast,
Dying young,

"big men" pollute,
"big men" corrupt,
Bringing death,

Children that cry,
Children that shoot,
What is this?

I won't survive another day,
I won't survive another,
Don't wanna waste another day,
Don't wanna waste another
I won't survive another day,
I won't survive another.
We should try to change the rhythm need to calm it down.

Slow the rhythm hold your horses,
Slow the rhythm give a chance to your breath.
Slow the rhythm hold your horses,
Slow the rhythm give a chance to your breath.

The tic-tac is melting away,
No more rushing there ain't no time left to pray,
No forgiving.

I won't survive another day,
I won't survive another,
Don't wanna waste another day,
Don't wanna waste another
I won't survive another day,
I won't survive another.

Slow the rhythm hold your horses,
Slow the rhythm give a chance to your breath.
Slow the rhythm hold your horses,
Slow the rhythm give a chance to your breath.
