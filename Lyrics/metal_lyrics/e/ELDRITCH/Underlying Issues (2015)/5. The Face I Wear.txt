There's nothing to lose when you're falling to pieces,
Like getting drunk on the 4th of July,
Trying to see if there will be a limit
On living steady on the edge of life.

Too many times in so many ways I got in trouble,
Nothing will change 'till the day I'll die,

I wear a face like if I'm in love
But I don't wanna show ya.
Don't wanna tell you how your strike was tough.
Bringing me right down to hell now.

When party starts and my friends carry me there,
I'm like a fish jumping out of the bowl.
My funeral face always gets there before me,
A story read at least a thousand times.

I wear a face like if I'm in love
But I don't wanna show ya.
Don't wanna tell you how your strike was tough.
Bringing me right down to hell now.

I'll never call you back
Or give you a trace of me.
I've been losing all hopes and there's no chance for me
For living a life with a bit of dignity.
