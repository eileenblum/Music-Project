You came to bring me hope,
But you brought only pain.
I am here, I am here, I am here trying to get outta this.
Ever since I crossed your eyes,
Thought you would've recover me
But the truth, but the truth, but the truth is that you've hurt me harder.

And now in the morning as I wake up,
The emptiness gets bigger
And every day that'll pass will make me stronger...
Stronger.

The mornings are so hard,
The highest level of pain,
But I'm here, but I'm here, but I'm here trying to get stronger.
Every time I open my eyes,
And don't see no shade of you,
I will try, I will try, I will try to push myself through this.
And now in the morning as I wake up,
And every day that'll pass will make me stronger...
Stronger.

When I wake up I feel so down
My head is buried underground
Buried in pain
When I wake up I feel so down
I see that I am surrounded by people bringers of hate.

My father taught me rules,
That I tried to bring to life,
But it's hard, but it's hard, but it's hard to teach the world now.
Spent my life delivering goods,
But got back only pain.
This is why, this is why, this is why my eyes are full of sorrow.

And now in the morning as I wake up,
The emptiness gets bigger
And every day that'll pass will make me stronger...
Stronger.

When I wake up I feel so down
My head is buried underground
Buried in pain
When I wake up I feel so down
I see that I am surrounded by people bringers of hate.
