Who will wait for me when I'll come to town?
Who can tell me if I'm wrong or if I'm right?
Who can fix my meals when I'm back at home?
Who can pull the sheet and cover me at night?

I've been pulling her to the edge of love.
I've been trying so damn hard to make her mine.
I took all the blame for this big heart crash,
I threw down the cards using the wrong hand.

I lost a piece of me when she left,
Closing my door to the happiness.

Brokenâstrange things that I'm feeling,
Strange things that I feel every time I think about you.

Now I need some time to be me again
And try to build a reasonable life,
I'll keep fighting for this to the end of time,
The only fear is how to stay away from crime.

I lost a piece of me when she left,
Closing my door to the happiness.

Brokenâstrange things that I'm feeling,
Strange things that I feel every time I think about you.
