They put the blame on you for all your hesitations,
The big spotlight's on you so you can't hide,
It all depends on you if you want some satisfaction.
What counts if how much you dare and how much you tried

So where are you now?
Where are you heading for?
Which is your final destination or decision?

You gave,
You gave it all and more and more
You tried your best
And now you're collecting only crumbs.

When life starts getting tough breaking all the motivations,
The certainties get lost and even luck gets blind,
The only things to do is erase all your frustrations
And turn your head up high breaking down the wall.

So where are you now?
Where are you heading for?
Which is your final destination or decision?

You gave,
You gave it all and more and more
You tried your best
And now you're collecting only crumbs.
