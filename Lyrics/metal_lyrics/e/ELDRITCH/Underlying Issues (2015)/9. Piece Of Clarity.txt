Cold winter come and freeze my mind,
Sometimes I need to switch off and close my eyes.
The rhythm of these days aren't for me,
But as I'm in the dance I'd like to see.

So if the moment comes full of curiosity,
I'll be waiting for a piece of clarity.
So if the moment comes,
I'll be here to stay
And finally settle up and build a hope for me.

Sometimes things seem so tough,
To tough to face,
But faith is all I need to blow the worries away.
Still didn't get too far, too far from here,
They told me just to trust so now I'll see.

So if the moment comes full of curiosity,
I'll be waiting for a piece of clarity.
So if the moment comes,
I'll be here to stay and finally settle up and build a hope for me.

I don't wanna spend my last dance all alone,
When I'm with you I feel in heaven,
I don't wanna spend this long night all alone,
A night with you brings me to heaven.

It's like playing roulette, it's just a game.
The more the game gets tough, the more I play.
So if I win or lose, I will be fine,
The only thing I want is you by my side.

So if the moment comes full of curiosity,
I'll be waiting for a piece of clarity.
So if the moment comes,
I'll be here to stay and finally settle up and build a hope for me.

I don't wanna spend my last dance all alone,
When I'm with you I feel in heaven,
I don't wanna spend this long night all alone,
A night with you brings me to heaven.

Only one night with you brings me straight to heaven.
