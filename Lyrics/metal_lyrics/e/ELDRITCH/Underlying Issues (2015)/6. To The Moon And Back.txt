When the sadness wins on me,
Feeling like I ain't alive.
When it's hard to sleep at night
But striving to get through this life.

Why me?
Why always me?

Wish you were here and I'll be the last man on earth.

Don't stand my ground and get away when I'm around
Wish I could travel to the moon and back
They say I'm walking all alone with no return
Don't stand my ground and get away from me.

Only time could heal my wounds
But it's never passing by.
Ready now to turn the page,
Bled a lot but won't give up.

Why me?
Why always me?

Wish you were here and I'll be the last man on earth.

Don't stand my ground and get away when I'm around
Wish I could travel to the moon and back
They say I'm walking all alone with no return
Don't stand my ground and get away from me.
