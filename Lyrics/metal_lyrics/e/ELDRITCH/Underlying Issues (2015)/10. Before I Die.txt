I've tried to do everything to keep this love alive,
It never had been simple but I was built to always fight.
I've been breaking all the rules and tried so hard to make her stay,
But no one really knows the truth, the reason why she ran away.

I still trust in the flame,
The flame within her heart,
I still believe she has something warm inside.

And if she comes, I wanna see her,
Before I die, before I die
And if she comes, I wanna see her
before I die, before I die.

I made a lot of mistakes so far trying to do the things right.
I should've listened to some friends that were giving me some good advice.
But I did it my way and this is the high bill yo pay.
I've better kept it all inside 'cause there ain't no remedy.

I still trust in the flame,
The flame within her heart,
I still believe she has something warm inside.

And if she comes, I wanna see her,
Before I die, before I die
And if she comes, I wanna see her
before I die, before I die.

And what if that day is coming straight towards me?
And what should I say to try to find the remedy?
So now what will happen to me now,
What is my destiny?
Where should I go,
Or should I stay or should I just pass away?
