People lie and people cry
And some got lots of toil in their lives,
This world today with many humans that spread,
Spreading around mountains of hate.
I'm seeking to find an escape from these things,
Trying to escape from this realty.
There is no way to stick out of this shame
And live a life full of serenity.

All these issues are changing my blood, changing me.

Changing my blood actually day after day,
Running to hide but never finding a way,
Seeking for something that could keep me away,
Away from running to ya.

Some tell me lies while some show their cries,
And some don't even care 'bout their lives.
It's hard to go on in a positive way,
It's difficult trying to keep the head high.
A walk in the town, could bring me straight down,
'cause people are staring at me in "that" way.
Lord give me a sign and help to climb,
Help to climb the mountain of faith.

All these issues are changing my blood, changing me.

Changing my blood actually day after day,
Running to hide but never finding a way,
Seeking for something that could keep me away,
Away from running to ya.
