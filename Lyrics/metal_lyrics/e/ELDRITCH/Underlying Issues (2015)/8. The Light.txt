Here I stand without a place to go to now
Wandering through the gates of my mind
The sun goes down and darkness crawls within me.
Though I fight and still haven't seen the light
Here I am living in the shadow.
Days like nights it doesn't make a difference
But you call I gotta tell you something.
Stand away 'cause I don't wanna be your friend,

I don't wanna be your friend,
And keep hoping till the end
I never will be your friend.

I stand, counting, all the stars and memories,
I stand alone in the shadow.

Days like hell,
Trying to find a reason.
Way too far to get out of the darkness,
I close my eyes doesn't make a difference.
How can I trust in a new dawn to come?

I don't wanna be your friend,
And keep hoping till the end
I never will be your friend.

I stand, counting, all the stars and memories,
I stand alone in the shadow.
