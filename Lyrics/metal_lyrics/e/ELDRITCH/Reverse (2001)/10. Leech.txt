Rush! Throw your last ace
don't stare at his face, tonight!
he'll crush you, he'll rape you 
Go! don't trust at his smiles
don't enjoy for his lies, tonight!
he'll swallow, he'll suck your blood
Wake! From this nightmare
you need courage to stop and fight!
the screen now will erase you
So many hours and time ran away
just realize it drinks your soul
And in his face you see the cheat
and in his game you're a looser
And in his face you see the cheat
and in his game you're a looser
Now! try to wake up
escape from his jaws, tonight!
don't sigh now, don't cry now
So many hours and time ran away
just realize it drinks your soul
And in his face you see the cheat
and in his game you're a looser
And in his face you see the cheat
and in his game you're a looser
