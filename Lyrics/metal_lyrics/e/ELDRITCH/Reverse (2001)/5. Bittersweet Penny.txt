Million things to say, million brains to waste
million my mistakes, million things never change
millions make you talk, millions make you walk
millions heal your pain, millions and a life can change 
Within your life, can't live without 'em
within your mind, you're addicted
Can't exchange a coin for life
When you're feeling sick, when you need a brick
to wash away a stain, or if there's something in your brain
the need to change a gear, or maybe disappear
just only for a beer, money! and everything is clear
Within your life, can't live without 'em
within your mind, you're addicted
Can't exchange a coin for life
