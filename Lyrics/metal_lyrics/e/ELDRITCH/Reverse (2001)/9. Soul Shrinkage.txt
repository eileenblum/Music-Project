My angel is leaving me
I'm ready to fall 
heat now is haunting me
to annihilate my soul 
The flames are growing
just 'cause of you
the ground is burning
I'll burn for you
The story's not over
gonna exhale in air
the story's not over
gonna exhale in air
Remember one day you're gonna fall
your power is gonna fall
your power is torn
Sulphur invades the air
nothing is clear
injection of fear for me 
please say a prayer
The flames are growing
just 'cause of you
the ground is burning
I'll burn for you
The story's not over
gonna exhale in air
the story's not over
gonna exhale in air
Remember one day you're gonna fall
your power is gonna fall
your power is torn
