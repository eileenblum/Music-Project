Losing faith day after day
thinking of what the wise man said to me
I'm too shy to tell the truth
better turn to another page 
And in the night, my darkened sight
can imagine you
Come to me
with your brand new pair of wings
Day by day people say I'm sick
I don't believe, but someone can create you now
I'm afraid to stir the phial
but you're afraid to spread your wings....
And in the night, my darkened sight
can imagine you
Come to me
with your brand new pair of wings
Now I'm here waiting for a sign
wasted time, I know that you'll never show
my opinion doesn't count much
but no one ever saw your face
And in the night, my darkened sight
can imagine you
Come to me
with your brand new pair of wings
