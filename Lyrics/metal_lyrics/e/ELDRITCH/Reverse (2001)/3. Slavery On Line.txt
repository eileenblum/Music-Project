He thinks he sits on top of the world
all he wants is a piece of your soul
now controls your system of life
beware of the rules that'll cut like a knife 
Run...if you have breath
Run...if you can do
It's hard to find a page where to hide
you are surfing on a deadly tide
try to find your peace of mind
life is tomorrow there's nothing behind
Run...if you have breath
Run...if you can do
