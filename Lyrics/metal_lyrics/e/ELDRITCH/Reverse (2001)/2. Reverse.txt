You took your risk and then you tried
hell ain't far, beware of this game
it seems nice, seems cool, it's your favourite pie
it's alright, it's okay, it relieves your pain 
Reverse your pain into hate
Reverse your pain into hate
The streets you live on are your reign
you prooved some friends crime sometimes pays
the night crawls deep into your mind
from dust to dust, it's the story of your life
Reverse your pain into hate
Reverse your pain into hate
You rolled the dice and now won the game
hell's your prize, too late to cry
it was nice, it was cool, was your favourite pie
but the slice you ate had a stain
Reverse your pain into hate
Reverse your pain into hate
