Toys left on the shelf
the pillow on the floor
a squeak comes from the door
believe me, please ignore
this image in your mind
just leave your grief behind
So tell me why you look behind
Irwin!
Image of disgrace
don't look behind
blood on your face
flood in your mind
"Them" whisper to you
this torment never ends
a scar deep in your brain
gotta wash this filth away
So tell me why you look behind!
Irwin!
Image of disgrace
don't look behind
blood on your face
flood in your mind
Don't look behind
blood on your eyes
So tell me why you look behind!
Irwin!
