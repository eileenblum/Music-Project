Crawling through the path, trying to win this wrath
I can see things unreal here
trying to find a real sense to my life
all I see in front of me is black 
Time goes on for me, not too far I see
there ain't no future here
it's like I belong to another race
and I'm cursed to wear this face
Don't stop me now, don't follow me
I'm dying every night, the epilogue of my life
I'm dying every night, the epilogue of my life
Feeling like a dumb, leftovers and crumbs
it's exactly like hell
someone is helping me then some killing me
got to erase my enemies
Don't stop me now, don't follow me
I'm dying every night, the epilogue of my life
I'm dying every night, the epilogue of my life
