I'm in mood for breaking some rules
I'm in shape for beating my ghosts
I will bend but never will break
living in the maximum level of pain 
Part of me, part of my soul
will never cry, never let go
And the dark is now descending
my inner strength is bending
this torture's everlasting
and part of my soul is torn apart
Trying to appease this sense of hate
this monkey on my back is tough to beat
friends now help me to find my way
this dishonour is my bundle to bring
Part of me, part of my soul
will never cry, never let go
And the dark is now descending
my inner strength is bending
this torture's everlasting
and part of my soul is torn apart
