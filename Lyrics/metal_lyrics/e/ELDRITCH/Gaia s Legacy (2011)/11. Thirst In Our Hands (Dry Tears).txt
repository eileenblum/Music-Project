Sometimes a simple move for us, is impossible for, entire families
Sometimes we let the water run, for hours and hours, to keep our bodies clean
With the water wasted to brush our teeth, a tribe could live for a whole week
When you stare into the eyes of a child, that is asking for more, how do you feel??
How do you feel? How do you feel now?

LET'S SAVE A DIME AND KEEP IT FOR THE THIRSTY LANDS, TO BUILD A VITAL WATER WELL
LET'S SAVE A DIME AND KEEP IT FOR THE THIRSTY LANDS, TO BUILD A VITAL WATER WELL

The distribution of wealth isn't really equal for all, greedy hands control us all
What's a dime for a normal man?? Imagine what if means for a millionaire
We all should put a hand on heart! And let new lives start

LET'S SAVE A DIME AND KEEP IT FOR THE THIRSTY LANDS, TO BUILD A VITAL WATER WELL
LET'S SAVE A DIME AND KEEP IT FOR THE THIRSTY LANDS, TO BUILD A VITAL WATER WELL
Have you ever seen the eyes of a child that's been stroke by thirst and hunger?
Have you ever seen the eyes of a man, greedy til his pockets blow??

[Solo: Eugene]

How do you feel? How do you feel now?
LET'S SAVE A DIME AND KEEP IT FOR THE THIRSTY LANDS, TO BUILD A VITAL WATER WELL
LET'S SAVE A DIME AND KEEP IT FOR THE THIRSTY LANDS, TO BUILD A VITAL WATER WELL
LET'S SAVE A DIME AND KEEP IT FOR THE THIRSTY LANDS, TO BUILD A VITAL WATER WELL
LET'S SAVE A DIME AND KEEP IT FOR THE THIRSTY LANDS, TO BUILD A VITAL WATER WELL
