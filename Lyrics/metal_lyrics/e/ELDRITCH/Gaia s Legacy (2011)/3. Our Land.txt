Early warning signs clearly illustrate
The global nature of the world's climate change
All the factories, spreading gases high
Chocking all our wounded atmosphere

COME CONSOLE ME MR. WEATHERMAN
TELL ME WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUR LAND
GLOBAL WARMING IS INCREASING
I'D LIKE TO LIVE BEFORE I DIE

The human influence is changing the environment
The increasing of the CFC's isn0t an accident

COME CONSOLE ME MR. WEATHERMAN
TELL ME WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUR LAND
GLOBAL WARMING IS INCREASING
I'D LIKE TO LIVE BEFORE I DIE
