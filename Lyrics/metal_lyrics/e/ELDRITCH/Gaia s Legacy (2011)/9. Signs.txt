So long ago, when the world was young
The air was so fresh and breathable
Skies were neat and the seas still blue
I know it might seem unbelievable
We're burning the oxygen out here
Killing ourselves and our future but we ain't got no

FEAR OF TODAY, FEAR OF TOMORROW
LETTING GAIA BURN 'TILL IT'S OVER
NOTHING LEFT TO SAY, TOO MUCH TO DO
LET'S ROLL OUR SLEEVES AND LET GAIA LIVE

Hidden secrets from the men who count
Telling us only pieces of the truth
What do we need to realize?
We've been told about things that are more than lies
Moving the puppets as they want
Killing themselves and their future but they ain't got no

FEAR OF TODAY, FEAR OF TOMORROW
LETTING GAIA BURN 'TILL IT'S OVER
NOTHING LEFT TO SAY, TOO MUCH TO DO
LET'S ROLL OUR SLEEVES AND LET GAIA LIVE

[Solos: Eugene/Rudj - Eugene - John]

We still have time, to shake a leg
And give our children a clean playground
Each helping hand is welcome and
Let's give our planet a second chance
Move your minds against the tide
Against all those closed-minded who really have no

FEAR OF TODAY, FEAR OF TOMORROW
LETTING GAIA BURN 'TILL IT'S OVER
NOTHING LEFT TO SAY, TOO MUCH TO DO
LET'S ROLL OUR SLEEVES AND LET GAIA LIVE
FEAR OF TODAY, FEAR OF TOMORROW
LETTING GAIA BURN 'TILL IT'S OVER
NOTHING LEFT TO SAY, TOO MUCH TO DO
LET'S ROLL OUR SLEEVES AND LET GAIA LIVE
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? TO LET GAIA LIVE
