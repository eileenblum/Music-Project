Now it's time to think and open our minds
Living every day like the last the last one of our life
Somewhere it always rains somewhere it never does
The earth is going down
Gases are floating high in the air
Up in the stratosphere
Coating all our dreams and all our hopes
CFC's rising

IN OUR SKIES NOW WE CAN SEE
A CHEMICAL REACTION NOT IN OUR MINDS
A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT'LL CHANGE OUR LIVES
A VORTEX OF DISASTERS SHOULD MAKE US THINK

UV rays come down warming the globe
The temperature is rising and the oceans will grow
So many rainy days in some lands
In other drought is striking
Gases are floating high in the air
Up in the stratosphere
Coating all our dreams and all our hopes
CFC's rising

IN OUR SKIES NOW WE CAN SEE
A CHEMICAL REACTION NOT IN OUR MINDS
A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT'LL CHANGE OUR LIVES
A VORTEX OF DISASTERS SHOULD MAKE US THINK

[Solos: Eugene]

Maybe it's too late. too late ti change the tide
Maybe it's too late to read the future

IN OUR SKIES NOW WE CAN SEE
A CHEMICAL REACTION NOT IN OUR MINDS
A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT'LL CHANGE OUR LIVES
A VORTEX OF DISASTERS SHOULD MAKE US THINK
LET'S MAKE IT END
