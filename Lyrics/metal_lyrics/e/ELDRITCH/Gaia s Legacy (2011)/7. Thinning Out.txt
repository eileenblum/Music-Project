Drought - stricken lands around the globe, still grow
Too long periods with no rain is the cause
Too many people striving to survive
But too many have past away... away

The cracks on the ground are open wide
While the heat is rising
As the land of our fathers dies

THE AIR IS THINNING OUT
THE SUN IS BURNING THE GROUND
ALL THIS CAUSES A FAST TURN INTO A DRY WORLD

Aerosols are filling up the sky
The fossil fuels burn and keep on burning dry

The clouds are changing density
It's no longer raining
As the land of our fathers dies again

THE AIR IS THINNING OUT
THE SUN IS BURNING THE GROUND
ALL THIS CAUSES A FAST TURN INTO A DRY WORLD

[Solos: Eugene - Rudj - Gabri]

THE AIR IS THINNING OUT
THE SUN IS BURNING THE GROUND
ALL THIS CAUSES A FAST TURN INTO A DRY WORLD
