The alteration of the ocean heat is moving on
Determining changes on the season's new behavior
Lot's of people's mood depends on how the weather goes
Like the rainy season's causing a disease for me

In this world of mine
Nothing seems the same
In this world of mine
All things seem so strange

WHILE THE WARM WINDS BLOW
AND THE SKIES ARE SEEMING TO FALL DOWN IN ME
EVERYTHING IS CHANGING COMPRISING MY SOUL
MY THOUGHTS ARE GREY... MY THOUGHTS ARE GREY

I have noticed that the sunny weather turns me good
But when the clouds get black in summer I'm willing to cry

In this world of mine
Nothing seems the same
In this world of mine
All things seem so strange

WHILE THE WARM WINDS BLOW
AND THE SKIES ARE SEEMING TO FALL DOWN IN ME
EVERYTHING IS CHANGING COMPRISING MY SOUL
MY THOUGHTS ARE GREY... MY THOUGHTS ARE GREY

[Solos: Rudj - Eugene]

Will this normalize or will it keep on going on?
It's too hard to accept this feeling of total apathy
Every day I open the window wishing the sun to smile
But all I get continuous changing of my state of mind

In this world of mine
Nothing seems the same
In this world of mine
All things seem so strange

WHILE THE WARM WINDS BLOW
AND THE SKIES ARE SEEMING TO FALL DOWN IN ME
EVERYTHING IS CHANGING COMPRISING MY SOUL
MY THOUGHTS ARE GREY... MY THOUGHTS ARE GREY
