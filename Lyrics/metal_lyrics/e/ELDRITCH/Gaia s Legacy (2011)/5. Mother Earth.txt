A flashback into my thoughts
Remembering the summer nights
When skies were still as clear as crystal waters
The walks down by the shore
Breathing deep the ocean breeze
It's something that has changed and no longer
coming back

WILL WE SEE THE SKY AGAIN?
WILL THE STARS SHINE CLEARLY?
WILL WE SEE THE SHINING NIGHTS?
WHAT WILL BE ABOVE US ALL?

The world needs a remedy
It can't just remain a dream
We got to find a way how to help our Mother Earth
We all should give a hand
To join up all the forces and
Try to give a future to who'll come after us

WILL WE SEE THE SKY AGAIN?
WILL THE STARS SHINE CLEARLY?
WILL WE SEE THE SHINING NIGHTS?
WHAT WILL BE ABOVE US ALL?
