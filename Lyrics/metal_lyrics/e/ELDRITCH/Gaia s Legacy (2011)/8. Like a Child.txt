Like a child with a brand new gift in hand
And then he broke it right the second day
So he had to throw it away
When we were younger and we have been told
That all the things that we given
have to be kept in our hearts
The land we're living is a gift from above
And we're breaking is faster than a child
Than a child with his toy
But this ain't a toy... a toy to break

IT'S LIKE A CHILD THAT IS PLAYING WITH HIS STORY
HE LIKES TO WIN AND NEVER LOSE
SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE CAUGHT IN PLAYING A BAD GAME
NO ONE WINS WE ALL LOSE

The rich don't help and the poor can't do
What's the reason for destruction?
If you look high up and then stare to the sky
There'll always be the answer to all our questions...
The land we're living is a gift from above
And we're breaking is faster than a child
Than a child with his toy
But this ain't a toy... a toy to break

IT'S LIKE A CHILD THAT IS PLAYING WITH HIS STORY
HE LIKES TO WIN AND NEVER LOSE
SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE CAUGHT IN PLAYING A BAD GAME
NO ONE WINS WE ALL LOSE

[Solos: Eugen/Rudj - Eugene - Bob]

Now it seems all over
There's nothing else to do
Nothing else to say

IT'S LIKE A CHILD THAT IS PLAYING WITH HIS STORY
HE LIKES TO WIN AND NEVER LOSE
SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE CAUGHT IN PLAYING A BAD GAME
NO ONE WINS WE ALL LOSE
