The sun sometimes is boiling hot like hell
And then the temperature us getting really tough
Hard to stand tall and it's hard to breathe now
The hottest season that we've ever seen

FOR HOW ONG, HOW LONG SHOULD WE TAKE THIS?
WHAT'S WRONG, WHAT IS THE REASON?
HOW LONG, HOW LONG WILL THE SUN BURN?
EVERYTHING'S BURNING

The ozone hole is growing wide permitting
Rays of light and heat to come to the ground
It's hard to heal or sew the sky with stitches
Because Greenhouse gas surrounds our life and our air

FOR HOW ONG, HOW LONG SHOULD WE TAKE THIS?
WHAT'S WRONG, WHAT IS THE REASON?
HOW LONG, HOW LONG WILL THE SUN BURN?
EVERYTHING'S BURNING

Everything is burning with the air?
Could we change this gear?
All our hopes are burning with sun
..And the most is done

[Solos: Eugene - Gabri]

FOR HOW ONG, HOW LONG SHOULD WE TAKE THIS?
WHAT'S WRONG, WHAT IS THE REASON?
HOW LONG, HOW LONG WILL THE SUN BURN?
EVERYTHING'S BURNING
