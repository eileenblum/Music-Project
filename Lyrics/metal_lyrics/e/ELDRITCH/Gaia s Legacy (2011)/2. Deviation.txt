Heavy downpours on our land
Lots of people buried under mud, of their own lands
Digging bodies with their hands
Everything is different now
Every season's changed in something that's out of
control
This global warming's hitting all
Variations of the solar radiations
Changes in greenhouse gas concentrations
Continental drift and orbit deviations
All this climate forcing is bringing us to

THE FEVER OF THE WORLD NOW IS RISING
THE ARCTIC GLACIERS MELTING, THE OCEANS
GROWING
THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD NOW IS CHANGING
WE SHOULD LEARN THE LESSON, LET'S TRY TO FIX
IT NOW

After million years of life
Something's natural but something isn't it at all
Some men's greed will kill us all
Everyone should give a hand
Everyone should put a hand on their heart and try
Twelve billion hands towards the sky
Variations of the solar radiations
Changes in greenhouse gas concentrations
Continental drift and orbit deviations
All this climate forcing is bringing us to

THE FEVER OF THE WORLD NOW IS RISING
THE ARCTIC GLACIERS MELTING, THE OCEANS
GROWING
THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD NOW IS CHANGING
WE SHOULD LEARN THE LESSON, LET'S TRY TO FIX
IT NOW

We need the trees, we need the green
The vegetation stress makes the desert's grow
And in the air, the oxygen
Is going slightly down leaving all breathless
