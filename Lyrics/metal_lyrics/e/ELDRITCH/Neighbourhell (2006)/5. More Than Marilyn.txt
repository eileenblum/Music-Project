She brings the rain, she brings the pain
She likes to break the balance of life
She lies to me, she cries to me
Sheâs an actress more than Marylin
But things are getting clearer to meâ¦

And when she cries, itâs just a lie
How could you trust in all the moves she makes?
And when she stays, for another day
How could you trust in all the words she says?

When I wake up, itâs a brain flood
I swear Iâd never trust her again
When Iâd see her walk, out of my door
I realized that Iâve been fired again
But things are getting clearer to meâ¦

And when she cries, itâs just a lie
How could you trust in all the moves she makes?
And when she stays, for another day
How could you trust in all the words she says?
