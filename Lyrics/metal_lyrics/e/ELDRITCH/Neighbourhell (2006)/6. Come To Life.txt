If life is good to me I think I could turn back
Fate has been odd to me putting tons all over my back
Too many times Iâve said: "I guess itâs time to go"
But when you came to me I felt a heat in my soul

Iâve found a reason
As time goes by
Iâve found my season... to live

There ainât no time for me to get away from this trap
Iâve tried so hard to see if you could show the fuckinâ track
Too many times Iâve said: "Why am I still here?"
But as you came to me the situation is clear

Iâve found a reason
As time goes by
Iâve found my season... to live

AND WHEN IâLL COME TO LIFE
IâLL SEE THE LIGHT INTO YOUR EYES
AND WHEN IâLL TURN BACK TIME
IâLL TRY TO CHANGE THE ROAD OF LIFE
