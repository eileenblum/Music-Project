When the curtain falls and I feel like a zero man
Itâs how I feel because my tragedies never end
How could I restore my mind?
And wait for the times to be changing?

So now because of you
My wounded heart keeps on its bleeding
Tell me why I ainât getting too far
Even though the scores Iâm achieving?

Too many miles and many times the risk of accidents
So many days of shouting loud all my innocence
How could I, change my life?
And hope the better days to be coming?

So now because of you
My wounded heart keeps on its bleeding
Tell me why I ainât getting too far
Even though the scores Iâm achieving?
