The days are passing
The days are passing by
The time is healing the wounds Iâve got deep in my mind
My friends are helping
My friends are helping me
There ainât no sense of living without music in my life

I want to follow the rhythm and try to search for my freedom

IT STARTED FOR A GOOD REASON
IT STARTED FROM A LONG TIME AGO
IT STARTED FOR A GOOD REASON
AND IâM STILL SCREAMING

Iâve got the passion
Iâve got the passion in me
Iâve got the chance to spread my inner feelings to the world
This is my mission
This is a mission for me
I want to demonstrate how screaming has fulfilled my life

I want to follow the rhythm and try to search for my freedom

IT STARTED FOR A GOOD REASON
IT STARTED FROM A LONG TIME AGO
IT STARTED FOR A GOOD REASON
AND IâM STILL SCREAMING
