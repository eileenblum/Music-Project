Just a little more, a little more of this game
A little empty space and
Why should I ignore, should I waste my time a little more?
Stay another more, another more by my side , Iâve gotta tell you a story
Hey, what did I say, what did I do tonight, where are you heading for now?

YOUâRE ALL OF MY LIFE
THATâS PASSING BY
GOING AGAINST MY WILL IâM STANDING STILL
YOUâRE RIGHT IN MY WAY
PLEASE LET ME PLAY

Dance another more, another more for me
I wanna see your veils off
Breathe another more, I wanna feel your heat,
Youâve gotta melt the dance floor

YOUâRE ALL OF MY LIFE
THATâS PASSING BY
GOING AGAINST MY WILL IâM STANDING STILL
YOUâRE RIGHT IN MY WAY
PLEASE LET ME PLAY...
IâVE SPENT MY LIFE LIKE A STEPPING STONE NOW,
LIKE A PEBBLE, LIKE AN OLD GUM, LIKE AN OLD SHOE UNDER YOUR FEET
