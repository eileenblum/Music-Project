Now Iâll take you by the hand
When Iâm with you I feel a man
But after all Iâm still a wounded lamb
Got to leave the past behind
Got to give a sense to this life
Doesnât matter how the story ends
Now tell me how to rid my mistakes...

AND WHEN THE RAIN COMES POURING
AFTER THE PAIN THATâS GROWING
AND WHEN MY HEART STARTS BLEEDING
YOU CAME TO WASH MY SINS AWAY

Living each day like if itâs my last
Trying to climb the hill again
No regrets for what belongs to the past
Everything was written down
All our steps are numbered now
We are moving just like marionettes
Now tell me how to rid my mistakes...

AND WHEN THE RAIN COMES POURING
AFTER THE PAIN THATâS GROWING
AND WHEN MY HEART STARTS BLEEDING
YOU CAME TO WASH MY SINS AWAY
