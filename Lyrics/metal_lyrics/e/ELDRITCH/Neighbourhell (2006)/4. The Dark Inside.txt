After the night, the sun will shine
And I would like to be in Heaven
After the rain, after the pain
Donât know if my heart could be beating

Who knows the reasons why Iâm here, down on my knees and crying?

The dark inside!!!
The sky is black, my soul getâs dark
Even the sun now is shading
Some people laugh, some children smile
All that I see are just illusions

Who knows the reasons why Iâm here, down on my knees and crying?

The dark inside!!!
