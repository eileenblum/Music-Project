Going home, the sun is going down,
Donât wanna see you
All alone, just wanna stay alone,
donât want you back now

When I walk and everythingâs calm
The dawn will never be arriving
When I walk in this never ending night,
The wheel will finally keep on turning

IâVE FOUND THE STRENGTH TO CARRY ON
NEVER SURRENDER
IâVE FOUND THE STRENGTH TO FACE THE DAWN
NEVER SURRENDER

Hereâs the moon, oh my little moon,
My second world now
All alone, Iâm better all alone
Iâve found the way how..

When I walk and everythingâs calm
The dawn will never be arriving
When I walk in this never ending night,
The wheel will finally keep on turning

IâVE FOUND THE STRENGTH TO CARRY ON
NEVER SURRENDER
IâVE FOUND THE STRENGTH TO FACE THE DAWN
NEVER SURRENDER
