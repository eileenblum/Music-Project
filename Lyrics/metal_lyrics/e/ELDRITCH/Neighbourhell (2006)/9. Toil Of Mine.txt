Just like a curse it never ends
These crooked days, full of pain again
Cursed, a curse that never ends
Will, bring me to the end

Will I survive, this toil of mine?
Or wait until the dark descends?

Donât want to stain with blood on my hands
Donât want my dark side to rise again
Cursed, a curse that never ends
Will, bring me to the end

Will I survive, this toil of mine?
Or wait until the dark descends?
Hope soon Iâll die and feel so light
And wait until the dark descends...
