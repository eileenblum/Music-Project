Hope Iâll make it âtill the end of the day
And my mind wonât break until I finish to say:
No money in my pockets, no mercy in my soul,
thereâs only one damn thing before Iâll let you go

I know that everything you said, confused my mind and killed me

SAVE ME, TAKE ME AWAY
ONLY YOUR HANDS COULD CURE ME
SAVE ME, TAKE ME AWAY
ONLY YOUR WORDS COULD HEAL ME

Too hard for me now for crossing the line
But I wonât give up until youâre all mine
Iâm too complicated, donât know if youâll resist
My lifeâs underrated, my soul still donât exist!

I know that everything you said, confused my mind and killed me

SAVE ME, TAKE ME AWAY
ONLY YOUR HANDS COULD CURE ME
SAVE ME, TAKE ME AWAY
ONLY YOUR WORDS COULD HEAL ME
