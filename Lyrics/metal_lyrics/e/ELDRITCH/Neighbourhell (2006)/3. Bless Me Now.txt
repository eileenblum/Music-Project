Black and grey is all I could see
No sun could make me see clearer
Toil and pain, who should I blame?
Canât see my face in the mirror

Bless me now
Quicksandâs getting higher
Bless me now
No air left for me to breathe

Make believe, youâre able to save
Tell me if Iâm one of the chosen
Iâll close my eyes and begin to pray
Hell now is becoming closer

Bless me now
Quicksandâs getting higher
Bless me now
No air left for me to breathe
