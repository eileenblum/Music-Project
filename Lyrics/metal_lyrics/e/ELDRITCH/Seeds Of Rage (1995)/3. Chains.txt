Make it out, is your life a real thrill? 
find out things that always make you sick
screaming out frustations kept inside
... do it now! Do it now! Do it now!
breaking out of opprensive...

Jails, clouding keen minds
instincts restrained by invisible...

[CHORUS]
Chains: express your own personality!

Make it out, did you decide your destiny?
pointing out mistakes you made on your way
bringing out the best you got inside yourself
...do it now! Do it now! Do it now!
breaking out of opprensive...

Jails, blinding hungry eyes
instincts restrained by invisible...

[CHORUS]
Chains: express your own personality!

[CHORUS]
Chains, Chains, Chains, ouch!
PER-SO-NA-LI-TY!!
