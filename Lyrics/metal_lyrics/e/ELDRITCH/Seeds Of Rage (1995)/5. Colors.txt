What color are you God? 
What side are you on?
Sure you're conceiving love?
We are born to wage wars!

Check it out from your high throne
Rabid dogs sinking teeth into skin
Hear the screams getting closer
Everyone is smelling like xenophobia

[CHORUS]
What's the color of the earth tomorrow?
We'll all be acting like avengers

Thank you god for our planet
Tell us why some people are dark and some briht
Sure you meant just one community?
This difference is spinning the world against its own run..

[CHORUS]
What's the color of the earth tomorrow?
We'll all be acting like avengers
Disagreeing words sound so hollow...
(no one wants to take the blame)
what's the color of the race to follow?

...By extreme prejudice...

What color are you God?
What side are you on?

[CHORUS]
What's the color of the earth tomorrow?
We'll all be acting like avengers
Disagreeing words sound so hollow...
(no one wants to take the blame)
What's the color of the race to follow?
