Another boy in lost again 
under our horrified eyes
one by one are swallowed and
what we hear are parent's cries
a weekend with drunk friends
and your ride home ia a funeral march
can't you see it makes no sense
to blow your head and drive your car

High velocity comes in control of their vehicles
their reflexes decreased by deafening noise
irresponsible youth back to town from the farest disco
treating danger as the new exciting toy
I doubt you'll have fun under this ground, I really doubt it
I doubt you'll have fun under this ground, I really doubt it
let's see you dancing as the bells sound

[CHORUS]
Senseless way for you to die
is your life worth just a dime?
one day is left for goodbye
forever you'll pay for your crime

After a too long night spent in wild thrashing
you feel no pain and your brain is washed away
overnigth heroes put na end to this abusing
you crash and burn and death is the price you pay

I doubt you'll have fun under this ground, Ireally doubt it
I doubt you'll have fun under this ground , I fuckin'doubt it
let's see you dancing as the bells sound

[CHORUS]
Senseless way for you to die
is your life worth just a dime?
one day is left for goodbye
forever you'll pay for your crime
