Where have you gone? 
Why have you been lying to me?
Who'll take care of me?
Blindness is taking place inside
What have i done (what have i done to you?)
Now i'm closed outside your dream
In your mind (inside your mind...)
Remember the promise made to me
The walls you confined me inside (inside...)
Have no windows to see
The darkness has surrounded my eyes, it hurts

[CHORUS]
Black is covering the light all around me (all around me...)
You had promise the life i can't see (I can't see...)
I can't see i can't see, the light inside... inside your dream

Sometimes I (I wanna know) ask myself
Who owns my destiny
Let me sleep (i wanna fall asleep)
I wish the awakening killed the nightmare
Now that i'm alone with myself (all alone...)
Illusions to stare at
I know you wanna live your life, don't care

[CHORUS]
Black is covering the light all around me (all around me...)
You had promise me true love i can't feel
I can't feel, i can't see, in your dream... i won't be there

I was waiting for me to get over
Believing some weird dreams i really needed
I thought it was over
Waiting for my heart to rest and to leave...

I was waiting for me to get over
Believing for my soul to lay down and sleep it wasn't over
I'm waiting for the sun to rise and me to...live
again and again and again and again...

I wanna live, I wanna live without you
I will reborn without you
