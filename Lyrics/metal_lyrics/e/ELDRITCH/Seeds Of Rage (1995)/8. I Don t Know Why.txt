Evil minds and bodies got hold of the feelings 
I don't have anymore
So do try to forgive the excuses and silly lies i tell
I've forgot the joy of living for somebody to love
giving them all
The stolen kisses, the forbidden words
that nobody wants to say, nobody wants to say

[CHORUS]
I don't know why my own ego is lying
I don't know why i deny what i feel
I keep playing myself in a game that is over
I don't know why, i don't know why

Free from passion I've become a slave of myself
Free and not feeling love
Cynicism put you in a second place with me
And nothing is gonna change
Mental chaos is keeping me from being certain
of what i am looking for
Only you can make me understand
what nobody wants to say, nobody wants to say

[CHORUS]
I don't know why my own ego is lying
I don't know why i deny what i feel
I keep playing myself in a game that is over
Help me trying to stop my dying

Give me reason and be my guide

I'll never pretend again and again... if you help me...

[CHORUS]
I don't know why my own ego is lying
I don't know why i deny what i feel
I keep playing myself in a game that is over
I don't know why, i don't know why
I don't know why my own ego is lying
I don't know why i deny what i feel
I keep playing myself in a game that is over
Help me trying to stop my dying
