Terrorizing rule 
echoes of ruthless shots
men used as mere tools
to kill cops

Fear of accusing
fault not to be escused
hints are still refused 

I am waiting for Strates to act and take 
revenge, because inocents mourn

[CHORUS]
Up to now we have always seen
those who dared brandish a sword
die and leave hearts torn by grief
heroes alone can't win this war

No escape
after being envolved
in a frighening bloody game
only monsters can play

Politicians winning seats
as long as they protect
the cancer grown inside government's spine

Extorticion racket
drug smuggling, tons of the money
quickly cleaned by swiss banks
la Mafia says thanks!

I'm waiting for states to act and break
connections across the whole world

[CHORUS]
Up to now we have always seen
those who dared brandish a sword
die and leave hearts torn by grief
heroes alone can't win this war
heroes alone can't win this war
