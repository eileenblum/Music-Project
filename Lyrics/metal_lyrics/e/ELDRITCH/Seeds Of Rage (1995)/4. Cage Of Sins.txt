My mind keeps on showing scenes Idon't want to see 
dry tears of my soul did flow again
and i'm sure the unwelcomed dawn wll wake mme sore
cause i know that you can change your role no more
who else's to blame? Can't hide this shame

[CHORUS]
Wounds can't recover when lovers lie
Rain is falling and fades a poems that was nice to write

Words are not enough to tell the pain i feel
'cause i know what you've done to kill our dream
sentenced to live in the cage f sins

[CHORUS]
Wounds can't recover when lovers lie
Rain is falling and fades a poems that was nice to write

Wounds can't recover when lovers lie
Leaves are falling while your eyes look as cold as ice
