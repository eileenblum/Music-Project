As twilight died
Blazing throught a mountain wood
I ran away by faith in a burning flame in vain!
When you think you know the way
To reach the place without a name
You just can't wait

Scared, in despair
A girl appeared in white clothes
And lighting up a trail up the slope (said:)
,,Try and fly to the sky"
a house stood high
Ten floors to climb
I think I saw a million traces there
And I went up the stairs
No one anywhere
Only empty chairs...

But a lady in bed
Once she said
,, If when I'm dead I stay alive
I'll kiss your ahnd like a butterfly"
I saw her lying in bed
As pale as death
To an end had come her life
I felt her soul was still inside
