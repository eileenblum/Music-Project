Night by night I hear a rending cry
Always restrained by the black
Day by day the rosy-fingered light
Wakes me and opens craked paths

Just keep away! Cracks will open wide!

Nine o'clock the sky is turning red
Look above to see hell
God extract my heart from the flames
This is your son, let it beat again

Behind the belfry prayers around a cradle
Over the empty eyes

Erase!!

Oldest hope rended by a cancer
Pieces beg for your mercy
Frosty drop of a bloody rain
Pushes deeply in my deadly flesh

Behind the belfry prayers around a cradle
Over the empty eyes

Erase! A hopeless life
Erase! The time to come
Deny! My dawn gone by
The door is approaching, the voices are calling
Fixing the cross on your breast I realize

Behind the belfry prayers around a cradle
Over the empty eyes

Erase! a hopeless life
Erase! The time to come
Deny! My dawn gone by
The door is approaching, the voices are calling
Fixing the cross on your breast I realize
