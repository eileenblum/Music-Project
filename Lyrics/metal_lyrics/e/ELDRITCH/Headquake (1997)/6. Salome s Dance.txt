Sway and dance girl, spread your glamour
I'll draw the curtains, I just can't see
Make a move, the wax will melt
Speak one worl to cast a spell
Queen of sin pull your veils off
Sway and strip and I'll obey
A demonstration of veneration on the silver tray, yeah!

All you wish is what I whould die hard for
I'd self my life to win the sweetest battle

Praying mantis kills after loving
I see you as the princess of beauty and lust
Play the nun with red painted nails
Changing into a tart veil after veil
A demonstration of my devotion on the
Silver tray yeah!

All you wish is what i would die hard for
I'd disobey and pick the sweetest apple
All you ask is what will get hold of
I would deny a friend for every veil you slide down

Beads of sweat on your body I'll drown in
The river I'll be baptised in
,,...into templation, but deliver us from evil
...Amen"

Sway and strip and I'll obey
A demonstration of veneration on the silver tray, yeah!

All you wish is what I would die hard for
You can dance on the hair of men
Whose heads I've struck off
All you ask is what you get hold of
I can behead a friend for every veil you
Slide down
All you wish... all die for.. all for you ask... for
Every veil you slide down
Until tomorrow if there's tomorrow for me... to live
