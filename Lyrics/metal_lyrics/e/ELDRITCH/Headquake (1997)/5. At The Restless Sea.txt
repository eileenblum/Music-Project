Here comes the rain
On fenced courtyards
Here comes the shade
On dead-end ways
Here comes the grey
To dim the colors
Here comes the cold
To wake the pain

It's hard to live in silent corners
Weary leaves
And crooked stalks
Flowers bow
Towards the light
So I do
Out of shape, out of sight

Calm! It's alright they say
Calm! you're straight on your way out
Calm's the last things I fel
'cause what is too calm seems to be unreal

Yet down inside
Seas are raging
One tear and hell shall burst
Cold tearing and grey as lead
I push it back as I bend my head
And keep on standing
If I'm here tomorrow, God, don't let it be raining

An abandoned bone
Lone, dead, shabby
One doomed man
Who can't give up
One croked flower
That still wants to live
I clutch at my last hour
At the restless sea

Calm! It's alright they say
Calm! you're straight on your way out
Calm's the last things I feel
'cause what is too calm seems to be unreal

Yet down inside
Seas are raging
One tear and hell shall burst

Cold tearing and grey as lead
I push it back as I bend my head
And keep on standing
If I'm here tomorrow, God, don't let it be raining

Calm! It's alright they say
Calm! you're straight on your way out
Calm's the last things I feel
'cause what is too calm seems to be unreal

Yet down inside
Seas are raging
One tear and hell shall burst
Cold tearing and grey as lead
I push it back as I bend my head
And keep on standing
Though I know well there's no way back in
And the world out here keeps on turning
Am I too far behind
I raise my hand but can't say farewell
Just as long as tides keep on turning
Until tomorrow if there's tomorrow for me... to live
