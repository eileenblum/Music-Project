Lost moons of regrets
The latest full of secrets
Air scents of love
Peace faith and warmth
A wax temple priestess
Tempting sweet kisses...
When someone calls
Behind a ghostly postless door

Shocking hurtful sight
Wide open bleeding eyes
Snakes creep inside
Wrapping my mind

Quiet down! The heart sound
Shake down! Hellbound

Sad timeless trip
Dark wavering poetry
Bring me back again
Those ghouls from the past
Soundless screams and shouts
Someone get them out!
No way to me myself
I'm chained to an endless past

Shocking hurtful sight
Wide open bleeding eyes
Snakes creep inside
Wrapping my mind

Quiet down! The heart sound
Shake down! Hellbound
