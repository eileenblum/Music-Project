I'm here in
I'm living
I'm dreaming
But you can't see me at all
I'm walking close to the wall
I'm here in
My breathing is my screaming
A half concealed look's my boldest
Approach to you

I talk barely
I wake up early
8 hours fairly
with spiders of silent pain
weaving cold webs in my brain
I hold on still I long
For the dusk to come
Like after the longest war
A knight on this way home

Lord of an empty place
Reign of one alone
Sham is the only home
I'm feeling friendly
I'm feeling my own
Lord of an empty place
Reign of chill and ghosts
Stage with the curtain down
Where I play the main role
But no one's there to applaud

I've grown old
Thought my world's so cold
Since i fold myself round na icy core
I don't know what I'm living for
If only I'd showed you
How much I loved you
I'd be lord in real world too
A king for the time with you

Lord of an empty place
Reign of one alone
Sham is the only home
I'm feeling friendly
I'm feeling my own

Lord of an empty place
Reign of chill and ghosts
Stage with the curtain down
Where I play the main role
But no one's there to applaud

Take a bow, a roaring crowd
Walls come crashing down
Raise your eyes
And find you're just all alone

Lord of an empty place
Reign of one alone
Open or closed it be
No one at the window
No one knocking at the door
Lord of an empty place
Reign of chill and ghosts
Stage with the curtain down
Where I play the main role
But no one's there to applaud
