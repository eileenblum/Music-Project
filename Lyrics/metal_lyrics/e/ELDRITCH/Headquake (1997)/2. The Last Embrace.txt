Deadly hatred deceitful lies
This plague is carved in my brain
Burn low! Burn alive!
Thoughts corroding my bones
Nailed on a cross, paralyzed
I see my faith collapse,
Paint my eyes, draw my mouth
On a mirror that hides my mask

I lied in silence
Stemmed my passions
Whatever happens, will you
Embrace me again?
Lying in silence
Waiting breathless
All of a sudden it may even be the last

Some black shades obscure the sunrise
Clouds... rain... a foreboding!
He used to spy on me behind a claw wall
When I slept in a bed of thorns

I lied in silence
Stemmed my passions

Whatever happens, will you
Embrace me again?
Lying in silence
Waiting breathless
All of a sudden it may even be the last
I face myself
One day will you embrace me again?
Tonight I'll cry
Next time over the clouds of the world
I will smile
