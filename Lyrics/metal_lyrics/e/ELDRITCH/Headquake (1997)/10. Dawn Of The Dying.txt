Remember the silent waters
The steam of the breathing
The wake 'round a shaded fire
The wait on a barren shore

My mother's been crying now
She'll dress in back
She kept her tears and whispers
Wishing me good luck
My father has turned his face
Turned by toil and sun
To the son who denies him
And everthing he's done

Done is the night
As I'm leaving
While my sad flight begins
Sun of my land
Rise up bening to light the way
I'll bless the new day

The land of my father dies
With our creed
My home land is barren
We couldn't make it breed
My wasteland
I turn my eyes towards the sky
Can't watch you as I kiss you
I kiss my land goodbye

Done is the night
As I'm leaving
While my sad flight begins
Sun of my land
Rise up bening to light the way
I'll bless the new day
