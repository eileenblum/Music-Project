Now my eyes start to smile again
You can't try, can't understand
Leve me in my world
I know my god is cold
Can't stand the heat, never had much fun

Here it comes my winter sun
You can't see it bright
In my own feelings he rises

My only winter, you keep my
Desires alive
My endless winter, confine me
Inside your light
In this garden of Eden I live again
Reassured by hope from my fallings born
Walking on my illusions I breathe the end
How many flowers will die

Got a soul forever doomed to escape
Wandering through a landless path
Rain on my better self
A rose will bloom from my ashes

My only winter, you keep my
Desires alive
My endless winter, confine me
Inside your light

My only winter, you keep my
Desires alive
My endless winter, confine me
Inside your light
In this river my nightmares scatter and drown
I fell free in this higher ground
Swimming in my ilusions, lost in the dark
Where the sky shines black for my eyes
