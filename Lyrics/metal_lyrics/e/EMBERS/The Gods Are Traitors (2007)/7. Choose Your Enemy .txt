I hate your lies! I hate what you are!
Who the fuck are you? What the fuck are you?
What I'd seen for so long, that's all false.
I used to be blind, but I can see clearly.
I used to be blind, but I can see your lies.
What make me angry and It arouses killing instinct against you.
Against only you!
I hate lies! Your fuckin' lies! I hate lies! I despise them!
I won't swallow them!
And now I'm your chosen enemy,
But it was a thoughtless choice of you.
My pride won't let me run away! Choose your enemy!
Because my anger will cut your throat, Through as a blade.
It will cut your throat, through as a blade.
I hate lies! Your fuckin' lies!
My anger opens your vein up, and you'll get drowned in your lies!
In your fuckin' lies! I hate lies! Your fuckin' lies!
I hate lies! I despise them! I won't swallow them!
