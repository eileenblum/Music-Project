All of thought of mine covers my offence.
Everything is condemned to death by you.
All of thought of mine covers my offence.
Everything is condemned to death by your selfishness.
Death by your selfishness.
I can't see because of hate, my curse will chase you forever.
All of thought of mine covers my offence.
Everything is condemned to death by your selfishness.
Look into my eyes, you will see the shine of my hate.
But this is not the shinning of the setting sun,
Or this is not the happy ray of the stars.
This is the shine of hate!
My look beams with determination, covers my thoughts,
Hides my offence, and the shine of my hate.
The shine of hate!
All your fuckin' selfish dreams seem to come true,
When I break them with the shine of my hate.
I break them with the shine of my hate.
I'm the only one, who stops you.
Stop your toundless selfishness.
