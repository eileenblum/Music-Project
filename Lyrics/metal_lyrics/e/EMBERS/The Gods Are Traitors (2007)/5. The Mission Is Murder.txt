They are called the heroes of our age,
Who are marching to the death by command.
"Our lives for the state!"-they shout,
While the past is losing in the grey mystery.
They are killing for us, But not of their own free will.
They are cleaning the world by a violent change,
What's "good" for the humanity.
It's called war by them, But they only slaughter us.
Trampling like machines over the dead bodies,
What are fallen in the front-line.
Why don't they ask us, If need the change at this fuckin' expense?
Why should the innocents' blood overflow For the "True Cause"?
Why don't they hear the painful Echoes of the screams?
The innocents' blood overflow. The mission is murder.
Fuck you! Common! Are they soldiers or heroes?
Oh, no! They're only puppets and murderers!
