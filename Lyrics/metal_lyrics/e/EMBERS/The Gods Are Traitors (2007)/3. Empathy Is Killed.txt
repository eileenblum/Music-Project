We are roaming with vacant looks, we are all empty.
Our bodies are controlled by emotional death.
The contact is lost between us.
I can't see your eyes, because they're closed.
We killed the empathy.
I'm looking for the people's eyes,
But the heads are turned away, Hiding the emotions.

We are roaming with vacant looks, we are all empty.
Our bodies are controlled by emotional death.
The contact is lost between us.
I can't see your eyes, because they're closed.
We killed the empathy.
We step over the man who's fallen down.
We are afraid of looking down,
To the howling suffering in the eyes. In the eyes.

I'd like to feel the contact. I'd like to see the flaming.
I don't wanna be lost in the emptiness.
I'd like the feel the same,
I don't wanna kill the empathy inside me.

You are all dead!
Everyone is executed by indifference.
You are all dead!
I'm still flaming. I don't kill the empathy.
