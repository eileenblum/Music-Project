So many religions, so many gods.
But who's the real one?
Who can we believe in?
Who will provide real support?
Who will help, when we've lost all of our lives?
Who will hinder from the shedding of blood
What's for simple goods?
Where could our prayer gain a hearing,
When children are dying, famine is devastating?
Who will lift us up?
Who will lift us up, when we are kneeling in the mud?

All of the religions are lying, the gods are traitors!
That's all eye-wash!
All of the religions are lying, the gods are traitors!
No mercy, no god! There is no god!
Nobody's helping, nobody's blocking the way of the bloodshed!
No mercy, no god!

So many religions, so many gods.
But who's the real one
Who can we believe in?
Who will hinder from the shedding of blood,
What's for simple goods?
No one and never! There is no god!
Only our children are hearing our prayer,
While they are dying by famine.
