I despise your individual. I will wipe your memory out.
Suffering follows the way of your rotten thoughts.
Shed blood shouts for revenge, Violence earns violence.
Shed blood shouts for revenge, Broken hopes, broken lives.
I see, your killing mind destroys the lives,
Destroys the lives and kills the hope.
Broken hopes, broken lives, broken hopes,
Who gives these back?
Only the hope remained for us,
To get rid of you for the change.
We're gonna survive, we'll wipe you,
We'll wipe your memory out.
We will wipe your memory out,
The way you lived that's how you'll rot.
Nobody weeps, weeps for you, But it's our mistake too.
We are all to blame, not to get rid of you.
You were our pride, you are our shame.
We are all to blame, not to get rid of you.
We'll wipe your memory out,
The way you lived that's how you'll rot.
Nobody weeps, weeps for you, But it's our mistake too.
