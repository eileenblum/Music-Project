The life sweeps away us We forget to live.
We're getting involved in apathy We forget to feel.
We're floating on the surface Then we sink and get drown.
I stand up, enjoy the sunshine With open arms, have a breath of air.
I wanna live. I wanna feel again.
I don't wanna fall. The freedom is within my soul.

The life sweeps away us We forget to live.
We forget to feel. I stand up, enjoy the sunshine
With open arms, have a breath of air.
I break my chains and trample over everyone,
Who holds me back and pulls me down to the deep.
No more bow down! No more compromise!
I can't bear the captivity any longer!
I step over the grey days And I'm flying on invisible wings.
I rather long to be the height, not the deep.

I'm living. I'm feeling. I'm free within my soul.
I rather long to be the height, not the deep.
I'm flying. I'm breathing. I'm free within my soul.
The freedom is within my soul.
I rather long to be the height, not the deep.
I'm flying. I'm breathing. I'm free within my soul.
Let's go! No more bow down! No more compromise!
I can't bear the captivity any longer! Any longer!
