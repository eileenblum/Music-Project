They are playing with our fate.
The truth is hidden by their power.
Our future is influenced by them.
Our freedom is shackled and suppressed.
Our freedom is shackled. Domination can be felt.
They bear down the rebels.
But we are the majority.
Our fate are the stake.
The weapon is in our hands.
We should use that.

We are the weapon. Revolution for us.
The weapon is in our hands. We should use that.
We are the weapon. Revolution for our fate.
The weapon is in our hands, We should not feel fear.
We will force the power to the knees.
The weapon is in our hands. We should use that.
We are the weapon. Revolution for us.
The weapon is in our hands. We should use that.
We are the weapon. Revolution for our fate.
This is a war, where the hope is lost.
Rebels gonna be winners. Power gonna kneel down.
