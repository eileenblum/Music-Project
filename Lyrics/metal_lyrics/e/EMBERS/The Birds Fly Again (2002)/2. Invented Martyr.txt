You are the god of darkness, you bring decay.
You build the future from ruin you have caused.
You sit on your throne as Ceasar and you turn towards the people,
Turning your thumb towards the ground.
The speech you prepared swings masses into the dreams that you will be the one,
Who brings a properus future, that you don't just promise things,
Do you everything for us and too make us free. For our release from misery.
You die as a martyr in front of thousands and thousands but this is only an appearence,
You will rule forever and give Death. But I will be your hangman once!
I will make the flame of embers to set the stake on fire under you!
Your bloody hands and black heart will be purified.
My deed is not guide by hate, but by common sense and hope.
Hope for being released from the misery.
This hope falls into dust because your successor comes to continue your tradition,
The greedy killing.
