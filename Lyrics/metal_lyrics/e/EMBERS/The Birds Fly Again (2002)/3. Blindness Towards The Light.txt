Everyday you wake with doubt and fear.
You fall to your knees for a better day.
Your greed happy, preaching hippourites try to hold,
What you can't grasp.
For believe in a saviour who gave blindman light and nealed the crippled,
Crucified for our sins, but where's he now to help?!
You wait for a star to fall from the sky to bring forth a better change
But now that star has lost its light as falls towards the earth.
You think you understand eternal dream but you don't they do.
They live off you.
I say pride, I wait for forgiveness from the masses,
They say faith but I believe in myself and my life.
You who don't take look into yourself or say who you are.
You say you have values? You are just victims in this world of everlasting darkness.
