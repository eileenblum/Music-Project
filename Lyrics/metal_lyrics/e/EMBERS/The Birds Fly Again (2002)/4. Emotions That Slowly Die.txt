Where is the point, when you say: ENOUGH?! The pride, the anger make you so cold.
There is a deep gulf between us, it's hard to overcome. To fear the first step.
The distance's getting longer. Real problems, silent people. Wounded pride,
Seeking the way out, offendness, fear. Emotions, that slowly die, become hate.
When were we sincere to each other? Lack of understanding pushes us so far.
Supposed or real insults burn inside of us. Our pride keeps us back to talk about them.
Growing distance between us. Can we look in each other's eyes? Can we talk sincere?
No, we'd rather choose a tragic way. What's redemption? What will it bring for us?
Disappointment, forgiveness. You hurt inside. Can you change what can't be changed?
Destroying everything we've built up. We'll pay a stiff price for our past mistakes.
Did we really want it?
