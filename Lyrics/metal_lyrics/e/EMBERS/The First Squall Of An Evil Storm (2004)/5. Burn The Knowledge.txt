Burn the books! Burn the knowledge!
Devastate everything, what you can learn,
What you can learn some new, some new and positive values by.
Stifle the unintelligent beauty of diamonds! Of diamonds!
Stifle the unintelligent beauty of diamonds! Of diamonds!
Well, we can hide behind the scenery of schematic, basic life.
We don't need truth, what we can realize our frail world by. World by.
We don't need love, what we can realize our transitory life by.
We don't need love, what we can realize our transitory life by.
We don't need faith, beauty and knowledge.
We don't need faith, beauty and knowledge.
Why would we make our life more beauty and happier if we can live in a dark cage?
We don't need the hypocritical gods. Kill them!
We don't need the hypocritical gods. Kill them!
Wipe the trait of angels from our faces and let he evil control our
Lives! Our Lives!
Control the only god called power. Burn the books, burn the wormy knowledge!
Be rattling machines, brainless beasts, who perform every program!
Be black demons and burn the wormy knowledge!
Be black demons and burn the wormy knowledge!
Burn the books! Burn the knowledge! Burn the books! Burn the knowledge!
Burn the books and burn the knowledge!
Be black demons and burn the wormy knowledge!
Burn the books!
And we won't have any chance to regret, that we can be humans never again!
