We're lugging the burden of life's difficulties.
But how long are we able to lug it? But how long are we able to lug it?
Where's that point, the limit of our patience, where we've to say: "I'm unable to suffer it!"
Where's that point, when we don't see the rainbow colorful enough?
When everything's turned upside down around us
And our feelings have gotten confused.
When we don't see the way out from the hopeless troubles.
When we don't look for the bridge what leads to the otherside
And we're just staring at the abyss in front of us.
And we don't choose the life. But the absolving death.
Where's this point? Maybe there, where we hear in our heads once: "To be or not to be?
This is the question." What's better for me? What's better for the world? Life or death?
And maybe we'll get answersâ¦ Or there, where neither the answers, nor the questions sound?
Where's this point? Who knows it? All the time with difficulties or prompt absolving death?
Solution or escape? "To be or not to be?" Life or death?
We're lugging the burden of life's difficulties.
But how long are we able to lug it? But how long are we able to lug it?
Where's this point? Who knows it? All the time with difficulties or prompt absolving death?
Solution or escape? "To be or not to be? This is the question!" Life or death?
Solution or escape? Life or death?
