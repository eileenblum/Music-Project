How many tears should come to my eyes, while I can not feel the suffering?
How much time should pass away, while I can see the blissful light?
I can't feel the happiness, I can't see the light.
I can't feel the happiness, I can't see the light.
While you're standing, in front of me, with borrowed smile.
While you're standing, in front of me, with borrowed smile.
You are only a false prophet behind the disguise. You are only mere puppet in a play.
You are only a false prophet behind the disguise. You are only mere puppet in a play.
Everything's valueless beside you, what I've done till now.
Everything's valueless beside you, what I've done till now.
Because you brand me a liar with hypocrite face.
Because you brand me a liar with hypocrite face.
Lost in a hopeless life. I open my arms,
Open my heart, but I get only slaps.
Lost in a hopeless life. I open my arms,
Open my heart, but I get only slaps.
You spit at me, humiliate me, directly by envy.
You only can disparage, because the valuation would be painful for you.
The valuation would be painful for you. For you.
It's easier to spit words at my back, to brand me than to express your sincere opinion.
Every word what I hear from the crowd without face,
Cleaves in two my aching heart like an arrow.
You're slandering and killing me slowly with your hypocritical life.
(Because) I'll bleed to death by this condition,
But I do not want you to watch my agony.
But I do not want you to watch my agony.
With hands in pockets, with borrowed smile.
With hands in pockets, with borrowed smile.
