My tears are flowing on my face, I feel the salted taste on my lips.
My heart is dying, my blood is overflowing.
I press my hand to my chest, I retain the cataract of my blood.
I wipe my tears away, and feel the sweet taste of my blood.
I'm suffering and bleeding to death without you.
I'm suffering and bleeding to death without you.
An emotion, what burns in my heart, cleans my soul.
And brings happiness to my days. And brings happiness to my days.
What breaks the rocks of bitterness down and builds the castle of silence up.
What changes my life, makes light in my eyes, dispels the shadows and lifts me up to the citadel.
Tears and blood. For you. For your love. Tears and blood. For you. For my life.
I'm crying without you, I'm bleeding without you.
You're my brightest star, you're my blood and my tears. You're my life, you're a part of me.
Your love is the only one, what I'm able to live for.
Your love is the only one, what I'm ready to die for.
Tears and blood. For you. For your love. Tears and blood. For you. For my life.
I'm crying without you. I'm bleeding without you. I'm bleeding to death.
I'm crying without you. I'm bleeding without you. I'm bleeding to death.
