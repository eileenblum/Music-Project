You will not turn your back on me, will you? Trust no one?
You will not turn your back on me, will you? Trust no one?
No, I'm unable to do that. There are still friends, who I've every confidence in.
Because I need someone, I can trust. Because I need someone, I can trust.
Everyone needs someone. I hope, I don't have to be disappointed with you.

Can I count on you?
Too many disappointmentsâ¦ Altough one of them is too many tooâ¦
Too many disappointmentsâ¦ Altough one of them is too many tooâ¦
Sincerety, confidence, selflessness. Sincerety, confidence, selflessness.
The three foundation-stones of sincere friendships' bastion.
Hypocrisy, enviousness, selfishness.
Are the thunder, the hurricane and the lighting of the evil storm,
What can raze this bastion to the ground.
Gnawed bone but still true. No one can deny the truth.
It's no tan oldfashioned cliche as so many people think itâ¦
Be lost in the thought! Be lost int he thought!
It's true now and forever, that sincere friendships last forever!
Be lost in the thought! Be lost in the thought!
Gnawed bone but still true!
