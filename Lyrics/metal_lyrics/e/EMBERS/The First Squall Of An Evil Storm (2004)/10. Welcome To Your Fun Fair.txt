Welcome to your exciting, colorful fun-fair!
Try to feel quite well and free from care!
Try to enjoy yourself and live alive,
Because we only live once and it's called your life.
Like the roller-coaster int he fun-fair,
Hills and valleys (of wave) one after the other.
I'm afraid a bit, what will come then,
But it's so exciting ont he other hand.
Like a carousel, what sometimes goes too fast.
Nausea, dizziness or a wonderful feeling.
Like the magic castle, where you can't find the way-out but please, don't lose your mind!
It's like a coaster, what's too steep.
When you've to climb the hole what's too deep.
It's like (a) carousel, what's too fast,
No one waits the round what is the last.
It's like a magic castle what's too dark.
Tears on your face, your life leaves its mark.
You should not live dead but alive in the exciting fun-fair, what's called your life.
Don't be afraid to try a new game,
Maybe it will burn your happiness' flame.
I would like to be the clown, who makes you laugh in the exciting fun-fair what'c called your life.
