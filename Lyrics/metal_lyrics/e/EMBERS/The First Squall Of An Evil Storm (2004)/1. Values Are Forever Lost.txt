I try to get to know the depth of your soul through your eyes.
You try to conceal your emptiness, because your values are lost. Forever lost.
You're nobody in my eyes, nothing more only material existence.
You're nobody in my eyes, nothing more only material existence.
You're a branded lamb in the herd, without thoughts and without emotions.
You're a branded lamb in the herd, without thoughts and without emotions.
You mean only this to me. You mean only this to me.
I try to get to know the depth of your soul through your eyes.
You try to conceal your emptiness, because your values are lost. Forever lost.
(The) values mean nothing in this dying world.
(The) values mean nothing in this dying world.
The values mean nothing in this dying world. Your values are lost too.
Forever lost.
The values mean nothing in this dying world. Your values are lost too.
Forever lost.
Purity, Morality, Innocence, Forever lost, Purity, Morality, Innocence,
Forever lost
Purity, Morality, Innocence, Forever lost, Purity, Morality, Innocence,
Forever lost
Purity, you're unclean for a long while. Morality, it was never for you.
Innocence, forever lost. Forever lost.
You try to stand with dignity in front of people,
You pretend to be honorable, but it's only the appearance,
What's transparent and it doesn't hide your valueless inside. Your valueless inside.
Purity, Morality, Innocence. Forever lost.
These words are only lies from your mouth.
Don't use these words! Don't use these words!
Because you've never known what these mean. Burn in flames of hell! Burn in flames of hell!
I want to see your destruction in purgatory! Unclean innocence, immortal manners.
