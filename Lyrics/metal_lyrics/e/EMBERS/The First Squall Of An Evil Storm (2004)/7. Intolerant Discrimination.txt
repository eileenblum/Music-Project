Your life is a sphere built from pattern.
Your life is a sphere built from pattern.
You do, what the expectancy dictates.
People who live around you, tell you what's right or wrong.
Do you despise me, because it is said, I'm not so good? I'm not so good.
Are you afraid of me, because my person sheds light on you? Sheds light on you.
You don't have to smile, I feel the contempt behind all your decisions.
I want to destroy your conservative world.
I want to enlarge your narrow-mind.
But I can't do it, because I'm afraid,
I'll hurt someone else. Someone else.
I must repress my anger, I must close it so deep,
If I don't want innocents to be wounded.
But I let the storm raging inside me.
I destroy everything, what has to do with your
Discrimination. I break the walls in your mind and thoughts without tolerance.
Why should I be tolerant when nobody is tolerant with me?
Why should I accept the fate, what you intend for me, For me.
When it's only in my hand? In my hand.
Do you want to keep distance from me?
I accept your decision
But you have to understand me too!
Or you have to try to accept my world too.
I want to destroy your conservative world and
I want to enlarge your narrow-mind, narrow-mind.
Because your product only resists me by your intolerant discrimination.
I'll resist till you don't change. I'll resist till you don't change.
Because your product only resists me by your intolerant discrimination.
I will resist till you don't change. I will resist till you don't change.
