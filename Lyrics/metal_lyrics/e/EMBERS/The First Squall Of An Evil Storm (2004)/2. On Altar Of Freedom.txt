I want to live for tomorrow, without limits. I want to touch the sky,
When I stand on the ground with both of my feet.
When I stand on the ground with both of my feet.
I want to embrace every small love, happiness, pleasure and freedom of the world.
I want to feel the sunshine and raindrops when they touch my skin.
I want to live for tomorrow, without limits. I want to touch the sky,
When I stand on the ground with both of my feet.
When I stand on the ground with both of my feet.
I want to embrace every small love, happiness, pleasure and freedom of the world.
I want to feel the sunshine and raindrops when they touch my skin.
I want to see: the flying of the birds, as they fly together,
The light in the darkness, when the moon is dark too.
The hidden truth behind the lies, when I watch the world in the mirror of reality.
I want to experience these all when I stand on the top of the world.
When the bitterness is in flames, the doubt is buried in the frozen ground,
The care and the pain disappears in the thick fog.
The care and the pain disappears in the thick fog.
When there's only me and the freedom.
When there's only me and the freedom.
I want to die on the altar of freedom when I shout with my last breath:
FREEDOM!
Enjoy its every moment!
Because the reality tramples these things down with merciless bitterness.
Oh freedom! You're only a dream, but I'll strive for you till my death!
I want to die on the altar of freedom! I want to sacrifice my life to the freedom!
I want to die on the altar of freedom! I want to sacrifice my life to the freedom!
