My hate is deeper and stronger than ever!
rabid schizophrenia
is destroying my own soul but not my kind
some live, some kill, some die
feel your essence purified as pus
this is infamy
a subliminal fire
hysterical lunacy
beholding the illuminated spaces
contaminating my own suicide
for the weak and worthless masses
for I am the narcissist
neurotic,  addicted
and I am full of death
may the wrathful hell be my eternal place
