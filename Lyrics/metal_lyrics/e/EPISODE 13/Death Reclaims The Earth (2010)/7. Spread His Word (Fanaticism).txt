Now...look at yourselves people
you weak, you feeble creatures
And I will commit myself to death
To His glorious duty and eerie majesty
look at yourselves people
you weak, feeble creatures
did you see the blowing
are your eyes kept closed again ?
And I will commit myself to death
To his eerie majesty
Yes I will commit myself to death
To Him!
Set off the dynamites !
infected is my heart
for I can hear your vulgar voice
5 times a day!
he was everywhere
he is everywhere

hi will be everywhere
just one path
the one. And the only.
