Stay away from that fucking shit
Belief! is my sworn enemy
Blood we shed, Blood we swallow
Blood is the answer
To all your prayers
To all your fears
so sick, razors are painting the skin
So overfucked is my brain
Bleached truth would be revealed
As the nature of living!
Within my skeptic scene
Of all (the) pleasures in one hand
The one hand will wash the pain
I will retrieve my pain
With all ascending snowhite in my scale...
(Go and get your weapon.
Be deprived...of all that you have inside)
