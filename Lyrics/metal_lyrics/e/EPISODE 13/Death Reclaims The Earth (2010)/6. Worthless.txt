Inhale the dust
Dismiss all calculations
This is the age after humans
Civilization, flags, religion
Don't exist any more
They forgot that wisdom should lead
(they) let the weak and the corrupted breed
Constantly banished from every captured field
Now it s turning out Suffer and bleed
DEATH reclaims the earth...
Final existence of the human era is demolished
A fucking sustained slavery is vanished
Father of surviving servants hail the new king
Now it s turning out Respect and bleed !
Initials  How can t you see .. How can you dare?
Visions.. Why can t you feel .. Why can t you see?
Death reclaims the earth...(you fools)
