All the gods I welcomed in...
All the gods I pushed in sin...

A burning anger surrounds the new world
The doom is closer and saying any word

Come with me look at me grope in my darkness...
I will pay for the time you had locked up...

My spell's on you...

Turn back your lands
Ooh the mighty heart
They lashed us upon your suspension time

In this plunder day...
Our insanity...

All the gods I welcomed in...
All the gods I pushed in sin...

A burning anger surrounds the new world
The doom is closer and saying any word

My spell's on you...

Turn back your lands
Ooh the mighty heart
They lashed us upon your suspension time

In this plunder day...
Our insanity...

Roots will turn into ashes
Souls in chains in merciless tombs
Sleeping and weeping on a bleeding century
With the art of lie...
