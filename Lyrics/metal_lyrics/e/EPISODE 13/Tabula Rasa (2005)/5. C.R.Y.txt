No one can take this mess
I'm crawling in my pain
I was always out of help
Same nightmares lick my brain

A drifted memory tries to survive
Day and day it flashes in minds
Our hearts have captured in
Cold Rainy Yesterday...

All the serpents of bloody tears
Are the shades of these numbness times?
We've never seen the guiding stars
Since the innocence was given by the lies

Amorphed prophecy unlightened mourning
Seems to grow on this wealth smelling ground
Suddenly Iâve reached in hollow fleshes
Now it's time to reap and bite my slaves

My pride was elusive... but I had no mistakes
Every second had lost... with my heathen chill in the air
My pride was elusive... but I had no mistakes
Every second had lost... with my heathen chill in the air

Scissors of hatred came for deviation
Insisting on fight, still I have raindrops on my face
Shining sad...

No one can take this mess
