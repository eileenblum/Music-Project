I was adored once...
I shall not forget the indulgence...
Deep in my army I feed the plagues within...
This greedy field... An exhaustion...

Ooh... Sharing the millions of dead wishes...
Into deep the ground will make a sigh...
Sharing the millions of dead wishes...
Into deep the ground will make a sigh...

Cold and the fire are shedding themselves
A harmony... Written on a cerement...

An expected damnation...
In rapture...

I was adored once...
I shall not forget the indulgence...
Deep in my army I feed the plagues within...
This greedy field... An exhaustion...
