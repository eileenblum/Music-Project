When the night turns into dusk
And the shadows embrace with all lives
The gathering of unflinching cells
The gathering of thorns ascending sharp

Submerging dreams... weak and revealed
With loosing anger temptation is concealed
See the path of twisting and tendering game
And we are as one to forever steal
The immense beauty of time
When curtains fall...

Submerging dreams... weak and revealed...
Which desire can hold the flame
Of floating virulence on the sea of darkness
In a sense of Satan I've fixed my loneliness
And I screamed â'I'll search my emptiness''

Submerging dreams... weak and revealed
With loosing anger temptation is concealed
And we are as one to forever steal
The immense beauty of time
When curtains fall...

Submerging dreams...
