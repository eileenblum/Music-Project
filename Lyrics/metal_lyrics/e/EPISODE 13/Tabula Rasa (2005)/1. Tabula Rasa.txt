The journey keeps the sun by the shadows overgrown
Invincible infernal fragments of shroud
We'd demand and we'd soar

I will die with an aimless suffer
I'm possessed in legions of despair

Through the mystic fillings of a tired womb
The new subsistence lies
Buried when the time of helpless pleasures withered in cries
Mutilate it from the deep
I can't taste loss of trust
I'm not shown...

Our mist is trampling...

The journey keeps sin by the shadows overgrown
Inherited from the past desires
We'd demand and we'd soar

I will die with an aimless suffer
I'm possessed in legions of despair

On my own
Now I see...
The earth is blind for me...
To see your scorn...
