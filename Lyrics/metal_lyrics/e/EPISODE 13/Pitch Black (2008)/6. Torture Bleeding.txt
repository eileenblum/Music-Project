Then comes the hour of the abomination,
Fall of human morals by the demonization,
Anti human manifest supreme insanity
Forces never seen by the human eyes

The black past has been written in blood on simple stones
Poisons the souls bring them chaos they fear two thousand years

Bringer of the pain and eternal suffering
Torture to flesh nonstop bleeding
Confused by the paradox everlasting
Son of thy desires and hate of god...

The black past has been written in blood on simple stones
Poisons the souls bring them chaos they fear two thousand years

Torture bleeding

Unlightened, Forsaken, Dishearten
Dishonour, Forsaken, Dishearten
