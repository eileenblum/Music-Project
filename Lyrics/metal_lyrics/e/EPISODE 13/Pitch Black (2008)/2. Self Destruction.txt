I have, I have spoken
Enjoy the black demise
Betray, you betrayers
Taste life blood from your own kind

Ignite waiting darkness
What you fear comes alive
Dry lips, chant damnation
Driving man to self destruction

No one can save you now
Behold the black demise
Cursed gods have forsaken
The lands of ruined mankind

Invades human nature
This lost and perfect rapture
Evil domination
Driving man to self destruction

Enjoy the black demise!!!

Taste life blood from your own side
Feel your flesh burning inside
Darkness blinds your perception
Driving man to self destruction

Enjoy the black demise!!!
