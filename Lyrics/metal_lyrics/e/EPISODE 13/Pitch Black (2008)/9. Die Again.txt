The war with the light will never end
Their blood flows through their last stand
Tear his chest for severe wounds
With sharp stakes and biting stones
Time to choose, choose your side
It's time to die defend your sight
Time to choose, choose your side
Time to die, die for your fight

Here's the sign with a shining bone
Let him reign in his rotting throne
Nevermore blessed by the heaven's grace
Scream as you burn in the rising flames
Time to choose, choose your side
It's time to die defend your sight
Time to choose, choose your side
Time to die, die for your fight

Lands of fire and flaming corpses
Crushed by the hands of shapeless, fleshless
Seas of the blood and darkened sky
Let dawn fill with fallen's cry

If you're down again
Call my name and beg for me
Soon you die again
Die again and die again
Die...
