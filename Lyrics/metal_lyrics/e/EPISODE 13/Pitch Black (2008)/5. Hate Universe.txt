Bleed Bleed Bleed like a whore
Kneel on your knees, suffer more and more
Blood Blood Blood for salvation

Dead by now, creatures of hate universe
All shall die, an existence nonsense

Praise the sins and the intense feelings
Burning down all the morals and beliefs
Made of bones these secret tombs
The place where we break cosmic chains

Dead by now, creatures of hate universe
All shall die, an existence nonsense

Hate...
