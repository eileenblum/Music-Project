Mankind!  Born to guilt and shame
Stand for! For the gates of hell

Vision for the dead eye
A song for the deaf
One word for the possession
The icon of death

Daylight! Still hide your sins?
Lights out! For the extinction begins

Vision for the dead eye
A song for the deaf
One word for the possession
The icon of the death

Time has come for extinction
My hatred for your race strengths my precision

Vision for the dead eye
A song for the deaf
One word for the possession
The icon of the death
