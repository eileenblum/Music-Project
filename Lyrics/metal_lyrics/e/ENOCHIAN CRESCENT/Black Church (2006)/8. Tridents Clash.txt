Vel, vel

Om namah shivaya

For three days and nights
I have not slept nor fed
Dancing and drugs blur my mind
And as a proof of faith
His metal pierced my face
The mighty trident, cheek thru cheek

Vel, vel

Om namah shivaya

For thirty days and nights
I haven't been outside
Prayer and rice still my mind
This is a proof of fate
A living sacrifice
Burn needlessness in his fire

Burn!

Stoke the fires up
Thick smoke fills the restless air
Ritual damaru
Chanting and praying under his divine stare

Shivalingam response
A sadhulike trance
Rousing me from the sleep of life towards the
Cleansing in flames of agni

Om namah shivaya

For thirty years of life
I haven't been alive
Until I scrambled the mound of red hot coals
That was a proof of faith
Lord Shiva, Tandava
He shall burn this world

And put out the stars of heaven
