The bitter grapes we have took
And drugs in this emerald juice
Shining as flowers in morning
Abloom on our graves

Should we ever wake again
From sleep all crowded with dead men

Price makes this cult so different
From all others
Even as rigor settles in
We're standing amongst them all fallen

Shining as we enter circle ready
To sign our lives away

La Fee Verte sorcery
The taste with graveyard legacy
Shining green flames in fields
Of bewitched outgrown graves

A pale lady with the looks
And a loving smile like a meathook
Shining with my white bones
A gift I leave her for forever twilight

Spirit of the spirits said
Whispering with the sweetest nightmares
Toast for the living enjoying decadence
I spell the name and ring the bell
