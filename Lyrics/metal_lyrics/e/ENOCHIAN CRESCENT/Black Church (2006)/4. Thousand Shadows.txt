Shadows crawl
Over the christian kingdom
Shadows crawl, shadows crawl

Shadows grow
In twilight every inch a demon
Shadows grow, shadows grow

Shadows roll
Blacken skies come down
Shadows roll, shadows roll

Shadows growl
Haunt their graveyards with terror
Shadows growl, shadows growl

Cloaked in darkness we wait
Patient, sharpening the blades
To cut and carve our names
In family tree of human waste
And feed all the young
With blood of the days gone by
The day the daylight dies
And the mother of the thousand comes

Oh Black Goat!
Oh thou with a thousand young!
Spread a forest and a desert
Where was history of human life

Shadows foul
Shrouds on daylight the lifegiver
Shadows foul, shadows foul

Shadows own
In end our dust and bones
Shadows own, shadows own

Shadows hold
To the unknown on doorstep of yours
Shadows hold, shadows hold

Shadows stole
What they were yesterday not given
Shadows stole, shadows stole

Leave no stone unground
No door with an unbroken hinge
With every curse a prayer
And with every cut a gift
