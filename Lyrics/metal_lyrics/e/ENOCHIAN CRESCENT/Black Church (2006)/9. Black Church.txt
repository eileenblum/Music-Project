Grim gateway of tortured stone
Opens in an accursed threshold
They only think it's a hall for their tortured lord
Here is so many ways a figure covered in blood

Covered in blood
Covered in blood
Another black church
For the other god
Another black church
For the dark lord

Crushing the weight of light
Stained glass stains their altar
Deceivingly faithful to measures but not right
Lift for praise on black pedestal the high craft
The high craft
The high craft
Another black church
For the other god
Another black church
Built all for all of their satans!

Here fools pray for the fools god
Echoes go 'bout turning the prayal around
The church laughs with diamonds in stone cracks
Only the black abyss staring back
As they lift their faces to face their savior, their redeemer
Here by calls to vesper their
Christ is the Lucifer
Christ is the Lucifer
Christ is the Lucifer
Another black church
For the other god
Another black church
For the dark lord
