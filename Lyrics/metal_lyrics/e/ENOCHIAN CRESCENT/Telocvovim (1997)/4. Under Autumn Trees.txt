Under Autumn trees
Black is my heart and Dark shall it be
I Forsake the evergreen
Gray Wisdom Churns the Coppered leaves

I am Blessed with Truth
Ascending life
And Surreal
Sadness Divine

Under Autumn trees
I embrace the bliss and kiss the soil
The Embittered ground
A Sentinel of All Darkest Lores
And Solitude
My Tranquil Throne Yet Sinister

...And I whisper like The Autumn leaves

Absorb the balance and yearn for Knowledge
Impale the obscene of blind compassion
A humble prayer (is) a fatigue lie
Push the falling, it's A New Millenium

And you'll pass on

Under Autumn trees
Golden Flame Burns for Eternity
Descending to Darkness
Ether Temptation of a saviour
Under Azure skies
I Die to recall The Pain

I've passed into The Afterworld...
