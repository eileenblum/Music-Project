The Shattering sky and Soaring Blackness
Torn by the wind, my eyesight Fails

Centennial Blood-Feud, The Craft of War
Transcend even Death itself

Cut Down the humble, Cut Down the meek
Cut Down the pious, Bonedancer

Kingdom Come
A Kingdom Done

Unchain The Daemons, Let Slip The Ungodly Host
By Ealden Magick, The Runes of Power
Teeth of Cunning Bow and Sharp Sword
An old opponent, I seek your wyrd

Cut Down the humble, Cut Down the meek
Cut Down the pious, Bonedancer

LET THE HARVEST BEGIN!

The Shattering sky and Soaring Blackness
Torn by the wind, my eyesight Fails

Phobos and Deimos, Terror and Fear
My Wicked mistresses, Uncleanly love

Cut Down the humble, Cut Down the meek
Cut Down the pious, Bonedancer

Kingdom Come
A Kingdom Done
