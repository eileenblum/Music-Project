I call The Fire from within.
Let Thy Flames grow stronger and burn higher
till the enemy is won within me.

Let Thy Fiery Tongues
lick my soul to Charcoal Black.
Let Thy Blaze burn the worm
that gnawed my soul and made me weak.

Let Thy Embrace burn me
till nothing's left but The Purest Essence of Wrath.

Let Thy Inferno
grow stronger and stronger...
till nothing's left
but The Fire of Thine
growing stronger and stronger...
burning within me.

I pray upon Thee
burn away the disease that weakens me.
Pity, compassion and love,
faeces spawned by humanity.
Burn them all away!!!
Burn away all that makes a human of me!!!

Leave only Wrath
to grow and thrive within me,
to consume all within me,
and to reign me for all eternity.

MAKE ME THY HAMMER OF WRATH!!!

Let Thy Flames burn forever and ever and ever and ever!!!
