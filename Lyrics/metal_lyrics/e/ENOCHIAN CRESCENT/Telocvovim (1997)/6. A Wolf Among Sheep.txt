I stand proud atop of the mountain
Made of Skulls of my enemies

I am True God among the mortals
Bow before Me!!!

I Rape myself with my own Might
I ride the winds of Eternal Night

I am The Venom in your veins
The Fear in your pathetic heart

I am Hate Incarnate
And I Am Eternal!!!

I Rape myself with my own Might
I am and will always be A Wolf among sheep

Hate Conquers all, Hate Conquers all
I am A Wolf among sheep
A Conqueror among slaves
Hate Conquers all, love will Fall!!!
Eternal Hate Incarnate
A Wolf among sheep

I am The King of My Realm
A Conqueror among slaves

For The Beasts of the field
Are of My Race

I Rape myself with my own Might
I am The One who Conquers over all!!!

Hate Conquers all, Hate Conquers all
I am A Wolf among sheep
A Conqueror among slaves
Hate Conquers all, love will Fall!!!
Eternal Hate Incarnate
A Wolf among sheep
