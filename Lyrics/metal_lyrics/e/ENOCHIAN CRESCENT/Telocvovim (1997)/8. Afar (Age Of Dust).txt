Thee I Invoke, Spirit of The Overcoming
With Drugs of MASHU, My Shaman Magick

Self-inflicted, be Thou The Sword behind me
As I go Afar, to The Age of Dust

...Remember... ...Remember...

Thee I Invoke, Spirit of The Sunset
In The Name of The Most Mighty Hosts, I stand firm

Necromantic Art, Dwellers of CUTHA
I Desire to Speak Thee, to Travel Black Earth

From The Unknown God, protect me
From The Unknown Daemon, protect me
From the unknown enemy, protect me
As I go Afar, to A Baneful World

Thee I Invoke, Mistress of The Rising Star
For We Shalt Fornicate, Debauchery of Sodom

Drink of My Seed, be Thou The Eyes behind me
Stand at my side, at The Gate of No Return

...Remember... ...Remember...

Thee I Invoke, Thee I Shalt Serve
An Ancient Pact, Borne of Sumer

The Spear behind me, The Armor behind me
As I go Afar, to The Age of Dust

From The Unknown God, protect me
From The Unknown Daemon, protect me
From the unknown enemy, protect me
As I go Afar, to A Baneful World

And when The Spirit of The One Called Appears
May The Dead Rise and smell The Incense

UTUK XUL Ta Ardata Barra Uug
KUTULU Ta Attalakla!!!
