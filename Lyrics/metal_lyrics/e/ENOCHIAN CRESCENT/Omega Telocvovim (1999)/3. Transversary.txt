Cryptic lore of the Black Crosse
As transversary called by Dee
Sinister with latent horror
After the sixteen next the gate

The Evil Angels
Minsters and Servants
The Trumpeters of Great Vision

EAST - Sickness and Death
SOUTH - Coining and Gambling
NORTH - Changes of Form
WEST - Evil use of the Elements

Transformation of the world
Through inverted names of a god
Apocalypse will be revived
We sing the songs of silver blades

The Evil Angels
Minsters and Servants
The Trumpeters of Great Vision

EAST - Sickness and Death
SOUTH - Coining and Gambling
NORTH - Changes of Form
WEST - Evil use of the Elements

The questions that went unanswered
For Kelley and John Dee
Are now dawning upon us
Secrets of the Transversary
