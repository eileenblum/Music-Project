Conditions remainâ¦ required to exit from this existence.
Although a solution seems impossible, I dread to fall into the cycle.

Attrition attainedâ¦ desire to plunge further in the sea of humanityâ¦ is no longer persistent or possible. I long for a time when nothing seemed impossible.

This is not a welcoming.
From the underworld to the overground
I belongâ¦ anywhereâ¦ but here.
The mask has fused to my face, I have become my disguise
And all I despise.

As I plunge deeper still into this social abyss,
All I'm taught, all I retain
Reminds me of how much I've changed.

Deeper, further, I watched rebel lungs explode inside.

Deeper still the sockets rupture.
On they plunge and disintegrate.
Become nothing, become nothing, become nothing,
Become nothing moreâ¦ than desensitized drops in an immeasurable ocean.
