What a wish, what a shift, what a twist of fate. All we waste, all we break, did we agitateâ¦ all we have, all we know, underneath our feet? Choke it down, spit it up - a spoiled piece of meatâ¦ is getting harderâ¦ and harder to identify. Crooked cooking, no one's looking
up the alibi. What a wish, don't you wish it was as simple asâ¦ an answerless question no one needs to ever ask?

If all you doâ¦ this time aroundâ¦ come back to you
Always, but often in disguise.
And all you doâ¦ to those aroundâ¦ would scar you too
Are you planning to survive?
