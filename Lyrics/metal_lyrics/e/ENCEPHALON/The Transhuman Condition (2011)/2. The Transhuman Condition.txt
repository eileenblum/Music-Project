The setting sunâ¦ may soon go down
And some may fretâ¦ but I don't

THIRDâ¦ EYE - EMERGES
To OPENâ¦ WIDE - ACROSS MANKIND
HIVEâ¦ MIND - AWAKE
A new DAWN of COMPLEXITY comes

And some say stormsâ¦ will pierce the sky
Before our timeâ¦ to move off

TOâ¦ KNOWâ¦ the DEPTHS of INFINITY
IS TO KNOW that EVERYTHINGâ¦. that COULD BE
Has BEEN and FOREVER WILL BE

[Chorus:]
A CHANGE must COMEâ¦ to form NEW LIFE
As EGOS fallâ¦ and CELLS DIVIDE
DON'T hold your breathâ¦ and close your eyes
You'll be left crawling... UN-EVOLVED INSIDE

THIRDâ¦ EYE - EMERGES
To OPENâ¦ WIDE - ACROSS MANKIND
HIVEâ¦ MIND - AWAKE
A new DAWN of COMPLEXITY comes

[Chorus:]
A CHANGE must COMEâ¦ to form NEW LIFE
As EGOS fallâ¦ and CELLS DIVIDE
DON'T hold your breathâ¦ and close your eyes
You'll be left crawling... UN-EVOLVED INSIDE
