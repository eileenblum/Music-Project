When you getâ¦ what you gave for answers
You'll regretâ¦ trying to face your selfish ways.
What you saidâ¦ to shift the blame from your head
Will not disguiseâ¦ the fault you wreak of.

They follow you down
They follow you down past the grave.
I just hit the groundâ¦ I just didn't fall in place.
They wont make a sound
They don't make a sound because of faith,
You're breaking it downâ¦ with every change you don't make.

By muting the blindâ¦ and blinding the deaf, you've forced them to trust.
They march in your linesâ¦ 'till I can't control or conceal my disgust.
So I walk awayâ¦ taking no part in this parade
But its your nerve to sayâ¦ I'm not doing what I know to be right.

They follow you down
They follow you down past the grave.
I just hit the groundâ¦ I just didn't fall in place.
They wont make a sound
They don't make a sound because of faith,
You're breaking it downâ¦ with every change you don't make.
