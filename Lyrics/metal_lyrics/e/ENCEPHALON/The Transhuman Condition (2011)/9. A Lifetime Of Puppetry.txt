So goes the quest
From furthest east to farthest west
To live a life you could call blessed
But underneath what you'd suggestâ¦ is not as divine

High as the wind may blow
Low as the deepest undertow
I tried to uncover you
Now I discover that you are a LIGHTâ¦ that LIVES in SHADES
You shine so brightâ¦ as color fadesâ¦ out of this life
So just tonight, please shed some lightâ¦ on a lie so black that you call white

High as the wind may blow
Low as the deepest undertow
I tried to uncover you
Now I discover that you are ALIVE

There's no time to sleep
I can't count another sheep that WASTES its POTENTIAL
WAITING onâ¦ a fucking MIRACLE

I won't close my eyes
I WON'T LIVE a LIFE of FEAR for FUTURE PUNISHMENT
I will CAST my OWN JUDGMENT

There's NO TIME to SLEEP
I CAN'T COUNT another SHEEP that WASTES its POTENTIAL
WAITING ONâ¦ a FUCKING MIRACLE

Burn among the treesâ¦ i find room to breath.
Drawing my conclusions free from foreign illusions

If I look back, I still see a lifetime of puppetry
Hollow dolls who fail to see whose hands their strings do lead
Lead us from explanation
Deliver us from an equation
That will cut us free
THAT WILL CUT US FREE

I won't close my eyes
I WON'T LIVE a LIFE of FEAR for FUTURE PUNISHMENT
I will CAST my JUDGMENT

There's NO TIME to SLEEP
I CAN'T COUNT another SHEEP that WASTES its POTENTIAL
WAITING ONâ¦ a FUCKING MIRACLE
