Commit yourselfâ¦ submit to intimacy
To your true self, to the one you forget every time.

If you MUST be VILIFIEDâ¦
To be PURIFIED
You'll be JUSTIFIEDâ¦
ON the INSIDE
FINALLYâ¦ ALIVE

Iâ¦ don't know destinationâ¦ I just wait to find you there
You just hide behind a stare
Iâ¦ don't know condemnationâ¦ I just love to take your blame
Take pleasure in the price I pay
No I don't know where I begin and you end
So follow this vein to the heart that bleeds between us all

Commit yourselfâ¦ submit to intimacy
(Say what you've been told and taught and forced while you complain)
To your true self, to the one you forget every time.

You MUST be VILIFIEDâ¦ to be PURIFIED
You'll be JUSTIFIEDâ¦ ON the INSIDE
FINALLYâ¦ ALIVE

Iâ¦ see endless complication
And limitless frustrationâ¦ causedâ¦ by everything perceived as flaws
All Iâ¦ know is domination
The effortless equation usedâ¦ to ever feel a thing from you
No I don't feel as if we're still ascending
Fall back down face first and meet the ending

Fall back down face first and fall back down face first and fall back down face first And fall back down face first

Iâ¦ never believedâ¦ that the door would close on me
As you leaveâ¦ would I fall back down to my knees?
Say what you've been told and taught and forcedâ¦ while you complain
Say what you've been told and (say what)

Commit yourselfâ¦ submit to intimacy
To your true self, to the one you forget every time.

You MUST be VILIFIEDâ¦
To be PURIFIED
You'll be JUSTIFIEDâ¦
ON the INSIDE
FINALLYâ¦ ALIVE
