There was a time I'd suck all the poison from your throat.

Does it really end here?
You haven't seen shit
And you're already blind.

Twisted sunrise turns everything faint to coax you from your black hole.

Comeâ¦ come aliveâ¦ in lightâ¦ before my eyes - but dead in my mind.
Comeâ¦ come aliveâ¦ in lightâ¦ before my eyes - but dead in my mind.

So just let it end hereâ¦ in this light.
With your claws sunk in tight to any other black-mailed knight in shattered armor. Kissed black by a poison tongue.
As you snapâ¦ and you curl, I know it wouldn't be right
Not to fight youâ¦ and to see youâ¦ devourâ¦ us tonight.

No warning sign.
No Morning light on this horizon.

Comeâ¦ come aliveâ¦ in lightâ¦ before my eyes - but dead in my mind.
Comeâ¦ come aliveâ¦ in lightâ¦ before my eyes - but dead in my mind.
