Time after timeâ¦ we've given up our home
And stepped into a voidâ¦ of nothing we know

Why do we search for shelterâ¦ when all we do is run?
Cast a curse on the savioursâ¦ oh what have we become?
I followâ¦ just to get where you have come
I couldn't make itâ¦ your peace where I found none

[Chorus:]
Mistook the calling of daylight for morning sun
And stayed too long as the daze of our mourning began

Time after timeâ¦ we've loosened our hold
We traced every lineâ¦ and feared what we wrote

And ALL we've DONE
To STOP this WAR
MIGHT have MATTERED
To a GOD WORTH FIGHTING FOR

[Chorus:]
Mistook the calling of daylight for morning sun
And stayed too long as the daze of our mourning began
