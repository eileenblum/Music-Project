[Chorus:]
Drop dead, leave the life that you're living behind
Was it all that kind?
Drop dead, leave the life that you're living behind
(Drop dead drop dead drop)
I'm beginning to get the pictureâ¦ buried under misunderstanding
I'm beginning to find the answerâ¦ I've been askingâ¦ all this time

Life didn't let youâ¦ pass your timeâ¦ the way most others do
Motherâ¦ did they let you know your daughter's dying?
As they watched you blow your mind
You seem fine

[Chorus:]
Drop dead, leave the life that you're living behind
Was it all that kind?
Drop dead, leave the life that you're living behind
(Drop dead drop dead drop)
I'm beginning to get the pictureâ¦ buried under misunderstanding
I'm beginning to find the answerâ¦ I've been askingâ¦ all this time

I couldn't let youâ¦ into my life

There's no time for anotherâ¦ disaster
Destined epicâ¦ to switch us from fall into careeningâ¦ out of line
Daughterâ¦ did they let you know you're catatonic?
And the moods you show have been programmedâ¦ into your mind?

[Chorus:]
Drop dead, leave the life that you're living behind
Was it all that kind?
Drop dead, leave the life that you're living behind
(Drop dead drop dead drop)
I'm beginning to get the pictureâ¦ buried under misunderstanding
I'm beginning to find the answerâ¦ I've been askingâ¦ all this time
