Once I tried to integrate and modernize.
Learnt my lines, knew my crimes, cut my ties.
Survival was not a priority.

(Survivalâ¦ was not a priority)

Did not take me long to realizeâ¦ I can't take all of your sides.
Summoned as a single wound bleeds
More sharks than I could ever feed.

Just then I knewâ¦ that nothing I doâ¦ will ever change you.

Sets of extroverted eyesâ¦ cutting me back down to size.
Social-life-support failing.
Regenerate another shell to replicate all of this pain.

Just then I knewâ¦ that nothing I doâ¦ will ever change you.

A human shieldâ¦
A human shield...

I never listen to intention, just the sound of the bodiesâ¦ falling.

Last time when the shadows surrounded the light
I had to shoot throughâ¦ my human shield.

Just then I knewâ¦ that nothing I doâ¦ will ever change you.
When will you seeâ¦ that none of this is me?
It's never easy.
