I WILL RISE

Drug me up and crucify me, I want to feel nothing but your betrayal
Nail me down and medicate what I'd assassinate if I weren't so frail

What is another black hole to a dead sky's stars?
What is a fresh wound to a body so full of scars?

Bleed me out and purify me, I'm in need of cleansing of what I've failed
Sail me down the ocean's face so I confront my fate in a ghost storm's gale

[Chorus:]
I WILL RISE
I will FIND... ROOM to GROW
Or a PLACE to DIE

It's decay in their eyesâ¦ widow black, withered white
I hope they see the price of deceit
Rot away in my mindâ¦ don't look back, don't deny
We all have what you've called demons

[Chorus:]
I WILL RISE
I will FIND... ROOM to GROW
Or a PLACE to DIE
