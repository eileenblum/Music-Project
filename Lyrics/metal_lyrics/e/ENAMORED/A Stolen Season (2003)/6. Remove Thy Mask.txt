Faceless, you confront me void of winter in your gaze Nameless, you reject me your brittle heart a whitewashed maze Heedless,
you ignore my sadness yet to your will i must now bend Heartless, you're consumed by madness My destroyed heart will not mend
Remove thy mask of sorrow falsehood to cover up your glee Entranced by hidden wonders from deepest tragedy Remove thy mask of
sorrow falsehood to cover up your glee and i shall rend asunder my need to flee And in the maelstrom's fury I will be forever
battered neverending shocking hatred I will be forever sworn to thee Remove thy mask of sorrow falsehood to cover up your glee
Entranced by hidden wonders from deepest tragedy Never again shall i breach the surface forever suspended between times now i am
forced to confront a destiny i cannot fully comprehend my cries frozen as winter descends As my heart is pierced my soul shall
scream i bid you stop for this is no dream i have become naught but your slave at your whim i am Thrust into the grave
