step within my blackened mind wither in the prison of my barren heart set in stone older than time destiny infects my path the
bitter curse of loneliness wraps its strangling tendrils around me -windswept wastelands of eternal solitude- embodied in a
single dying breath as the soliloquy echoes from here to never my haggard voice begs release ending now i'm falling into infinity
the dim recession into carnality insurmountable frigidity --snow fall-- a desolate landscape of the soul within bleached white
devoid of reason eternal abyss I embrace the rigors of longsuffering i defy the presence of my inner pain my last cry broke me as
the night ensnared the dawn
