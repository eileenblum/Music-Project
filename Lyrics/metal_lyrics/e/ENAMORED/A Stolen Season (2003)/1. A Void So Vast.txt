True solace found in solitude yet it rings false A black darker than night a void so vast in the absence of light struck with
the withered limbs of misconstrued love a black darker than night a void so vast in the absence of light energies spent forever
black forever hopeless illimitible night strangles fleeting light you bend and shatter my soul to pieces (i am a useless shell)
beckon to the fog call upon the wolves to drag me to hell
