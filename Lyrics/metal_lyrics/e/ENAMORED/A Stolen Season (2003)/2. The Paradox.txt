I am spineless I am unlike he who made me I am imperfect no will to better myself I rot in squalor sedentary lifeless shell I
bask in filth my own circle of hell hope squandered on me and then you turn away disgusted that you can't understand my pain
wretched heartless void of earth destroying me since my birth enveloping all i know into the abyss of the black hole lukewarm
stuck in mire venerated by fire and still i decay dead leaves destroyed by the rain
