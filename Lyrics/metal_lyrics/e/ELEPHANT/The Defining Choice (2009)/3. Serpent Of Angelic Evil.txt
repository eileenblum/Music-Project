No apologies for hunger
No shame of the urge to feed
See the blood of balancing life
Evil known in a living circle
Shadowed dreams of a darkness fair
Hawks and doves engaging the mind
Laughing nymphs and striding goddesses
Sucking on the tongue that devours

Consumed by a cruel artistry
Avenge the stains of the relentless throne

Joyous healing in the revelation of hatred
Grief ecstatic in the clarity of horror
Animalistic groans ripped from the body
Wrenching wild in crazed delight

Helpless fly in a spider's web
Breathing the fiery musk of greed

Tiny victim under control
Asking whether to release
Raising tension to quaking screams
Roaring exaltation

Fierce magnificence swallowing millenia
The true visage of an elegant tyrant
