I am that which darkness fears
The voice of anguish taunting you
False evidence appearing real
What is not but could be if
I am the echo of your failure
The grandfather of your despite
Standing reserved with arms crossed
Glaring, leering, smug and solemn

I am the phantom waiting for your fall
The possessive lover taking your breath
Agony, tragedy, suffering and pain

I am the grand obscenity
The living mirage of constant doubt
See your reflection in my eyes
Timid, reluctant and insecure

The newborn child is guilty of every crime
Ever committed by man
Shifting ever inward and away
As the final virgin lies slain by the maiden's wrath

Nightmares unite with the torture of waking
As the first jealousy rises
And the jaws expand to devour

Sleeping stars awaken the masquerade
Disguised abhorrence in the boiling lake
Another dies as another is called
Inexorable night and the shadows will feed

Crying for help, unable to speak
Dying unmourned, screaming unheard
At the mouth of hell in the valley of the sun
All hope is drained in the death embrace

Times of crisis, a vision of no future
Formless apprehension of perceived loss
Twisting of speech from a desperate mind
Birthed the legend of the defining choice
