A force of fury fueled by grief
And the abysmal silence
Harvest of destroyed purpose
Paragon of suffering
Stench of mentals defiles the face
Cinders of the womb inhaled
Haunting talisman manipulates
Binding fields of the thaumaturge

Ancient microcosm, inferior command
Barren hollow of the terrible mountain
Glowing ways of the eternal craft
Reaching the mind that dwells within

Guided by the blood of the slain
Nemesis throne amidst the crimson pyramids

Cleansing fires to purge the slate
Funnelled through her effigy
Daring the magicks
This night my legions walk the sky

Dark clouds swirl above the breaking dawn
Conjure chilly moonscapes and slumbering nightmares
Whisper zephyr winds of an alien sun
Black worlds under the glare of strange eyes

Slitting the throat of the enchanted doe
Wine of wrath clips the wings to the kingdom
Hear me, keeper of mysteries
Conflicted by approaching dimensions

Veiled upon the hill laughs a haunted heart
Eternity of stars in a netherworld of souls
Onyx vision to flowing tonic
A burning gaze that purifies the abyss
