From the abyss of night
Is risen the glow
Silent shells shall open
Ghosts who reigned a thousand hells
Scripts of life, the scrolls of time
Arrive at death's threshold
Stars are the eyes of space
Sands give untold millenia

Cloven darkness unleashed
Fire envisioned by the spine
Dreams and thoughts fall to the ground
Screaming into lands of glass

Desire to know the reasons
Hanging lunacy bleeds
Transparent lifeline ceases
Timeless revenge

I come in the prescence of my dead
While encountering rulers past
Trying but the dust wouldn't see
Passing the rising writs

Heavens engrave a celestial inferno
Over the moon and the high horizon
Slow ending of a hateful sleep
Devastating sins of the lacerating sword

I feel now as I did the day I died
Myriad earths without system
Echoes and songs resting here
Flickering in drowning whispers

Doorways complete unlock transformation
Cold terror preserves the gates

So days last as the wind
Capture awake the only breath
When voice and word upon the air
Only down the soul in slumber

Obscure despair in debris
Mortal lies and scattered flesh
Fury prevails, purity forged
Awakened and seeking

Portals collide
In transcendent flight
Fulfill all that tramples below
In restless dreams of my demise
