Intuitive dreams, an inner flow
Synergy of visions, the seventh sight
Darkness surrounds the fear that refines
Journeys heighten the plateau
Nothing before knowing, time and the after
Emptiness perceived in hindsight
If this will end in failure
I cannot lose by daring the conflict

Minds engorged, brimming with sickness
Scared of the suffocating chase
Protector, defender, champion condemned
Not beyond but all within understanding

Perversion is surrendering choice
Corruption of purpose
Weakness spurred by the waste of an oath
Extinguish the groveling flesh

Beasts roll in nightmares, bodies found in sunrise
No foes but self to mar the way
I will succeed where the mighty have failed
Because I am not them

Compass of infinite stray desires
Light the clay black as love
Bites precious the eternal realm
Burning the ruler's requiem

Standing restless
Transcending fantasy
Nights of thought beyond all craving

I'm in the sun, hiding and lost
But at the bane of the newest day
Blood of the pure will howl as fire
Quaking outward from the fault

Strange are the moments as chance recedes
Yet I continue against the face
Covered by the frothing dark
My voice is still my own
