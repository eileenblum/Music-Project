Error in the creation room
Subterrestrial, chaotic and mad
Aware of every aspect of self
The olden fist of the doctor's path
Harrow the kin and slaughter the flesh
Attendant spirit, being or devil
Hands of minutes destroy the blind
Gaining reason at midnight's tune

Fashion a chimera from genetic disarray
Engineer a race of man, demon, and machine

Tormenting persistent wraith
Procreating a wicked feast
Souls bewitched threaten the unborn
Modern ravers of nobility and skill

A flash of intuition to a rising revelation
Hellish, deranged, roaring and wild
Terminate the centuries, hushing the voice
Understanding their obscure choices

Bleeding suns pour into the veins
Fertile embers fanned by funeral winds
The ultimate never shall die reborn
Words remain as little wars
Jaws diseased have been disfigured
By all the evil they have spoken
Enthroned by thinning screams
Swimming an embrace of ritual flames
Prying mastermind plays insanity
Made inside the creatures seed
Born the victim of the lightning monstrosity
Strike alive in vain delirium
Primal strains of ancient disease
Fall in a whirlwind of glowing pain
Weapons crafted in a maze of fire
He who kills is prouder than the storm
