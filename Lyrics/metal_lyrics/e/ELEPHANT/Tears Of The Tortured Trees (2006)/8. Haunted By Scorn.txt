Haunted by scorn
The Wolf retreats amongst the tortured trees
Grim, alone and betrayed
A doomed son hangs his head

Lost to dying, a hideous sensation
Brooding in desolate gloaming
Beasts of darkness, demons of light
Have hunted in my dreams since the last extinction of man

Those of the sky
Those with hearts of iron
Those who have loved
Have long since died

The entity unknown has awakened to its ancient name
The heaving serpent in chains of the underworld
He makes the deep sea boil and leaves a shining wake
Commander of the falling waters and of all the creatures within

The dragon wears a crown of stars
Serenading the return of The Countess and the one from the moon
Exploring the seas of distant planets
Melding with the benighted waves to where no man durst follow
