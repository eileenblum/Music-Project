Once, long ago
Before the splendor of light
When unicorn and serpent were beautiful
With the first blazing innocence
Sylvan purity harbored
In eternal precious souls
The balance of the universe
In the chiming harmony of dawn
Exiled upon the ancient paths
Of the brothers Order and Chaos
As the souvenirs of youth
Become the silent laments of maturity
Yet forgiveness lives in dreams
Beneath the black oak
For the sun was given to all
And even Darkness himself should be loved
