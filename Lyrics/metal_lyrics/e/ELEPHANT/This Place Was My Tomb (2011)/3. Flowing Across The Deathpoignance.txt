Formation and fusion of trance
Along seas of The Deathpoignance
Wide like the mynd that lies awake
As a feverweary nomad
Imagination never sleeps
Blind senses scream in shock
Before perception, a gorge

Refraction and inversion through the lens
Colors float in flesh of eyes
Hanging from the surface of the sky
Visions recede like a wave
Comets yoked through the deep
Lighting the knowledge of centuries

Shredded sails of magnetic stone bellow in the storm
Brains float as reptiles against concentric sunsets
Fall the skull of fire upon oceans upon oceans

Dormant villages of manacled souls
Enveloped by inferno
Blistered and charred
Masses in the tonsils of crypts
In the shadows in shame
Pens cut like swords across paper in hand
Words incinerated by the codex devourer
Tapping, biting, returning consciousness
Frostclad desolation is the prelude to rebirth
Benevolent forces in butterfly patterns
Skeletons of cosmic tones
Light your star away
Heroic master of identity
Praise the dead, I am become eternal!
