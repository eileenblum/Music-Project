I cannot remember my birth
First came terror then transformation
Energy to form back to energy
Sacred fluid of the future
Always flowing into me
They believed in two eternities
Poignance in transition
Excites the mindflower

Speeding heartbeats slow perception
"Open!" and the choir falls
Thoughts spin on their axes
In an orbit 'round the mind
Death has no reflection
In this spectrum
Beyond living comprehension

Have misery upon me
Abandoned to ponder the loss
Deranged experiments of memory

Shifting consciousness
Without constant
Invert the plains of fire
Straging and brutish
Upon the long path of posterity
Oscillation of perception
As I fall and rise
Feel deep change
And I still dream of finding a way

Insanity hangs by a friend
But you are never always alone

Relentless valor
And I will never regress
Evergize and transcend the eternal
Animate the coming sons
Fortified to lead at dawn
Ecstasy in every movement
Take the searching hand
And admire a new fear
