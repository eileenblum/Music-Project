Praise me in the howling shadows
In gardens of coiling apparitions
Violent lunacy in fragile lands
Of blooming legions
Displacers of light
Birthing limitations
Enslaving me to die

Raptured insanity felt its release
Eternal victims of the sky

Mayhem of living claws the chest
Plays across the satchel of the spine
Consume the gruesome valley of the comatose grotesque
Cast down hypocrisy
And recover your limbs if you can
And we're banishing banshee wails by the heavy screaming of The Dimandaahl

Judgmental soliloquies slough the stars
As symbols bent bowed and broken
Can't find the source of my damnation

Condemn us, everyone
Smouldering in illusory combat
Tension of bloodblind mantrae
Omnipotent vengeance
And spectacular achievement
Release the warriors of punishment
Biological turbines fall

Slit my skin it taints my wrists
It takes some work for me
Evaporate exhausting flesh
Statreds of hatement in aphasia
You're thinking things about yourself that they don't even think
