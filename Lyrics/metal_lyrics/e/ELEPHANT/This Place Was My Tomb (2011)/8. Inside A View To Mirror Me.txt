Abandon all moments but the present
Weave ideas and imagine thoughts
Breathe the journey between paradigms
Drink the voice of ecstasy
Growing at a glance through the eyes
Each sense a universe in infinite synergy

Beyond the stagnant void of hate's existence

Strangled by mortality
Constrained by doors
Latent telepathy rises
As angst dies

A gentle learning stare
Resolves the vagaries of revelation

Dark pupil inside
A crystalline tapestry
Pierces the depths of your regret
Within the profound taking of elation
Yearning to know in this oasis
Before the final ember fades goodbye

I am a man triumphant in the skies
Drowning out my night by wake of life
