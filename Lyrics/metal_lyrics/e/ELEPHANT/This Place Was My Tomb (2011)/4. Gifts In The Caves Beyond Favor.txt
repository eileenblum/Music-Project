Truth will come to you in lies
Light beyond light behind darkness
Commanders sharpening the luminous blade of voice
Nuclear sabres for nebular wars
Numb the atoll at the eschaton forge

The first page of the new pledge
A book is a delicate life

Acidic gates of sulphur rainbows
Immerse castles in the arcadian cradle of ferns
Thyridium syllable transformance

Skills to reconcile characters
Circle the dragons of a shrinking quasar
Moonsaws, armored whips
And pneumatic weaponry
Mangle the lairs of planets

Crying shores of a weeping earth
Stone claws and humanoid forms
Poison and potion, tomb and cave
Silent cenotaph
And prophetic cromlech
Stargods in the floating heavens

Feel timeless journeys within eternal moments
Of deafening chaos
The hermit sees the warrior bearing the spoils
Without limitation, without doubt
With profound gratitude
