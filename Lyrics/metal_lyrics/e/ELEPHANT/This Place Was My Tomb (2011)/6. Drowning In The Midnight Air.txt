Something saw me drowning in the midnight air
Sheep of the night life me up
Out of the sky a diseased entity
Filled yet never slowing
Darkness whispers with the eyes
"Drink the blood
"And spit the dust
"Into the face at the core of lament

Freezing on the altar
Sleepless in falling thunder

Graveyard predators
At the feast of stars
And moonflesh

Bestial horizon
Of raging suns
Shields of flame
An arsenal of spells
Solace in the darukh
Perspiring at rest
And the voice in my head said to hold on
But the words on my hand screamed "Don't!"

Know the burning is constant
Like a tornado dressed in debris
By my fingers the heavens are death
