Darkness has fallen upon this
Feeble planet and we are part of the fucking plan
Our blood will stain the lands
And our loved ones will fall
Not a fucking thing our government will do but kill themselves
They thought they were prepared but they impaired
Those who believe they are prepared
Are going down (blegh!)

I lived behind false eyes for so
Long and you all fell for it
Like the sheep you are
Follow the herd but watch for the cliff
Careful who you put you trust in
What makes them special?
What makes them leaders?
If they are so spineless?
Then they are the pigs dressed as the wolf (breeeeeeee)

They are the pigs dressed as the wolf
But we're the traitors for standing up
How cam someone so spineless, so ruthless, so gutless be the one we call our leader

Get ready! Here it comes! The downfall of our leaders! [2x]

We shall come out on top, we shall not be stopped [2x]

These fuckers they have no chance
We will put them in their place
We will meet them face to face
Then they're heads go in the case [2x]
Oh!
