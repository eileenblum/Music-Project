Numb, silent, smiling she was sitting
In the dusty armchair,
The horizon was blurred in front of the tired eyes
Tangled, messy moments
Gained meaning for a second
Having become an opposite to imagination
She was enlightened in a twisted way

He wondered through the corridors for far too long
Filthy, stinking walls
Were wings to the rotten world,
The sink in the far end, broken glass...
You won't see nothing there
The broken mirror does not reflect

A shapeless and unwilling gesture of your hand
Wants to call the light in
Tenderness keeps fading...

A worm came out from inside
A voice was born from inside
It sets up its ears and...

It is that leaking tap again!
