In the name of the war
Hunger, blood, air and fire
He travels his mind
By celestial signs,
Blood-thirsty flashes

So that to trample the body of mankind
Down in the tragic moan....
To sink in the thoughts of your mind....

He chokes on theatrical blood
He sings....
An artificial intelligence
Looks like an electrical hangman....
A plastic hand, a deadly battery
With a fake smile
Says '
Sleep, mindful mind

In the name of the war
Hunger, blood, air and fire
He travels his mind
By celestial signs,
Blood-thirsty flashes

So that to trample the body of mankind
Down in the tragic moan....
To sink in the thoughts of your mind....

The black with blackness
With the black Soul
Defeat the clock of bones
So that in the future eternity,
To be able to defeat with a shine of your eyes

In the name of the war
Hunger, blood, air and fire
He travels his mind
By celestial signs,
Blood-thirsty flashes

So that to trample the body of mankind
Down in the tragic moan....
To sink in the thoughts of your mind....
