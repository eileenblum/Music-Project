I occupy this throne
For only spiteful reasons
The only kingdom known to me is out there
My forest calls to me
Amongst her leaves and grasses
As calm and callow as the springtime air
This keeps no home for me
Unholy sanctuary
These castle walls can't keep my spirit in
These people don't love me
I don't belong amongst them
They want a king and I want
Peace and quiet now
