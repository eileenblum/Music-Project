Behold I've come Ax in hand
To lay claim to this your land
Face me now I stand alone
Rightful heir to yonder throne

Fool! How dare you come here
With your insults and delusions
Guards! Behead this wretch
And fetch his ax for my collection

Good it is to taste this wine again
And fall upon the necks of mortal men
Drunk I am upon the blood of slaves
Kingly blood I deign to taste

[dies]

[Villagers:]
"When the Ax is freed from hell
A single stroke shall break the spell
When the Ax is free again
A brutal reign shall meet its end"
