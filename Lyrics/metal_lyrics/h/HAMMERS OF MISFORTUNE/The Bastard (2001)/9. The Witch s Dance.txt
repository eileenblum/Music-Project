Did you see the Wood-child's gaze
See the ancient fire in his eyes?
Did you hear the Ax as it sang
Thirsting to drink the blood of a king?

Did you see it flash to and fro
Glowing with a life all its own?
Did you see the tyrant fall
Headless in the torchlit hall?
Did you see the wood child
Tear the crown
From the severed head
of the king?
Did you see the Tyrant
On a stake in the village square?

Could it be the end
Has come at last?
Could this be the prophesy
Come to pass?
Back in the town they
Celebrate times to come.
Here in the wood we dance
For the end has come
