Of unholy fire forged
And by inhuman hands created

You're free now, you're free now

Blessed with endless lust for blood
My appetite cannot be sated

You're free now, You're free now

Seven thousand kings I've slain
And seven thousand years I've waited

You're free now, You're free now

When the light of the moon
Is reflected in red
When there's blood on the stone
In the sacred event

Costly, the light of the moon
Saturated in red
Cast the blood on the stone
