[Act I]

I am the maelstrom's deafening song
The ether through which the fallen descend
I am the frightful dance of the flames
The pain of creation and violent end
I am the sculptor of wreckage and ruin
The creator and destroyer of all
Where is the sacrifice unto my shrine?
Where is the blood I took for my wine?

Now I sleep in nether darkness
Dream with wolves in cold betrayal
Breathe in storms and turn the seasons
Through this curse of mortal treason

Who dares disturb my slumber
Ages and eons of sleep without number
The spell is broken my fury unleashed
The Dragon is summoned,
the mark of the beast
Who is this sprig off a fallen tree
Thus is a creature created by me
Manifest is this deathly vision
I give you life to carry a mission

Speak in tongues of spheres in blackness
Cross the stars with dark recitals
Turn the wheels of catasrophis
Fly! My spear, your name is vengeance!
