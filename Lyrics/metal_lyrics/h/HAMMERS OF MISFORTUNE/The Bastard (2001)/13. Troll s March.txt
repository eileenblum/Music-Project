March ye trolls of wood and stone
March for now the way is shown

He who sits upon the throne
Is not a man but of our own
This road he built will show the way
To find the mortals we must slay

He who sits upon the throne
Is not a man but of our own
He who sits upon the throne
Is made of wood, wind and stone
