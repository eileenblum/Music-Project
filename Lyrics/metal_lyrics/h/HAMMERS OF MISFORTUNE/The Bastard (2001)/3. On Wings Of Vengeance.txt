I have come to answer your fears
I have come to make good on a promise
I am the whisper that gives you a reason
For all your feelings of hatred and treason

He left you fighting for your life
A bastard son he soon forgot
He raped and destroyed the village
No regard for the life he pillaged
On the throne there sits a villain
And for this now you must kill him

On wings of Vengeance
Fly forth my son
To claim your right as
Chosen One

Now I understand what is my history
It's no surprise
From a king given to treachery

My destiny
I am the rightful heir to the throne
You left your son Forsaken

Turn the wheels of Catastrophis
Fly my spear your name is Vengeance!

My destiny
I am the rightful heir to the throne
You left your son Forsaken

Turn the wheels of Catastrophis
Fly my spear your name is Vengeance!

My destiny
I am the rightful heir to the throne
You left your son Forsaken
