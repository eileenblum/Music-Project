Praised - praised be our vanity 
Now that we have our own tragedy 
No time for subtlety 
War is upon us, oh can't you see 

Here in the holy land 
See how united and strong we stand 
Slogans and banners for every man 
Here in the holy land 

Death - death to the infidels 
Sons of our servants shall serve and serve us well 
And gifted with endless war 
Flags and fanatics forevermore
