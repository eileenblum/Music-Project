Famine always hangs his lamp 
Above the holy land 
Hangs his lamp, he hangs his lamp 
Above the holy land 

Pestilence will pitch his tent 
Upon the promised land 
Pitch his tent, he'll pitch his tent 
Upon the promised land 

Death will always break his bread 
within the temple walls 
Break his bread, he'll break his bread 
Within the temple walls 

War will always find his mistress 
In the highest tower 
Find her waiting, find her waiting 
In the highest tower
