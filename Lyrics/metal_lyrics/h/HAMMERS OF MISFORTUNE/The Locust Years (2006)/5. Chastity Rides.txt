Oh chastity 
you spoke so clearly 
Holding the reins of your steed high and mighty 
One voice, two faces, three kings, and four horsemen 
Delighting our eyes, silver strings in the moonlight 

Oh sanctity 
Tiny eyes like diamonds 
You glide in the sky in your saddle so high 
One voice, two faces, three kings, and four horsemen 
Sway through the air on strings straight from heaven 

Chastity rides on a horse oh so high 
Dancing on strings in the sky
