Please hold your applause, though you may pause for genuflection 
As so deftly we're directing your attention 
To this hand my left or is it right, no need to analyze 
the sentiment and scope of our correctness 

Please remain seated as the spectacle repeats itself 
ad nauseum (that's latin for "relentless") 
Don't you lose your focus as we orchestrate these locust years 
My dears, the show is bound to leave you breathless 

You paid admission, now the ride's begun, guaranteed to
leave you groping for the gears in this mad machine of tears 

Now that we're unchained 
we'll reign, insane 
and drown the world in flames 
and blood, and pain 
Our legion eyes and ears 
will amplify your fears 
in a wilderness of mirrors 
in these new Locust Years 

Our timeline spins unbroken 
Like the webs that we have woven 
As the show unfolds like clockwork on command 

Are those horsemen knocking? 
Or the ticking and the tocking of the Watch? 
We are the face, we are the hands 

Sirens bay like mares at night, Sirens howl like wolves 
But it's all right for the show has just begun 

Now that we're unchained 
we'll reign, insane 
and drown the world in flames 
and blood, and pain 
Our legion eyes and ears 
will amplify your fears 
in a wilderness of mirrors 
in these new Locust Years 

Now that we're unchained 
we'll reign, insane 
The pain will flow like wine 
in time to find 
us drunk upon your tears 
and feasting on your fears 
sharpening our spears 
in these new Locust Years
