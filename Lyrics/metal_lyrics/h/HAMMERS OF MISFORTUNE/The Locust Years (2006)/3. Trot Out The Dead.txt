Fool, I am no hero
So leave my casket be 
Furthermore I'd never give my life 
for such as thee 

If the people wonder at the suffering you've caused 
And your massive avarice has left them at a loss 
If by chance they notice your bloody snapping jaws 
the blood upon your claws 
your shifty eyes and laws 
the nauseating flaws in all you've said 
Trot out the dead 
Trot out the dead 

If by chance they give you the slightest bit of grief 
Or perhaps they notice you're a liar and a thief 
If they dare to question your lunatic beliefs 
The wicked web you weave 
The slimy trail you leave 
Or maybe they perceive they've been misled 
Trot out the dead 
Trot out the dead 

Trot out the dead, trot out the dead 
Fire up the burning pole while you're ahead 
Blot out the truth, trot out the lies 
Myriad eyes 
Silence the wise 
Shackle the skies 
Stifle the cries of the soon to be dead 

If the people wonder why so many had to die 
Or they test the wisdom in your prevailing lie 
Or how you let it happen when you knew it all the time 
and you just let them fly 
it's in your evil eye 
the way they were betrayed the day they died 
Trot out the dead 
Trot out the lies
