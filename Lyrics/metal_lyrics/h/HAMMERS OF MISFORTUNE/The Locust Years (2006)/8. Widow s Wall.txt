It won't matter, when it's over 
but ending, its everything 

Shall we gaze into the sky 
And watch the stars expire 
Or is it just our eyes? 
Shall we quarrel and conspire 
and in our cups we'll raise 
our knuckles to the sun 
and curse the sea 
Shall we strut about inside 
And haggle for the dearest nest 
the highest bough? 

it won't matter, when it's over 
but ending, its everything 

Las the widows to the mast 
and hope our craft will last 
this broken mirror sea 
and feel the vastness of the swells 
that crash against a wall so high and wide 
it's barely there at all 
And helpless watch the storm 
Foaming forms of locust swarms 
against the mirror sky 

Swarming - an insect storm 
A million paper wings that whisper "fall" 
Scrawled all in blood across the sky 
The writing on the wall - the widow's wall
