A makeshift parlour game
Of treachery and shame
A nest of sin and vice
Informant's paradise
All ears and all the same
The rat's assembly line

We work in shifts then rest
Our ears are always fresh

For every bird a song
Sure as your life is long
A bird for every jail
For every rat his tale
Some friends of yours we met
Have echoed our request
The table has been set
And you're the honored guest

Article 128 could hardly be more clear
By order of the council you are always welcome here

You remind me of the wine
Not running out tonight
No need to check the time
No difference day or night
Judgment has her kiln and justice her baton
The people have their will and truth her blindfold on

Article 128 could hardly be more clear
By order of the council you are always welcome here

Windows are nothing but glass, so easily shattered
Shutters are nothing but wood, so easily cut
Walls are but plaster and lath, no match for a hammer
Spirits are nothing but fires, so easily snuffed
All ears and all the time
The rat's assembly line
We work in shifts then rest
Our ears are always fresh
Some friends of yours we met
Have echoed our request
The table has been set
And you're the honored guest

Article 128 could hardly be more clear
By order of the council you are always welcomed here
Long as you're still breathing you can sign the questionnaire
Surely your rendition will be more extraordinaire
