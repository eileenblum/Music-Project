The spotlight found another fool
The crowd has gone away
There's a shabby sunset
At the end of your big day
A joker in your finest hour
With aces up your sleeve
The clock has struck - you're out of luck
And now it's time to leave

Time to rest my clever friend
But first we must take flight
Time to find where jesters nest
When day turns into night
There's a place, if we make haste
Where we can hdie away
Watch our shabby sunset
At the end of our big day

[Chorus:]
Everything is concrete now
Concrete is the queen whose kingdom crumbles down
In Butchertown
Everything is metal now
Metal is the king whose crown is melted down
In Butchertown

Something in the air down here
Describe it if I could
I don't know what it is
But I know it isn't good

Something in the air down here
I wish could explain
I don't know what it is
But I know it isn't same

[Chorus]
