Hanging bones like paper dolls
And posing by museum walls
A forest of quotation marks
Where minnows masquerade as sharks
And every line is well rehearsed
And everyone in line is first it's

[Chorus:]
Almost like you really care
Almost like you really hear
Almost like you're really there
Almost like you're really here

Dressed just like a skeptic
But you tow the party line
You have no dialectic but
You know the secret sign
And every line is well rehearsed
And everyone in line is first it's

[Chorus]

Outskirts and concentric rings
     follow you they follow you
Shallow cuts and childish things
     follow you they follow you
Scratch the surface just like this
     follow you it followed you
Shadows of a class dismissed
     followed you it followed you

While it's no surprise I'll try to be
Kind to your disguise just another
Plot to subdivide passenger
Just waiting for a ride down around the
Corner now they say that you never
Ever saw the train leave without you

Try to place a call to that picture
Hanging on the wall same old message
No one there at all there's no answer
Scripture known by rote by this time there's
Nothing left to quote but your skin a
Scribbled sheet for notes incoherent

[Chorus]

Charm will steal your time
Just as time will steal your charm
