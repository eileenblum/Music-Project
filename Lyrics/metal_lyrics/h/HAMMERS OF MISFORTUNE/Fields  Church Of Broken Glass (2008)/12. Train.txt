Where were you? We faded out the other day

Make up new wounds to count and contemplate
Hear that lonesome whistle blowin'
Just for you and you alone
Lightning speed to nowhere it's your lucky day

Can't believe the nerve of that proceeding verse

Worse than where you are is that you got there first
Sure you can reverse
Turn a blessing to a curse

Lightning train to nowhere in the universe

Stressing every syllable of your complaint
Can't they tell the difference
Between passengers and freight?
Cursing the conductor then
We try our luck again
Lightning speed to nowhere but oblivion

Pictures play in place all day
They never leave their wall
They stand against it
And when they talk
They do so it can hear
For they know
That their wall has ears
All ears, all ears

Swatting at the smoke rings in the dining car

Speculation station is that where we are?
Plenty Of Conjecture
Would you like to give a lecture?
Lightning train to anywhere but very far

Lightning Speed to nowhere but obscurity
Only destination is the scenery
Hear that lonesome whistle blowin'
Just for you and you alone
Lightning train illusion of Velocity
