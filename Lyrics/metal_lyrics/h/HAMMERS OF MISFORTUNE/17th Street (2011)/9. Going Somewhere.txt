Shanksâ mare, threadbare
Saturnine pace
Never quite there
What is this place?

Where did you wake up?
Going Somewhere?
Picking a path through a ruined estate
Where did you end up?
Going Somewhere?
Wandering through a forsaken domain

There was a door, but not anymore my friend
Now there is only a road
we take to the end
Before this wreck
Will sail again

There was a chance, a circumstance left to defend
Now there is only a road
We take to the end
Until this wreck
Can sail again

Things once so plain
Now seem so out of place
Transformed landscape
Trail of those displaced

This wreck will sail again
Going somewhere, going somewhere
