Chairs were mahogany crystal was set
Finest of victuals wealth can beget
Table and Chairmen were gathered around
Portraits of patriarchs glowering down
Staring....

Heads of the families save one that was missed
20-ton specter was not on the list
Freshly cut flowers and straw in the breeze
Obvious octopus nobody sees
Staring...

And as the Chairman
Appears at the door
The specter is elsewhere
The 31st floor
An obstacle course
Of the finest decor
One ear to the bell
One eye on the door
Staring...

Racing his thoughts and fighting the tape
Pacing the cell as his fate takes the shape
Of a 20-ton specter who's not on the list
Too big to fall too bad to be missed just
Staring...
