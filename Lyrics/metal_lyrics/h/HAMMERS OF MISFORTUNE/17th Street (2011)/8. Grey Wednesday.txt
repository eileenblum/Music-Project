Wednesday and the wolves are at the door
Goldilocks is dizzy smelling war
Beyond the bitter end
Nothing left to send

From on high the chamber can observe
Scale of the sentence to be served
Balance of your life
Spend it catching knives

Wednesday is grey again
Can you remember when she smiled
When will she smile again?

When the till is nil you'll take the store
When the lake runs dry you'll take the shore
Yes you taught us well
See you all in hell

Grey Wednesday cloudy skies
When the horizon lies in bed
Can't face another day
Grey Wednesday walks away
No love to send today she said
and then she faded away
