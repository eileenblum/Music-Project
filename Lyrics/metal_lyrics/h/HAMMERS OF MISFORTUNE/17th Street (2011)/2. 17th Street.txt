Seventeenth Street
Ruthless! Ruthless!

Look through the window no one is there
No one is watching and nobody cares
All of your wishes and all of your prayers
Dead in the letters down on the stairs

Dreaming in the counting house
Watching the price per ounce
Dreaming in the counting house
Watching the dead cats bounce

Seventeenth Street
Ruthless! Ruthless!

In chapter seven surrounded by thieves
A thousand cuts later by chapter thirteen
There is a place for you somewhere they say
Down on the sidewalk or far far away

predator, I am game
Citizen is my name
Haunting a shadow house
Watching the dead cats pounce

Seventeenth Street
Ruthless! Ruthless!
