Seems as though the PTA has finally conquered Rome
They're gonna charge admission and enclose it in a dome
Now it's just a theme park and the rides are over-priced
Maybe you can run the one that used to be your life

TICs and refugees are scattered far and wide
And many tales are told about the day The City died
Painted ladies faint before the speculator's eye
The gravy boat will always float until the bay runs dry

and everybody sighed
and gets all misty eyed
about the day the city died

This one's called I'm moving to Oakland
This one's called I'm moving to Portland
This one's called I'm moving to Brooklyn now

Prospectors and pushers still conspire to subdivide
And many tales are told about the day The City died
Skinny dips on crystal ships sail through the Golden Gate
I left my heart in a shopping cart at the bottom of the Bay

and everybody sighed
and gets all misty eyed
about the day the city died

This oneâs called Iâm getting addicted
This oneâs called Iâm getting evicted
This oneâs called another one moving away

This one's called Iâm moving to Austin
This one's called I'm moving to London
This one's called somewhere in L.A.

This oneâs called Iâm moving to Boston
This oneâs called Iâm moving to Berlin
This oneâs called Iâm off to Savannah, GA

This oneâs called Iâm moving to Glasgow
This oneâs called Iâm moving to Moscow
This oneâs called Iâm moving to Detroit today
