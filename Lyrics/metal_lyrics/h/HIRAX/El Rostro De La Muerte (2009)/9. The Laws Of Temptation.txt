You lie, you cheat, kill and steal,
You're supposed to be the law
Take the oath to protect and serve
Exploited and destroyed them all
Guilt is written, it shows on your face
You will pay with your life

THE LAWS OF TEMPTATION

The good, the bad, the mean,
Ugly scum of the Earth.
Demented, sick and crazy,
Damaged, distressed and hurt.
Battered and beaten, Never too young to die
Drunk with power, And FUELED BY HATE!

Guilty as charged.
Failed all the tests.
Misuse of power.
Controlled and possessed, You will be judged.
By those you have punished
Disgraced, twist human. The truth will be told!
High priest of sin. Blood, thirst and greed.
Master of guilt. Corruption and lust.
Seducer in black. Desecration of souls.
Denial of truth and innocence is lost.
Victims, Crimes of flesh
Decades of lies, Repent to death
