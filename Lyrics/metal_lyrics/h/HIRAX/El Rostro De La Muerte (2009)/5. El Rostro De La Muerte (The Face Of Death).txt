DRESSED IN FEAR

Death will call, a vision appears in white,
superstitious bow their heads and cry.
The scythe of justice a symbol of hope and fear.
On bended knee holy death followers pray.
Dark icon. Condemned by the holy church.
Deemed to be an evil pagan god.
For decades thousands invoke,
Death to their enemies, Black Magic!
Dressed... in... Fear!
