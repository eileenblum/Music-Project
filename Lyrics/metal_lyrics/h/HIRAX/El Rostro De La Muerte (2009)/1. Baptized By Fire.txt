[Solo: Glenn Rogers]

Pin them down! An unrelentless barrage.
Show no mercy! Send them to hell and back again!

War is hell! Baptized by fire!

Death and fear, take the land by force
Grind them down, iron fists we've come to destroy.

War is hell! Baptized by fire!

Shoot to kill until, no man is left standing
The enemy must die for crimes against us all

[Solo: Lance Harrison]

Shoot to kill until, no man is left standing
The enemy must die for crimes against us all

Marching, battalions deadly strike
Destruction, nothing will survive
Annihilate, death toll - thousands have die
Desolation, burning bones and cries

[Solo: Glenn Rogers]

First to kill, kill everything that moves
Wage of war, soldiers will pay with their blood

War is hell! Baptized by fire!
Shoot to kill until, no man is left standing
The enemy must die for crimes against us all

[Solo: Glenn Rogers]
