The sleeping beast has wakened,
to take back what's been taken.
The red flag rises over the land,
now the world will hold it's breathe.
Flesh and Blood

No mercy in this theater of war.
Warfare, the method and device.
Four ugly years of mass killing.
30 million lives
wiped from this Earth.
Flesh and Blood

The fearless fight and never die.
Red soldiers fight until the death.
Summoned to defend against evil.
Smashed by Stalin's hand.
Flesh and Blood

Quiet on the Eastern front.
The silence is deafening.
The calm before the storm.
Disrupt the enemy.

Fighting and blood shed.
Obliterate life.
Pulverize, stop the attack.
Demolish, expedite the conflict.
Decimate the crusade.
