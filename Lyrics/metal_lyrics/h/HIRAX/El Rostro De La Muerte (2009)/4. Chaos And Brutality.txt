[Lyrics: Katon W. De Pena; music: Glenn Rogers]

Born  to  withstand death
Fall  from grace  to rise  again
Our struggle  Still  to find  faith
Pushed  into  the brink

There will be hell to pay!

Hard  as nails  forever  we stand
Madness  is all  around  us
Betrayal  lies  deceit  and hate
Snapped  one day  over

There will be hell to pay!

Blood shed
Mass murder has been done
Killing in the blink of an eye
Unarmed victims are dead

Out of control
No one is safe
The living die fast one by one
Chaos and Brutality
We are all going to die
Who will be left to bury the dead?
NIGHTMARE

Violence wide spread
Grim death and fear
Bottom feeders feast
The face of evil reveals itself

[Guitar Solo: Glenn Rogers]

It's a sin to kill
you will burn in hell!
