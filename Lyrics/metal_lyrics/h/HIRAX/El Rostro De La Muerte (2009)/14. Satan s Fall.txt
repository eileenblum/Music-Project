[Solo: Glenn Rogers]

Straight from heaven and straight to hell
Consumed by power and hate
The embodiment of evil
Once he was the morning star

[Solo: Glenn Rogers]

The first enemy of God
Out of heaven he is cast
Condemned to walk the earth
The arch angels fall from grace

[Chorus:]
Son of dawn, sinners and saints
Banished forever, you've sealed your fate
Your revolution was your demise
For eternity to reign in hell
SATAN'S FALL!!

Exalt, praise, honor, glorify
The throne you sit on, is built of lies
The pit of fire slowly burns
Hell awaits to burn your soul

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: Glenn Rogers/ Lance Harrison]

Roaring thunder pounds the skies
The wrath of God you can't defy
Rebellious Lucifer, he lurks and deceives
The kingdom of hell, lies the beast

[Repeat chorus]

Torment and fire, grim, death and fear
Leprosy and famine murder and tears
Deadly diseases, millions will die
Starvation and hunger, the well has run dry
Faster than lightening, angelic symbols appear
Crusaders engage in warfare
Until the end, destine to die
Victorious the hand of doom
SATAN'S FALL!!!

[Solo: Glenn Rogers]
