[Scream:] GO!

The speed is too fast
The G's are too strong
Nobody could withstand the force
Dead on impact Never felt a thing
Crushed like a roach on the floor
Nobody is safe Upon collision
Big money hides the truth from us all
Unsafe with no testing Riged up to breakdown
Blood on their hands, They will Fall
BROKEN NECK
Concrete and steel
Corporations make money from the dead
Millions of bodies "People die every year"
Neglect they don't care, It's a sham!
[Repeat]

[Scream:] GO!

The speed is too fast
The G's are too strong
