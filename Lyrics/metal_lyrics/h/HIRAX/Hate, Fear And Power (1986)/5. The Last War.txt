Strike in the night
Chaos all around
Trouble the power down
No help you're all alone ah!

Dead silent sound
Alive you won't survive
Safe underground
No one gets out alive ah!

I would rather die
Than live through this hell
What are we gonna do
Die like stupid fools

Men in their fuckin' suits
They're screwin' with our lives
Their game is a game of hate
Stop them before it's too late

We must make a stand
The children of the world
Together we must unite
Precious is our life

Bodies all around me
I hope this is a dream
Pray for God to help us
Father lord bring peace to me

I would rather die
Than live through this hell
What are we gonna do
People it's up to you
