Scared to walk in daylight
At night time he's home locked inside
Afraid to admit he's hiding
Liar prejudice fucked up pride

He's worried only for his life
Imprisoned by ignorance
Thinks everyone's out to get him
Except for people his creed

Raised by hate in this life
Taught to stay away
Anyone not just like him
They're inferior he would say
