Midnight is the time
The first born will die
By the hand of the Lord
They scream and they cry

The deadly plague strikes them down
They die one by one
The mother and father helpless they watch
Their dying baby son

And there shall be
A great cry through the land
Such as never heard before
And shall never be heard again
