You, you will go down to the demons
When you get there youâll be down in hell
Sinners are wrong sinners are weak
Got top be strong can not be weak
Down to the demons, down to the demons
Down to the demons

Black is the night cooled itâs the air
Prepare for hell get ready if you dare
Lucifer is his name he is a liar
Hell is his home down in the fire

Evil forces you must face the beast called by the holy one you are the priest

You must believe in me my son

I am the Lord God the Holy One
