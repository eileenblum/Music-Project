Warlord take the land
Armies march by command
Wounded left for dead
Rip to shreds like a doll
Ten days the fight goes on
More soldiers fall and they die
When the battle's won
Who will be left to carry on

Attack kill everything
Butcher stab till no life
Abolish wipe them out
Murder them in cold blood
Who's the next to die
No one knows for sure
Bloodshed everywhere
The smell of death in the air

The warlord he commands
Must obey his command

Ah ha ha!

Warlord take the land
Armies march by command
Wounded left for dead
Rip to shreds like a doll
Nobody knows for sure
Bloodshed everywhere
The smell of death in the air
