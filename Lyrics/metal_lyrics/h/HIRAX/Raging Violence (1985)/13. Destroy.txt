Kill all in sight
Defend with your might
Break the man's skull
Rip out his eyes - destroy

On to the fight
We will go
Kill them all
To the Fight

Evil in his soul
You must take control
God's on your side
He is your pride - destroy

Strike make him bleed
Death dying speed
When he is dead
Cut off his head
