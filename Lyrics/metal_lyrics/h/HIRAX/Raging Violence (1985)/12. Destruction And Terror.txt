Can you feel the power
Vibrating all around
Anarchy in the city
Bad people all around

Shooting screaming people cut down
Killing bloodshed death all around
Running hiding this is a war
Caught in the middle the center the core

Destruction and terror taking the land
Survivors together looting command
Those who survive will become scavengers
Killing each other and taking what's theirs

Ooh! People stop this hate
Learn to love before it's too late

Lying stealing anything to live
No food or water nothing to give
Starving to death barely living
Torture and pain to main it will bring
