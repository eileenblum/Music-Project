Innocent man walking home
Police pick him up
Fits the description of the villian
The law is looking for
Convicted of murder, first degree
He is on death row
Sentenced to death for a crime
He did not commit

Blind fold, firing squad
The wrong man will die
Executed, shot to death
The dead man's family cries
Investigation into the case
No one can deny proof revealed
He told the truth the dead man
Did not fucking lie

The state is sorry so they say
But nothing can bring him back
The fact remains he is dead
The guilty's ones on the loose
There must be precautions taken
So this won't happen again
The innocent die, the criminals live
What's this world coming to?
