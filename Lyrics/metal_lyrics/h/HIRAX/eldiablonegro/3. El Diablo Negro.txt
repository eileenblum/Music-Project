Evil Lucifer's hand of doom, the rules to his game,
There are none. Hard drug abuse, this is the devil.
Pull the hammer back on the gun.
This is Your life, to pick and choose
Do you really want to die?
Think about the path you walk,
Judas the angel defies.
Never regret mistakes you make
What doesn't kill you makes you strong.
You can't enjoy life in full
Until you have dealt with all your fears.
Don't deny the beast within we all are totally insane
He who is accountable this sick society is to blame
EL DIABLO
EL DIABLO NEGRO
[Repeat]
