Suicide. Maybe I could use the sleep.
Depressing down, I'm slipping comatose deep.
They call me a freak, Misfit #1
Now I want to live because
My mission is undone.

Slit Your Wrist. Slit YOUR Wrist.

I'll get revenge. I owe them, payback is a bitch.
Your fate is sealed, you should die in a watery grave.
You'll be the one. Karma's sign is the spade.
Bathroom tub, I'll picture you with a blade.
Slit Your Wrist. Slit YOUR Wrist.
