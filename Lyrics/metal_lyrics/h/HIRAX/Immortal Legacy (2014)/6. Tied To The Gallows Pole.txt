[Solo: Juan Garcia]

Now changed with treason guilty
False accusations false lies
Condemned for life eternity
Retribution the payback the penalty

[Chorus:]
Iron fist breaks the backs of those who oppose the queen's strong command
Tied to the Gallows
The punishment fits the crime of those who oppose the queen's strong command
Tied to the Gallows Pole

[Solo: Lance Harrison]

Unbroken by the hammers of brutality
Leaders of the revolution stand strong
Condemned for life and eternity
Retribution, the payback the penalty

[Chorus:]
Iron fist breaks the backs of those who oppose the queen's strong command
Tied to the Gallows
The punishment fits the crime of those who oppose the queen's strong command
Tied to the Gallows Pole

[Solo: Juan Garcia]

[Chorus:]
Iron fist breaks the backs of those who oppose the queen's strong command
Tied to the Gallows
The punishment fits the crime of those who oppose the queen's strong command
Tied to the Gallows Pole

[Solo: Lance Harrison]

Tied to the Gallows Pole!
