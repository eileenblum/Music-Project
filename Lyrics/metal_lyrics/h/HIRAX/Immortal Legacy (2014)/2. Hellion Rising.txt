Hellion Rising
Bow to your knees
Armageddon
The apocalypse
Now is here

Masters will fall and slaves will rise
Immortal, he shakes the earth
Hellbringer of death and destruction
To the damned

The reckoning has begun
The wrath has been unleashed
The witching hour is here

Scorching the world, no mercy
Dark holy war!!

Where the angels fly
The Hellion Rising
Where the angels fly
The Hellion Rising

Massive annihilation, the killing of God's high priest
Catastrophic deadly power from his hands

The reckoning has begun
The wrath has been unleashed
The witching hour is here

Scorching the world, no mercy
Dark holy war!!

Where the angels fly
The Hellion Rising
Where the angels fly
The Hellion Rising

Hellion Rising
Bow to your knees
Armageddon
The apocalypse
Now is here

Hellion Rising
Bow to your knees
Armageddon
The apocalypse
Now is here
