RIDE
Brave into devastation, death rides of the night we are the law
Brave we are united, thunder roar battalion we charge in for the kill

[Solo: Lance Harrison]

First to fight, and die, war dogs from hell don't fear
Mouth wild open they are ready to bite
Battle torn, tough as nails the colors will never run
Band of brothers, they are bonded by blood.

[Chorus:]
The overload rides, on wings of steel
La boca de la bestia, for the ... KILL!

[Solo: Rocky George]

The sounds of war, are deafening and loud
There will be peace when they all are dead
Collateral damage no one is innocent
Fire fight cowards forced run.

[Chorus:]
The overload rides, on wings of steel
La boca de la bestia, for the ... KILL!

[Solo: Rocky George]
[Solo: Lance Harrison]

[Chorus:]
The overload rides, on wings of steel
La boca de la bestia, for the ... KILL!
The overload rides, on wings of steel
La boca de la bestia, for the ... KILL!
