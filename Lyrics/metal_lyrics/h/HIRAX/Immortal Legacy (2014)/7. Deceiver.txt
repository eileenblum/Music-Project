Born to lie, born to cheat
Iscariot betrayer, rotten to the core
Evil incarnate, the demon serpent
The father of lies, never trust a word

[Chorus:]
The deceiver, the master in disguise
False disciple, backbiting for
The deceiver, despair rules the Earth
The prodigal son he has returned

Harvester of sin, the antagonist of deception
Malevolent scoundrel
Dealer takes your soul
The charlatan, the swindler
Perdition is calling, hear the bells toll

[Chorus:]
The deceiver, the master in disguise
False disciple, backbiting for
The deceiver, despair rules the Earth
The prodigal son he has returned

[Solo: Lance Harrison]

Born to lie, born to cheat
Iscariot betrayer, rotten to the core
Evil incarnate, the demon serpent
The father of lies, never trust a word
