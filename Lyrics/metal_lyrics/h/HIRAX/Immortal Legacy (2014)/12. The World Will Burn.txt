[Solo: Juan Garcia]

The six days of fire, the Roman empire, burned July A.D.
The torches of Nero, the villain, the hero
The fire spread quick through the land

[Chorus:]
The world will burn, suffer the world
The world will burn, suffer the world

[Solo: Lance Harrison]

Set the blaze, Paris in flames
Inferno, Christians sentenced to death
The great fire of Rome, lambent flame
He'll breath damnation released

[Chorus:]
The world will burn, suffer the world
The world will burn, suffer the world
