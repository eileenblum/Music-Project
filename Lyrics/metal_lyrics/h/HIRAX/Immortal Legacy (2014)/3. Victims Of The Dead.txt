The poor man will suffer, while the rich get rich
The tempter of evil evokes his will
Dividing the masses, teaching the weak to hate
Blood for the cross, the inquisition begins

[Chorus:]
Release - the victims of the
Release - the victims of the dead

Raining tears from angels, somewhere the devil grins
Thunder and lightning shakes the Earth
Demons and wizards, the black storm is here

[Chorus:]
Release - the victims of the
Release - the victims of the dead

[Solo: Jim Durkin]
[Solo: Lance Harrison]

The unholy spirits, the blinding infinite light
Loud deafening sounds of misery
Savage lands of slavery, forced to pray to their god
Crusaders reign of terror enslaved in chains

[Chorus:]
Release - the victims of the
Release - the victims of the dead
Release - the victims of the
Release - the victims of the ... dead
