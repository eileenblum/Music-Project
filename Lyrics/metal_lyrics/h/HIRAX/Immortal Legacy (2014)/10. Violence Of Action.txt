[Solo: Lance Harrison]

Smashing down the doors, blasting holes in the walls
Helicopters landing one by one
Flash bangs and gunfire, aggressive action lethal force
Killing hostiles, no one left alive

[Chorus:]
Attack, engage the enemy
Dominance, retaliatory strike
Obliterate, leaving no trace left
Infiltrate, the violence of action

[Solo: Lance Harrison]

The theater of war, ugly death toxic fumes
Radiation lingers in the air
Deadly fire fight, bullets fly, someone's hit
Soldiers bleeding out the desert sands

[Chorus:]
Attack, engage the enemy
Dominance, retaliatory strike
Obliterate, leaving no trace left
Infiltrate, the violence of action

Sacrifice, human life, the high price of casualties of war
Defiant till the end, staring death in the face
No one will stand in their way
Proud to defend, won't back down
The enemy they defy
Strong as steel, the fearless, never afraid to die

[Chorus:]
Attack, engage the enemy
Dominance, retaliatory strike
Obliterate, leaving no trace left
Infiltrate, the violence of action
