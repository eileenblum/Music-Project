[Solo: Rocky George]

There is a place not so far from here
Where the elders meet at the peak f the mountain top
They practice the ritual til this day
Travel from every corner of mother Earth

[Chorus:]
Reign!
Immortal Legacy
Reign!

To bring deceased back from the dead
Levitate and bring them back to life
Unearth them from the sarcophagus
Walk amongst the living once again

[Chorus:]
Reign!
Immortal Legacy
Reign!

[Solo: Lance Harrison]

[Chorus:]
Reign!
Immortal Legacy
Reign!

Decadence, buried alive a cryptic death
Arrogance, brought forth from the kingdom of lies
Sacrifice, timeless ever lasting strife
Lacerate, commemorate the immortal legacy of life!
