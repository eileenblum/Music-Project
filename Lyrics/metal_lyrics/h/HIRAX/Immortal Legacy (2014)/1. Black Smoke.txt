Servants of war, engineers of death
You'll never see them coming your way
Hide in the dark, and in plain sight
No rules in this game that they play
License to kill, bringers of death
Carnage waste them all
Stand up and fight, bastards will run
We will hunt them down

[Chorus:]
The sight of war
Black smoke fills the air
The sight of war
Send them back to hell

Defeatist when push comes to shove
Blood guts and chaos, termination of life
Survivors will have their revenge
Never surrender, never bow down
My family will avenge

[Chorus:]
The sight of war
Black smoke fills the air
The sight of war
Send them back to hell

The aftermath, shattered glass
Terror zone, where dead bodies lie
The baneful, have stricken once again
Evil, the sick against the weak

Trepidation here, hatred breeds more hate
Mutating like a disease, division and despair
Horizon of a new dawn, dispute hypocrisy
[Break the status quo, the peacekeeper will save us]

Black smoke fills the air
The sight of war
