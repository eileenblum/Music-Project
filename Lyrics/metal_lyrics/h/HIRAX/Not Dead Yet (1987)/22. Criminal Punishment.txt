If you take another life
You should die a bloody death
Rape a woman sick freak
Life in prison ain't enough

Now you'll pay for what you've done
We'll strap you do the electric chair
Pull the switch and you will fry
No remorse now you die

Criminal punishment

If you kill it's an eye for an eye
Brutal attack fight back
To survive you will fight till the death

Child molested-demented mind
Insane a violent crime
Treat them to make them well
Let them out they kill again
