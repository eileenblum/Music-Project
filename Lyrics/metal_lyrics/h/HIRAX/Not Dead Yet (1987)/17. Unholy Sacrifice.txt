The child's fate the sacrifice
The terminate blood's the price
Burn the land watch the sky
The falling star you will die

Misfall death's mate
Fire ball Hell's gate
In the day Egyptian land
Ancient way Pharoah's plan

Drink the blood die obey
To the Gods they must pray

Justice must be done 1,000's dead by one
Responsible for all who died feel his
Wrath you're terrified

Gas them genocide shoot them bullets fly
Torture kill war crimes seek destroy devastate

The dungeon holds the prisoner
The time has come to live no more
He walk the hall to the place
The look of death upon his face
