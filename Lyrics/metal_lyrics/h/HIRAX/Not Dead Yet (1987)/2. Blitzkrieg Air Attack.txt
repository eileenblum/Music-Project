Airplanes diving! - Smoke fills the air
Horns blowing! - War is declared

Blasting, crushing, destroying, fighting back!
Pounding, thrashing! Blitzkrieg air attack

Explosions fire from the falling bombs
Buildings crumble - rubble they become

Blasting, crushing, destroying, fighting back!
Pounding, thrashing! Blitzkrieg air attack

Go in for them! Fight them to win!
Charge the rebel! Death - He must die

Surviving people burying their dead
Living corpses - nightmares in their heads

Blasting, crushing, destroying, fighting back!
Pounding, thrashing! Blitzkrieg air attack

Go in for them! Fight them to win!
Charge the rebel! Death - He must die
