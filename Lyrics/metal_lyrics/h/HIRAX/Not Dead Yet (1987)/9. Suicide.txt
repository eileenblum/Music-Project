Neglected treated bad
Outcasts no gall
Obsessed with hate
Vengence death's call

Crazy out of his mind in sand he's cracked
Desperate to take his life
Rifle gun or knife

Plead for help silent scream
No one cares now it seems
The weapon to his head
Trigger's pulled no he's dead

Die for no reason but we do not know
Why he killed himself death by suicide

Everyone wonders why
The young man took his life
Unsolved mystery
Evil let it be
