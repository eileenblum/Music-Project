On through the night
Praising what is right
Angel of Mercy
Looking over the
He must defend
The weak and the strong
Fight for the good
Conquering the wrong

Ah Ah Ah

Guardian protector
Looking over the domain
The brave warrior
Against the wicked insane
From Hades the wicked come
Trying to penetrate
Wait for the night when it's black
Thunder roars as they attack

Scream in pain the call of war
All hell's breaking loose
Holy man prays to God
That this will all soon end
The nightmare bloody death
It is real you are there
The capture the torture
When you wake up you're dead
