A killer a leader they think he is God
Demanding commanding obeying his word
Crazy psycho out of his mind
Followers believers loyal to the man

Kill for their master murder when he says
Torture all their victims
Bloodbath they look dead

Animals savages sick people they are
Praying sinning for their fake God
Wild dirty together they ride
Their home the desert cult they live

Mayhem death shoot them down
Take no prisoners kill them all
Cutting breaking thrash to death
Banging the head breaking his neck
