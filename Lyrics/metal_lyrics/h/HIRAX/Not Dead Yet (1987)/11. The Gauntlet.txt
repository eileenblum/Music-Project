Infiltrate mutilate slaughter instigate
Strike again decapitate impale rip flesh

Gauntlets striking rushing through the town
Corpse laying rotting on the ground
Rabid death the plague has won again
History repeating a war dying sin

Lightning thunder starving hunger
Kick down pissed on hell to pay bastard

Pressure mounting the clock counting
Fighting dying children crying
