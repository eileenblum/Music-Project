Day of Christ Christian war
Barbarian chivalry
Attack the land Israel
The place of the Lord
Moses said Joshua
Choose me for the fight
A top the hill Moses stands
Power in each hand

Die defeat terminate Amalek
Cry defeat holy victory

Joshua fought Amalek
Time came to pass
His faith God would decide
If heâd live or die
Moses Aaron and Hur
Held their hands up high
The sun went down
It was done Amalek had lost

Strike to win
Fight the sin
Battle of brave
To the top
