No belief oh how the children sin
Over and over they do it again and again

Call of the gods evil ones
Burn in hell you will rot

Breaking the cross turning it upside down
Acting like fools they are the devil's clowns

Call of the gods evil ones
Burn in hell you will rot

Wicked misled throwing their souls away
No mercy Satan is why they will pay
