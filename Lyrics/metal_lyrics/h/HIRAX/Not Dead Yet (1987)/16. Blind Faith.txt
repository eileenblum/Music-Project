Religion is a sacred thing
To each is their own
Do not preach your beliefs
Let people find their own, find their own

Nobody has the right to say
How to live your life
You donât have to believe in God
To be a friend of mine

Religious cults of every kind
Promise and fool disciples in
Brainwashing their innocent
An unhuman sin
Lead to believe life will be good
From sick twisted freaks
They take their money and take their souls
And throw their bodies away - Go!

Act the way you want think what you will
Life is a bitch but its still a thrill
Donât let anything get you down
Never let anyone push you around
Blind Faithâs a thing that should no be
Cause everyone has rights to choose and be free
Donât let anything get you down
Never let anyone push you around
