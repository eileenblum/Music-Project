Taken by force, you never had the chance
Sick twisted mind, his thirst for blood it grows fast
Possessed by painful, shameful, sinner thoughts
Sent from hell, he has no love for no one.
Modernday cannibal, he preys upon the weak
Deceiving the innocent he murders them at his own will
Horror unfolds this nightmare is not a dream,
He's tormented now by the act's of violence that he sees
Mouth Sewn Shut...Eye's wide open...You can't scream...
Horror takes over you...Overwhelmed by pain...
Your scared stiff...You can't move...
STRAPPED TIGHT TO THE TABLE
