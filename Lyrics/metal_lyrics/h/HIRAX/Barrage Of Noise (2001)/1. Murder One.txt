You see it on the news, it happens everyday.
Propaganda misinformed, how many have died?
They lie to you, you can't handle the truth.
The facts are all in, and the death toll is up.
The killer instinct is hard to control.
Tormented by hate, a murder is born.
Sacrifice a life, to feed the passion
They tell you to kill: The voice is in your head.

Murder One [Repeat]
