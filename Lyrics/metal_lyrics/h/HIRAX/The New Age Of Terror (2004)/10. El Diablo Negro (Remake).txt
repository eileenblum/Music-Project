Evil luciver, the hand of doom
The rules to his game, there are none
Hard drug abuse, this is the devil
Pull the hammer back on the gun.
It's your life to pick and choose
Do you really want to die?
Think about the path you walk,
Judas, the angel defies

Never regret mistakes you make
What doesn't kill you makes you strong
You can't enjoy your life to the fullest
Until you've dealt with all your fears
Don't deny the beast within, we are all totally insane
He is accountable for what's been done
Our sick society is to blame
