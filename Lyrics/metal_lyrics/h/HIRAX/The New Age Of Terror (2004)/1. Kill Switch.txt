Fight!

Murder, killings, misery and pain
Deadly full force, we've all gone insane!

[Chorus:]
Self destruct, time bomb, kill them all - die!!!
Kill switch, hell's ditch, blown to bits - die!!!

Slaughter, death, sings of the bastard's war
Overkill, power mad, spill - blood, guts and gore

[Chorus:]
Self destruct, time bomb, kill them all - die!!!
Kill switch, hell's ditch, blown to bits - die!!!

Cold as stainless steel, harder than concrete stone
A merciless tyrant of a man
You can see the venom in his eyes
Master of deceit, ice runs through his veins
Possessed by money and greed,
He will kill for what he needs!

[Chorus:]
Self destruct, time bomb, kill them all - die!!!
Kill switch, hell's ditch, blown to bits - die!!!
