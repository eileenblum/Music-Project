Suffer!!

Running and hiding the innocent are dying defenseless this killing is
Wrong protecting the land from the enemy's strong hand refuges are
Losing their lives

Suffer!!

Shooting and firing
The bullets are flying bodies expire when they fall
Strike and attack with deadly impact never to be taken alive

Suffer!!

Pushing them back, rebel soldiers attack
The bloodshed, when will it end?
Social unrest between the east and the west
Lambs to the slaughter they fall!

The tanks are advancing to the front
Gunfire lights up the sky
Heroes march to their death to kill is the ultimate sin

Surrounded by death, you'll breathe your last breath
The countdown to extinction now begins
This killing machine, a nightmarish dream
Invaders fear the final blow

Winged assassins fly fast to the zone
Driven by honor and code
Dedicating their soul to their god
Prepare it will come the jihad

Holy war!

Bushing them back
Rebel solders attack
The bloodshed when will it end?
Social unrest between the east and the west
Lambs to the slaughter they fall!

The tanks are advancing to the front
Gunfire lights up the sky
Heroes march to their deaths to kill is the ultimate sin
