Masters of destruction, in for the kill
Dismantle their enemies, at their will
Hammer smash! Pounding nails!
Invaders attack! Friends and foes!

War gods have risen
Armageddon has begun, wrath of evil, burns like the sun!

[Chorus:]
Unleash the dogs of war
Open the gates!

Born in Sodom, three thousand years ago
Dark lords of thunder, imprisoned down below
From the belly of the devil, from the breast of sin retribution is coming,
Bow to the iron dogs

War gods have risen
Armageddon has begun, wrath of evil, burns like the sun!

[Chorus]

Angels descending, the battle is commencing

Forever immortal â killing machines, soldiers of death
Masters of destruction, in for the kill
Dismantle their enemies, at their will

Hammer Smash! Pounding nails!
Invaders attack! Friends and foes!

War gods have risen
Armageddon has begun, wrath of evil, burns like the sun!

[Chorus]
