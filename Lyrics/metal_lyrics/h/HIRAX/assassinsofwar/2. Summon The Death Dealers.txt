Riding hard, riding fast, protecting innocence
From those who hide behind the mask
Above the law, allowed to roam free
The priest is guilty and punishment is the key

Summon the Death Dealers

Trusted them to teach and protect
Crossed the lines of honor and respect
Sacrilege committed inside the church
Hunt them down, for their crimes they must pay

Crimes of faith, committed by those of the cloth
You canât escape for Godâs will be done by their hand

Summon the Death Dealers

Blood is spilled, the hand of vengeance is forced
The ghost rider and the mighty black horse
Abuse of power, lies and deceit
Sentenced to die face down in the street

Crimes of faith, committed by those of the cloth
You canât escape for Godâs will be done by their hand

Called to avenge, out of the night
They stand to preserve innocence
Crusaders defend, the weak from the young
THEYâLL NEVER BACK DOWN FROM EVIL!!!

Summon the Death Dealers
