What have they done to you? ...
what's this smell on your skin? ...
let me embrace you again
let me take you on this bed... (Laying together again)
let me love you once more (no life nor death on that bed, but...)
so you would remember (just a woman and a man...)
how to breathe and why eyes must be opened (laying together again...)
eyes must be opened...
Now our passion is ripe
there's no reason to talk, my swan
just return to me your beautiful smile
or I will go back to that grave
to find it and pray that so
(your) Death will be just a bad dream
Your pale nudity
it seems the very seed of life
shining on your livid lips
that night has kissed so hard...
so hard
Why? You won't listen me
... caress me
So just let me
follow you
Straight to the hell
Far from THIS hell
Wake up... the sun has come and
Our night, this time, is really gone...
the silence devours even my last sighs
please freeze my screaming heart
please...
laying together again
laying together again
no life nor death on that bed
(but) just a woman and a man...
laying together again
tears won't wake up the dead
laying together again
laying
