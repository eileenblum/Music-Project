I want to thank you for feeling insane
You could not make up your mind
Demented and insane
Conniption fit
Thank you for being
So strange if you had gone through with it
Demented and insane
I would not be
Rotten broken
Throw your fit
You're nothing but a hypocrite
Conniption fit
Thank you for being off the edge
Though that's what you wished of him
Demented and insane
I would not be
Rotten broken
Throw your fit
You're nothing but a hypocrite
Conniption fit
Hate you leads me to believe
Your heart is kind with a disease
Demented and insane
