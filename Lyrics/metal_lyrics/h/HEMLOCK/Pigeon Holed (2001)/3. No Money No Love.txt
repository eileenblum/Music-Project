Rat races leaves a pale face-
An empty heart with a dead taste-
You left me with a cold space-
Our friendship is now a disgrace
No money no love-
An empty wallet wipes away your smile-
I wanta  life that's more worthwhile-
Than clocking in from nine to five-
I crave a way to feel alive-
No money no love
