The sky is falling-abaft memories of my youth-
all those years i longed for truth-
now i see that it's all lies-
there is no truth-your youth is dying-
falling to draw the blinds on nothing inside-
a pain subsides to use your mind- the sky is falling-
because your youth is dying-
because your youth is dying-
the sky if falling-
your world is lying-
because your youth is dying-
so innocent so pure-
a child sheltered from the world-
you'll never regain hope like before-
it's all over-the sky is falling
-dying-
why must you hide-
why can't you try-
a life of lies-
a false denial-
the sky is falling-
because your youth is dying-
because your youth is dying-
the sky is falling-
your world is lying-
because your youth is dying-
no more time-
once there's death-
no more time once there's death-
don't be scared to life your life-
the sky is falling-
because your youth is dying
