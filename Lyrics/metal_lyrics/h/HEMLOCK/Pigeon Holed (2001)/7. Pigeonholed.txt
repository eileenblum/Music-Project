From your own mold-pigeonholed-mold
you can pain yourself into a corner
or you can- you can paint yourself a new world-or
week by week and day by day
what is all of it anyway
looking forward to friday
this is what your narrow mind says
are you busy living-or are you
are you busy dying-or
pigeonholed from your own mold
washed away your chance in life
past your prime and past your time
looking back you swallow your pride
out of time and you didn't try
pigeonholed from your own mold
