Too weak to overcome
Scrambled lineage
confused kindred
reckless decisions
crying, screaming
pleading for harmony
our world is ugly
our families hideous
beauty
beauty is in the family
the complete biological family
our abundance of beauty
has diminished
kill kill kill kill
kill your children
backbone severed
repulsive association
I'll kiss the feet of the few families
that work things out
instead of giving up
