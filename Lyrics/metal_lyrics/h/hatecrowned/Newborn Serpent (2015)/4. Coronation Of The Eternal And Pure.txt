Oh devotion, oh power
Oh spacious, oh eternal
Oh void, oh immense
Oh burning, oh dinless

Embracing me with abomination
Spreading thy lawless wings of blackness
Inside me, inside thee, as one in nothingness
Ecstasy of silence, I bleed for thee, within thee

Oh majestic, oh cold
Oh dreadful, oh mighty
Oh crave, oh lustful
Oh peace, oh war

Lead me with you raging streams
Into thy abyssic visions and realms
Execute the human I used to be
Ignite inside me the blackest of flames

Crushing the universe and the stars
Bury me in thy sterile womb
Teeth and nails made my tomb
Grant me vengeance, wisdom and blood

Oh devotion, oh power
Oh spacious, oh eternal
Oh void, oh immense
Oh burning, oh dinless
Oh majestic, oh cold
Oh dreadful, oh mighty
Oh crave, oh lustful
Oh peace, oh war
Oh mother, oh father
Oh grief, oh wrathful
Oh freezing, oh boundless
Oh dominant, oh mistress
Oh grave of humanity
oh endless, oh debauchery
