I escape this flesh
This rust, this worthless pile
Of bones, skin and lies
Into a delightful form
Of shapeless flames from the dark

I float among
The barren fields
Of God's light and grace
I walk towards
The vast fields
Of Chaos,Emptiness and Darkness

And I offer this sacrifice
The inheritance of Adam's chains
Witness my love and wrath 
As I walk upon The Path
Of the Dragon and Serpent mark
Of Chaos,Emptiness and Darkness

As I roam among the pale 
Dead by mind and heart
Stench from the fate
Of woman, man and child

Sinful and wretched tales
Made the history of Gods
Heroes of charlatan tales
Made the history of mankind

None will trample my path
To the catacombs of salvation
Only whose spirit aflame
Will heed and follow my shadow
