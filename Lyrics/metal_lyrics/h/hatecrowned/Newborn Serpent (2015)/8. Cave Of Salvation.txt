Ageless, formless and dark
Rivers of rushing fire and bones
Under the crowned skull of horns
Veins of the eternal blood

Creatures of clay 
Mutilated and chained
In the name of Death
We prey, we pray

Creatures of clay
We despise, we slay
In the name of Darkness
All virtues impaled

In the depth of blackness
Hateful we soil
In the Labyrinth of light
We taint here and above 

By the spear of the beloved torment
All your images and names
Fell into a world of feces
Beyond all filth and scum

Creatures of light
Dethroned from Eden
In the name of Satan
Idols and gods impaled
