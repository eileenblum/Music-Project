Scorch the feathers as ye ignite my heart
With thy possessing eyes of dread
Summon the mist, as I reach the self
Of the long-dead dusk and dawn

Oh beckoning blackness shine further and more
Upon the feeble seed of the creeping man
The candle light of god will disturb ye not 
When I will hold thy darkness in the candles of sin

As my dignity feeds on thy humiliation
My hatred grew through generations
Stagnation to the world of virtue
As ye equally rot in the crypts of naught

Carve me with thy flaming truth
And coffin me, and bury me 
In the shrines of eternity
With the endless rivers of Gnosis
Oh mighty ones of wisdom

Unite thy wings with mine
So I may release my mind away
From this worthless creation
Oh mighty ones of wisdom

I sealed thy realms into my flesh
In the seance of the ancient reign
May they descend and we ascend
Oh preachers of the starless night
Oh bringer of light
Oh morning star

A spine between death's head and tail
The pit where ye pile the souls let me be
A dagger to the flank of sympathy
The unbroken circle of fire let me be
