The sun has darkened in the middle
Of a sky bleeding red and grey
As the curses come along the hissing
Cosmos trembled with fear and dread
For the hatching drew the Sigils on the Shells

Bloodshaped we creep in the veins of light
Injecting and spitting waterfalls of venom
Turning the brightest day into a sullen night
For the glory of the abyssic gods of destruction

We await thy presence, we fight and endure
Servants in black, in the halls of lure
The son of Man, is wretched and impure
We come to mankind, with Kingu's Blood

Oh Mighty Serpent, We approach Thee
Grant us the vision from The Abyss below
Oh Mighty Dragon, we approach thee
With bloodsmeared faces and souls
Oh Mighty Beast, we approach Thee
Guide us with thy numbing eyes
Speak forth the words of liberation's dawn.

The ancient roots of evil and vengeance arise
The halo has fallen as once it rose
Crushed by the crown of hatred and wrath
Embrace thy disastrous end with the strings of demise

Oh Serpent
Oh Dragon
Oh Beast

Born through Death
Destroy The Ten
Devour The World
