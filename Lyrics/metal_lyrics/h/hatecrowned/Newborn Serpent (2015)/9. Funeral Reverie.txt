Fatigue soul, tremulous carcass
Laid upon, sweat-cold coffin
Panoramic view, from a deathbed
Where Rat and Worm gather
Crows and Wolves, King-headed Eagle
Black yet glancing garment
Fleeting upon wine-red eyes
Pale skin as a funeral morning sun

On the zenith, of the bones pile
Where every palace, collapsed to ash
I've seen the I, scattering like glass
I've seen the Lion, devouring the Lamb
Blood-soaked, skin and fleece
Skull crushing, triumphant Snake
The emblem of death leeching the life's
Pale eyes as, a funeral night moon
