Hatred that grows wild
And enshrine my heart
With the darkest tales and macabres
Tales of mankind hypocrisy

Hatred that grows wild
And attack my soul
From the eight sides of the world
Hatred that sharpens my axe and decapetates you!

Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
My reign has come, with the gavel of dread and doom 
I am surrounded by wolves, we will feed upon you
Await the grimness, await thy doom

Your bodies occupied the lands
Even in your death you still disturb my sight
This filth this stench that stinks is the same
Either you are dead, or alive
Come my darkness and mantle their flesh
Come my ravens and bore their flesh
Come my wolves and tear their flesh
Come my rot and grow upon their flesh
Come my flames and burn their flesh
To dust, to dust, to dust
