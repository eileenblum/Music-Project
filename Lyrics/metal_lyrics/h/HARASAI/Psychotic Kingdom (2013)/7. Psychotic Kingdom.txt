From ancient wisdom to the world we know today
A shallow end, a hole of fear
The quest for truth, the search of light
Why do we die everyday with the hourglass in our hands?

With outstretched fingers to await the flames
Souls that wither to tell stories of pain
Swallow the pill and abandon to masters unreal

A song from a world in disgrace
This is the heartbeat of tragic minds
Don't you realize the loss of your freedom
Skywards we fly

Welcome to the psychotic kingdom
Streets of isolation and towers of evil
They manipulate the free will
And drink our blood

Obvious demon rides, obvious error words
There is no absolution in this hateful world
Demoralize their pride, demoralize their justice
An ideology corrupted at it's birth

Everything is grey
And everything is built on stones
Can there be a spark of light?
Can there be a glimpse of hope?

Destroy it and bleed it out

There must be a different way to find reality
Without thy bound, without thy lies
To dream beyond thy shadows, beyond thy creation
Psychotic ways to find the truth
