An invisible float swims in crystal shades
Of sophisticated life parades
The visionary retro carnage
Avoids the tear-soaked fragments of eternity

At the break of autumn
The leaves of rust disease
That lovelorn place
A winter's bane to entice my soul to sins

Just another magic driven fear
Skywards we fly
The recreation of eyes
Skywards the future with a destructive plan

This is the liquid everything
Embodiment of wrongs
Surface beyond a purple light
No guideline in sight

There is no hell, there is no heaven
There is no God, there is no master
You just forgot to trust what you see
Therefore to not wake up from your coma

Atmospheric cross roads fade to grey
Fade to nothing, breathless dawn
The smell of suicide
Just another nihilistic age to come

Skywards we fly
The recreation of eyes
Skywards the future with a destructive plan

This is the liquid everything
Embodiment of wrongs
Surface beyond a purple light
No guideline in sight

This is a bleakful happening
A flood of disgrace
And dreadful nights
A shelter to avoid life

You can't explain the fever
That pulverizes your veins
You can't explain the tides
That navigate our lives
These are the mountains
That embody our inborn chaos

Skywards we fly
The recreation of eyes
Skywards the future with a destructive plan

This is the liquid everything
Embodiment of wrongs
Surface beyond a purple light
No guideline in sight
The liquid everything is here
It is everywhere

This is a bleakful happening
A flood of disgrace
And dreadful nights
A shelter to avoid life
