The chosen way into drama
Our self-immolating path of existence
A generation lost in depression
We're all turned over to oppression

Nothing more to say, nothing to reach
In evidence perceiving the fall
How to feel or how to breathe
Unsettled by life we walk the earth

Actual a silent murder
Into the soil of evil
Into the dreams of black

Actual a silent murder
Into the soil of evil
Into the dreams of black

Enlighten my eyes
Enlighten my dreams
To bring back mental war
Of a sphere never known before

Circles of death corseting the day
Their swarms of nothingness obviate the fray
To gamble with the awakening of drives
And the deathless spiral in infinity

Enlighten my eyes
Enlighten my dreams
To bring back mental war
Of a sphere never known before, ow
Yaah

Actual a silent murder
Into the soil of evil
Into the dreams of black

Actual a silent murder
Into the soil of evil
Into the dreams of black

Enlighten my eyes
Enlighten my dreams
To bring back mental war
Of a sphere never known before
