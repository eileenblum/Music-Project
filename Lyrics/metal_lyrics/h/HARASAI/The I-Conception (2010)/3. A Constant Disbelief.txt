Yaah

Angels and demons cross our ways
Obvious to entangle our given fates
Desperate man causes sins and hate
Amorphous to find a beautiful grace
Twilight devours our senses

We elect a constant disbelief
As eternal path through our lives
Just stabbed by those filthy knives
We elect this constant drama
As we're tramping into the fire
That embodies our deepest desires

This blackness is a turning point
Flatlined by the shores of night
Losing the darkest defense
Twilight devours our senses

We elect a constant disbelief
As eternal path through our lives
Just stabbed by those filthy knives
We elect this constant drama
As we're tramping into the fire
That embodies our deepest desires
A constant disbelief
A constant disbelief

A certitude that pain is our ground
Makes us fall into the coldest voids
Like rats we crawl through the years
In regression hiding delightful fears

We elect a constant disbelief
As eternal path through our lives
Just stabbed by those filthy knives

We elect a constant disbelief
As eternal path through our lives
Just stabbed by those filthy knives
We elect this constant drama
As we're tramping into the fire
That embodies our deepest desires, yeah yeah yeah
A constant disbelief
A constant disbelief
