In consume our worlds collide
Two sides that embody the same
As the sun enlightens the moon
Averted by time and confusion

Behold, let me be
The spearhead of your storms
As you are mine
Just to melt the souls

Staring at your sad eyes
To wash away your fears
You're taking mine away
This presence takes me high
We'll just together cry
Where our dreams can fly
This waters light a fire
Dilute my false desires

Will neverland and wonderland merge tonight
Let's get over these obstacles we've made

Behold, let me be
The spearhead of your storms
As you are mine
Just to melt the souls

Behold, let me be
The spearhead of your storms
As you are mine
Just to melt the souls

Starchild, I'll catch you up
Wherever you will fall
