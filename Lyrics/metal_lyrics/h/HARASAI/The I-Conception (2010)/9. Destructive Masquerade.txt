Diieee

You travel to an orchid sphere
A flower that embodies mental decay
Frozen hearts in December nights
A winter's bane without any sky

It tears you dry, it tears you apart
Mirroring my darkened heart
You ever try to dispose this horror
Fly away from your sorrow

Inconspicuous like unheard cries
It's the embrace of your everlies
On the track to despise your life
You destruct all that was alive

Hammering the coffin nails
As I walk an astral strain
This moonlight serenade
My destructive masquerade
I never felt betrayed
Using this evil ways
This moonlight serenade
My destructive masquerade

My masquerade
Makes me blind
Blind at heart
Now

Hammering the coffin nails
As I walk an astral strain
This moonlight serenade
My destructive masquerade
I never felt betrayed
Using this evil ways
This moonlight serenade
My destructive masquerade

My
My never-ending path
Of self-destruction
