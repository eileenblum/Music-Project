Drifting into the voids of existence
All false illusions colliding
This face marked by eternal sorrow
This is our final burden to borrow

A confrontation once lost
With our sickminded inner frost
Caused by devouring holes
That were created by reckless fools

In the hour of the dead eyes
Everything you once dreamed will be killed
You will fall down to zero

When souls get reborn
Through the blackest thorns
Resistant to the worms
To shatter their scorn
