You got me by the throat
And I feel my own demise
I'm standing on a sinkin' boat
Of whom I now despise

Share my pain, share my anger
Life in vein, falling for another

Your betrayel etching out the past
And I feel an urgent need
To tear apart what should last
To do the evil deed
Facing opponents, taking revenge
Before the dawn they'll bleed

Share my pain, share my anger
My disdain, your own failure

Nothing more to cover up, nothing to explain
You will take your chosen way into oblivion
I will lead my steps away to a brighter day
You will take your chosen way into oblivion

Aaaaah

Found my will, found my passion
You will fade, you're not worth a second thought

Nothing more to cover up, nothing to explain
You will take your chosen way into oblivion
I will lead my steps away to a brighter day
You will take your chosen way into oblivion
Into oblivion
Into oblivion
