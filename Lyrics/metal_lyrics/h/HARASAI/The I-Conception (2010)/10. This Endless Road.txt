There is a hole that erodes this visage
An endless ocean defines this pain
You get affronted, you get insane
Blue eyes weaken the assured man

Mirror-portraits get broken
To flood all grey emotions
From afar I see her now
This perspective is so hollow

This endless road is paved with sweat and aguish
Cravings for the flesh scourge my dying reason
It's a black light projection to fall from earth
A revelation of my deepest fears

I dip into silence to find redemption
A broken whisper echos in the dark
At the edge of the darkest stench I'm falling into the ways of misery's reign
Uncertain where to go or where to fall I create this frozen chords
And to aim for this deranged bound is my self-imposed isolation, my black bane

Mirror-portraits get broken
To flood all grey emotions
From afar I see her now
This perspective is so hollow

I am drifting into the shores of depression
Creating my sings of confession

Mirror-portraits get broken
To flood all grey emotions
From afar I see her now
This perspective is so hollow

This endless road is paved with sweat and aguish
Cravings for the flesh scourge my dying reason
It's a black light projection to fall from earth
A revelation of my deepest fears

This endless road, my death parade
Misery's reign, echos in the dark
