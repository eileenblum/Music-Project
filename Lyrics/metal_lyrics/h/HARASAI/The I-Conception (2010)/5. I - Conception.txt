Aaaaah

I see my life in ruins
Destructed by everdreams
I scream my name again
Final symbols of fear
In visions I seek shelter
Visions of another life
Constructed new realities
Schizophrenic episodes

Everlasting escape
Versus conclusive perception

Nevermore I bear
This I-conception I created
Into an abyss I fall
To release myself

Weepings in a silent night
Creeping into their hearts
Listening to the tribal beats
To behold a blackened feed

Everlasting escape
Versus conclusive perception

Nevermore I bear
This I-conception I created
Into an abyss I fall
To release myself

Aaaaah

I-conceptions prevaricate
I-conceptions bleed to death
Prevaricate
Bleed to death

Another one-way focus discharged by the martyr
Who is throwing away egomania's burning crown

Ow
Everlasting escape
Versus conclusive perception

Now I see what is real
A cosmic relation
Nevermore I bear
This I-conception I created
Into an abyss I fall
To release myself
Now I see what is real
A cosmic relation
