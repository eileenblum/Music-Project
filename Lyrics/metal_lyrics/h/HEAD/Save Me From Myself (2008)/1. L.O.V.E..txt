I gave you everything, all the pain life brings
Just to get you to come back to me
I want to give you light, I donât want to ever fight
Stop resisting and come home to me
Youâre so afraid of love, thereâs not much time
All the pain inside just makes you want to die

Love me, donât hate me, youâre angry, itâs OK
Trust me, come this way, live in eternity

Iâm the real drug to take, to numb your heartache
Stop your running and come back to me
Iâve had it up to here, Iâve cried way too many tears
Youâll keep suffering till you come to me
Outside you act so tough but inside you cry
All the pain inside just makes you want to die

Love me, donât hate me, youâre angry, itâs OK
Trust me, come this way, live in eternity

Your soul is mine, your soul is mine
I donât want to fight
Your soul is mine, donât be unkind
Your soul is mine, your soul is mine
I donât lie, I swear youâll never die
Stay alive when I restore all mankind

Love me, donât hate me, youâre angry, itâs OK
Trust me, come this way, live in eternity
Come see, youâll soon be not guilty and set free
