Letâs make a hit, weâll be so rich and famous
Weâll have it all, weâll be everyoneâs favorite
No way, I wonât sell out for the money
Kill me, Iâd rather die
It took us ten years to build a fan base
I quit, I canât, I wonât live a lie
This is goodbye

Loyalty has all been thrown away
Where did all the loyalty go?
Where did it go?

OK, Iâve quit, what now?
Do I sit in church and pray?
No way, not me,
Iâve got to try and change things, without failing
Iâm not crazy, I just want to help
The gift of life, forget quick
Teenage abortion, its so sick
We give these kids a choice to kill
Then they hate themselves because we gave them free will
But God loves them still

Loyalty has all been thrown away
Where did all the loyalty go?
Where did it go?

Please donât lie, or kill, itâs making me ill
Donât lie, or kill, itâs making me ill
Please just donât lie! Just donât kill!
Please canât you stop, itâs making me ill!
Please just donât lie! Just donât kill!
Please canât you stop, itâs making me ill!
Isnât it time for us to be real?

Loyalty has all been thrown away
Where did all the loyalty go?
Where did it go?

Will love bring it back?
Loyalty
Bring it back! Bring it back! Bring me love!
Where did all the loyalty go?
Where did it go?
Bring it back! Bring it back! Bring it back!
Bring it back! Bring it back! Bring it back!
Bring me love! Bring it back!
