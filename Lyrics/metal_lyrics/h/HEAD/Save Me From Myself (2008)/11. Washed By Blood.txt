I know youâve tried to satisfy
Your appetite for too long
You wonder why you are alive
Youâve lived a lie for too long
So now youâre done
Life isnât fun anymore
Whatâs this life for?

These are not only words to a song
Come to me, youâre forgiven now
Youâre washed by blood, from deep inside!
Youâre not a prisoner of your old life
Washed by blood, a brand new start!
Itâs time that I rebuild your heart

Iâve paid your price
I sacrificed my human life all for you
Come to the light, you will shine bright
Youâll never die, thatâs the truth
Cause I have sworn youâll be reborn
If you choose, whatâs there to lose?

These are not only words to a song
Come to me, youâre forgiven now
Youâre washed by blood, from deep inside!
Youâre not a prisoner of your old life
Washed by blood, a brand new start!
Itâs time that I rebuild your heart

Wash away all the pain
With the blood, no more shame
Understand who you are
And what your life is for, for, for

Wash away all your pain
With the blood, no more shame
Understand who you are
And what your life is for, for, for

I am taking over from now on
You canât escape, donât even try to run
I canât just sit and watch you die no more
You will begin to learn what life is for

Iâve chosen this life
To change your mind
So you will find your way back home
Where you belong
Your heart of stone
Will start to feel love from now on

Live for me and you will see
Your life will be so worry-free
Say goodbye to your old life,
Give me a try, be alive!

There shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying
There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away

Youâre washed by blood, from deep inside!
Youâre not a prisoner of your old life
Washed by blood, a brand new start!
Itâs time that I rebuild your heart

Come fly away with me
And come fly away with me
You know I love you
I love you
Come fly with me
Love, love, love, love
