Mom and dad are not happy, they fight every night
They canât even get through just one day without a fight
Mom and dad donât notice me, they work six days a week
Sundays we all go to church, but we donât even speak

Rebel! Rebel!
Your parents have failed you,
And Iâm here to tell you
Rebel! Rebel!
The world has abused you,
And Iâm here to choose you!

My step dad, he hates me so he hits me all the time
But when weâre around people, he acts like weâre all fine
My real dad, he left us all one day when I was born
Mom got drunk and told me that my dad loved me no more

Rebel! Rebel!
Your parents have failed you,
And Iâm here to tell you
Rebel! Rebel!
The world has abused you,
And Iâm here to choose you!

The blood has poured out, just like dust
Just read the writing on the wall
Youâre so consumed with your lust
You do not fear my word at all
Itâs time I break your family curse
Of lies, neglect, abuse, and shame
Youâll have to give me your life, first
Youâll never be the same!

Youâre not alone anymore, if you knock Iâll open the door
Donât forget about the call to love me with all your heart!
If you give me just that one request, we will never be apart!
Your life, it means so much to me, youâve been abused in every way
Everyone on Earth has let you down, now come, try me
Theyâre breaking, theyâre taking you down, let her
Willing to kill you right now, let her
Theyâre breaking, theyâre taking you down, let her
Willing to kill you right now, let her, let her
Let her, let her, let her, let her, let her
