Iâm sick of all your rules
Theyâre so man-made
You treat them all like fools
You put my name to shame
Iâm everything youâre not
I give them love
My ways you have forgot
You put yourselves above

Iâll testify!
Itâs time to see religion die!
The truth canât lie!
Itâs time to see religion die!
Who cares whoâs right?
Itâs time to see religion die!
Iâll crush the fight!
Itâs time to see religion die!

Church is not inside your building walls
On Sundays you all hide, while the world just falls
Now go into the world and destroy Hell
You have authority, use it for the kill

Iâll testify!
Itâs time to see religion die!
The truth canât lie!
Itâs time to see religion die!
Who cares whoâs right?
Itâs time to see religion die!
Iâll crush the fight!
Itâs time to see religion die!

Children come away with me
I want you all to be mine
I am taking back whatâs mine
And youâve killed too much time
With pointing all your fingers
At your kids thatâs why theyâre lost
Try to look deep in their eyes
You will see suicide
Blame it on yourself
Cause no one else will pay your price, your price

Die just, die religion die, just die
Die just, die religion die, just die
Die! Die! Die! Die!
Die! Die! Die! Die!
Religion, die!
Die! Die! Die!

Do not be afraid
Religion is man-made
Everything is OK
The rules have just been changed
