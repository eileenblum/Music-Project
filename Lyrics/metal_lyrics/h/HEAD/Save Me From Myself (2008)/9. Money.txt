Look at yourself, you canât even get to sleep
Boy, you love your wealth, you bow down to your money
Youâve got what you want, but it wonât get you far
Was it what you thought? You forgot who you are!
Your wife has left you and you donât see your kid!
Now get on your knees you know who your god is!

Your god is money, so bow down to it!
You act so funny, just look at yourself!
Youâve lost your family, your friends all use you
You canât buy happiness, so get down on your knees
Bow down!

Look at yourself, your tickets are almost free
To everyone else, you look like youâre living the dream
Addictions have left you in your own gutter!
You canât buy your way out of this hell on earth!
If you donât get up quick, you will soon be dead!
Now get on your knees, you know who your god is!

Your god is money, so bow down to it!
You act so funny, just look at yourself!
Youâve lost your family, your friends all use you
You canât buy happiness, so get down on your knees
Bow down! Bow down to your money

Bow down! Get down on your knees
Bow down! Bow down to your money
Bow down! Get down on your knees
Bow down to your money,
Were your dreams what you
Always thought theyâd be?
Get down on your knees!
Bow down to your money!
Were your dreams what you
Always thought theyâd be?

Now bow down!
Bow down! Bow down!
Bow down! Bow down!
Bow down! Bow down!
Bow down! Bow down!
Bow down! Bow down!
Bow down! Bow down!
Bow down! Bow down!
Bow down, now!
Hold on to your money, now

Your god is money, so bow down to it!
You act so funny, just look at yourself!
Youâve lost your family, your friends all use you
You canât buy happiness, so get down on your knees
Bow down! Bow down to your money
