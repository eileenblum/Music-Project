Forget all the rules, forget everything
You took my name out of schools
I take back my blessings
How can I bless the things I donât believe in?
Is it right? Remember whose planet it is, Mine

You wake, youâre fake, you take away from me
I donât try to make things right
Earthquakes will shake to wake you up again
Cry, thatâs why I donât protect your nation now

My rain is pouring down,
Youâre welcome to drink
Just follow your heart,
And try not to fake
Iâll relieve you for good,
Matching torture in your soul
But first you have to die to yourself, now

You wake, youâre fake, you take away from me
I donât try to make things right
Earthquakes will shake to wake you up again
Cry, thatâs why I donât protect your nation now

Youâll be so sorry then, youâll wish you were forgiven
Quaking, shaking, earth quaking, shaking
Earth quaking, shaking, earth quaking, shaking
Earth quaking, shaking

Shake! Shake! Quake! Quake!
Shake! Shake! Quake! Quake!
Shake! Shake! Quake! Quake!
Shake! Shake! Quake! Quake!

Buildings are crashing down, just look around and see
You wake, youâre fake, you take away from me
I donât try to make things right
Earthquakes will shake to wake you up again
Cry, thatâs why I donât protect your nation now
Cry, thatâs why I donât protect your nation now
