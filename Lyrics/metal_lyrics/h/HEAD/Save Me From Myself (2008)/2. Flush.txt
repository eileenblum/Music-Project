Look at my face, Iâm all sucked up
I think Iâll sleep all day
I get the spins when my eyes are shut
I hate feeling this way

Flush all the puke Iâm throwing up!
In the toilet this sucks!
Not a part of growing up!
Only spoils it

Life is boring, same old story,
Get drunk, throw up, sleep all day
I am something, Iâm not nothing
I canât let myself decay

How did I get into my bed?
I donât remember anything
How did I get this bump on my head?
It could have come from anything

Flush all the puke Iâm throwing up!
In the toilet, this sucks!
Not a part of growing up!
Only spoils it

Life is boring, same old story,
Get drunk, throw up, sleep all day
I am something, Iâm not nothing
I canât let myself decay

Tell me no gossip,
I donât wanna know
Jimmy got caught,
Smelling like beer,
By his mom and his dad,
Heâs grounded for a year
Lisa got popped,
She got a DUI
She cussed out the cops,
Sheâs lucky sheâs alive
Tell me no gossip,
I donât wanna know
Pedro got jumped,
Heâs always starting fights
Every time he gets drunk
It happens all the time
Reggie ODâd
From slamming heroin
Heâs not a dope fiend
He was trying to fit in
Take me away please
Oh know life blows

Flush all the puke Iâm throwing up!
In the toilet this sucks!
Not a part of growing up!
Only spoils it

Flush all the puke Iâm throwing up!
In the toilet this sucks!
Not a part of growing up!
Only spoils it

Life is boring, same old story,
Get drunk, throw up, sleep all day
I am something, Iâm not nothing
I canât let myself decay

Come on, get up, letâs change!
Come on, get up, letâs change!
Come on, get up, letâs change!
Come on, get up, letâs change!
