Understand!
Itâs for the sake!
Of every man!
That I must take!
This whole world back!
To make things right!
I will attack!
I came to fight!

I will rise a generation up to be my soldiers
I will tie my heart to yours, put my head on your shoulders

Make your escape from life with Adonai!
Everything in life depends on Adonai!

Understand!
Itâs for the sake!
Of every man!
That I must take!
This whole world back!
To make things right!
I will attack!
I came to fight!

Natural disasters will keep coming but donât worry
My people donât live in fear of death, thatâs how you should be

Make your escape from life with Adonai!
Everything in life depends on Adonai!
Lift all your worries up to Adonai!
You will all stop hurting, come to Adonai!

Leave me alone, now
Iâm not from here
My homeâs in Heaven
Leave me alone
Rise! Rise! Rise up Adonai!
Rise! Rise! Rise up Adonai!
Rise! Rise! Rise up Adonai!
Rise! Rise! Rise up Adonai!

Let your worries rest on Adonai
Life is just a test from Adonai
Make your escape from life with Adonai!
Everything in life depends on Adonai!
Lift all your worries up to Adonai!
You will all stop hurting, come to Adonai!

Understand!
Itâs for the sake!
Of every man!
That I must take!
This whole world back!
To make things right!
I will attack!
I came to fight! I came to fight!
I came to fight! I came to fight!
I came to fight! I came to fight!
I came to fight! I came to fight!
