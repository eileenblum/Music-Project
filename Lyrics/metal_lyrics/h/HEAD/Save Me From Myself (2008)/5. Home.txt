My little boy, bow your head in shame
Youâve disgraced your fatherâs name,
And now, itâs time you choose
Your little toys wonât save you from shot ten
Without me you will not win,
No, I swear youâll lose

Wisdom comes through suffering
Tell me whyâd you let him
Give you a cheap name?
Itâs time to come home
Playtimeâs over now

Youâre nowhere near,
The teachings of Martin Luther King
Did you forget all about his dream?
Now, itâs time you choose
Godâs hand was there
Think back to when you were down, itâs so clear
Itâs time that you do what is right here
Thereâs no excuse, thereâs no excuse

Wisdom comes through suffering
Tell me whyâd you let him,
Give you a cheap name?
Itâs time to come home
Playtimeâs over now

Itâs my world, itâs my world
Itâs my world, itâs my world
Itâs my world, itâs my world
Itâs my world, itâs my world
Son itâs my world, itâs my world,
Itâs not your world
Iâve tried peace, Iâve tried love
Iâve tried kind, I give up
You donât hear, you donât feel
Now Iâm here, and Iâm real
I gave you my blessings
Youâve failed from testings
Iâll show you what death brings
Now feel how my wrath stings
God told me that you were about to die for living this way
God saved me so I must teach whatâs right, so you see
Itâs my world, itâs my plan
Itâs my sea, itâs my land
Itâs my moon, theyâre my stars
Youâre my mind, youâre my heart
Whatâs your choice?
Whatâs your role?
Youâre my life, youâre my soul
Youâre my son, youâre my seed
Weâre one love, come home, please
Come home, please
Come home, please
Come home, please
Come home, please
Come home, please
Come home, please
Come home, please
Come home, please
