Another day in life, which way will I go?
Will I pick suicide? How do I say no?
The demons are calling me
Just one more line
Voices echoing in my head
These thoughts arenât mine

Chop it, snort it
The kid? Ignore it
Life sucks, Iâm over it
Save me from myself
Canât quit, I tried it
Your love? Denied it
Canât fake it, I hate it
Please help me God!
Save me from myself,
Iâm begging you God!
Save me from my hell

Chilling in my own gutter,
Iâve sunk so low
I want to be a good father
But, hear the voices go

Chop it, snort it
The kid? Ignore it
Life sucks, Iâm over it
Save me from myself
Canât quit, I tried it
Your love? Denied it
Canât fake it, I hate it
Please help me God!

Save me from myself,
Iâm begging you God!
Save me from my hell

Save me, save me from my life now
Save me, save me from my life now
Wake up, wasted
Get up, wasted
Go out, wasted
Come home, so wasted
Play shows, wasted
Pimp hoes, wasted
Life blows, Iâm wasted
No more living wasted!
Drug use! I get that!
Abuse! I get that!
Iâve failed! I get that!
I wonât kill myself!
Depression! I get that!
Suicide! I get that!
Telling lies! I get that!
I wonât kill myself!
Father! Thank you!
Father! I live for you now!
I bow down, Adonai, bow down, Adonai
Bow down, Adonai, bow down and
I bow down, Adonai, bow down, Adonai
Bow down, Adonai
Oh my God, I live for you now
Oh my God, I live for you now

God! Save me from myself,
Iâm begging you God!
Save me from my hell
