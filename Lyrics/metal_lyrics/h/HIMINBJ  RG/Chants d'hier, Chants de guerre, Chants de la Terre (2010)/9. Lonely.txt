Since the road is so long, since the rain is so cold.
I prowl among all the people, since I am so lonely.

Since the snow is so nice, when it's when it's falling slowly.
I prowl among all the people, but I am so lonely.

I'm so hateful that the fire rises within me.
I know that it's gonna bring me power.
