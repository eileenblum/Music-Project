I am the insane, speaking with inconsistent words
I am the deranged guy who claims he talks to his ancestors
I am the alienated who builds his life on intangible things
I am the one youâd like to lock up in your asylum.

You are the surety of this system,
You are the surety of its values,
You are the surety of its quietness,
You are the surety of this system,
You are the surety of its values,
But donât look at it closer, it could look like a cockroach nest...
Iâm living in hell

I am the monster who affirms that to each people belongs its own land
I am the sanguinary being who covers his face with his enemiesâ guts
I am the shadow which rapes your sleep every night
And I am the one youâd like to lock up, more than anyone else

You are the surety of this system,
You are the surety of its values,
You are the surety of its quietness,
You are the surety of this system,
You are the surety of its values,
But donât look at it closer, it could look like a cockroach nest...
Iâm living in hell

I have no pity for you fuckinâ asshole
Youâre just a bastard with no conscience of the meaning of your deeds
We used to be from the same blood but your spirit is just an empty shell now
May my hate feed this ocean which will annihilate you.

Letâs Odinâs words burst forth through my mouth
May my hands accomplish his only will...

Die, die, die, die, die, die
