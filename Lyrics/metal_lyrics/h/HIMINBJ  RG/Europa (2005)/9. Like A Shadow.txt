Friendship and years passed by,
To live present time without thinking that it will become the past
Souvenirs go away and become a bit more inaccessible everyday

Oh my God, how could have imagined?
The frames of my soul did break down one by one
Only the root with a dying face remains
It waits for vital food on the other side
Thereâs no longer anything nice in my life.

I only see death everywhere
Oh my God what did I become?
I feel dead, I am a shadow roaming among people...
I am a roaming shadow.

I am a shadow roaming among people
And I am walking alone a dark and endless road

I am a shadow roaming among people
And I am walking alone a dark and endless road
