Far away behind the barricades that rise around the huge fortress, the sun rises,
And it seems like it tells me that all is over

Death is our destiny and an icy shiver is glancing through the landscape

Men fought restlessly and our wives and children die of hunger,
How can an entire people disappear instantaneously?

Death is our destiny and an icy shiver is glancing through the landscape.
But even through death we remain the proud and courageous Celts that we always have been.

I have an appointment with my own death and my oeuvre will be accomplished intimately,
I know itâs gonna be blazing and memorable because Gallic spirit is immortal.
I will cross the limen as the proud warrior that I am.
