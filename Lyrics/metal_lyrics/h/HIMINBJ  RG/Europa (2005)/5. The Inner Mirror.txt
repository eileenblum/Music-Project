A very last chance before I sink in the night
Everything sets ablaze.

I love you so...
Youâre the blood that flows in my veins

The miracle happens and changes everything
Now life is my own.

And sublime illumination did hide a dreadful intention
The joy decorum breaks down, the mirror of time raises in front of me now...

Look, all your deeds are written on it
Soul palpates its own reality

Did you really think you deserved something better than that?
