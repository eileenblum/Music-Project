It was in Europe, in a time when our ancestors knew how to perceive themselves through Nature,
Period of conscience of the positive and negative aspects of every reality,
Neverending wars, to push back the enemy, above all, not loose any territory.

It was in Europe, at the decline era, first step in the night for the Pagan people,
Christianism arrival, it spreads on the Earth as the pest does with animals.

Perfid religion, fiendishing every ancestral rite and anything thatâs not Christian
Neverending wars, to push back the enemy, above all, not loose any territory.

Itâs my land, it did give me birth and grew me up
Through it I can see my ancestors calling me,
Now I join them and take place on the edge of time
In order to keep that way open through ages.
