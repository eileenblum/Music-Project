To go forward and never give up,
To get back up each time and rush in like a bull
I always followed this flame that I carry in me,
And never has it been extinguished by any storm

Never give up and fight,
Never give up and fight,

To go forward never listening to those who judge me while,
They themselves behave as rats
I've never courted those who from behind their mask want to see me,
On the ground

Never give up and fight,
Never give up and fight
Never give up and fight,
Never give up and fight

Because life is a nightmare within which we live our dreams

To feed the light during a neverending winter,
To feel I, I and, always I,
When you lost everything and only the source remains, you,
As a snow covered tree, in a field

Never give up, fight forever!
Never give up, fight forever!
