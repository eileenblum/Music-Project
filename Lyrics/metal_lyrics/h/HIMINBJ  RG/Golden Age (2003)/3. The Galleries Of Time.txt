To climb back up the galleries of time,
To melt in this ocean of spirits,
To bath in this substance of autumn colors,
To be the fÅtus in your own stomach

To climb back up the galleries
Whose walls are made of the spirits of our ancestors,
The guardians of time
To bath in cosmic matter, the mother, the matrix, the whole

To feel the connection, and see the inside outside
To see the connection, and feel the outside inside
To feel the connection, and see the inside outside
To see the connection, and feel the outside inside

It's a profound exploration of the human soul,
An intimate dialogue with the origin of things,
It's a profound exploration of human nature,
A bath in the primitive energies

Suddenly an internal wave submerges me
The storm breaks and I now feel energies of fiery,
Active and creative energies

Now I know the color of positive energy necessary to influence things
I have the spark at the tip of my fingers
I can feel it inside my spirit and body

To feel the connection, and see the inside outside
To see the connection, and feel the outside inside
To feel the connection, and see the inside outside
To seal the connection, and feel the outside inside

It's a profound exploration of the human soul,
An intimate dialogue with the origin of things,
It's a profound exploration of human nature,
A bath in the primitive energies
