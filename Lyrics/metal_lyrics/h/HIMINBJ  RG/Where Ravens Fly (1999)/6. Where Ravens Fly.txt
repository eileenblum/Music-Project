Fly mighty ravens fly,
Fly up high in the sky...
Fly over the forests, over the mountains...
Fly over the seas, mighty ravens fly...
Black riders of the winds of destiny
Flying silently over my head
By fixing my calm and deep gaze on you
I raise my spirit which slowly mixes with yours
Then through your onyx eyes
I can see and know
Know the divine message
CArried over the wings of the northern wind
The ravens' spirit majestically flies
To the slow rhythm of our hearts...
