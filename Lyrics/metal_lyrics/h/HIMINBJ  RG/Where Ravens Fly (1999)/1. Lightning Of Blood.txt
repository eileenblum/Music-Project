Steel is still faintly glimmering in the sunlight
But wounds will soon smoke in the freezing dawn
And my sword will be the color of embers....
My war horse hammering the ground with impatience.

Proud with our swrods and shields in hands,
Our ancestors' blood burning within our bodies
We are spinning a web of fright for our enemies
And each man will see his face in it.

On our battlefield at dawn,
In the ravens' shadow slowly gliding,
Carefully observing every single move
In a majestic aerial dance.

We are marching wild with the desire to fight
And the blood in my mouth awakes madness in me
My mind is now as burning as fire
My animal spirits dominate... lightning of blood!
