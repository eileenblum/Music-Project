NidhÃ¶ggr, gnawing the roots of the cosmic tree
Devouring the corpses of Hvergelmir

NidhÃ¶ggr, soon will the smell of your vomit
Reach the heights of the black mountains

The doors of Helheim are open!
(Rush to MidgÃ¥rd) Huuh!

Sky and earth are the same colour
The colour of hatred, of blood
Everything is drowned into the lakes, of unclean blood
Here comes the dawn of a new age
