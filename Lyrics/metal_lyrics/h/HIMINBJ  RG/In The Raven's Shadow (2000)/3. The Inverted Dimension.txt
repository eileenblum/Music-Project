Start dust in my eyes
Winter cold in my hand
Moon dust in my heart
Moon reflexion, deep inside my eyes...

On the path of self individual revelation
A fixes its freezing glance on me

Expression of the digging dimension, like a truth that my only soul can touch. The infinite loop of inverted powers appears, inside of me...

Each thought I have each deed I make,
Is a seed which modifies the relief in both dimensions, wich charges the universe with an unempty emptiness. But also fills emptiness with plenitude...

Our lives and deeds are only livid agitations,
Fertie excuses of god's spirits,
The only power is love, But hate is just an antipower
