I'm walking into the labyrinth of universe
Trying yo find my direction, led by the stars

I accomplish my desperate quest, thoughts the obstacles of existence,
I'm looking for the path, which will lead me, to myself...

Odin yeg vet as du ser oss,
Oh pater ov de morke tider,
Vi er din sonner, yeg vet at
At din makt grenselose...

As I's walking, it becomes clear, it become blurred,
Reality becomes illusion, and illusion reality...

Odin yeg vet as du ser oss,
Oh pater ov de morke tider,
Vi er din sonner, yeg vet at
At din makt grenselose...

The stars I followed before, were only reflexions,
Everything breaks down one more time, as I'm loosing, I understand

I'm walking, observing the motions of universe,
I know that one day I'll be in front of myself,
My being and sensations, reflexions of each others...
