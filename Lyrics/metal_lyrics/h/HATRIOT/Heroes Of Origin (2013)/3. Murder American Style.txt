[1st verse:]
It happens to people innocently
So caught up in their own affairs
Murder for hire, Murder for greed
Murdered more americans
The killing of children, the killing of moms
Muders of domestic violence
Capture attention, the horror appalls
Sorrow for the end of silence

[CHORUS:]
Now its all for the world to see
In all the papers and on the TV
How we know whos the devils child
And this is murder american style

[2nd verse:]
They slaughter the butcher, then smile in your face, and carry on like nothings wrong
Once its discoverd, what a disgrace, the damage that is done is done,
It happend to small towns farm USA, innocence thats stripped for good,
Someone who known someone of trust, someone who knows all of us

[CHORUS]
