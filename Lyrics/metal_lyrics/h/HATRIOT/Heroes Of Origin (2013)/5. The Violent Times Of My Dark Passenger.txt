Patiently awaiting the arrival if my next victim like I take for no surprise right before their eyes,
As I seal the deal on their fate darkness takes the height the blood looks black against the moon to me so picturesque.

Devastating mentally sender of eternal peace carefully I pick the place
Brutally I kill you as you lie in wait
Dump the bodies where they lie after they are all cut up
Something of a ritual something that I have to do when I kill you.

These are the violent times of my dark passenger,
These are the selfish dreams of my own massacre,
Leaving a trail of blood as if it's from a messenger,
Forgive the violent times of my dark passenger

In so much as evil plays a part in my own life do you think that I'm insane for destroying those to blame
So by killing just evil ones who seem to get away this the way to let them know death is the price to pay

Killing always numbs the pain until again I take a life and it doesn't matter when I will have to kill you again,
Guilty are the chosen ones they will have a price to pay with only their life I want

Something that I have to do love to kill you warning your time has come
