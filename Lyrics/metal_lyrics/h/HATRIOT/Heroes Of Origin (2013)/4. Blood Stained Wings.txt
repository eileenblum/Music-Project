Fallen from the nest a future of promise no more
Disgust from family and friends now a total waste of human life
Sympathy for no one in your life is the key to your callous driven soul
Tarnished the image of a family name to but all abide your social suicide

Watching in pain as you go down in flames
And destroy everything dripping your blood stained wings

Infamous a legacy you leave for us never to destroy the dignity
Disgraced destroyed credibility for promises you never could achieve
Outlaw an outcast in society a ruthless killer with no fucking heart
Apologies for a families dignity for he has been a demon from the start

Oppressing that aggression oppressing all the hate
Oppressing that aggression oppressing all the hate

Forbidden lies deception the thing that hate creates
Disgusting way so I disorder the unfair games you play
Makes living with you harder as your life disintegrates 
Your blacklist reputation and failure to address the systematic spiral clown arise 
No more respect your rehabilitation will only feed the need to blame all those responsible for your own selfish greed
