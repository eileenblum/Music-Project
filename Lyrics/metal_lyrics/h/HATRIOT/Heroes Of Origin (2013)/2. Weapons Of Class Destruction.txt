Another school under siege is the breath refreshing me
This time bombs a teen assault, attack that no one foresees
Chaos and panic and nobody lives expecting this mayhem when havoc begins
I am scared but I am going to survive fallen students and death and suicide
What do they think a desperate mind being brought to the brink
The parents receive a call from the morgue they could not believe

Watch close for the quiet minds for they may strike at any time
Dangerous children like at Columbine killers in class without a warning sign
It is now become an epidemic such easy targets are pathetic
Too late now for introductions it is weapons of class destruction
Weapons of class destruction weapons of class destruction
Weapons of class destruction weapons of class destruction

Revenge so extreme planning assault that nobody believes
The innocent bleed and die by the hand of those pushed to succeed
Feelings of remorse does not exist at the top of the list
A community scorned wounded by the shocking events to report

Death first never surrender death first never surrender
Death first never surrender death first never surrender
Weapons! that blow off your classmate's face
Weapons! that blow up yourself
Weapons! are those who just do not care
Weapons! of the cards you are dealt
