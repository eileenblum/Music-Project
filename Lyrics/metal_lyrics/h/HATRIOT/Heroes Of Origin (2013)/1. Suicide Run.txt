Out of his mind and out of control,
The sting of the whip has
Yet buried His soul,
To carry on with blood on his hands,
Wreckless intent to destroy all he can,
Don't care to die, so fuck all who try,
Revenge and vengeance is never denied,
Begging for your life,
Will not help your cause,
Now committing murder,
Awaiting hells applause.

[Chorus:]
In a drug filled craze,
He fulfills his rage by
Inflicting his own brand
Of torment and the death
He brings, that fall into his
Plan chaos and mayhem will
Be done, the moon will
Swallow the sun,
This is to be his suicide run,
And kill and kill and kill
And kill and kill

Hunting down his enemies
Destroying one by one,
Not giving any pity or
Remorse, for what he's done
The killer lives inside him, it
Has nowhere to go,
Eventually he'll fall as the story goes

[Chorus]
