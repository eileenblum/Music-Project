Jihad's soldiers martyrs keeper 
Unleash violence on their people
Silence turns to screams and bodies everywhere 
An action so extreme that no one never ever seems to care 
Why does this have to be innocent people die the senseless slaughtering 
Of third world countries who welcome this thing

Globacidal, suicidal homocidal maniacs globacidal worldwide 
Religious kamikazes strike and sacrifice their bodies 
Like it's globacidal genocide

Crowded markets, easy targets tragedy awaits 
Everyday they kneel to pray that they will meet their fate
To die with dignity is living by a creed 
Eternal life ahead is waiting for me as I bleed 
Not afraid of death an honour so complete 
Forty virgins wait to reward all those who die in hate 

So in time of great rebellion 
Desperate measures mounting tension 
Globacidal bombing set the standard worldwide
Why does this have to be? 
Why do I have to see? 
Why do I have to cry? 
Why do we have to die?
