Lunatics nut jobs whack case
Running through the halls for all to bleed
Orderlies holding violent ones
Who can't be controlled chemically
Snap case time for someone to get control
Of situations running out of hand
Lockdown, no more will we ever be
Subjected to this devious sub-plan

Let all the insane go free
Let all of them go home
Let all the insane go free
Sedate them with heavy dose
Let all the insane go free
Let all of them go home
Let all the insane go free
There can be no hope

Soon your demise at the palm of my hand
Locked up like rats in experiment labs
No time for revenge
Remember the damned
No sympathy as we kill on command

Red flags sirens tearing through your ears
Signaling release of those in care
Prozac mental headed residents
Running amok with no despair
False sense safety is not guaranteed
For anyone or anything at large
Round up corralling all the lunatics
And putting the authorities in charge

Let all the insane go free
Let all of them go home
Let all the insane go free
Sedate them with heavy dose
Let all the insane go free
Let all of them go home
Let all the insane go free
There can be no hope

Someone will live
Someone will die
Tonight

Caged animals
So free at last
Abomination call
To destroy the past
Just one more chance to feel free
To smell the air for eternity
So conjure one last thought
Defy what's taught and who is bought

Some will live
Some will die
All at large
Will multiply
Twisted minds
Twisted lines
Exercising
Your demise
