Punish all politicians
Condemn all of their greed
Defend the rights our liberties
Sacrificed disease
Never will we let them take our guns away
Maybe in a foreign land
But not in the USA

Face down dead on the ground a killer is walking away
People kill, bullets don't, so the fact remains
Death's face shares a twist if you're not prepared
Safety's off, lock and load, see no longer scared

Freedoms of a country written long ago
Should not ever modify, the rights that we now own
Execution homicide, and gun related crimes
Are casualties of laws that bleed right to blinded eyes

Who oh oh
American Phenomenon
Everybody's got a gun
American Phenomenon
Kill somebody with a gun

I'd rather be a criminal
Then give up on the hunt
The President himself should know
Our wars are fought and won
That would not be possible without
The M-16 fully locked, and bullets stocked
A bloody battle scene

Who oh oh

Lead

Let this be a lesson learned
That freedom isn't free
The fathers of this land of ours
Gave life for liberty
So give old Uncle Ted a shout
And join the NRA
Adrenalize your hunting size
From small to the extreme

From my cold dead hands
You may not succeed
From my cold dead hands
Is the only way you'll take it from me
