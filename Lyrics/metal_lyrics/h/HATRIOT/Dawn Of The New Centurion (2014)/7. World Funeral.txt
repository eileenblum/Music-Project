Wear your black suit
Your black armband
Follow the black hearse
It's the world's end

World funeral
Time to die now
World funeral
Fear so hollow
World funeral
No more signs
World funeral
Last in line

Sorrow size good byes
No one is saved
Follow your black heart
To the world's end

World funeral
Time to die now
World funeral
Fear so hollow
World funeral
No more signs
World funeral
Last in line

Hurricanes tornadoes earthquake and fire
We've finally fucked Mother Nature
Way too fucking hard
It's shouting back in violent ways
to let it all be known
We've abused the resource for too long
The Earth we have all scorned

It's my world funeral
It's my world funeral
It's our world funeral
It's their world funeral

It's my world funeral
It's my world funeral
It's our world funeral
It's their world funeral

World funeral
Time to die now
World funeral
Fear so hollow
World funeral
No more signs
World funeral
