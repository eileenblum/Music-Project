I have never been afraid of taking someone out
Bashing in somebody's brain till the blood runs out
Because I am not built to crash
It's full speed ahead
Follow you to Hell and back and make sure
That you're dead

I will now use a vicious means of torture
Something that you never will accept
Crossing me a fate you'll now see
Is so painful you will scream and die
Getting mad and even will complete
The rush of violent actions running through your brain
Don't forget the beatings they will now commence
You're the only one, so take the pain

Step up you will see
A monster I will be
A psycho on full blast, when I kick your ass
You will wish the pain would stop as you begin to bleed
Now you know and know who's now
Your worst enemy

Revenge a word I carry hard
I live life by its law
Double-crossing motherfucker
Torture you'll endure
There is nothing that I like more
Than laughing at your pain
Rape your love and kill your dog
Then I piss onto your grave

I will show my force
Then bloody up your face
Every time you turn around
More tortures taken place
I could kill you quick
But that would be no fun
Psychotherapy is good when
I'm the only one

Step up you will see
A monster I will be
A psycho on full blast, when I kick your ass
You will wish the pain would stop as you begin to bleed
Now you know and know who's now
Your worst enemy

Count the screams as they cry out
It's a job well done
Putting fingers in a vice to me
Seems like some fun
I will never run out of the way
To take a life
As long as I have a reason
And revenge right by my side

Time after time
It's been played in your mind
And the horror is real that you feel
To your bones
And the rush that's so sick
Keeps it's euphoric kick
When the skull is just busting
Apart from the seams

Step up you will see
A monster I will be
A psycho on full blast, when I kick your ass
You will wish the pain would stop as you begin to bleed
Now you know and know who's now
Your worst enemy

So I guess I've never made it clear
Don't fuck me around
Those who've tried have disappeared
Their bodies never found
So take note and stay in line
And watch your P's and Q's
You'll never know who you'll piss off
And that might spell your doom
