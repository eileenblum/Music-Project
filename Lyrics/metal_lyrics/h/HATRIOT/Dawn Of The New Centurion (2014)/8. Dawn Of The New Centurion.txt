Raise your weapons
Hold them high for all to see
Legions stare in attention

For now they know who will defy and who will defend

Blood will flow down from the mountains
In like river and streams
Carcasses lie on the landscape
Bird's of prey will feast
Sounds of marching condemn all
Brave enough to die
Centurions chanting so loudly
All in our path now must die
All in our path now must die

Retreat is not an option

Standing your ground to take on
Whatever is coming

Enter the sound of your life's end
Subtly silence to screams
Instantly up go the white flags
Surrendering imminently
Infidels fall by the way side
Rebels succumb quietly
Centurions are chanting loudly
All in our path must die
All in our path must die
All in our path must die
All in our path must die

Painful elimination overdrive
Taking down the hopeless souls again
Remains pile up behind the path
Of bodies from the blood of muddy graves

Distant screams that haunt the innocent
Of violent acts which must be carried forth
Rebirth of modern day assassination
Nobody that's here is left alive
So respect and honor new centurions

For his I way more lethal than before
He'll wear the code of those
Before him on his scars from all
Th wars he has endured

Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion

Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion
Dawn of the new centurion
