Predator criminal, hide behind the uniform
To taste forbidden fruit
Molester pedophile preying on the children
That you helped to recruit
Celibate a solemn vow
Never to indulge yourself in pleasures of the flesh
Blind faith and simple doubt
Are easily mistaken as excuses handed out
Holy men in Holy Hell can't control the urges
That are stronger than belief
Turn an eye, look away
Fathers gonna give you all
The sermon of your life

Thou shall not kill
Thou shall not steal
Thou shall not feel
Innocence against their will

A fallen priest, the mothership hypocrites
Caught up in a system all their own
Making up the rules as they go along
Let the fallen pray for their soul
This has been a problem now for many
Many
The epidemic worsens, more throughout the silent tears

They are all afraid
We're finding them all out
It has come the day
To answer for this plague
So many put away
For crimes behind the cloth
Not just the USA
This world problem mounts

Who is more to welcome than a man
Who serves his God
Abuse the trust of willing souls
And all the things are wrong
Plagiarize the youth with lies
