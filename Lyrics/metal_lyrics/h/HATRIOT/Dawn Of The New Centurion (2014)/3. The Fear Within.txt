Violent urges plague intention murdering with no redemption 
Kill another life's descension disturbing the fear within 
Heretics from fallen angels kill the weak and steal their halo 
Innocence condemned with no soul pray to end the fear within 

Terror tormenting inside my mind 
Terror tormenting me 
Terror tormenting me all the time 
Tormenting me all the time 
Terror tormenting inside my mind 
Terror tormenting me 
Terror tormenting inside my mind 
Thrill to kill when blood runs cold 

God like power feeds the sickness blacking out all those who witness 
Random victims fill my hit list then you will know the fear within 
Exhilaration, satisfaction consequences for such action 
Gruesome killing is the caption documenting fear within 

I let my fears go away from my mind 
Let my fears go away from my mind 
I let my fears go right out of my head 
Out of my mind out of my mind 
I let my fears go right out of my head 
Out of my mind let my fears go 
Bodies bleeding from incisions black and white controls my vision 
What I am is my decision insuring the fear within 
Insuring the fear within insuring the fear within insuring the fear within
