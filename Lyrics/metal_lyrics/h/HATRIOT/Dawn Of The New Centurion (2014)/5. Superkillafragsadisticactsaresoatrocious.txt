Graphic horrors and the global genocide
And many tales of a holocaust
Modern existence in our society
Armies try to take over the world
The rise to power is the fall that
Always comes more violently than
The one before
There will be no rest till we taste the blood
This is what we tell them when we meet

So many countries full of this corruption
Only wish for freedom and democracy
See Ghadaffi's body on the hood of a car
While people are rejoicing in the streets
What was he thinking?
That he was a god and can do whatever all because he can?
Eventually the world will end all tyranny
And this is what we shout at all of them

If you hear this phrase they're chanting
Through the streets
Some leader getting lynched for their atrocities
We're speaking out for truth
And all the things that live
But in the meantime it's democracy that dies
So join the cause with us and make the voices heard
So many sacrifices all seem so absurd
A revolution for the rest of us alive
Superkillafragsadisticactsaresoatrocious
Now's your time to die

Free pussy riot!
Free pussy riot!
Free pussy riot!
Free pussy riot!
Free pussy riot!
Free pussy riot!......
