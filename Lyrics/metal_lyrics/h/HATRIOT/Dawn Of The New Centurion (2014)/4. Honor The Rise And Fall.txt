When the world was blood and sand
And combat fought was to the end
Making sport of slaves who fight for honor
Pride, the afterlife
Trained to die all day and night
And pray the gods are on their side
The stench of death is in the air
So now kill with no care

Impaled them - Disillusioned renegades
Impaled them - Run it fast and hard
Impaled them - Stabbing bodies with a blade
Impaled them - Changing of the guard
Impaled them - Revolution overrun
Impaled them - Impale through the heart
Impaled them - We have yet begun to die
Impaled them - The violence can begin

Outplayed in an atmosphere of sickness
Perverse, decadence carnival of execution
Where death is a guarantee
One by one the conflict rages on
Till someone dies!
Cheer the one who's still alive
He's live to fight another day

Impaled them - Disillusioned renegades
Impaled them - Run it fast and hard
Impaled them - Stabbing bodies with a blade
Impaled them - Changing of the guard
Impaled them - Revolution overrun
Impaled them - Impale through the heart
Impaled them - We have yet begun to die
Impaled them - The violence can begin

Live and die, kill to survive
Honor honor and the rise and fall
