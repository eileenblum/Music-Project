The battle field a soldier's church
Bred to fight as you disperse
Show no mercy to your foes
Death to all who oppose
Blood-soaked hands now feel so cold
Look inside, you have no soul

War, Pain, Loss, Death

As secret documents reveal,
Made of man, made of steel
Genetics have been engineered
Now no man that you will fear
Marked by a number code
You bring hell and conquer all

All weaponry at your dispose
Feel the power that you own
Arsenal of pain you bring
Crying children, you say they sing
Join the race of the damned
You cannot change the chains that bound
