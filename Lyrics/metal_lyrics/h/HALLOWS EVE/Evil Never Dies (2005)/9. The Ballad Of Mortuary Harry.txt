Well, they call me Mortuary Marry, And my friend is
Hari-Kari Mary, And when the night fog rolls in
We've got an axe to bury
Well, they call me Mortuary Harry, Donât want no folks
six feet underground, 'cause when Mary brings the
little girls in, I wanna gobble them down...
You know when Mary kills 'em, 1 chill 'em, and save 'em
for a rainy night, And when Mary stabs 'em, I slab 'em
On a table for my tummy's delight...
Well, they call me Mortuary Harry, And I not sure if I'm
alive, But if you wanna visit with me,
I'll be glad to sit and jive
