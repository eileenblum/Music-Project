Gotta make a life, not a living
Gotta meet the end, no misgiving
Gotta hit the road
Gotta call, to live live live
Roadkill

Gotta lot to die for, more to live
Gotta lot to fight for, more to give
Gotta hit the road
Gotta call to live live

Evil may come from Eves gone past
Waitin' ta see if I can last
Evil may come, Evil may rage
Of those dues, I have paid

Scratch your soul with a monkey's paw
Nothing endures but change
I have lived to do my best
Living my fullest range

Scratch your soul, with a monkeyâs paw
Scratch it well, scratch it hard
I like living hard
Of all I overcome

Kill at will
