Do not put me in a grave
I'm not born to be a slave
I am the lightning flash
I am the thunder crash
Do not say what song I play
Do not listen anyway
I am the fierce in flight
I am the fight of fights
Do not put me in a grave
I'm not born to be a slave
I am E1 Tempesto
I am the storms that blow
Do not say what song I play
Do not listen anyway
I am space in in your eye
Fire and stars, night, I

Can't put me in a grave
Can't make me a slave
Mai nunca muere

I stood transfixed
As she decended the crest
Her figure a regal, menacing silhouette
The eyes burned hot into my very soul
As I felt her presence

Outstretched hands invited me toward the visage
Who I knew to be more than human
You are my disciple, my servant, my very life force

Through abnormally large canines
Which flanked either side of her ghastly mouth
"Come unto me and I will give to you a new existence"
Illuminated by the crescent light, hypnotic stare
Set me into syncopated motion, with an obscene relish,
her tongue lashed, intoxicating my blood...

Her hands took hold and I was repulsed
By the sweet, sour stench of death
Which clung about her
While a clammy sweat engulfed me

An alien heat caressed me, the demon in my throat
Light kissed the horizon, A blessing and a curse
A shriek of pain bellowed from the pit
Of the beasts black soul, She stumbled...

Her hands released my choking throat
Her fingers softly ran over my parched lips
I cried for her to melt into the fleeting shadows
Of nocturnal fantasies, She laughed and said to me...
"Really, The doctor will be with you..."
