Death and insanity a flicker in the flame
Death and insanity are you truly sane?
Do you ever wonder when you're lying in your bed
Deep dark thoughts of trances coming flying through your head
You know you're truly stable but could your thoughts be the truth
A horde of groping parasites to haunt you in your youth

Sitting in the shadow of your stone cold padded cell
You dream the macabre dreams that you have come to know so well
Brain is pumping harder and about to hear the shriek
Of warriors wielding demon swords and death is what they seek

Could this really be the truth or is it really real?
Is it the depths of hell I see or insanity I feel
The triumphs of my dying mind shall overcome at last
Wicked evil leering eyes shall see me to my death
