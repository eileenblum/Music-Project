Out of love out of mind out of food out of time
Those who live do not care a taste of war a taste of death
Die!
Live for the cross it has been said but in the end aren't we all dead
Death has come from 'cross the sea now realize reality

Time out of mind, carnage butchery leaving life behind lethal tendencies
Die!
Those who rest, the kiss of death is upon most every face
Feel the fire from the sky to diminish the human race
Die!
There lies no one here but me bloody bodies in the debris
Before I breathe my final breath peer into the face of death

Genocide they take you down to the burning pit of hell
You realize you're wondering what's the burning that you smell
Could it be the dying world or could it be the pit?
For if this is my hell for me then maybe I need it
