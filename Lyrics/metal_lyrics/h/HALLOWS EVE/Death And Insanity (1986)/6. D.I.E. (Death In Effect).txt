We are all dying there's no sense in trying no way you can stop it no way
Death comes to you when you're an early son
Then he walks beside you all the way
Any moment he might strike reflecting your past life
And sentencing you to the grave
Don't live life worrying 'bout things you can't stop
If you give in then you'll be his slave

D.I.E. death in effect
He's our final conflict he's our final judge
He is death and he follows me
He is the force which exists on this earth
To betray and intimidate me
Only one way to win only one way to live
If you give in then you're going to pay
I'll be the conqueror I'll thrash till death
Exist for myself all the way

When I feel I am slipping they stand in my way
The people that might drag me 'round
I'll never worry I'm the killing force and I'm bringing the hammer down
You do not own me there are no rules society I will begrudge
Believe on thyself and thou shalt be saved
For thou art thine own final judge
