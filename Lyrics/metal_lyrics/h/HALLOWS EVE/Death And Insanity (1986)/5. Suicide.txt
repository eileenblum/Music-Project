I took the pills that made me fast to speed my brain future is past
Rapid pulsations upon my heart pulsing my blood from part to part

Suicide I'm still living suicide I'm still giving
To suicide I bring the gas to suicide I give my ass
Open the can I huff the fume ah, to me it is perfume

To suicide I swear an oath the human race I do loathe
Now I drive reckless speed with suicide I take the lead

I wish I had never been born my own past hear me mourn
Arm in arm I walk with death crazed words on my last breath
