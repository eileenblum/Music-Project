Splitting the night, tenor &amp; strife,
Coming apart at the seams.

We are members of the thundering horde,
Rising up out of the East.

Lighting the fires of burning desires
Keepers of the sacred blade.

Battles not lost at any cost,
We are the final remains.

[Chorus]
Terror!
Dementia!
Grandeur!

Pleasure!
Fetish!
Flesh!

Terror!
Dementia!
Grandeur!

We are the frightening Remains!

Out of the blackness of night sky we ride,
Feeling at one with the blade.

We're the dark stranger, the resurrected.
A picture of what we are made.

Shadows of destiny loom in the night.
A scream blasting out through the trees.

Battles not lost at any cost,
We are the final remains.

[Chorus]

Resurrected...
Resurrected...
Resurrected...from a distant memory.

Resurrected...
Resurrected...
Resurrected from a distant memory.

RESURRECTED!
RESURRECTED!
