In your pursuit of happiness, you've broken all the rules.
Opened the gates of loneliness, and left me for a fool.
As you keep reaching out for me, now look what I've become.
I'm one demented guardian, and Iâve only just begun.

Artificial happiness, for now I'm killing you.
Feel the pain of emptiness, there's nothing you can do.
See the seasons pass you by as your life slips away
Broken dreams, you wonder why?
Now live another day.

On your knees your severed dreams, for now is yours to hold.
Everything comes crystal clear; your life is growing cold.
I will lay a path for you, the way your vision lies.
I will bring euphoria, but never satisfy.
