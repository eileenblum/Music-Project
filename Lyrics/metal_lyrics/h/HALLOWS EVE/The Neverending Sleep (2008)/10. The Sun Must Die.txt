All will be revealed to you or all will be erased.
By dawning of the new day.

The grapes of wrath are grown, devoured without a taste.
Now lying in mortal decay.

Never letting go of what has been seen through our eyes.
An endless shadow etched in time.

On an endless journey now to cross the bridge of sighs.
Now mounting up for one more ride.

[Chorus]
The sun must die.
Black the sky!
The sun must die.
Crack the sky!

Tracing all our conquests back to images in time.
We'll feed upon the dark of night.

Under stars on steeds we ride with flash of blade and might.
On a quest for killing all that's light.

[Chorus]
[Lead]
[Bridge]
[1st verse]

[Chorus x2]
