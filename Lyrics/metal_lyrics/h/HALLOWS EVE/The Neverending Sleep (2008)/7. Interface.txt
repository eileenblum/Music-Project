Systematic, Reproduction
Regulated birthright
Man make machine
Automated impregnation
Evolution through duplication
Imitation, Procreation

Am I you, or am I me? No more personality.
Are you you, or are you me? No more personality.

The seed has been sucked from me, extracted by machinery.

Electro genesis
Mass conception
Manufactured population
Registration, then gestation
Cyber clone breeding into one collection
Imitation, Procreation

[Chorus]
Interface or Die

Low and Behold
We'll live to see, human destruction through technology
Bio-machine, production birth
Semi-conductors, destroy what's left of earth
Man and Machine, has it begun?
Dehumanized till all are one
Bio-machine, production birth
Technology, destroys what's left of earth

[Chorus]
