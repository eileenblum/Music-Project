When they said there's a storm inside my head,
Threw me out and theyâd left me for dead.
One more ride through my cursed forest,
One more stand for me in darkness.
Never knowing what may lie ahead,
A product of a world where I'm force fed.
One more ride through my cursed forest,
One more stand for me in darkness.

[Chorus]
Army of One!
Stick to your guns!

When they said there's a rage inside of me,
Only honesty will set it free.
Winds of change are blowing through the trees,
I'm the man you thought I'd never be.
I am legend, you can't throw me out.
No room here for the bringer of doubt.
One more ride through my cursed forest,
One more stand for me in darkness.

[Chorus]

[Lead]

[Chorus]

When they said there's a storm inside our head,
Threw us out and they'd left us for dead.
One more ride through our cursed forest,
One more stand for thee in darkness.
Never knowing what may lie ahead.
A product of a world where we're force fed.
On more ride through our cursed forest,
One more stand for thee in darkness.

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
