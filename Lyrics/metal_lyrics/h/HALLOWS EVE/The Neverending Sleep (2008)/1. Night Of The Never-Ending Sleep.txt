Nightmares running through my head are all that I can see.
They wonât stop, they won't leave me be.
One step from genocide, one inch from suicide.
In the night of the neverending sleep.

Close my eyes and listen to the clock tick, silence is all I hear.
Close my eyes and listen to the voices whispering in my ear.

Nightmares running through my head, now living to haunt me.
They won't stop, they won't set me free.
Terror consuming me, my conscience lies to me.
In the night of the neverending sleep.

Close my eyes and listen to the bomb tick, bedlam is all I hear.
Close my eyes and look into the faces of the souls who've brought me here.

[Chorus]
Terror through the eyes of madness,
The afflicted rising up through the ash.
Look into the eyes of sadness,
Retribution is all that I need.

[Bridge]
The eyes of horror are upon you.
The eyes of horror will consume you.
The eyes of horror will control you.
The eyes of horror will betray you.
