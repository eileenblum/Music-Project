I don't know what's on your mind, so I'll tell you, what's on mine.

I don't know what's on your mind, so I'll tell you, what's on mine.
What you do is in my head, spilling blood so you can color red.

Nightmares when I dream.
Can't erase what I've seen.
Don't want to close my eyes, forgetting what I've been shown.
Lying on my bed of nails.

Don't want to know what I know.
Leave it behind when I go.
Don't want to close my eyes, forgetting what I've been shown.
Lying on my bed of nails.

Don't want to know what I know,
Leave it behind when I go.
Don't want to know what I know.
You donât want to know, you don't want to know.

Lying on my bed of;
Keep it on my bed of;
Leave it on my bed of nails.
