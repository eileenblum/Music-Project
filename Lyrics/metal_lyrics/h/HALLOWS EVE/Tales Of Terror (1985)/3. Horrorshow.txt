There exists two worlds for you one is false and one is true
I have lost my shirt my friends paranoid vision,
my brain is mildew I lost reality long ago now I live in a Horrorshow!
reality is a tightrope trick once fell,
real beasts devour quick my fictional beasts are real to me my very thoughts
a caustic I lost reality long ago now I live in a Horrorshow!
Truth, fiction, one and the same one is real,
the other to blame I don't care what your bishops say truth
shall eat the skull of the lame I lost reality long agonow
I live in a Horrorshow!
