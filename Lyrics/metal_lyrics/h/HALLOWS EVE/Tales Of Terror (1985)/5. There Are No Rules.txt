Shake your fist at the sky did your god up and die did your hero 
ever lie does your brain ever fry there are no rules let the thunder cry 
mean let the gods make a scene how can you fight it out throw your head 
back and shout there are no rules what gives you the right to stand up and 
fight there is only one rule though it may sound cruel there are no rules 
the wages of sin have the highest wage take a trip through hell cause the 
demons to rage there are no rules every generation bears a soldier of the 
truth who marches through the realm setting fire to every roof yelling 
there are no rules and as the flames leap high into the stormy night he 
leaps onto a log and laughs at the masses burning bright yelling there are 
no rules feel the flame in my voice
do you have any choice but to 
reach out for the sky grab the sun you may no die there are no rules let 
the armies of the land march on till their damned my fetus will not spill 
on the ground that they till there are no rules shake your god by the robe 
tell him what you intend that's what it's gonna be he'll know in the end 
that there are no rules there are no rules there are no rules there are no 
ruaaaaa!!
