I walked into the room
There came a voice saying aloud
"Thou hast no business here!"
"Your best bets to get out!"
The spirits in my head said
"You don't have to run!"
"You don't have to run!"
I was not afraid of the dead I'd dealt with them before
That's how I got my new life 
1000 years ago or more
I knew i must return to this house too much for me 
to bear the world outside,
I just can't stand I just can't live out there! 
The spirits in my head said "You don't have to run!"
"You don't have to run!"
She's waiting for you in the upstairs room she's waiting
for you in her bed she's waiting for you
as you're climbing the stairs she's waiting 
for you and she's dead!
Close the door feel the presence of Black Magic! 
Thinking that you'll never die is so tragic
you hold her close,
you look into her dark eyes
Could this be, the devil in disguise?
