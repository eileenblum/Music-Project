MerchantsConquering and pillaging our metal it will stand the mighty 
metallion will be heard across the land in the end aren't we all animals 
and leather is the word so welcome to the human zoo where metal can be 
heard
[Chorus]
Metal Merchants Metal Merchants Conquering and pillaging 
unleashed and let go death to modern music and to all who oppose we'll 
blacken eyes of their severed heads
dismember them at night we'll 
shove our metal down their throats and show them who is right
[Chorus]
Bang your head against the stage
Throw, throw your fist up in the air 
don't worry their downgrading of our leather and long hair thrusting with 
a vengeance now we know just what they are we're all metal merchants and 
there ain't no fucking stars.
[Chorus]
