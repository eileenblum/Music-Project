They're coming,
they're soaring they're flying right out of the sky you're hearing
the screams of your comrades and wondering why stare at the skies
as they're starting to land	you sob and you cry with your head
in your hands they come without warning no mercy they show soon
you'll be seeing the end of the world alien forces from out of the sky
conquering all who appear to their eyes they come without warning
no mercy they show soon you'll be seeing the end of the world
You can't imagine what terror they bring a world gone mad where bedlam is king
[Chorus]
Under, your under invasion terror unknown to man under,
your under invasion reeks terror across the land run for shelter
they're moving in soon the world will be seeing the end
You can't imagine what terror they bring a world gone mad
where bedlam is king they're coming,
they're soaring they're flying right out of the sky you're hearing the screams
of your comrades and wondering why stare at the skies as they're starting
to land you sob and you cry with your head in your hands
You can't imagine what terror they bring a world gone mad where bedlam is king
[Chorus]
under, your under invasion blinding beams of light under,
your under invasion they shall overcome tonight
