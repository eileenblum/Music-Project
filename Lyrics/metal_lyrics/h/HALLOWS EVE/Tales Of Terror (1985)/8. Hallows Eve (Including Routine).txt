Hear the voices, see the faces feel the chill of the fog rolling 
let me bring you, tales of terror let me bring you, the macabre tale of 
Hallows Eve, let me bring you terror fear grips your heart as you've ne'r 
known Hallows Eve, let me bring you horror shock grips your soul, as 
you've ne'r known lay your ear to the floor hear us down below calling to 
be released from your private twilight zone Hallows Eve, the rising of the 
dead Hallows Eve, and bedlam will rule Hallows Eve, turn look past the 
shadows our dark carnival is about to begin!
Arriving home as you've done 
everyday before 
up you walk, up to you everyday door pulling out the key you've known so 
long you open the door and everything is wrong before your eyes a paradise 
unfolds money trees,
whiskey and wenches to hold turn around to see the 
door is gone forget 'bout the home you've known so long you turn to face 
the enigmatic scene it is all so beautiful yet this is no dream it is all 
you ever wanted, don't be naive see the gates around,
you can't leave such 
frustration to be trapped in a cage
...skin of fair wrenching only serves 
to enrage they offer you the fruits of all you see you can't have the 
goods 'cause you're not free suddenly the trees are burnt and dead the 
babbling brook turns to bloody red the demonic faces of the women turn 
only to reveal that now you'll burn demons of all kind appear their faces 
all distort and leer one is wielding quite an axe you are thrown upon your 
back the axe is raised above your head....
"STOP!! it is not yet his time, but we will have him soon enough..."
The harpies with their webbed wings 
laugh away the Filthy One says that you can't stay the Master syas your 
time has not begun we will send you back, but we will have our fun it 
won't take long and you'll be back for good we'll let you meet the axe-man 
with the hood he will rind your bones and we'll have our meat you'll feel 
and be alive, but grovel at our feet
arriving home as you've done 
everyday before up you walk,
up to your everyday door though you don't 
know why, you feel quite strange you leave your home behind, guess,
you need a change?
hear those voices,
see those faces feel the chill of the 
fog rolling let me bring you tales of terror let me bring you the macabre 
tale of Hallows Eve, let me bring you terror fear grips your heart as 
you've never known Hallows Eve,
let me bring you horror shock grips your soul,
as you've never known lay your ear to the floor hear us down below 
hear the wicked saint laugh from his vile embryo a toast my friends to you,
rehearse you loudest scream, I am out to get you,
I am I am hellish grace,
thief of light lurking always in the night I could have you one by 
one creeping round till I'm done demons taking to the sky round and round 
and round they fly the well are sick,
the sick are well living in eternal 
hell celebrate the quaking quill of Edgar Allan Poe,
you will scream, 
scream for your Christ everlasting antichrist bouts with death do not 
serve to change a man's belief,
just nerve only to reveal more clear just 
who does he serve on Hallows Eve?
