Warriors on horseback from out of the sky coming to take you away
Your life as it stands now in their hands it lies you won't live another
full day man now he wonders just when he will die searching
and seeking the truth for now he wants but one thing on this earth
the perilous fortunes of youth
[Chorus]
Plunging to Megadeath seeking the truth plunging to Megadeath
searching the youth plunge to Megadeath you live for tomorrow we live
for today our strength's held here within our youth man soars through space
but he still wonders who lies and just who speaks the truth worrying
won't bring you one bit of good if you die you'll die not at will
you'll soon be feeling	the cold hand of doom is your blood beginning to chill?
[Chorus]
Nighttime falls in the city your lying alone in your bed the picture
in your dreams isn't pretty the tombstone lies there at your head
warriors on horseback from out of the sky coming to take you away
your life as it stands now in their hands in lies you won't live another
full day man now, he worries just when he will die searching and seeking
the truth for now, he wants but one thing on this earth the perils
and fortunes of youth [Chorus]
