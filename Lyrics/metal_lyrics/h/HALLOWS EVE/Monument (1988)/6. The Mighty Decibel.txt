The Mighty Decibel
Here we are all knobs to the right
Ears embrace my din this night
Bathe in the volume, I am pain
My rod of sound piercing your brain

[Chorus]
Oh, no, another fell to
Decibel!
I am the mighty
Decibel!
Lift your arms now in my praise
make me a circle now don't delay
Shank to the left, slam to the right
Ears are bleeding, what a sight

[Chorus]

Come to ,y alter, don't be slow
Loudernloudernlouder I grow
I am the mighty Decibel
Shank till deaf! Ha!

[Chorus]
