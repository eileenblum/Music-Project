Get me to that show on time
Think I'm about to lose my mind
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!
Drivin' like a maniac
Capable of heart attack
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!
Unyielding is what I am
I don't really give a damn
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!
I've a lethal tendency
Like no other you have seen
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!

[Chorus]
Driving hard
Power mad!
Wheels don't stop
'Til you're had!
I'll set your soul on fire...
Set your soul on fire

Crashing through the barriers
Like loaded missile carriers
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!
Driving hard, too fast to live
Too young to fry, my live to live
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!
On the road I'm feelin' bad
One too many I have had
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!
Living hard, just doin' fine
Just spend my last fucking dime
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!

[Chorus]

Get me to that show on time
Think I'm about to lose my mind
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!
Drivin' like a maniac
Capable of heart attack
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!
Eyes are bulgin' at the seams
Endless highway through my dreams

Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!
Scared and torn from eve's gone past
Reach my destiny at last
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!

[Chorus]

I'll set your soul on fire...
Set your soul on fire
I'll set your soul on fire...
Set your soul on fire
Speed Freak!
