Dark nights
Under a killing moon
Step in the
Vicious circle and beware
Sweat to
Ventilate this rage
Slamming hard
Now we don't fucking care!
Draw blood
For we show no remorse
Now with
Killer force we are as one
Weak race
Dare not to stand to close
For if you do
Soon the deed is done

[Chorus]
Tonight you will surrender
I am th pain killer!
No time to repent
I am the pain killer!
Crushing through
Sacrifice
All those who will oppose
I shows in
Everything we do
Deceivers
Lives now coming to a close
And if
The circle gets too rough
You can
Bow out and cover like the weak
Just like
Our everyday life
Deceivers never
Practice what they preach

[Chorus]
