No Sanctuary
For those without forgiveness in their hearts
Life's more punishing than death
For those without mercy in their souls
The world is thine unrelenting enemy

[Chorus]
For those who know anger
For those who know heat
For those who crave blood
For those who find revenge sweet
No sanctuary
For those incapable of passion
The world is a cold and empty place
For those who know no compassion
Life remains a bitter sentence

[Chorus]

For those without introspection
For those without introversion
Is comfort found by ignorance!
Where is thine Avalon?

[Chorus]
