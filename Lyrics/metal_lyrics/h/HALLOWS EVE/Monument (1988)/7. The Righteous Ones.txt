The Righteous Ones
Lead us on
With make believe
Your so-called righteousness
Forget your Constitutional rights
We are the new law
Soon you will
Be cleansed like us
Without any flaws!

[Chorus]
Pulling back the reins
Locking down the chains
Righteousness they say
Will take its toll today!
Ruling all you do
Ruling through and through
Righteousness they say
Will take its toll today!
Fleeing from you
Sinful ways
Soon you will give in
The claim to be
The driving force
To deliver you from sin
Attention hungry seekers
A movement filled with fools
Living just to rectify

[Chorus]

Keep the rules
Coming now
Soon freedom will be done
Satisfy
Their twisted minds and,
Soon there will be none
If forefathers
Could see us now
They'd gasp in disbelief
Rape the constitution now
And what have you achieved

[Chorus]
