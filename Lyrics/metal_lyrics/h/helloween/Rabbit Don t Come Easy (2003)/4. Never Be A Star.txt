No matter how big we are
We dream of home
The place where we all belong
Therefore this song

We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star

No time to see all our friends
There where we are
Ten thousand miles are quite long
And much too far

We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star (a star) - no

We are who we are
We are who we are
We are who we are
We are who we are

We are who we are
Never be a star
We are who we are
Never be a star

We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star, never be (a star)

We are who we are
We'll never be a star (never be a star)
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star (never be a star)

We are who we are
We'll never be a star (never be a star)
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star, never be

We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star

We are who we are
We'll never be a star
We are where we are
But we'll never be a star (never be a star)
