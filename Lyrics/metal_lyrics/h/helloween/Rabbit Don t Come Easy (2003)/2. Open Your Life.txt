Do you know what there is just behind your wall
Do you hate what you can't see on the spinning ball

Ignorant and wasted that's what you are
But you could be so much more
Listen to your TV, believe the words
And you're dumber than before

Try to see the real picture
To train your mind to read between the lines
Take your level higher that is your way
Just get up, start out today

Time seems an endless road when we are young
It don't need a genius to know that it's wrong

Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive
Hey now, hey now, open your life

Full synthetic anger that's what you breathe
It's a strategy for all
Telling people stories and bed time tales
But the real important false

So you grow the wrong seed inside your head
To the will of the modern priest
Supervised aggression instructed to sleep
That's the devil let you breed

All that we learn is just one point of view
Out there in the world it may not become true

Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive
Hey now, hey now, open your life

Time seems an endless road when we are young
It don't need a genius to know that it's wrong

Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive
Hey now, hey now, open your life

Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive
Hey now, hey now, open your life

Hey now, hey now, open your life
Hey now, hey now, open your life
