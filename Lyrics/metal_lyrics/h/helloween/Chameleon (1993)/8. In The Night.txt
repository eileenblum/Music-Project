[Words and Music by Michael Kiske]

In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night i call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
The songs I sing, all my love - I bring for you.
I always try to makethings better, everything that has gone wrong,
Mighty plans in the right direction but very little has been done.
Everyday when I try to get forward - I find myself another mile back,
Help me fighting, help me breathing - why am I falling down instead ?
Every useful minute seems to be the thoughtof you,
Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do.
Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but it's true.
In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night i call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
The songs I sing, all my love - I bring for you.
[Acoustic Solo: Roland Grapow]
Free from ourselves and free form this world we may find,
The freedom we search ,'cause all that we need is inside.
The hours we waste - we may not get back for a while,
And when it gets dark - no chance will be there for atry.
When I wake up early in the morning I catch abook and jump inside,
I fill my head with a million wonders and try to fill the night with light.
The moment when I get things clearer - I see another mountain to climb.
And always when I think I'm nearer - I realize there is no time.
In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night i call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
Sometimes I cried after all Ilied to you.
[Rhythm Guitar - Michael Kiske]
