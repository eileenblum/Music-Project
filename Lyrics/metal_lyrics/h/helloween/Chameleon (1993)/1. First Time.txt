[Words and Music by Michael Weikath]

Will you first time... Will it be... I think of someone like me ?
Makes me wonder,I can show you'd neverthought you'd see.
You're like sunshine,I can feel your heat is drying out my brain,
Would you feel like... like we're having fun it Ican do the rain ?
Have you thought out your dreams, do you have some ?
Let's see if we can find some more.
Give me your fancies at random,I think we can deal with them all.
I can't wait forever, baby, open me your door,
I just want your loving if you cannot give me more.
I can see you standing there, you know you're worth the try,
Let me guide you in my spaceship and I'll surely make you have
A  R e a l  G o o d  T i m e .
Don't waste time now - you are soaking wet, so fix the things you got,
Guess you know how - and when you're done I dotta see you strut.
My desire - can I watch you rock and know which one of choose ?
I'm no liar - I could take you down and you got nothing to lose.
I don't know any better occasion, can't hold back, it's the end of the day
I don't think you're here for the first time, no problem with me anyway.
I can't wait forever, baby, open me you door,
I just want your loving if you cannot give me more.
I can see you standing there, you know we have a try,
I can feel this night is special and I surely make you have
A  R e a l  G o o d  T i m e.
