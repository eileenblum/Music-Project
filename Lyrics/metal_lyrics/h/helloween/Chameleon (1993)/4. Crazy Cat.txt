[Words and Music by  Roland Grapow]

My little crazy cat took a train to meet his gang downtown.
They played Black Jack&lt; Fritz played his false game too far.
A guy got up and started a gunfight.
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day,
Don't waste time, cute - runaway, you cute - runaway,
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town.
Addicted to chicks, he's got a rental tree near the nudist beach.
Oh, watch out ! Booze and ladies are his fate.
Too much sex and food and Rock'n'Roll.
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day,
Don't waste time, cute - runaway, you cute - runaway,
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town.
[Solo: Roland Grapow]
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day,
Don't waste time, cute - runaway, you cute - runaway,
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town.
