[Words and music by Michael Weikath]

[INTRO: Roland Grapow]

Well,I think it's really time again for a revolution,
Not to destroy at all costs but have a look at what's there.
Can you remember a time when water was still water,
Or are you too young to even know what we won't give to our heirs ?
Inhale the bless of science through your lungs, skin and brain !
It'll surely make our children feel a lot more sanel.
Revolution now ! ... Revolution now ! ...
I was born when April guaranteed a sexual renaissance,
And today we're all faced with death, rubbers and AIDS.
In'68 some people went out to fight for freedom,
They would never ever have thought that their children wear ties.
And if you come to San Francisco -
You're gonna meet some broken people there.
Revolution now ! Revolution now ! Revolution now ! Now !
[Solo: Roland Grapow and Michael Weikath]
Revolution now ! ... Revolution now ! ...
Revolution now ! ... Revolution now ! ...
