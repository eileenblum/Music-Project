[Words and Music by Michael Weikath]

[INTRO: Michael Weikath]

Strong and invincible, they know every rule,
Seems inconceivable anything they do.
They made us their slaves - we weren't unified,
Ever since we paid for selling our lives.
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland,
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again.
Deprived of our consciousness, we can't predict what's more,
Can you remember how things used to be before ?
I secretly dream of things we will be taught,
Will someone esteem for those who have fought ?
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland,
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again.
[Solo: Roland Grapow and Michael Weikath]
Strong and invincible, they know every rule,
Seems inconceivable anything they do.
Deep in our hearts we hope our dreams come true,
The only thing is "What are we to do ?"
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland,
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again.
Won't you say it ... Can't you feel it .. ?
