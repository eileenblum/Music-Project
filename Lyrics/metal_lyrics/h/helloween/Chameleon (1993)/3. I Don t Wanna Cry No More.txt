[Words and Music by Roland Grapow]

Hey, brother, I miss you so - you knoked on heaven's door,
And we won't see you anymore - it must be crazy what we're living for.
'Cause God's stopped keeping you on the ladder of you life,
I call your name with tears in my eyes.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
Life's like a walking on a high wire,
You slipped away, I've seen you dying in vein.
High as mountains seem all the problems that I have,
But when I hear your voice far away out of the dark -
You just go on and on in the back of my mind.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
Skin and bone won't touch the sky,
I hope you'll find passage out of the dark.
To the otherside of the sea and I know that I'll see you again.
[Acoustic and Electric Guitar Solo: Roland Grapow]
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
I don't wanna cry no more -past gave me happiness and gain
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance,
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul.
I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you.
