[Words and Music by Roland Grapow]

Time has come, start your search for tomorrow,
No escape from that long trail of sorrow.
You don't know how it keeps going on. Oh ... No ...
Wake up out of misty dreams,
Evil drugs is starting to grab you, to grab you.
Step out of hell - demons dancing around your brain.
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins.
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead.
Step out of hell - take my hand I wanna help ... But can I ?
You did your best to keep yourself down,
Give it a rest and just turn around !
It's only a one way street of lies ... Yes it is !
Living in a twilight zone,
Get away out of that drug jungle, that drug jungle.
Step out of hell - demons dancing around your brain.
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins.
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead.
Step out of hell - take my hand I wanna help you.
Another line, have a good time, you don't mind
To turn you brain inside out, to serve the final rite.
Step out of hell - demons dancing around your brain.
Step out of hell - streams of madness flow through your veins.
Step out of hell - go on like this you're gonna be dead.
Step out of hell - take my hand I wanna help you !
