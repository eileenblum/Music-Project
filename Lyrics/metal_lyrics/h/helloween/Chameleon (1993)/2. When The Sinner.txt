[Words and Music by Michael Kiske]

Now it's time - to shake it all up, to be free,
Now it's time - to make us some room to let us be.
Oh, it feels so bad, yes, if fells so bad,
When everything good looks so bad,
When everything right goes so wrong.
I am up - to break it all down what's in my way,
I won't stop until I am where I'm going to stay.
No one holds me back, no, no one holds me back,
Don't wanna be what I am not,
But it's gotta be myself who breaks my neck.
I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere,
= Over my head - look over my head =
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around
= And you won't see no halo =
We keep on looking 'til we know what for.
If you don't know it,I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?
= It's driving me mad =
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know,
= I must hold it back inside =
But anyway we've got to make a stop.
When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you !
In my mind - the battle goes on 'til I give up,
Will we find - the key of life we oncehave dropped ?
Do you realy care ? - Tell me you realy care !
You may find Mr. Blane, but the guilt of life burns everywhere.
Give me light to see my inside, give me light tosee my sin,
= Over my head - look over my head =
I'd never do what I regret, I've never done anything bad,
= And you won't see no halo =
You must be joking when you point at me.
Hey ! Don't you blame me ! Don't you touch me !
Won't you ever leave me be ? I wanna live! Don't wanna think!
= It's driving me mad =
Why should I give what I can drink ?
= I must hold it back inside =
When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you !
Pain - I feel inside - it's such a Shame.
No one fights fair but who's to Blame ?
Might be the game of life but it ain't over.
Now ! I walk my way firm any
Now ! My conscience speaks andthere are Doubts !
But nothing's sure in life and it ain't over. Now !
I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere,
= Over my head - look over my head =
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around
= And you won't see no halo =
We keep on looking 'til we know what for.
If you don't know it,I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?
= It's driving me mad =
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know,
= I must hold it back inside =
But anyway we've got to make a stop.
When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you ! ......
