[Limited Edition Bonus Track][music: Grosskopf, lyrics: Grosskopf]

I am no stranger to darkness
I am no stranger to pain
I had to suffer 'til I went insane
Learning from pain and from heartaches
How to forgive and forget
Never give up 'cause life goes on again

Pushed all around I can't take it no more
Don't tell me how to behave
Won't hide away I can make it for sure
I will survive, I will live my own life

Shot of life
I will take another shot of life
I take my pride - thereâs no price too high for me
Shot of life
I will take another
Shot of life
Shot of life
'Til I find my destiny

If you feel strange and emotional
Carrying the weight of the world
Open your soul and let the spirit in

It's not the end of the rainbow
It's not the end of the line
Your time will come and you will rise again

Pushed all around I can't take it no more
Don't tell me how to behave
Won't hide away I can make it for sure
I will survive, I will live my own life

Shot of life
I will take another shot of life
I take my pride - thereâs no price too high for me
Shot of life
I will take another
Shot of life
Shot of life
'Til I find my destiny

Shot of life [4x]
I'm leaving all my pain away
My sorrows are not here to stay
Tomorrow comes another day
Another hope, another try

Shot of life
I will take another shot of life
I take my pride - thereâs no price too high for me
Shot of life
I will take another
Shot of life
Shot of life
'Til I find my destiny

Shot of life ...
