[music: Gerstner, lyrics: Gerstner]

I, never saw you goin straight
You, lying right into my face
High, my expectations were for faith
You, youâre driving me insane

No one came that far, without abilities
Youâre the greatest of them all
You lie you steal you betray you donât feel

Youâre an asshole
Typical human being
Youâre a sucker
Sucking out energy
Asshole
Typical human being
You motherfucker
Stupid shit you make me flee

I, Iâm sick of your stupid ego
No, you are not the only one
You, your manipulation stops here
No, right now we are not friends

No one came that far, without abilities
Youâre the greatest of them all
You lie you steal you betray
You donât feel

Youâre an asshole
Typical human being
Youâre a sucker
Sucking out energy
Asshole
Typical human being
You motherfucker
Sucking out energy
Asshole
Typical human being
You motherfucker
Stupid shit you make me flee

Youâre an asshole
Typical human being
Youâre a sucker
Sucking out energy
Asshole
Typical human being
You motherfucker
Stupid shit you make me flee

Asshole
Typical human being
You motherfucker
Stupid shit you make me flee
Asshole!
