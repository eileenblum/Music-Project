[music: Deris, lyrics: Deris]

Never again
I told myself
Iâll play with fire
Never again
Iâll come too close
To this desire
My melted wings have just healed
When my facetted eyes are bound in fascination
Never say never say
Never again
Never again

Alright
Itâs my last flight
Must go on and on
Until I die
Tonight
Into the light
Must go on and on
One last sigh
Make fire catch the fly

Never again
But just tonight
I heed the calling
This could be the end
I wonât regret then when Iâm falling
My melted wings have just healed
But my little mind is bound in fascination
Never say never say
Never again
Never again

Alright
Itâs my last flight
Must go on and on
Till I die
Tonight
Into the light
Must go on and on
One last sigh
Make fire catch the fly
