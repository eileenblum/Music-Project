[music: Gerstner, lyrics: Gerstner]

Warfare - the only solution for your stupid problems
Soldiers - marching out for your revolution
Killing and burning, destroying, overturning
You got the license to hate
All the others are cowards
You believe they got no power
stealing what they own

Making all the money with your big guns
Ripping out their heart for a drop of oil

World of war
We know it all is not the grand solution
World of of peace
Would give us all an enlightened constitution

Task Force - dirty soul of an american institution
Cold War - military build-up made money for your crown
Killing and burning, destroying, overturning
You lead people into fate
Grab your M-16
Like a war machine
Just make it all yourself

Mothers crying over losing their sons
Ripping out their heart for worthless gold

World of war
We know it all is not the grand solution
World of of peace
Would give us all an enlightened constitution

Persecution, dissolution, execution NO!

World of war
We know it all is not the grand solution
World of of peace
Would give us all an enlightened constitution
World of war
We know it all is not the grand solution
