[music: Gerstner, lyrics: Gerstner]

I need your guarding hand to guide
Me through this sand of time
Then I know, I'll be alright
Like a child that never cries

I'm aware of all your rules
But you know that I will run
No matter where I'll follow you
Don't make me go

Take me, take me
Hold me in your arms
Save me, save me
All I need is your love

Maybe you will leave the light on
While I walk into your dream
I can't remember where you came from
(See) the breadcrumbs in the snow

I'm aware of all your rules
But you know that I will run
No matter where I'll follow you
Don't make me go

Take me, take me
Hold me in your arms
Save me, save me
All I need is your love

Take me, take me
Hold me in your arms
Save me, save me
All I need is your love

Take me, take me
Hold me in your arms (hold me in your arms)
Save me, save me
All I need is your love (all I need is your love)

Wake me, wake me
Hold me in your arms
Don't break me, don't break me
I just need a place in your heart

Take me, take me (please take me)
Hold me in your arms (hold me in your arms)
Save me, save me
All I need is your love

I need your guarding hand, my bride
'Til the end of my whole life
