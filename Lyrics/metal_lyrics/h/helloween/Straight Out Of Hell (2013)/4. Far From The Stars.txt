[music: Grosskopf, lyrics: Grosskopf]

Every time I try to take control Iâm getting mad
Things are always different than you want them all to be
I have learned a million times you can just make it bad
Ainât no way to change these things to what you wanna see

We take control of our whole wide universe
We are pretending we donât need no helping hand
We try to take control of all our whole wide world
But we will never understand

Far from the stars
There might be a higher being we may not yet see
Far from the stars
A better life could wait for me

Every time I lose control I learn a little more
We are not the ones to regulate or justify
Every time I see the world turns round I understand
We are not the ones to dominate or modify

We take control of our whole wide universe
We are pretending we donât need no helping hand
We try to take control of all our whole wide world
But we will never understand

Far from the stars
There might be a higher being we may not yet see
Far from the stars
A better life could wait for me

Nobody knows where it begins or where it ends
Time only shows weâre holding nothing in our hands
Wasting our time trying to know the universe
The end of the line is that we can not live without a strong belief

Far from the stars
There might be a higher being we may not yet see
Far from the stars
A better life could wait for me
