[music: Gerstner, lyrics: Gerstner]

No one ever knows how evolution goes
The earth is still a plate with emptiness of goals
No matter what you do a priest will suppress your knowledge
The time that passes by makes us recognize
That cross and robe are made not for paradise
Just some odd relics of old worlds dusty mankind

Oh lord is there anyone
Who knows the truth
Of the future and the past
What must we believe
With all our faith
Evolution happens now!
The church breaks down
When science strikes
They played a game
Left crosses in flames

The church breaks down
When science strikes
Deceived us all
Left crosses in flames

Da Vinci was a man back in 1502
A genius on his own who already knew
There must be something more than just the bible
Heretical disease! They called everyone a thief
Who didnât walk the road that put him on his knees
To pray and glorify their holy waters

Oh lord is there anyone
Who knows the truth
Of the future and the past
What must we believe
With all our faith
Evolution happens now!
The church breaks down
When science strikes
They played a game
Left crosses in flames
The church breaks down
When science strikes
Deceived us all
Left crosses in flames
Left crosses in flames

Dies Irae - di meliora (day of wrath - heaven send us better times)
Dies Irae - di meliora (day of wrath - heaven send us better times)

The church breaks down
When science strikes
They played a game
Left crosses in flames
The church breaks down
When science strikes
Deceived us all
Left crosses in flames
The church breaks down
When science strikes
They played a game
Left crosses in flames
The church breaks down, down down
The church breaks down, down down
Left crosses in flames
Left crosses in flames
