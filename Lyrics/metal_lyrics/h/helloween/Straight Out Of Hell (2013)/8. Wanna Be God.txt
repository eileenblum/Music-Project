[music: Deris, lyrics: Deris]

He's a man looking down on the people
He's a prick you got to really call evil
Cannot be stopped, you cannot change his mind
Shots have been lethal
What he eyes is just there for the taking
What he takes will soon be forsaken
He is rich so he'll never die
If money can buy
He says

I don't wanna be an angel
I wanna be god
Mine the key to hell and heaven
I wanna be god
He said - I wanna be god

When a man is just out for the power
All his life, every day, every hour
He should be in the psychiatry
Brainsick and sour
It's a ghost living just for the money
It's a cripple with a heart of a mummy
In a game for eternal fame
A contagious fever
He says

I don't wanna be an angel
I wanna be god
Mine the key to hell and heaven
I wanna be god
I am high, mighty and awed
He said
I wanna be god
