[Japanese Limited Edition Bonus Track][music: Grosskopf, lyrics: Grosskopf]

Takinâ my time ainât too easy today
No time to live ainât no time for dying
No time to talk cause I have to move on
No time for love ainât no time for crying
No time to waste not a minute to wait
No time to care because time is money
Timeâs so expensive we can not afford
Only hellfire waits

Sometimes I donât care at all tonight Iâm breaking free
Seems like it is my last facility

Time is losing all itâs pride
We live as if we hide
Away from all our joy and glory
Time is losing all itâs pride
We live as if thereâs no eternity

TimeÂ´s running out it can happen so fast
We're gonna perish in big haste at last
No turning back cause I canât turn the page
Farewell my friend ainÂ´t so long

Sometimes I donât care at all tonight Iâm breaking free
Seems like it is my last facility

Time is losing all itâs pride
We live as if we hide
Away from all our joy and glory
Time is losing all itâs pride
We live as if thereâs no eternity

Time is losing all itâs pride
We live as if we hide
Away from all our joy and glory
Time is losing all itâs pride
We live as if thereâs no eternity

No eternity
No eternityÂ
