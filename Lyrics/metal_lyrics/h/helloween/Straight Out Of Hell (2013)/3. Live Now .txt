[music: Deris/Gerstner, lyrics: Deris]

Thereâs somebody made for me
Someone I still donât see
One I will find tonight
Everything will be alright

Live Now!
Live Now!
Say it loud
Live Now!
Say it loud
Live Now!

Donât say youâre too scared up high
Life needs no wings to fly
Come out into the light
We can reach the height tonight

Live Now!
Live Now!
Say it loud
Live Now!
Say it loud
Live Now!

Get up and start to see now
Give it a try and learn how
To leave behind the wasteland
Have no fear, Iâm taking your hand

Live Now!
Live Now!
Say it loud
Live Now!
Live Now!
Say it loud
Live Now!
