[music: Deris, lyrics: Deris]

Sometimes Iâm tough and bold
Just sometimes I am frightened
Sometimes Iâm dull and cold
But sometimes so enlightened
I made some old mistakes but still did what I wanted
Sometimes the right you turned into wrong
I did it again
I donât give a damn

Here I am
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the pain
Waiting for the rain youâre bringing
Here I go
Waiting for the thunder
I am not a saint
Put on your war paint
And kill me

Sometimes I have to leave
Knowing sometimes I got stranded
Sometimes I want to fight
Though many times I was branded
Whatever life may bring I just try to keep my head up
Sometimes you have no choice but to kill
A man as I am
I donât give a damn

Here I am
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the fate
I am not afraid to face you
Here I go
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the flame
Play your lousy game and kill me
And kill me
And kill me
Come and kill me
Come and kill me right now

Here I am
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the pain
Waiting for the rain youâre bringing
Here I go
Waiting for the thunder
I am not a a saint
Put on your war paint
And kill me

Here I am
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the fate
I am not afraid to face you
Here I go
Waiting for the thunder
Waiting for the flame
Play your lousy game and kill me
