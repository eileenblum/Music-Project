[music: Grosskopf, lyrics: Grosskopf]

Straight out of hell I waste my life not for tomorrow
Straight out of hell Iâm only livinâ for today
I roll the dice I know that something strange is coming
Iâm cold as ice I always take it as it comes

Ainât no eternity, ainât no salvation
In this damnation we will burn

Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
Thereâs no tomorrow there is no farewell
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell

Iâm gonna lose it but it feels so well
Iâm straight out of hell

No ace to play I live my life with no protection
The price I pay my act of grace will be denied
This road to hell and I wonât find no resurrection
Cause I will sell my dirty soul to rock nâ roll

Ainât no eternity, ainât no salvation
In this damnation we will burn

Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
Thereâs no tomorrow there is no farewell
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
Iâm gonna lose it but it feels so well
Straight out of hell

So sad and lonely I go down
No helping hand no soul around
I lost my faith so long ago
A million tears are gonna flow

Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
Thereâs no tomorrow there is no farewell
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
Iâm gonna lose it but it feels so well
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
Thereâs no tomorrow there is no farewell
Straight out of hell, straight out of hell
Iâm gonna lose it but it feels so well
Iâm straight out of hell
