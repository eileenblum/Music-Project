[music: Weikath, lyrics: Weikath]

I see you beg for truth
Hereâs some news I can convey
All your lifeâs in your own hands
Flat or steep you define yourself

Take a stance towards life that will keep you strong so youâre in control
Free your mind and choose from the good things that come your way

See the years passing by
Add your part, fade and die
Weâre all in this scheme to thrive
In a quest to persevere
Donât submit to your fears
Even youâll see the light

I just heard, you made the call
Untold myths and pains resolved
Time has shown, no time left to tell
Keep your life, you just saved yourself

Build up strength so life canât turn awkward, avoid the pigeonholes
Free your mind to choose from the good things that come your way
