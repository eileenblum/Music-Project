[Music &amp; Lyrics: Grosskopf]

We hurt who we love we destroy what we need
For profit we sell our souls
We're sowing disaster, the mess is complete,
Resources will soon be consumed

Open your eyes see the signs all around;
Hoping fate will have mercy on all
Someday the next generation will pay
But one day it' s too late to regret

If a mountain could talk it would tell us a story
To reign in love means just how to say sorry
If an ocean could cry we would drown in it's tears
Dusk breaks to dawn,
Which we cannot survive without love

Time passes by, time's gonna fly
Life is much too short to understand it
Don't even try

Time passes by, time's gonna fly
Don't fill up your heart with hate and anger
Give it a try

I know that things are going wrong sometimes
But then we need to get it right
I feel the pressure's so intense, sometimes,
I know we need a change tonight.

If a mountain could talk it...

Always on time always right on track
Expectations are set to the limit
Is it too late is there no turning back
All I need is a moment in peace
