[Music &amp; Lyrics: Gerstner]

You think you are alone
In this universe
What would you say if there are some
Armed with all you deserve

Destiny my friend you'll see
Counts nothing anymore
Open up your mind now and realize
They may come for sure

Dead and gone
No survivors
They'll hit and crush our earth
You stupid mankind

Evolution everywhere
Who do you think you are
Like you are on the top of there ?
They may come for war
More evil, violent and vain
Than you could ever be
Can beam through time and bring you pain
All dead no one flees

Destiny my friend you'll see
Counts nothing anymore
Open up your mind now and realize

They may come for sure

Dead and gone
No survivors
They'll hit and crush our earth
With no mercy
Dead and gone
No more fighting
They'll kill and burn your earth
You stupid mankind

They don't care
They don't care
They don't care
They don't care

Dead and gone
No survivors
They'll hit and crush our earth
With no mercy
Dead and gone
No more fighting
They'll kill and burn your earth
You stupid mankind
