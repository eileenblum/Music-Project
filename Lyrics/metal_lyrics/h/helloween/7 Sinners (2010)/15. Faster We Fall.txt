[bonus track]

I have a dream no more such pain from dictators
No more such racists and no hell on earth
No politicians are tellinÂ´ us lies any more
Life without enemies life without war without war

Some people are starving while some of us stay rich
Some pigs are the masters that pull all the strings

Faster we fall if we wonÂ´t change at all
Pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
Faster we fall free your mind free your soul
Stronger than ever before

I have a dream no more commanders and soldiers
Life without enemies life without war
No killing weapons no walkinÂ´ on blood any more

Some people are starving while some of us stay rich
Ooh some pigs are the bastards left the poor all as slaves

Faster we fall if we wonÂ´t change at all
Pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
Faster we fall free your mind free your soul
Stronger than ever before stronger than ever before

Faster we fall if we wonÂ´t change at all
Pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
Faster we fall free your mind free your soul
Stronger than ever before

Faster we fall if we wonÂ´t change at all
Pray for your freedom and pray for your soul
Faster we fall free your mind free your soul
Stronger than ever before stronger than ever before
Stronger than ever be stronger than ever be
Stronger than ever before
