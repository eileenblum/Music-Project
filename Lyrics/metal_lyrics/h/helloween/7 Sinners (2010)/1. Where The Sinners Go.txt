[Music &amp; Lyrics: Deris]

Can you hear me
Do you know me
I'm a taker
I'm a faker

Oh my God, don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
Oh my God show me no way
Mercy, don't struck me a blow

Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go

May I argue
Is it all true
You forgive us
What is and was

Oh my God, please look away
Mercy, don't struck me a blow

Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go

Can you hear it
Or is it just summining in my ears only?
It's talking
Words so true and old
I'm afraid to loose my mind
No, no, don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
Don't wanna know
Where the sinners go
