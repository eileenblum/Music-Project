[bonus track]

IÂ´m aiming high I wanna reach the sky
I wanna try to spread my wings and fly
No time to wait, no time to hesitate
ItÂ´s not too late IÂ´m breakinÂ´ free

I take the stars up to the sky
At least I carry on and try

Aiming high and try to leave
The world of sorrow
Aiming high and live like there is
No tomorrow aiming high

IÂ´m reaching out for peace and liberty
IÂ´m breakinÂ´ out far from reality
IÂ´m cominÂ´ out until my eyes can see
So clearer now until IÂ´m free

I will take the stars up to the sky yeah yeah
At least I carry on and try for you

Aiming high and try to leave
The world of sorrow
Aiming high and live like there is
No tomorrow aiming high

Aiming high and try to leave
The world of sorrow
Aiming high and live like there is
No tomorrow I am aiming high
