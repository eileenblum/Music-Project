Daily in the news and on the screen
they wanna show you how to look like
how to be a star
But if you bignosed without muscles
you are not attractive
you don't fit in what's so popular
Four pounds too much without a suntang
selfrespect is fading
they already tooked away your pride
California dreamgirl with her brain down in her pussy
you will never reach her you're too small

Wake up all you idiots don't close your eyes
and see there is only one thing you can be
this is just you and nothing else
start to believe all in yourself
stop to running after visions you don't need

who is in the mirror
do you really trust this face
smiles at you so bad and ugly
this is not yourself anymore
will a soul feel well in plastic bodies
where it don't belong
silicon and lifted faces
don't you really know who you are

Don't try to hide
if you don't look like Monroe
the smile on your face this is real
just be yourself that's the deal

California dreamman
with a smile made out of plastic
juicy woman dreams that you can buy
selling you a dream so far away
and so fantastic until you realise you won't get high

Now you're close to suicide
your dream bursts like a bubble
all the gossip you once liked is gone
your addiction to be skinny is driving you to madness
I hope now you can see what you have done
