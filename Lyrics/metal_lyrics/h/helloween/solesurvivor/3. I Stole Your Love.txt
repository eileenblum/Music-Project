Alright
I remember the day that we met
I needed someone you needed someone too
Spent time taking all you could get
Even yourself was one thing you never could do
You played with my heart
You played with my head
I've got to laugh when I think all things you said

Cause I stole your love
Stole your love
Ain't never going to let you go
I stole your love
Stole your love

You never stop running around
You pick me up and say you want some of me
Down
You were the girl that nobody could own
You stay for a while and then you would leave me alone
But I'm something different - ain't like the rest
How does it feel to find out your failing your test

Cause I stole your love
Stole your love
Ain't never going to let you go
I stole your love
Stole your love

Guitar!

Listen!
Cause I stole your love
Stole your love
Ain't never going to let you go
I stole your love
Stole your love

I stole your love
Stole your love
Stole your love
Come on
I stole your love
