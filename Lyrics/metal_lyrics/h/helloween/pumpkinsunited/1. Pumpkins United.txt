Take heed, beware
There's something in the air
Grown to an almighty size
It's loud and it gleams
And with fury it screams
See the big Pumpkin arise

From out of sight it's been
But growing deep within
To boiling point excited
The fire is ignited

Here we are, here we go
Shout it out, let them know
Like a bright shining star
Pumpkins United we are
We're red hot

Beware, beware
Something's in the air
The Halloween monsters arise
The pieces brought back
From the book of the dead
By Dr. Stein brought back to life

Oh, my God, we burn
The point of no return
To pleasure point excited
The fire is ignited

Here we are, here we go
Shout it out, let them know
We're a light in the dark
Pumpkins United we are

And we're riding the sky like the eagle
We wake up the mountain a far
We're blasting the walls in Jericho
Pumpkins United we are
Pumpkins United
Red hot

Sing it high, sing it low
Shout it out, let them know
We're a light in the dark
United we are

And we're riding the sky like the eagle
We wake up the mountain a far
We're blasting the walls in Jericho
Pumpkins United we are
United we are
Red hot
Red hot
United
United
