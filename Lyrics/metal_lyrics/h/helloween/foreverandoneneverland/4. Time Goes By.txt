I saw a million people cry
I heard so little laughter
Tasted so many tears of mine
Still didn't feel good after
Sometimes I just wish
To turn back time
But if I could there is no world
No world that I just want to see
In my mind And time goes by
Passing by my eyes
And I still wait here for better
Time goes by
Deaf to pain and cries
And I still wait here for better
For better
Forever
