There's a light in the sky
Shining all a life for one heart
There's a light in the sky
That will lead you when we're apart
All my love's shining
To lead you when you're gone
All my love's shining
To say you're not alone
There's a light in the sky
For everyone who believes
There's a light in the sky
Giving mind everlasting peace
All my love's shining
To lead you when you're gone
All my love's shining
To say you're not alone
There's a light in the sky
There's a light in the sky
