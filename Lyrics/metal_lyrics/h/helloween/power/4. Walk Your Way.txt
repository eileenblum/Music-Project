I see black, I see white
I see the darkness and the light
Life goes up, life goes down
I am the hero and the clown

(I live it up) - yeah
(Won't give it up)
I want it all don't wanna fall
(I live it up - won't give it up)
(I want it all don't wanna fall)
I'm pretty sure there must be something worth living for

(Walk Your Way) Don't let them tear you apart
(Walk Your Way) Don't let them change you
You are here to live and what you take you've got to give

(Walk your way) It's just a signal from your heart
(Walk your way) Sometimes it strange though
Life is such a game, don't give it up
Cuz it will never be the same

I'm smoking, I'm soaking
Till there is nothing left to lose
Shit stinks and really smells bad
Step into it - makes you upset

(I live it up) - oh yeah
(Won't give it up)
I want it all don't wanna fall, yeah!
(I live it up) - oh yeah
(Won't give it up)
(I want it all don't wanna fall)
I'm pretty sure there must be something worth living for

(Walk Your Way) Don't let them tear you apart
(Walk Your Way) Don't let them change you
You are here to live and what you take you've got to give

(Walk your way) It's just a signal from your heart
(Walk your way) Sometimes it strange though
Life is such a game, don't give it up
Cuz it will never be the same

(whoa oh oh oh oh) yeah
(whoa oh oh oh oh) So many different things are waiting to be done
(whoa oh oh oh oh)
(whoa oh oh oh oh) So many things but you can put your ears into the sound
(whoa oh oh oh oh) hey
(whoa oh oh oh oh) Just take your time and you will never be too late
(whoa oh oh oh oh)
(whoa oh oh oh oh) Just take your time don't try to change your fate

(Walk Your Way) Don't let them tear you apart
(Walk Your Way) Don't let them change you
You are here to live and what you take you've got to give

(Walk your way) It's just a signal from your heart
(Walk your way) Sometimes it strange though
Life is such a game, don't give it up
Cuz it will never be the same
