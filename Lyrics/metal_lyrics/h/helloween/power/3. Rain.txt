How can I see what I'm leaving for?
How can I give what I gave before?
How can you tell me that you want me to stay?
How can I stay when I'm trying to say,
That I can't live without the rain,
Yes I cant live without the rain.

How can I feel what I'm trying to feel,
How can I move when I'm heel to heel,
You're always shouting about the doubt in my eye,
But I can't answer cos my eyes are so dry.
Now I can't live without the Rain.
Yes I can't live without the Rain.

I cant live without the rain,
That's falling on my head,
Rain that's falling on my head.

Rain that's falling,
Rain that's falling,
Rain that's falling on my head.

I'd started thinking back to you when,
I'd like to send a line but then again,
How can I write you when there aint no light,
I'm feeling tight tonight but that's alright.
Now I can't live without the rain,
Yes I can't live without the rain.
