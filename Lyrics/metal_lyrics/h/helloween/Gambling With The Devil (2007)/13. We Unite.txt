[Japanese bonus track]

When tyranny will have an end around the world
And freedom has become a part of all our lives
When slavery will have an end to all of us
Then we don't mind the colour of our skin
We go straight for paradise no more treason no more lies
One day we will know what we are fightin' for
Under the eternal sky we unite to be free from your spell
Someday we will know what we are cryin' for
Under the eternal flame that's called freedom again we unite to be free
Dictators and pretenders we don't need no more
No more sending death and soldiers round the world
When no one listens to you and just turns around
Then your worlds'll be blowing in the wind
We go straight for paradise no more treason no more lies
One day I will know under the eternal sky
We unite to be free from your spell
Someday we will know under the eternal flame
That's called freedom again we unite
When tyranny ended and slavery has brought to fall
Then freedom will show that the world we do live in is worth to fight for
One day we will know what we are fightin' for
Under the eternal sky we unite to be free from your spell
One day we will know under the eternal flame
That's called freedom again we unite to be free
