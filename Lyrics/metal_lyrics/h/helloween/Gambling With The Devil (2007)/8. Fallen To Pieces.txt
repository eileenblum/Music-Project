[Music &amp; Lyrics: Deris]

Thunder
Rain
My aching mind
Arise from a dream
Step aside
Into the shadows
Brightness
Just borrowed
For too short a time

Why must I die one more time if I try?
Way down I pray but the skies turn to grey
How long lived I waiting?
How long can I vie?

I run high and low
I'm fallen to pieces
My heart cried for you
I'm fallen to pieces

Say, do you see you're just playing with me?
Way down I flee from your spell and appeal
No more I'll be  waiting
No longer I'll  vie

I run high and low
I'm fallen to pieces
My heart cried for you
I'm fallen to pieces

Hold on
Hold on

Lies turn to ties for ill famed and disguised
One day you'll pay and  your skies turn to grey

I run high and low
I'm fallen to pieces
My heart cried for you
I'm fallen to pieces
I died times ago
I'm fallen to pieces
Now I rise alone
I'm fallen to pieces
Fallen to pieces
