[Music &amp; Lyrics: Deris]

I close my eyes so I don't have to see
I shut my heart and tell my mind to run and flee

Once I was flying high
I touched the sky

As long as I fall
I don't hit the ground
As long as I fall
I'm safe and sound
As long as I fly
I sure cannot die
I don't need to hear the call
As long as I fall

Would I have time to change reality
I would become the man
The man I could never be

Oh my God please tell me
How to break free
Once I was flying high
I touched the sky

As long as I fall
I don't hit the ground
As long as I fall
I'm safe and sound
As long as I fly
I sure cannot die
I don't need to hear the call
As long as I fall

As long as I fall
I got no reason to care
As long as I fall
I got no problem to bear
I don't need to bother what I did or did not
I would cry out in pain, but:

As long as I fall
I don't hit the ground
As long as I fall
I'm safe and sound
I don't need to face
No  blame or disgrace
No reason to change at all
As long as I fall
I don't hit the ground
As long as I fall
I'm safe and sound
As long as I fly
I sure cannot die
I don't need to hear the call
As long as I fall
