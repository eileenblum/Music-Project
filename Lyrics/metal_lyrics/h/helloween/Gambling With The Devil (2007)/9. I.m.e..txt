[Music &amp; Lyrics: Deris]

I should not this
I must not that
No matter how I act I must regret
It's not me
It's not me
I got to play
What others say
I got to turn it down when I feel great
That's not me
It's not me

I am me
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to be
I am me
No matter what you say
Today I keep my way
I am me

You make me sick
You make me choke
For me your way of life is just a joke
It's not me
It's not me
I got a face
I got a name
Whatever you perceive is not the same
That I see
It's not me

I am me
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to be
I am me
No matter what you say
Today I keep my way
I am me

I got to change this
To rearrange this
Start writing onto my own pages
It's just me
It's just me
It's just me

I am me
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to be
I am me
No matter what you say
Today I keep my way
I am me
How grave you think you are
To tell me what to be
I am me
You better creep away
Today I'm on my way
I am me
