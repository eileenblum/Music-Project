[Music &amp; Lyrics: Deris]

Listen to the whisper of the weak and blind
Listen good if you want to learn how  to survive
Treasure when you've been chosen to turn water into wine
Never meant for your own
Don't drink it!

We are the hive
We are the people
We ring The Bells Of The 7 Hells
We bear the light
We bear the fire
We ring The Bells Of The 7 Hells

Shiver, you have taken from the poor in greed
Shiver, you betrayed the ones you've sworn to feed
With given power comes responsibility
When you will regret
Don't take it

We are the hive
We are the people
We ring The Bells Of The 7 Hells
We bear the light
We bear the fire
We ring The Bells Of The 7 Hells

Did I keep my vow?
Did I wrong somehow?
Did I stay right on my way?
Have I lied to cover
My precious lover?
My prurience for fame
God help me
God help me

Listen to the breathing of the underground
Listen to the voice that tries to make no sound
Treasure when you've been chosen to turn water into wine
Never meant for your own
Don't drink it!

We are the hive
We are the people
We ring The Bells Of The 7 Hells
We bear the light
We bear the fire
We ring The Bells Of The 7 Hells
