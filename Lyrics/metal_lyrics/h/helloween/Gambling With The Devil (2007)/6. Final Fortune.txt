[Music &amp; Lyrics: Grosskopf]

We try to force our final fortune
As if we knew the final score
And we pretend to know things better
In our madness we ignore
How small we are
We are

Far above this ignorance
A higher force you'll find
Forever giving answers to the blind

When fate comes calling you
You don't know what to do
Behind the world we're living in
Is so much more than we do know
There's ONE who loves you so
Behind the world we're living in
There's so much more than we will ever get to know

Protecting nations, wealth and soldiers
Collecting fame and victory
Inventing star-ships, tanks and rockets
But still we don't know how to see
The love in our hearts
Our hearts

Far from all this ignorance
A higher force would share
Verity and hope
But we don't care

When fate comes calling you
You don't know what to do
Behind the world we're living in
Is so much more than we do know
There's ONE who loves you so
Behind the world we're living in
There's so much more than we will ever get to know
