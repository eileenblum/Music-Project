[Music &amp; Lyrics: Grosskopf]

I could go a step ahead and try
Harder than before but I deny
Always when I try a step
Something's gonna hold me back
Back to where I started
I just bump my head instead
Better leave me here all on my own
Better leave me or become my clone
Everyone who grabbed my  hand
Fell into the same wasteland
Don't try to convince me with your optimistic smile

I'd need a shotgun in my dreams tonight
To terminate my rotten side
Just need one shot into the center of my hate
To light the darkness and run free
From that old spell

I don't know if hell or paradise
Belong together or if Heaven Tells No Lies
You role the dice
You know the price is higher than you can afford
Beware of what you might see
Can you trust your blinded eyes?
I don't know if Heaven Tells No Lies

Black is white and colours turn to grey
What was close is drifting far away
Just now right's  already wrong
What turns weak was never strong
Can I kill the daemon without blowing out my mind?

I'd need a shotgun in my dreams tonight
To terminate my rotten side
Just need one shot into the center of my hate
To light the darkness and run free
From that old spell

I don't know if hell or paradise
Belong together or if Heaven Tells No Lies
You role the dice
You know the price is higher than you can afford
Beware of what you might see
Can you trust your blinded eyes?
I don't know if Heaven Tells No Lies

I will return
You have to burn
Abide my vision, you no longer keep me bound
I will be back
I will attack
In my religion I will make you hell hound drown
