[Music &amp; Lyrics: Weikath]

When you feel weak
When you feel small
I tell you theres a beast inside you yet unknown
When times get rough
And you're being played
(You) y' ain't gonna flinch or run away cry like a babe

I say that you'd be so surprised seeing what is in for you
If after all you'd still deny it theres nothing I can do
listen up...
come along...

Well you can do it
There's nothing to it
When all others turn their backs on you
There is still yourself to prove it to that

You can do it
There's nothing to it
If the whole damn world abandoned you
You're the only one worth listening to

So, come one come on come on...
come on come on
Get on...

Now look at you
Wearing a crown
Having achieved now all your dreams in just one go
What did I say?
You got it made
Still pondering on the spiteful things of long ago?
No!
I said that you'd be so surprised seeing what is in for you
Now after all that has been done you know what you can do
listen up...
come along...
