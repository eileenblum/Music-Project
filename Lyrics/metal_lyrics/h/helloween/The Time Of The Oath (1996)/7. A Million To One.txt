[Music: Kusch/Lyrics: Deris-Kusch]

Born into somewhere unseen and unknown
Just like a wonder so small and alone
Take me away into your innocent dreams
Maybe I'd see what it all means

A million to one
You will lose it all
A million to one
You'll be falling
Down to where I am
An unholy man
A million to one
You'll be falling

It's so sad and so true but what can I do
Only a few years then it's up to you
To care for yourself, I hope I gave good advice
For all your life, how to survive

A million to one
You will lose it all
A million to one
You'll be falling
Down to where I am
An unholy man
A million to one
You'll be falling
