[Japanese Bonus Track]

Been here just long enough to see what trip you're on
Suffered from your ugly deeds
The way you're pushin all, Oh No
Better watch out what you're doing
Better take some rest or get right of here, oh yeah
Haven't you hurt the people tryin to be your friend

[Chorus:]
You take it to the limit, you take it to the top
You take it to the limit, until you get stopped
You take it to the limit, you take it to the top

Stop! Stop!

You think you're somebody
But you'll never be
On the back of others
You're just acting
Like a thief, oh yeah

Better watch out what you're sayin
Better take your hat and get right out of here
Didn't you lose all the people
Tryin to be your friend

[Chorus:]
You take it to the limit, you take it to the top
You take it to the limit, til you get stopped
You take it to the limit, til you get shot, stop it!
Take it to the limit, take it to the top
Take it to the limit, til you get stopped
Take it to the limit, get out of my head!
