[Music: Kusch/Lyrics: Deris]

Some people die
And even never realize
Man's growing blind
Is seeing only with the eyes
We think we're strong
Believe we never could be wrong
But we are fools
Because we are dying by the rules

Though I cannot change the world we're living in
I can always change myself

One more to count in
Wake up the moutain
All colour's slowly turning to grey
Our world is darkling
Wake up the mountain
And we will find it once more again

Cash and careers
Built on countles sums of fears
All good of life
Begin to vanish behind tears
How do we know
Why did we choose the way we follow
Why do we hurt
Why do we hurt the ones we love

Though I cannot change the world we're living in
I can always change myself

One more to count in
Wake up the moutain
All colour's slowly turning to grey
Our world is darkling
Wake up the mountain
And we will find it once more again
Once more again
We made the rules and we can change them

Break down the orders on by one
We made the laws and we can break them
Break down the mountain
Stone by stone by stone by stone
