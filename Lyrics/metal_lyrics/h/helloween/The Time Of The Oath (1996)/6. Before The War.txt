[Music: Deris/Lyrics: Deris]

Come take a look up to the constellations
Take the book of God you will find your relations
If you understand you will know the solution
Things will fall back to the new constitution

I'm a son of a distant future
I'm the last of the seven troopers
And I came here for the 7th war

I'm a child of the stars
The blaster of the gods
And I have seen it all before
Before the war
Cold-hearted earth
I'm the master of the universe
And I have seen it all before
Before the war

Nature sets a limit on your millenary
Turning every place into a cruel mean scenary
All will get a chance to shun the holy file
But you will be few getting under the wire

I'm a son of a distant future
I'm the last of the seven troopers
And I came here for the 7th war

I'm a child of the stars
The blaster of the gods
And I have seen it all before
Before the war
Cold-hearted earth
I'm the master of the universe
And I have seen it all before
Before the war
Mind the seventh war - mind the seventh war
Yes I came here for the seventh war
