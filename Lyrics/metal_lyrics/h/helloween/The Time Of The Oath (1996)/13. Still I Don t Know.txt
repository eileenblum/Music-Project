[Japanese Bonus Track]

I'm Asking Here
I'm asking there
And we all seem to share
Different gains for life
Though We'll all arrive
At the big end somewhere
But we don't know whats more when its over
Is there heaven or hell?

[Chorus:]
I wonder if there's something when my time's
Run out in life
Still I don't know, Still I don't Know
Wonder if there's music, rubbersex
And a Mac Drive
Still I don't know, Still I don't know

All we know is here
What we lone and fear
Its a question of time
When all is said and done
When we're dead and gone
We'll just disappear

Yes We don't know whats more when its over
Is there heaven or hell?

[Chorus:]
I wonder if there's something
My Lifes run out of time
Still I don't know, Still I don't know
Wonder If there's smokers
Even in "Deutsche Bahn
Still I don't know, Still I don't know

Wonder if there's something
Like a cigarette or some wine
Wonder if I'm lonely
If i'll meet a friend of mine

[Chorus]

Still I don't know, Still I don't know.......
