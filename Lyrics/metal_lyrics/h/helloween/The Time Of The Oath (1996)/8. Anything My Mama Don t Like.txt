[Music: Deris-Kusch/Lyrics: Deris]

I'm no believer
I just listen to my own head
I'm no believer
I just call you liar instead
Keep all your sorrows
Words might be pathetically vain
Life is a fire
Light it and you can read your name

I'm the king of the night generation
I'm anything my mama don't like
I'm a slave of perverted nation
Anything my mama don't like

I am a flyer
Rising in the wake of my dreams
I am a tumbler
Life can be as good as it seems

I'm a child playing chess with tomorrow
I'm anything my mama don't like
I'm a clown and I beg, steal and borrow
Anything my mama don't like

I'm the king of the night generation
I'm anything my mama don't like
I'm a slave of perverted nation
Anything my mama don't like
