[Music &amp; lyrics: M. Weikath]

Each time when one more year was over
You refused to hear heavven's bells sound
And the happiness in you heart's been set lower
You were searching for friends but no one seemed to be 'round

You merely should think of the good times
'Cos there are so many ways you can go
Take a look at yourself, you're still very young
And big aims always take very long

Now it's time for happiness, stay hard and trust your fate
Don't forget you're something else you'll never be too late
Trust your fathers' mighty spell you'll never be alone
Fate will always turn out well and you'll be number one

Shout at the world don't care what they say
'Cos your life is now, here and today
Luck is there, ev'rywhere
Go on, reap its goods, that's the way
You wanna have truth, relief from your pain
But life takes its toll again and again
Don't fear the night--your future is paid
And the tracks to your aims are laid

Now it's time. . .
