[Earbook Edition Bonus Track]once you were calling
now I got you under control
you can't deny me
I am living deep in your soul

now you are my victim
and I do as I please
now you are wailing
but you'll never find your peace

nightmare in the darkness
tearing you apart
you fall asleep and I come closer
there's no escape
I'm living in your mind
nightmare in the darkness

eternal lifetime
just what you were asking for
I gave you all but you are still asking for more

now I am your anger
I'm your darkest desire
you wanted all but now you're burning in hellfire

nightmare in the darkness
tearing you apart
I'll get you when you close your eyes
you can't resist
I'm living in your soul
nightmare in the dark

you fall asleep and I come closer
I'll get you when you close your eyes
now your addiction's getting stronger
and now there is no turning back

nightmare in the darkness
tearing you apart
you fall asleep and I come closer
there's no escape
I'm living in your mind

nightmare in the darkness
tearing you apart
I'll get you when you close your eyes
you can't resist
I'm living deep in your soul

I am your nightmare in the darkness
I am your nightmare in the dark
I am your nightmare in the darkness
