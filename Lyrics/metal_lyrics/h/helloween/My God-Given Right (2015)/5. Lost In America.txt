[Music: Deris, lyrics: Deris]

We are stranded in Belize
Ten hours we must wait
They started with a flight show
So the airport opens late
Nobody really told us
Nobody seems to know
Now we're sitting here all drinking
We hope to catch the show

Finally they make the call
We toddle to the boarding
In the plane we're drunk and loud
When the captain gives a shout

We are high
We are far
But we wonder where we are
We are lost
Lost in America
There's a cloud
There's a star
We should plunder the sky bar
We are lost
Lost in America

Now the captain says the gauges
Don't really seem to be
In the best trustworthy status
As far as he could see
Some ridiculous disturbance
Or a simple full breakdown
Makes it hopeless to impossible
To measure where we're bound for

Finally they make the call
We toddle to the boarding
In the plane we're drunk and loud
When the captain gives a shout

We are high
We are far
But we wonder where we are
We are lost
Lost in America
There's a cloud
There's a star
We should plunder the sky bar
We are lost
Lost in America

We are high
We are far
But we wonder where we are
We are lost
Lost in America
There's a cloud
There's a star
We should plunder the sky bar
We are lost
Lost in America

We are high
We are far
But we wonder where we are
We are lost
Lost in America
