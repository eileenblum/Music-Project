[Music: Grosskopf, lyrics: Grosskopf]

He was a guy who had no education
He never learned to love and now he hates society
He never had somebody who would listen
He never had a friend that he could talk to when he's down

He has to suffer mental discomposure
He never learned to pay, he's only taking what he needs
His only friends are hate and violation
To get arrested some day is his only destination

Too late the damage's done is everything you hear
And when you're dead and gone nobody cries a tear

Carry on now, carry on
Living life in danger, living on the edge
Carry on now, carry on
Living like there's nothing left to lose

He's hating light
He loves to live in shadows
Where he can hide his fears
When he is crying secret tears
He's hating light
He loves to hide in darkness
Where he can hide his feelings and emotions
His enemies

Too late the damage's done is what they always say
You never get your chance you lose it anyway

Carry on now, carry on
Living life in danger just like living on the edge
Carry on now, carry on
Living like there's nothing left to lose

You never had the chance to prove
That youâre a man full of emotions
You only learned how to survive
In your environment of darkness
You build a fortress 'round your soul

Carry on now, carry on
Living life in danger, just like living on the edge
Carry on now, carry on
Living like there's nothing left to lose
