[Japanese Bonus Track]I'm staring on at your picture
How the wind picks up your hair
Behind you a palm and the ocean
How I wish I had been there

Yeah, too often we're not together
Yeah, too often I'm far away

Know that I always care
I wish I were
I wish I were there
No longer away, no dead air
I wish I were
I wish I were there

I'm listening to all of your stories
What you've done and what you've seen
Your face so small on my iphone
And I'm touching you on screen

Yeah, too often we're not together
Yeah, too often I'm far away

Know that I always care
I wish I were
I wish I were there
No longer away, no dead air
I wish I were
I wish I were there

I never had a doubt I would achieve it
I never allowed myself to fail
But then when I was there
I wished I were where you were
I wish I had been there
I think I got the moral of the story
For every wish granted there's a snag
The genie in the bottle never tells to take care
I wish I had been there
Wish I had been there

Know that I always care
I wish I were
I wish I were there
No longer away, no dead air
I wish I were
I wish I were there

Know that I always care
I wish I were
I wish I were there
No longer away, no dead air
I wish I were
I wish I were there

I wish I had been there
I wish I had been there
I wish I had been there
Wish I had been there
