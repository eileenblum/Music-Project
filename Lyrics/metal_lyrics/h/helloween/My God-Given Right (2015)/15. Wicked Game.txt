[Japanese Bonus Track]I came into the world to play

I'm the master of a shady revolution
I don't care about your constitution
You can call it quite a lunatic rebellion
Yeah right, I am a hellion

I will return with glory
I know how to win this game

I came into the world to play
Wicked game
I'll have more fun with you, round and round
No matter what you're gonna say
Wicked game
Come on and stay with me, the hunting grounds

I'm not sorry for a bad decision
All I care about is my own vision
Super sonic boom with all my power
I'm back for your last hour

I will return with glory
I know how to win this game

I came into the world to play
Wicked game
I'll have more fun with you, round and round
No matter what you're gonna say
Wicked game
Come on and stay with me, the hunting grounds

I came into the world to play

I came into the world to play
Wicked game
I'll have more fun with you, round and round
No matter what youÂ´re gonna say
Wicked game

Come on and stay with me, the hunting grounds
Wicked game
I came into the world to play
Wicked game
I'll have more fun with you, round and round
No matter what you're gonna say
Wicked game

Come on and stay with me, the hunting grounds
Wicked game
Wicked game
Wicked game
