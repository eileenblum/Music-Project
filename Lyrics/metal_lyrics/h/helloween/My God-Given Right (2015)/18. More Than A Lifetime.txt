[Earbook Edition Bonus Track]Media controlled
Overruled, we are racing through time
Hiding our souls and emotions away
Fearing that we all can be left behind
Scared about sharing our hopes in a world full of lies

Cold as a stone we are playing our part
Pushing it to the extreme
Still there's a fire that burns in your heart
Save it and never let go
More than a lifetime it takes
In a world that is made out of madness
More than a lifetime it takes
To find out we know nothing at all

Faster and faster we're pushing our limits too high
All what we see is the profit
Paid with the blood of the weak and the poor
Stone cold and careless we're playing our part
Avarice is all that we know
Still there's a fire that burns in your heart
Save it and never let go

More than a lifetime it takes
In a world that is made out of madness
More than a lifetime it takes
To find out we know nothing at all
Out of the blue there will rise a new day
Don't let them tear you apart
Chances are few but you'll find your own way
And you try another start

More than a lifetime it takes
In a world that is made out of madness
More than a lifetime it takes
Carry on with the struggle
On with that struggle
On with the show called life
