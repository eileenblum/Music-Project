[Japanese Bonus Track]No more excuses, no more regrets
Living my life as good as it gets
No more dictators, no thought control
No asshole calls you a fool

The world's growing colder
Can I prevent?
Can I see clearer?
Can I understand?

Imagine living in a free world
Nations to be one
Living in a free world
I know it can be done
Living in a free world
Glorious and wild
Living in a free world
Hand in hand we start a better day

No politicians telling you lies
Breeding their profits
We pay the price

Endless oppression comes to an end
Hope and relief all over the land

Over the rainbow I see a light
Time for deliverance
I'm ready to strike

Imagine living in a free world
Nations to be one
Living in a free world
I know it can be done
Living in a free world
Glorious and wild
Living in a free world
Hand in hand we start a better day

Imagine living in a free world
Nations to be one
Living in a free world
I know it can be done
Living in a free world
Glorious and wild
Living in a free world
Hand in hand we start a better day
