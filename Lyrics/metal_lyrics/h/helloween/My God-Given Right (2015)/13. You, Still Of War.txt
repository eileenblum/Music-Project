[Music: Gerstner/Deris, Lyrics: Gerstner]

Wake up

Alone I find myself on my knees
I see those footsteps on this crystal frozen sea
No bird, no tree nor any other living creature seen
Wind the only thing I can hear
Cloud transitions passing by above my head
While I'm moving I see my feet are deep blood red

Hey
I find myself alone
What happened suddenly?
Hey
I find myself alone
Is this my destiny?

I spread my wings and fly to find those of my kind
As I will not survive the loneliness
Don't wanna let you down no matter who you are
I can't believe I am the only one
Ah, you still of war
Ah, you still of nevermore
Ah, you still of war
Hush

Frozen cities, ashes fallen off the trees
I killed those who chose me for a nuclear decease

Hey
I'm made in fire
What happened suddenly?
Hey
Exploding is my desire
Is this my destiny?

I spread my wings and fly to find those of my kind
As I will not survive the loneliness
Don't wanna let you down no matter who you are
I can't believe I am the only one
No!

Hey
I'm made of steel
What happened suddenly?
Hey
I just eject from seals
Is this my destiny?

I spread my wings and fly to find those of my kind
As I will not survive the loneliness
Don't wanna let you down no matter who you are
I can't believe I am the only one
Ah, you still of war
Ah, you still of nevermore
Ah, you still of war

All these tears I've cried
Flowing into seas
All the memories gone
Of this human breed
All these years I've tried
To be just your threat
All the triggers made you
And me a hand of death
All the creatures died
New generations bloom
Frontier ahead, on an airplane
Led me into doom

No, you still of war
No, you still of war
No!
