[Music: Deris/Gerstner, lyrics: Deris]

Can anybody tell me how I gotta do it right?
I need a revelation
Can anybody tell me how to turn back to the light?
I'm yearning for salvation

I don't know
Which way to go
So I
Come out and play
I come out and play
Russian roulÃ©
Come out and play
Russian roulÃ©

Better to die trying than to rot away in vain
The last stop to damnation
Better to be fighting for a better life in pain
Than living on probation
I don't know

Which way to go
So I
Come out and play
I come out and play
Russian roulÃ©
Come out and play
Russian roulÃ©

Somebody tell me how to live my life
Must I break the rules?
Somebody tell me how I have to fight
To live to win, to live up high

Come out and play
Come out and play
Russian roulÃ©

Come out and play
I come out and play
Russian roulÃ©

Come out and play
Russian roulÃ©

Russian roulÃ©
Russian roulÃ©
Russian roulÃ©
