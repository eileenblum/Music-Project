[Music: Weikath, lyrics: Weikath]

Ohhhhhh!
Yeah!
Come on!

Shoot down their legions they die in vain
helpless against your advanced weaponry
what they will get is their names on display
maybe a casket if there's funds left to pay these at all

Left in the swamps bent over rocks
that's the glorious take of their lives
what they just got is eternal fame
rats and dogs devouring their sorry remains

You made 'em suffer and pay their price
watched from far above them
however their history has just been changed
their past is gone once more

Stand tall
your battle's won
all foes defeated, done
and feasts achieved
with fate on your side
rejoice for evermore
victor to the core
you excelled by all means
went on and on

Yeah!

There's more dispatches for killing sprees
checking out grounds for the next genocide
greed for profit advances being paid
tech shares soar balanance sheet rising up high

Can you remember that hero we had
who bombed that lot to ashes?
Ask is whereabouts summon him now
employ that guy once more

Stand tall
your battle's won
all foes defeated, done
and feasts achieved
with fate on your side
rejoice for evermore
victor to the core
you excelled by all means
went on and on

Ohhhhhh!

Stand tall
your battle's won
all foes defeated, done
and feasts achieved
with fate on your side
rejoice for evermore
victor to the core
you excelled by all means
went on and ooooooh

Stand tall
your battle's won
battle's won
your battle's won
Ohhhhhh!
