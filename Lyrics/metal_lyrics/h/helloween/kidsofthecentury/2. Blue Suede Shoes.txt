Well it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go cat go
But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes

For you can knock me down, step in my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
But oh oh honey lay off of my shoes
Well you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

You can burn my house, you can steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
You can do anything that you wanna do
But oh oh honey lay off of my blue suede shoes
You can do anythind but don't step on my blue suede shoes

Well it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go cat go
But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes

Blue, blue, blue, blue suede shoes ...
