[Deris/Kusch]

We can race over the mountains
Sail over the spheres
We can ride under the oceans
But we can't fight our fear

Something's wrong with the world these days
Do you know what it is?

We believe to govern nature
Find ways to lenghten our life
And we go through digital stages
Still the children cry

Something's wrong with the world these days
Do you know what it is?
The planet could be a better place
If we spot the miss
But I guess I would see a start
And I will sing it loud
WON'T YOU PUT YOUR FEET BACK ON THE GROUND

We explore the existence of aliens
Try to conquer space
We refine nuclear science
Still to die in the haze

Something's wrong with the world these days
Do you know what it is?
The planet could be a better place
If we spot the miss
But I guess I would see a start
I warn you without doubt
WON'T YOU PUT YOUR FEET BACK ON THE GROUND
