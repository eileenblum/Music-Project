[Deris]

(What is it all about?)
Pleasure or pain
Cold or fire
Love against disdain
Hope or dipair
Truth or liar
Normal or insane
Do you know wat to choose?
It can't happen you lose
Like the stars need the light
No left without right

Hey lord, hey lord
Life is striking as you taught
Hey lord, hey lord
Time is running, time is short
Hey lord (What is it all about?)

Good or profane
Odd or even
All is face to face
Sinner and saint
Serve each other
Life is called this place
Do you know what to choose?
It can't happen you lose
Like the stars need the light
No left without right

Hey lord, hey lord
Life is striking as you taught
Hey lord, hey lord
Time is running, time is short
Hey lord

Hey lord, hey lord
Time is running, time is short
Hey lord, hey lord
Life is striking, life is short
Hey lord, hey lord
Time is running, time is short
Hey lord, hey lord
Why did you want us so wayward?
Refrain (what is it all about?)

[SOLO: Michael]
