[Deris]

Feel it running off
So strong and clear
An age is over fast
And dissapears
Help him if you can
His hour will come soon
Push away his fear
He'll see Elysium
It's time
It's time

Guard him a little while
And calm his shiver
Wash and dry his tears
And cool his fever
Take the bibles words
Speak it pure his soul
Lay love in his mind
His close to the final goal
It's time
It's time

It's time to go
Time for the freedom
Time to face what we all believe in
Pray strong
Pray to the higher
Turn your back on the devil's fire
Time to go
Time for the freedom
Time to face what we all believe in
Time is passing by

When his mind was clear
He called you brother
Now his brain is dazed
It's resigning rather
Mother take his hand
Say a last Good-Bye
We're not gifted to
Turn water into wine
It's time
It's time

It's time to go
Time for the freedom
Time to face what we all believe in
Pray strong
Pray to the higher
Turn your back on the devil's fire
Time to go
Time for the freedom
Time to face what we all believe in
Time is passing by
