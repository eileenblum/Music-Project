[Deris/Weikath]

I thought that I felt alright with my world
But now what I knew seems taken by someone
Probing me, waiting if I take the bait
Surrender, step into the line

We won't give into the false
We are not as dull as taken
some will hold out if they can
They must kill us if they want us to fall

When we unite
We're falling higher
When worlds collide
We'll stand straight in turmoil and fear
No harm coming near

Hungry forever since we took a glance
Feared that the world was taken by someone
We realized by the look in your eyes
Metal will never die

With magic in our hands
We are lost-and-found contenders
For a kingdom of our stand
Come together no surrender at all

[SOLO]

With magic in our hands
We are lost-and-found contenders
For a kingdom of our stand
Come together no surrender at all

When we unite
We're falling higher
When worlds collide
We'll stand straight in turmoil and fear
No harm coming near
No harm coming near
No harm coming near
We're falling higher
