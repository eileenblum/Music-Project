[Music + lyrics: M. Kiske]

Don't turn your head
back to the wall
don't close your eyes
and wait for your fall

If you believe that you know in this time
you've got anything to win
if you believe that you know
then I say, "you'll lose all again"

[Bridge:]
In this time there's nothing to get for you
you cannot really do what you want
you're a child, a prisoner in your mind
you are a victim of this hopeless time

You better believe all you do has a sense
it's not for nothing
you better believe all the troubles you have
will play you someday

[Bridge:]
Why don't you help yourself and do the best
put all the bombs back up their builders' ass
why don't you stand up to say who you are
to show the people that paradise is not far

[Chorus:]
Oh, can't you see we got the right
to look into the future without no need to hide
no, we won't accept what you do
we stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse
oh, can't you see we got the right
to say we are here to see the light
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can

[Solo: both]

We are credulous idiots
and won't understand what they plan
we march with the times
it's what they expect and we do

Why don't you open your eyes
to undercover all of these lies
I think you won't accept this
go oppose with your fist
fight for your rights

[Chorus:]
Oh, can't you see we got the right
to say we are here to see the light
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can
no, we don't wanna lose all again
stand up, you people, to save the world
as good as you can
