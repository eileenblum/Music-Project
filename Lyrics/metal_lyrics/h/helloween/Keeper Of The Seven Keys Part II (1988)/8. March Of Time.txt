[Music + lyrics: Kai Hansen]

[Solo: Kai]

Hours of lust, hours of tears passing by before my eyes
today, tomorrow, yesterday. . .one life
days of joy, day of sadness come and go to pass me by
a month, a year, one hundred years, they fly

[Bridge:]
Ohh, one day I will be gone to lead another life
ohh, and this world will stop to turn around with me
'cause

[Chorus:]
Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally

Times of peace, times of fights, constant movement is our life
can't stop no more, not until. . .we die
we long for more. . .eternity, and maybe there's another life
this one is short, no matter how you try

[Bridge:]
Ohh, but never give up all the hope to lead a good life
no, don't waste your given time to make things worse

[Chorus:]
Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
one without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally

[Solo: Kai/Michael/Both]

Please, please help me see, the best way to be
make a change and we, live eternally
no more wasted years, no more wasted tears
life's too short to cry, long enough to try

[Chorus:]
Time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally
