[Music + lyrics: M. Weikath]

Once a singer sang 'bout bullshit
everyone could see him fall
and be sure it's been his last hit
he's never been seen at all

Some dictator felt progressive
and lay down in the sun
but his people were aggressive
they killed him with a gun

[Bridge:]
Sometimes you're wrong
by some things you have done
you see fate is too strong
nothing's won
no use for a fight
if you're not acting right
you'll be cut down to size
like a lie

[Chorus:]
It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
so better use your brain

A little dragon could spit fire
but never so for something bad
he didn't know the knight's desire
to throw a lance into his head

Romeo loved his Juliet
their parents told them "Stop"
then it all turned out peculiar
he couldn't get it up

[Bridge:]
And it's all in vain
when you're living with pain
reap not goods you have grown
by your own
feelings you like
disappear overnight
you sip up every grin
free to win

[Chorus:]
It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
you nearly go insane

[Solo: both/Kai/Mike]

A spaceman flies the rocket
that takes him to the stars
thinks his wife is in his pocket
but she's strolling 'round in bars

The king of Los Angeles
bought himself a teddy bear
and the queen became shameless
she did it with a chair

[Bridge:]
Sometimes you're wrong
by some things you have done
you see fate is too strong
nothing's won
no use for a fight
if you're not acting right
you'll be cut down to size
like a lie

[Chorus:]
It's the rise and fall
the prize for all
that ain't nice at all
luck is like a ball
you can't recall or care at all
so better use your brain
