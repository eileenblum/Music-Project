Once they killed his monster when it went into a trap
Now he's making better ones on a higher step

[Bridge:]
On a warm summer day the doctor went away
To a place where he could make it real
His assistant's hips were nice
So he cloned her once or twice
Now his hips are aching what a deal

[Chorus:]
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become great rock musicians
And their time is right

Sometimes when he's feeling bored
He's calling it a day
He's got his computers and they do it their own way

[Bridge:]
They mix some DNA, some skina and a certain spray
You can watch it on a laser screen
And the fellow's blue and grey
Or sometimes pink and green
Just check it out on Halloween

[Chorus:]
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become great politicians
And their time is right

[Solo: Mike/Kai/Mike/Kai]

[Bridge:]
One night he cloned himself
Put his brother on a shelf
But when he fell asleep that night
It crept up from behind and thought "well never mind"
Took a syringe and blew out his life

[Chorus:]
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become a great possession
And their time is right

[Chorus:]
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become a great oppression
And their time is right
