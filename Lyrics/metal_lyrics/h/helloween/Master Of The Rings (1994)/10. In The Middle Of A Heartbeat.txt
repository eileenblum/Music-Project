Tell me, pretty girl, do you know who I am?
Have you ever seen me as your friend?
Anything we have is those hungry nights
But there's so much left unsatisfied
All those little things you told me
Ain't good enough to show me
That we're gonna make it through the time

I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that I'm doin' right
Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to be your light
I can't get any closer to your heart

Now that I'm afraid just to ask for more
I'm still waiting as I did before
If you only said that it's not too late
We could then rely upon our fate
All those little things you'd tell me
Could bear enough to show me
That we're gonna make it through the time

I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that I'm tellin' right
Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to be your light
I can't get any closer to your heart

[SOLO]

I found out
I found out
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And I know that I'm tellin' right
Together we are still so far apart
I found out
In the middle of a heartbeat
And the more I try to br your light
I can't get any closer to your heart
