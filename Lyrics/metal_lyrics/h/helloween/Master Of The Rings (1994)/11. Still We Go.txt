In the beginning
Out of nowhere
We had a dream
And Now It's Helloween

Speed up to a higher limit
Change gear, we're losin' our spirit
We won't take your special advice
We are close to a metal breakdown
Sirens to warn of our meltdown
We couldn't see that headline

Now we can see a horizon
We're gonna be here to stay
If you cannot see our sign
You must be blind

Still we go
Still we go
Still we go
On the metal highway
Still we go

Warn out, won't die on our knees
Shine on, proud as we can be
Time has come to stop pleasing you
Hey man, Let's get it together
Our strength will last forever
Push us as far as we can go

Now we can see a horizon
We're gonna be here to stay
If you cannot see our sign
You must be blind

Still we go
Still we go
Still we go
On the metal highway
Still we go

[SOLO]

How many times must a man cross the lines
To find his right way

Still we go
Still we go
Still we go
On the metal highway
Still we go
