Ooh if I could fly
No fear no pain nobody left to blame
I'll try alone make destiny my own
I learn to free my mind myself I now must find
Once more once more
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall I would picture it all
If I could fly see the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
To the heavens I sail if I could fly
So here I am in solitude I stand
I've got dreams inside I need to realize
My faith has grown no fear of the unknown
No more no more
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall I would picture it all
If I could fly see the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
To the heavens I sail if I could fly
If I could if I could fly
If I could if I could fly if I could
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall I would picture it all
If I could fly see the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail I could ravage my jail
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall I would picture it all
If I could fly see the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
To the heavens I sail if I could fly
