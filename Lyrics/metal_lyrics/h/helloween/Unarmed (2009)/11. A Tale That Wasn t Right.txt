Here I stand all alone
Have my mind turned to stone
Have my heart filled up with ice
To avoid its breakin' twice
Thanks to you my dear old friend
But you can't help this is the end
Of a tale that wasn't right
I will have no sleep tonight
In my heart in my soul
I really hate to pay this toll
Should be strong young and bold
But the only thing I feel is pain
It's alright we'll stay friends
Trustin' me in my confidence
And let's just say it's just alright
You won't sleep alone tonight
In my heart in my soul
I really hate to pay this toll
Should be strong young and bold
But the only thing I feel is pain oh
In my heart in my soul
I really hate to pay this toll
Should be strong young and bold
But the only thing I feel is pain
