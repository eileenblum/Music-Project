La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la laa
From our lives beginning on
Oh we are pushed in little forms
No one asks us how we like to be
In school they teach you what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that they're the ones to see
So they keep talking and they never stop
And at a certain point you give it up
The only thing that's left to think is this
I want out out out to live my life alone
I want out out out leave me be
I want out out out to do things on my own
I want out out out to live my life and to be free
People tell me a and b they tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushin' me from black to white
They're pushing til there's nothing more to hear
But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
'cause I decide the way things gonna be
I want out out out to live my life alone
I want out out out leave me be
I want out out out to do things on my own
I want out out out to live my life and to be free
There's a million ways to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool
And in the end of it none of us is right
Sometimes we need to be alone ooh ooh out out out
No no no no ooh leave me alone
So they keep talking and they never stop
And at a certain point you're giving up
The only thing that's left to think is this
I want out out out to live my life alone
I want out out out leave me be
I want out out out to do things on my own
I want out out out to live my life and to be free
