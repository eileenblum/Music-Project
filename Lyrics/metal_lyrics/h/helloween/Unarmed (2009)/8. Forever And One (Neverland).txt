What can I do will I be gettin' through
Now that I must try to leave it all behind
Did you see what you have done to me
So hard to justify slowly it's passin' by
Forever and one I will miss you however I kiss you
Yet again way down in neverland
So hard I was tryin' tomorrow I'll still be cryin'
How could you hide your lies
Here I am seein' you once again
My mind's so far away my heart's so close to stay
Too proud to fight I'm walkin' back into night
Will I ever find someone to believe
Forever and one I will miss you however I kiss you
Yet again way down in neverland
So hard I was tryin' tomorrow I'll still be cryin'
How could you hide your lies
Aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah aah aah aah
Forever and one I will miss you however I kiss you
Yet again way down in neverland
So hard I was tryin' tomorrow I'll still be cryin'
How could you hide your lies
