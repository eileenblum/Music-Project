People are in big confusion they don't like their constitutions
Every day they draw conclusions and they're still prepared for war
Some can say what's ineffective some make up themselves attractive
Build up things they call protective well your life seems quite bizarre
In the sky a mighty eagle doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light it's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free let people see just make it your own way
Leave time behind follow the sign together we'll fly someday
Hey we think so supersonic and we make our bombs atomic
Or the better quite neutronic and the poor don't see a dime
Nowadays the air's polluted ancient people persecuted
That's what mankind contributed to create a better time
Eagle fly free let people see just make it your own way
Leave time behind follow the sign together we'll fly someday
Eagle fly free let people see just make it your own way
Leave time behind follow the sign together we'll fly someday
Oh oh eagle fly free let people see just make it your own way
Leave time behind follow the sign together we'll fly someday
