I never looked higher mm than I could see
Never gave less than you have given me
The more you have taken you turned into fakes
I finally know now why for heavens' sake
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that if someone's made dumb to the core
He would stay like before
So I take my life back from where the rain grows
Die to survive back from where the rain grows
Now you call me liar 'cause you are just the
Always have right fools majority
Mm I think that if someone starved at your side
You'd all turn your back won't give any dime
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that ii someone's made sad to the core
He would stay like before
So I take my life back from where the rain grows
Die to survive back from where the rain grows
I take my life back from where the rain grows
Die to survive back from where the rain grows
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that ii someone's made sad to the core
He would stay like before
I take my life back from where the rain grows
Die to survive back from where the rain grows
I take my life back from where the rain grows
Die to survive back from where the rain grows
I take my life back from where the rain grows
Die to survive back from where the rain grows
I take my life I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive die to survive
Back from where the rain grows
