Once they killed his monster when it went into a trap
Now he's makin' better ones on a higher step
On a warm summer day the doctor went away
To a place where he could make it real
His assistant's hips were nice so he cloned her once or twice
Now his hips are achin' what a deal
Doctor Stein grows funny creatures lets them run into the night
They become great rock musicians and their time is right
Doctor Stein doctor Stein doctor Stein doctor Stein yeah
Sometimes when he's feelin' bored he's callin' it a day
He's got his computers and they do it their own way
They mix some D.N.A. some skin and certain spray
You can watch it on a laser screen
And the fellow's blue and grey or sometimes pink and green
Just check it out on Halloween
Doctor Stein grows funny creatures lets them run into the night
They become great politicians and their time is
Doctor Stein right doctor Stein doctor Stein doctor Stein
One night he cloned himself put his brother on a shelf
But when he fell asleep that night
It crept up from behind and thought well never mind
Took a syringe and blew out his life
Doctor Stein grows funny creatures lets them run into the night
They become a great obsession and their time is
Doctor Stein grows funny creatures doctor Stein
Doctor Stein grows funny creatures and their time is right
Doctor Stein doctor Stein time is right
Doctor Stein doctor Stein time is right
