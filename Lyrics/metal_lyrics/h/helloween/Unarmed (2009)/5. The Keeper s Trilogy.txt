Masquerade masquerade grab your mask and don't be late
Get out get out well disguised heat and fever in the air tonight
Meet the others at the store knock on other people's door
Trick or treat they have to choice little ghosts are makin' lots a noise
But watch out watch out beware listen listen take care
In the streets on Halloween there's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween the spirits will arise
Make your choice it's hell or paradise
Aah it's Halloween aah it's Halloween oh tonight tonight tonight
I am the one doom's in my hand
Now make your choice redeemed or enslaved
I'll show you passion and glory he is the snake
I'll give you power and abundance he's the corrupter of man
Save me from the evil one give me strength to carry on
I will fight for all mankind's deliverance and peace of mind
Aah it's Halloween aah it's Halloween oh tonight
Make the people hold each other's hands and fill their hearts with truth
You made up your mind so do as divined oh oh
Put on your armour ragged after fights
Hold up your sword you're leaving the light
And make yourself ready for the lords of the dark
They'll watch your way so be cautious quiet and hark
You hear them whispering in the crowns of the trees
You're whirling 'round but your eyes don't agree
Will o the wisps misguiding your path
You can't throw a curse without takin' their wrath
Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
Or all us people forget what we've been
Our only hope's your victory kill that Satan who won't let us be
Our only hope's your victory kill that Satan who won't let us be kill
You're the keeper of the seven keys that lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
You can feel cold sweat runnin' down your neck
And the dwarfs of falseness throw mud at your back
Guided by spells from the old seer's hands
You're suffering pain only steel can stand
Stay well on your way and follow the sign
Fulfill your own promise and do what's divined
The seven seas are far away placed in the valley of dust heat and sway
The seven seas are far away placed in the valley of dust heat and sway
You're the keeper of the seven keys that lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
You're the keeper of the seven keys that lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
Wouldn't it be nice to plunder with your eyes
Whatever there's for you to see is yours to be
Let me be there just tell me you don't care
Just say you pay me after life however high the price
I know your secrets I know it all
I know your secrets I see them hidden without light
I am your sickness biting you right behind your lies
Don't try to kill me I cannot die I guess you know
You and I will be heaven above and hell below brother release me
Father conceive me brother believe me perceive me
Time will be a turnin' wheel we show or retard
Time will be a joy time we will enjoy
Say you want to live forever mindless one day say you will obey
And I I will show I will show I will show your Reich of gold
And I will show I will show I will show you friend and foe
Wouldn't it be nice to reign and to decide
Whatever there's attracting you will give its due to you
Let me be there just say you want to share
A power no one will withstand just be my human hand
I know your secrets I know it all
I will show I will show I will show your Reich of gold
And I will show I will show I will show you friend and foe
Aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah
Don't believe us or deceive us no illusions executions
Alienation elimination chaos no exoneration
No believers all deceivers no illusions executions
Alienation elimination chaos no exoneration
No believers all deceivers no illusions executions
We are king for a thousand years we are king of a million tears
We're the ones who bring desire binding their greed and fears
We are king of fallen men we are keepers of the damned
Turning hope into obsession we are the king
We are the king for a thousand years
