I run high and low I'm fallen to pieces
Why must I die one more time if I try
Way down I pray but the skies turn to grey
How long lived I waiting
How long lived I waiting how long can I vie
I run high and low I'm fallen to pieces
My heart cried for you I'm fallen to pieces ooh
Say do you see you're just playing with me
Way down I flee from your spell and appeal
No more I'll be waiting
No more I'll be waiting no longer I'll vie
I run high and low I'm fallen to pieces
My heart cried for you I'm fallen to pieces
How long can I vie
I run high and low I'm fallen to pieces
My heart cried for you I'm fallen to pieces
I died times ago I'm fallen to pieces
Now I rise alone I'm fallen to pieces
Fallen to pieces fallen to pieces
