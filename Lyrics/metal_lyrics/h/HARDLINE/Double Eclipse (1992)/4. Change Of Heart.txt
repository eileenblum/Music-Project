I can feel the time is slipping
And there is nothing I can do to get through to you
Night after night, fight after fight
Is every inch of hope gone, or is it hiding in you
Through the laughter there's always been pain
There's only heartache and no one's to blame

[Refrain:]
I feel the change of heart
Burning inside me
It tears us apart
I feel the change of heart
Not a word that you can say
Could change yesterday

Sometimes words don't come out easy
Though we try and try again, the hurt never ends
Maybe we'll learn to love tomorrow
It's my heart I've got to follow more faithfully
I can't stay another day
I've been living a lie in hope
And I'm praying there's a way

[Refrain]

You know we have tried
I have nothing to hide
There's no you and I
Yeah, stop talking about love

You're everything I wanted
You're everything that I need

[Refrain]
