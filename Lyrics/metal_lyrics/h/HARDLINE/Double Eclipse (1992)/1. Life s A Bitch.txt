Here comes daddy with the strap again
Toward my backside with the buckle end
Sing it, yeah, yeah, yeah... Life's a bitch

He said "I'll teach you something about the back of my hand
School can't teach you how to fight like a man"
Sing it, yeah, yeah, yeah... Life's a bitch

I can hear myself screaming out the backdoor, yeah
And I'm numb from the healing, I can't take no more
I can't take no more

[Refrain:]
Poor man poor, rich man rich
Hang on baby, cause life's a bitch

My old man waits up, it's a quarter to three
Smells my breath as he's talking to me
Sing it, yeah, yeah, yeah... Life's a bitch

In comes mama with her golden rules
Sayin' me and the boys are just dreamin' fools
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I catch myself dreaming of the wild side, yeah
And life's wheels are spinning, gonna be one bumpy ride
Well oh yeah

[Refrain]

One step up
Two in the ditch
Hang on baby, cause life's a bitch
