Living every moment holding on to a dream
Staring at an empty page will it come to me
And I wonder will the light ever shine on me
If it's a mountain I must climb then that's the way it must be

Day after day like a lifetime away I keep holding on
And night after night out of reach, out of sight from it all
Day after day I won't walk away from this dream of mine
It's in The Hands of Time

Living every moment with a dream burning bright
Never stop reaching when the dream shines its light
Well I take it for granted when the trying's all said and done
Does the pain of remember fade when dreams are won

Day after day fight the storm's shade of gray and keep holding on
Night after night let hope be your light on your way
Day after day I won't walk away from this dream of mine
It's in The Hands of Time

Day after day like a lifetime away keep holding on
Night after night let hope be your light on your way
Day after day I won't walk away from this dream of mine
It's in The Hands of Time
