[Japanese Import]

I need to reach out and make you understand
I`m just a lonely heart in the palm of your hand
Can you feel it baby you take my breath away
Each night I hold you girl the world has no time
Is love a chance of fate, is my heart on the line?
I was a blind man and now you`re all that I see

[Bridge]
Well, I`ve been waiting for you All of my life
This feeling inside is too strong to fight
One look in your eyes and I know it`s a fact
This time it`s forever there`s no turning back

[Refrain]
When love leads the way two hearts never stray
We`re one night and day When love baby when love leads the way

I feel you tremble with every touch of your hand
You want to run away well run if you can from this feeling but you won`t get very far

[Bridge]
`Cause baby tonight This love that we found
Will take us to heaven We`ll never come down

[Refrain]
When love leads the way two hearts never stray
We`re one night and day When love baby when love leads the way

[Bridge]

Ooh if we follow our hearts day after dayOur love will know the way

[Refrain]

Ooh woo when love leads the way (When love leads the way)
Two hearts never stray (Two hearts never stray)
We`re one night and day (We`re one night and day)
When love leads the way

When love leads the way two hearts never stray
We`re one night and dayWhen love baby when love leads the way

When love leads the way two hearts never stray
We`re one night and dayWhen love baby when love leads the way
