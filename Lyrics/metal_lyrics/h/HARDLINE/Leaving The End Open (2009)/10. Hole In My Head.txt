I know what you're going through
I see myself the same as you
And I don't care about the things I do
I know what you keep inside
Try to fight it try to let it ride
But it seems to slip out before ya catch your tongue
Too late the damage's done
Try to fight it try to let it ride but it seemed to slip out
before I caught my tongue
Too late the damage done
Never mind what I said
I'm alive with a hole in my head
Never mind who I am
I'll survive with a hole in my head
Didn't mean it didn't even try
One word two words swallowed a fly
Got a stomach ache heartburn and don't know why
Should I throw up or should I let it be
Cleanse myself of you and me
Keep my damn mouth shut and just let it be
To late you're sick of me
I cleanse myself of you and keep my damn mouth shut
and just let it be
Too late I'm sick of me
Never mind what I said
I'm alive with a hole in my head
Never mind who I am
I'll survive with a hole in my head
And if try to find my way to light
I'm clinging I'm a parasite
I'm alive with a hole in my head
And if I drain the words right out of me
I said it wrong I'll strangle me
I'll survive with a hole in my head
