It's all the same but the better part
Standing in the dark and you know
You know that its better when I'm standing in solitude
Standing here for you
All alone you know that I'm here for you
You know that I'm here for you
Sometimes it's all that I want to do
Is to do it for you, so lets go, go on
It's the strangest things
That make me want to scream at every word
Who doesn't believe in what we have
And on and on and on and on
Why'd you have to do this you had to leave this
Your stupid reasons why you're not around
Cut me to pieces cause I don't need this
And all I need is what I had before this
When I look at you in photographs
I want this to last
And you know you know that I'm
Always on the side that is wanting you
Always rooting for you and you know
You know that I'm here for you
This time I think that I need a break taking this away
All alone, alone
It's the strangest things
that make me want to scream at every word
Who doesn't believe in what we have
And on and on and on and on
It's another case of a waste of time
Turn your head away and I'll take what's mine
Doesn't matter what you say you're a waste of time
