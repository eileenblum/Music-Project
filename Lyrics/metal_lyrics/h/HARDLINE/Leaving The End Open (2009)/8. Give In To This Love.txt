Your skin jeans that you wear so tight
Make you feel pretty good tonight
Romance, headlights
Yeah we're heading to the streets alright
Funny games that you like to play
Never seem that funny to me
Let's go, let's ride
We do this all the time
And I will never leave
The two of us will never be this way again
And I am screaming out for a chance
To bring this back to where we started from
To give into, to give into this love
And fall in love again
This is what I mean this is what I mean to say alright
You look good but you look so bad
Your makeup makes you look so sad
Sunglasses, car crashes
We're living on the wild side
This is what I mean to give in to this love
A new perspective of
I want to light this love on fire
