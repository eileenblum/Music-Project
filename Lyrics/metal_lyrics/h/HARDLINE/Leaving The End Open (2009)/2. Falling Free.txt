Tonight I'm letting go
Tonight I'm falling free
And I can't wait
For weight to fall from me
The clear blue sky can't stay the same;
Sometimes we need the wind and rain
I saw you shut your eyes
Don't be afraid
And I'm here to break you out
I'll take the wheel-
You don't have to drive
Just disconnect yourself
Open your eyes

[Chorus:]
Don't stop for a second
Let the weather change
The sun's shining right behind the hurricane
Now that we're spinning in the storm
Together, not alone
The rain falls down on the windshield all around you
Storm surrounds you
You can't break the chain if you never make a sound
But now I've found you
And I'm here to break you out
I'll take the wheel you don't have to drive
Just disconnect yourself
Open your eyes
Let's keep the windows down
And ride the open road
Nothing we run into the way
Can touch the things that we know
And now that we've left the worst of the storm
We're flying faster than we ever thought we could
We're free at last
So take a breath and let's take a ride
Tear down the walls you hide behind
Just disconnect yourself
And open your eyes
Breathe in, you're breathing out with me
Step into the storm
