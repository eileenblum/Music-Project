I want you to know that I will always fight
I will continue to wonder
And I can hear you when you can't see the light
Shadow in the night shadow in the night
So you know where I've been turn it over again
What comes next can we wonder
I want you to know that I will always fight
Shadow in the night shadow in the night
Can we start again
Your ship still isn't sinking
And the stars are out the moon is full
Can we start again
And how hard am I thinking
Can the time still pass without a toll
I want you to know we can still make this right
The worst is finally over
So don't turn around now the past's out of sight
Shadow in the night shadow in the night
Will you stay by my side
We can have all the time in the world if you just let me
hold you
I want you to know we can still make this right
Shadow in the night shadow in the night
And every time your broken spirit screams
Can't you run away can't you run away
I'll find my way into your dreams
Don't you run away don't you run way
