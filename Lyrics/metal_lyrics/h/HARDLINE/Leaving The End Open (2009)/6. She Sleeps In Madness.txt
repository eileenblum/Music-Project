Swallow up the future,
Thick with confidence
Don't break a sweat
To find a reason
When reason won't make sense
In black and white (Inside)
Silence all the phantoms
Banging on the drums
I feel the change inside (Inside)
You'll feel the fire melt the wax away
While you're sleeping in the sun

[Chorus:]
It beats the fastest
When she sleeps in madness
Tearing out the sheets,
She dreams at night in black and white
Follow in the footsteps
Left behind by thoughts
That walked across the open ocean
Until her mind was lost
In black and white (Inside)
You'll feel the fire melt the wax away
While you're sleeping in the sun
The wax melts away
The fire burns inside your words
Tearing out the sheets,
She dreams at night in black and white
