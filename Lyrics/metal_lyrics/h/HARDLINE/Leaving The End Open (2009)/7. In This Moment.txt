Every day's like a miracle
As I stand in your grace
I'm weighed down by a ton of life
Yet this dream we still chase
And through love, mind, spirit find, all we can relate
And we look to find our peace of mind again and again
And all that I don't know, I'll make up in I love you so
And all you fear, I'll make up in this moment here
Every day's a new breath of life
Yet I'm gasping for you
Just want a simple stroll or a look outside
And a chance to feel the truth
I don't want to face a memory
Just want face you
And we look to find one minute of time
For hello and how are you?
And all that I don't know, I'll make up in I love you so
And all you fear, I'll make up in this moment here
