Oh I watch you scream
Then I watch you go
Then you realize you're all alone
Then you want me back
Yet I can't take that
And that's where were at but something seems so wrong

And the times we shared
When we walked around the world
with our fingers locked so we
Wouldn't let go
And the pieces of puzzles were spread all around
But we made it
Oh we made it

Maybe if we close our eyes and smile
All the good times will come back
We could go to anywhere we want
And forget about the aching past
And I don't want to leave this place again

I want to understand
Why it hurts so bad
But your all I have I can't let go
Your secret life
Comes alive at night
Your poison eyes look deep into my soul

And the times we shared
When we walked around the world
with our fingers locked so we
Wouldn't let go
And the pieces of puzzles were spread all around
But we made it
Oh we made it

Maybe if we close our eyes and smile
All the good times will come back
We could go to anywhere we want
And forget about the aching past
And I don't want to leave this place again

Until I open my eyes and see
