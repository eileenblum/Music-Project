I heard the voice of a stranger
Ringing out with a question in the undertone
I heard a voice call my name out loud
Caught me just when I thought I was alone
Can we really see the future?
Buried in the roots of seeds we sow?
All the twists and turns they try to make me crazy
Time to break the code
I can see a better future
Hiding in the things that we don't know
The unknown will never break me
I stared into the horizon
Reaching out to the place I wanted to belong
I watched the sky and for once I felt invincible
The stranger's voice ringing in my ears was like a song
Can we really see the future?
Buried in the roots of seeds we sow?
All the twists and turns they try to make me crazy
Time to break the code
I can see a better future
Hiding in the things that we don't know
The unknown will never break me
Finally there - Imagine everything I have -
And all the past will see - Fading behind us -
So look forward now - open your eyes and take
It in - Imagine Everything - straight ahead
