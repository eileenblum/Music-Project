All the lights were turning on
And you were mine
And all the pain was gone
Remember the night
Far away so far away from home
Together there so many years ago
The last time that night
We made believe that nothing mattered
Closed our eyes
Walked to the cliff and took a dive
Like running from a murder
I remember the last time that we touched
Wishing there'd be another night so much
Bittersweet feeling inside
My body knew the truth it didn't matter
I still was with you...
Falling fast so I kept the time behind my back
It cut through like a knife
We tried to survive
On the run from what we had to face
Now we're separated by a fall from grace
Love buried alive
We made believe that nothing mattered
Closed our eyes
A flash of bursting memory
A patient killer watching me
