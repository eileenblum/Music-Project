Somewhere out of nowhere comes a feeling hard to explain
When love lights your life you just ain't the same
Crazy yeah maybe but you're everything I know
Your eyes they told me so

Reach out and hold me now
And say I'll be all right
I need you in my world
Need you by my side

[Refrain:]
Only a night
When the moon lights the sky
Only a night with you

Somewhere out of nowhere comes a feeling shared by two
When fate shines it's light girl it's bright on you

If I could reach out and hold you now
And say you'll be all right
I need you in my world
Need you by my side

[Refrain]

Somewhere out of nowhere comes a feeling hard to explain
When love lights your life
