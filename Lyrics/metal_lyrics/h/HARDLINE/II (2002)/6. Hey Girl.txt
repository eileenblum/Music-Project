Hey girl what are you tryin' to do
You've been staring at yourself in the mirror for an hour or two
Hey girl who are ya tryin' to be
Are you painting yourself a picture of you and me

No nobody knows you like I do
Like I do

[Refrain:]
And you run run run
From the one you love
And you run run run
From the world we own

Hey girl what are we supposed to do
Are you leaving it up to the heavens for guiding you
Hey girl don't be surprised if one day
You take another look in that mirror
And regret your ways

No nobody knows you like I do
Like I do

[Refrain]
