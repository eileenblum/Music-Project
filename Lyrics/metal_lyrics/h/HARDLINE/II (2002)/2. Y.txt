Feel the wonder, in the palm of my hand
Maybe all that I know
Hear the laughter, of truth as it tries
Maybe all that I show
Reaching out to sympathize the simple words
The shadowed lies are walking in my way happens every day
A fevered tone of much surprise taken back I realize
That all I ever needed was you

[Refrain:]
Tell me Y can't it just be
What's this Y that's burning in me
Tell me Y can't I believe
That this Y is just you and me

Feel the wonder walking my way
Maybe all that I know
I paint a picture of you in my life
And you're all that I know

Reaching out to compromise those simple words
That seem to hide and never shows the face and bitter to the taste
A fevered tone of harmonize taken back I realize that all I ever needed
All I ever needed...

[Refrain]

All I ever need all I need
The view in my eyes I'd fly away and never let you go
You on my mind I can face the fate
The fate I hoped I'd find... in you
