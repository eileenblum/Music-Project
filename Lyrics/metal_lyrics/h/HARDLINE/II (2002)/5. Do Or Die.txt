Everybody's thinking something
Everybody thinks what is right is wrong
I can't take it another minute
I won't make it I'm tired of being strong
See you look out from the inside

[Refrain:]
Feeling do or die
Someone give me just a reason why we
Do or die
Taking cover on the streets at night
Feeling feeling do or die

Can you save me
Can you praise me
Can you see me under glowing light
I can't take it another minute
I won't fake it I'm not strong to fight
Can you face me from the outside

[Refrain]
