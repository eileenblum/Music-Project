Ice cold touching the dead life living in nowhere
Nobody knows how gone
My mind's buried in six feet weight of the world's
Been dragging me down too long
Can't explain the pain that eats away the way I want to be
Drowning in a pool of flesh and blood you ask too much of me
Can't feel a thing but the hole in the wall

[Refrain:]
Paralyzed... nothing moves me
Set in stone for a thousand days
And though I lie
I know I've got a reason for you
Paralyzed...

Shock me into daylight leading the stone blind
Turning my eyes away
From too much suffering hey life's guilty as sin
But only myself to blame
Try and try but I can't break the silence leave it all unsaid
My life leads to nowhere far away from all that's in my head
What did I do... did I do it again

[Refrain]

Go go on ahead
I'm just gonna crawl to you my only friend... denial
Time and time again I relive the fall
Trapped within I'm drowning in the bleeding of my heart

Can't feel a thing but the hole in the wall

[Refrain]
