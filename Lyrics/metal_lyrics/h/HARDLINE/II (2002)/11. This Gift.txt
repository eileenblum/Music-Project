Many times I remember
Wondering where that You might be
I know You're looking down upon us
I felt I heard You answer me
You gave your life for me
Lord I try
To give to You the best that I can be

All the love I feel is due
Now I sing this gift for You

When I'm weak You carry me
Lord forgive us when we falter
Help to heal the wrong in me
You gave your life to me
Lord I try
To give to You the best that I can be

All the love I feel is due
Now I sing this gift for You

Many times I remember
Wondering where that You might be
Is the rain Your falling teardrops
Pouring down upon me
Now I sing this gift for You
