Remember when our love was strong
Through the toughest times nothing could go wrong
Now I'm gone and the wheels turn on and on
In the hopes of a dream that came from a song
But nothing in this world makes me feel like you do
No matter what life could bring me
Let it bring me right back to you

[Refrain:]
And I won't let you face the night alone
Easy come never easy go
I won't let you face the night alone
I'm coming back

I'll never forget that look in your eyes
Standing on your doorstep I was home for good tonight
As time slipped away the boys they played on
Their dreams turned to gold that came from a song
But nothing in this world means more to me than you
No matter what life could of bought me
It brought me right back to you

[Refrain]
