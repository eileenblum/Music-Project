Ain't got much to say
Feel like I'm your prey
And you walk away from me again
Take a bite of me taste inside of me
Spitting out the bitter life you're in
And you wonder why but somehow you will try
And forget the pain of yesterday
But never will you see everything in me
All I ever wanted was to be with you
And I try to find my way
It's all right you're blinded
That's just the way it is

Can't you see I fear
Everything that's near
Crawling thru the everything I am
So you want to be half inside of me
Telling me I'm all that you once were
And you wonder why but somehow you will try
And forget the pain of yesterday
But no you'll never see
All I ever wanted was to be with you
Try to find my way
It's all right

[Refrain:]
It's just the way it is
The way it goes
What no one sees
No one knows

I never wanted you to make it all up to me
I just wanted you to find it yourself and see
I just made it so it was plain for you and me
I just want you to find it

[Refrain]
