Hello I've come to follow
I'll crawl into your web
It's your words I'll hear and swallow
It's your voice I'll need and beg
There's always always ways you say

[Refrain:]
But you hold me down
I didn't see it coming
Losing ground
Feel it all around you
Hold me down
Every way I turn it's
Holding me down
Hold me down
Ease it in the morning
Losing ground
Can't you hear I'm falling
Hold me down
Every way I turn you
Hold me down

Hello I've come to follow
I'll slip inside time
I need your voice inside me
I fear you now you're mine
There's always always ways you say

[Refrain]

What you trying to do to me
What you trying to make me feel

Can you feel...
