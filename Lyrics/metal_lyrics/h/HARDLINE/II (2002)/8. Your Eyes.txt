Don't walk away
I didn't mean to put you through it
It's just my way
The only way that I can say it
Never again
Will I ever turn to stone
Sometimes words are better left alone
Look what you started
Never again

[Refrain:]
Your eyes
I'm looking through it all with your eyes
Your eyes
I'm looking at the world with your eyes

If I could take
And make it all just start again
Just my way
The only way that I could make it
Never again
Will I ever leave you alone
Sometimes words are better when they're known
Look what you started
Never again

[Refrain]
