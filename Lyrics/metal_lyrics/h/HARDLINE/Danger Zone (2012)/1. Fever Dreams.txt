The moon donât shine and I donât see my road again
Whereâs the light at the end where is my life lost
An ancient call, darkness fall around me
Spirals and fire, youâd put me higher again.

Where am I now? What should I see beyond?
No shining star to light my way home

[Chorus:]
Stone cold, heart of gold, set me free
Dark night, poison bite, fever dreams
DÃ©jÃ  vu I canât see trough
Leave me alone
A later dawn, brightness gone
Fever dreams

No edge on this town, only despair around
No candle to burn, where should I turn?
The day is gone and like a swan I sing my last song
Devilâs daughter awaiting your slaughter, youâre lost

Where am I now? What should I see beyond?
No shining star to light my way home

[Chorus:]
Stone cold, heart of gold, set me free
Dark night, poison bite, fever dreams
DÃ©jÃ  vu I canât see trough
Leave me alone
A later dawn, brightness gone
Fever dreams
