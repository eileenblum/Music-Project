No, we canât lie and pretend that we love just like before
And no, we wonât cry in the end thereâs no tears left anymore
Iâm leaving home, gonna walk away
But before I go, I just wanna say
One thing that I know

Youâre gonna be, stronger than me
I know that youâre bleeding, I know youâre in pain
But when everything is over, it wonât feel the same
Youâre gonna be stronger, stronger than me

No, I wonât try to believe we can make it follow through
And on, donât ask why I must leave, I canât take this not from you
Yeah, youâre on your own, but youâll find a way
Yeah, come high or low, youâll be okay
Thereâs one thing that I know

Youâre gonna be, stronger than me
I know that youâre bleeding, I know youâre in pain
But when everything is over, it wonât feel the same
Youâre gonna be stronger, stronger than me

Stronger than me
I know that youâre bleeding, I know youâre in pain
But when everything is over, it wonât feel the same
Youâre gonna be stronger, stronger than me

Youâre gonna be nothing left for me to say
In the end youâre gonna beâ¦

Youâre gonna be, stronger than meâ¦

Youâre gonna be, stronger than me
I know that youâre bleeding, I know youâre in pain
But when everything is over, it wonât feel the same
Youâre gonna be stronger, stronger than me

Stronger than me
I know that youâre bleeding, I know youâre in pain
But when everything is over, it wonât feel the same
Youâre gonna be stronger, stronger than me

Stronger than me
I know that youâre bleeding, I know youâre in pain
But when everything is over, it wonât feel the same
Youâre gonna be stronger, youâre gonna be stronger than me
