(I don't wanna break away)

You say I'm a junkie for your love, but this is a different story
I've got this craving in my heart
You took away a piece of me and left me momentum already
I should've known right from the start

(Don't know what to do, don't know what to say
Don't know where to go now)

I don't wanna break away, I don't wanna fade away
Please don't you deny me
I don't wanna break away, I don't wanna fade away
Don't try to deny me, I don't wanna break away

You said we were never meant to be, how come I just can't say never?
I need your fix, I can't let go
I need your love inside veins and now it's like Heaven's falling
I crave that fix, I can't let go

(Don't know what to do, don't know what to say
Don't know where to go now)

I don't wanna break away, I don't wanna fade away
So please don't you deny me
I don't wanna break away, I don't wanna fade away
Don't try to deny me, I don't wanna break away

(Don't know what to do, don't know what to say
Don't know where to go now)
Baby, can you hear me calling?
(Don't know what to do, don't know what to say
Don't know where to go now)
Can you hear me calling?

When you never know

I don't wanna break away, I don't wanna fade away
So please don't you deny me
I don't wanna break away, I don't wanna fade away
Don't try to deny me, I don't wanna break away
