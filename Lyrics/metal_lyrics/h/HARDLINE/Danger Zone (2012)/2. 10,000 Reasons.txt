Woman, I know
It's just a game we're playing in my mind
It's just a game we're playing in my soul
I should be running away I know
Fires still burning in my heart
Fires still burning bright

I got ten thousand reasons to go
You're destroying my heart but I still can't let go
I got ten thousand reasons but it seems like I need one more (one more)
One more (one more)
I can't let go
Leave you alone

Holding onto you
Just makes me look a fool
Woman, I know
I've got your poison running through my veins
My heart is craving you again and again
I should be running away I know
I can't let you go no matter how I try
Fire is burning right

I got ten thousand reasons to go
You're destroying my heart but I still can't let go...
