Iâve waited all of my life for you
I would have waited forever
Now it all seems clear now that you are here
That we could make it together

I know the heart is a restless thing
We bear the scars of our sorrows
With the pride that was lost as our passions were crossed
Gives us hope for tomorrow

And weâve been through it all
Weâve been hurt before but weâve come too far to close that doorâ¦

Itâs too late to go back through the years
Itâs too late to cry all the tears
I know its late baby â but thereâs still time for us
Cause itâs never too late for loveâ¦

I had a vision of happiness
But I guess it was all an illusion
I lived alone in a cold fortress
Behind a wall of confusion

Now I see I was wrong not to swallow my pride
And I knew all along I was wasting time

Itâs too late to go back through the years
Itâs too late to cry all the tears
I know its late baby â but thereâs still time for us
Cause itâs never too late for loveâ¦

Thereâs only so much time â so much life to live, baby
Weâve got so much left to give and itâs never too late

Weâve been through it all â weâve been hurt before
But weâve come too far to close, to close that door

Itâs too late to go back through the years
Itâs too late to cry all the tears
I know its late baby â but thereâs still time for us
Cause itâs never too late for loveâ¦

Itâs too late to go back through the years
Itâs too late to cry all the tears
I know its late baby â but thereâs still time for us
Never too late, never too late for love

(Itâs never, never, never too late)
Never too late
(Itâs never, never, never too late)
Never too late for loveâ¦
