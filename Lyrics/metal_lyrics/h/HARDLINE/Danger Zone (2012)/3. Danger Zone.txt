I'm back in the ring
I just came to win
See the darkness all around
Your new home that I found

Every day and every night
No end in sight
And I waited for you
Now what should I do

I'm on my way
Revenge, that's all I can say
I'm back on the trip
Oh yeah
I'm ready, are you too

Living in the dark, borderline
I am pulling through
Acting like a shark
I'm seeking you
In the danger zone

Hold back your tears
You've been lied
Sadness and peace
Don't climb any mountains...
