Show me your love
Whoah yeah, whoah
There is nothing do to be your man
There is nothing I wouldn't fight in the name of love
And girl, I'd look for you from town to town
Nobody's stopping me in search of gold

Lady I'm ready, I'm tough and steady
I feel like a hunter; are you feeling my heart girl?

Show me, show me your love
Show me what you have inside, what you have for me
Show me, show me your love

There's a place you wanna go, that's all right for me
You're the one who's keeping me high, it ain't so easy
Trying to stay away, while you tell me to stay
I'm a man made of flesh and blood, who do you think I am?

Lady I'm ready, I'm tough and steady
I feel like a hunter; are you feeling my heart girl?

Show me, show me your love
Show me what you have inside, what you have for me
Show me, show me your love
Tell me I'm the only one that's right for you
Show me your love

Show me, show me your love
Show me what you have inside, what you have for me
Show me, show me your love
Tell me I'm the only one that's right for you
Show me your love

Show me, show me your love
(Don't hide, don't your eye)
Tell me I'm the only that's right for you
Show me your love
