If you wanna reach my heart
If you wanna touch my soul
Remember my girl
Thereâs only one word I know

If you wanna walk with me
And find our inner world to see
To see who we are, to live what we feel

And we can hold on, hold on to your love
Shine on, shine on me
Hold on, hold on to your love and stay
Stay with me

Stay, donât go away
Baby I know how it feels to be desperate and lonely
Stay, donât go away
I longed for your touch please stay with me

If you wanna lay by my side
If you wanna hold your arms around me
Remember my girl
Thereâs only a four letter word

If you wanna see the truth
The truth behind my eyes is easy to see
To see who we can be and live for what we feel

Oh! Hold on, hold on to your love
Shine on, shine on me
Hold on, hold on to your love and stay
Stay with me

Stay, donât go away
Baby I know how it feels to be desperate and lonely
Stay, donât go away
I longed for your touch please stay with me

Close your eyes just to remember
The dreams we had and I will surrender
Stay with me and never walk away

Stay, donât go away
Baby I know how it feels to be desperate and lonely
Stay, donât go away
I longed for your touch please stay with me

All right !

Stay, donât go away
Baby I know how it feels to be desperate and lonely, oh yeah !
Stay, donât go away
I longed for your touch please stay with me
