Keeping our promises alive
What am I supposed to do?
Watching the shadows far behind
Always you out of the blue

Are we strong?
Are we strong enough to be just one?
Donât we stop?
Donât we stop again? We need each other

Never surrender, try to remember
Our days of Avalon
Telling our story, do you feel our glory?
Thereâs a turning back, I canât go on

Youâre the only one
The only one Iâve ever loved
Our sacred hearts
Will keep our love alive and strong
The only one
The only one Iâve ever loved
Youâre my sacred one
The only one who holds my heart

Sharing our lives hand in hand
Who am I supposed to pray?
Living our dreams of hope and love
Tell me what could I do

Are we strong?
Are we strong enough to be just one?
Donât we know?
Donât we know again? We need each other

Never surrender, try to remember
Our days of Avalon
Telling our story, do you feel our glory?
Thereâs a turning back, I canât go on

Youâre the only one
The only one Iâve ever loved
Our sacred hearts
Will keep our love alive and strong
The only one
The only one Iâve ever loved
Youâre my sacred one
The only one who holds my heart

Donât turn your back to me, another day is passing by
I need your love
Oh yeah!
Hold me in your arms
Youâre the only one I ever loved

Never surrender, try to remember
Our days of Avalon
Telling our story, do you feel our glory?
Thereâs a turning back, I canât go on

Youâre the only one
The only one Iâve ever loved
Our sacred hearts
Will keep our love alive and strong
The only one
The only one Iâve ever loved
Youâre my sacred one
The only one who holds my heart

Youâre the only one
The only one Iâve ever loved
Our sacred hearts
Will keep our love alive and strong
The only one
The only one Iâve ever loved
The only oneâ¦
