Here's what I want
Here's what we've got
Thunder and lightning
Chain reaction
That's what I'd like

I walk in the shadow of distant hopes
I still don't know what I'm looking for
Who was the one that took it all?

I dream of a place that I'd call home
And be the shelter from the storm
Who was the one that burned it all?

Hold on to survive
Hold on
With the ones in control

Here's what I want
Here's what we've got
Thunder and lightning
A chain reaction
That's what I'd like

We were human, what are we now?
Where's our vision? Where's our soul?
Who was the one that changed us all?

Hold on to survive
Hold on
With the ones in control

Here's what I want
Here's what we've got
Thunder and lightning
A chain reaction
That's what I'd like

Here's what I want
Here's what we've got
Thunder and lightning
Dreams and passion
That's what I'd like

(Change your mind )
That's what I'd like
That's what I'd like
(Change your mind)
Lots of ways to go
Where's our gold?
Where's our heaven?

Here's what I want
Here's what we've got
Thunder and lightning
A chain reaction
That's what I'd like

Here's what I want
Here's what we've got
Thunder and lightning
Dreams and passion
That's what I'd like

Here's what I want
Here's what we've got
Thunder and lightning
A chain reaction
That's what I'd like
