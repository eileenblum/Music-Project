Sometimes we feel like we're lost and alone
When words come out
In a way it was not meant to be

But baby believe it
In spite of it all, I still love you
I still love you
But right from the start
It was always you

Babe, please have faith in me
Don't give up
Don't let us down (Don't let us down)
Babe, please have faith in me
I just need a little more time
Don't give up

Lets the vow we made long ago
No matter what
I am trying to keep my word

But baby believe it
In spite of it all, I still love you
I still love you
But right from the start
It was always you !!

Babe, please have faith in me
Don't give up
Don't let us down (don't let us down)
Babe, please have faith in me
I just need a little more time
Don't give up
