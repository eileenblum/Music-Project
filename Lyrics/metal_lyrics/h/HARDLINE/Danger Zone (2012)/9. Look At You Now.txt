When everything is said and done
When truth will arise
When you have nowhere left to run
Where will you hide

All of this time you've been living
Your life like a victim
When really it's you who's been
Pulling the strings from a distance

But look at you now
You're trapped in a lie
With a million scars
That you are trying to hide
And I think to myself
You are broken too soon

I know
You know
Never gonna make it.

When you have no one left to blame
For what you have done
Will you be strong enough to face
What you've become

You had a chance to make up
For the past in a second...
But you had to throw that away

But look at you now
You're trapped in a lie
With a million scars
That you are trying to hide
And I think to myself
You are broken too soon

I know
You know
Never gonna make it.

I am letting you go now
While there is time
God know I tried to make it right
And I say a prayer for you tonight

I say a prayer...
Yeah!
I say a prayer...
Oh yeah!

But look at you now
You're trapped in a lie
With a million scars
That you are trying to hide
And I think to myself
You are broken too soon

I know
You know

But look at you now
You're trapped in a lie
With a million scars
That you are trying to hide
And I think to myself
You are broken too soon

I know
You know
Never gonna make it...

Through you're never gonna make it through
And that is why I pray for you
I guess you learned your lesson well

I know
You know
Never gonna make it...

I know
You know
Never gonna make it...
