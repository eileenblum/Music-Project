Raping..The Human Herds 
Making..A Flesh Path Of Them 

Sacrifing Whores To The Worm Gods 
Closing Pale Walls Around Your Own Son 

Sleeping..In A Nightmarish World 
Seeking..a Nonexistant Fall 

Satisfying Whores On The Altar Of God 
Waiting Till He Falls Into The Mouth Of Old 

Imaginary Often Tied To Rotten Beliefs 
Craft And Darkness Given To Mental Relief 
Blasphemy Against The Rhymed Church 
Burn In Hell And Pist The Blind Priest 

The Coming plague In The Ecstasies Of Lies 
Only Dead Is What Is Left Behind 
The Black Plague In The Ecstasies Of Mind 
In The Eternal Of The Fallen Of Life..
