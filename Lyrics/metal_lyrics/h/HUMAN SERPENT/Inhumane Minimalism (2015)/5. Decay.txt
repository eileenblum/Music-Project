Grey Rotting Skin, Of Human Remains
Chants in hopeless Seeds, In Total Oblivion

just the way millions do, infants and old men have no meaning. forever... 
What a way to perish, What a way to fade
If there is nothing have no Light forever... 

nothing is too extreme in every form of religion
They only fall I am your suicide

Grown the poison of the Earth. Praise The Elite of Death
There's a war inside my head, sadness (flows) in my flesh
