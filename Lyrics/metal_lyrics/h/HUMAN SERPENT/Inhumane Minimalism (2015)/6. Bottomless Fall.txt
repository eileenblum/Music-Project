Darkness reigns. Worms crawl through in veins.
Regret to Grace (and) remain alone in the inner fall

through the eyes of the blind may their years be nothing inside.
Through the ears of the deaf for everyone that share the Death
I am everything or I am nothing.?
words of the gospel of wrath to fade the stars, To devour the sun

Over the most glorious failure as god
for perdition to be reborn nameless void is my world
Mental illness returns in unity of Darkness and Light
From the Suicidal screams of the stillborn Child

For I was, For I am now, I shall be Nothing forever
