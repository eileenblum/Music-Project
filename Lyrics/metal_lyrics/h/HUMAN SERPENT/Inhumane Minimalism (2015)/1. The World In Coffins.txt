The feelings as cold, infected razors carving your flesh.
As you shove poison in veins for your inner death

in this world of Misanthropy
Fuck Humanity
Hundreds (of) masses of misery
Sodomized the (whore) reality
I hate every kind of God
Religion, followed by sheeps or not?
I am a Nihilist inside you
This is life? miserable fool

Fornication, Drugs, Trafficking, Cancerous diseases
 this is you deserve in your fucking world!

This is the beginning of the end 
Mother Nature decomposes tones of flesh
world in which no one breathes
respect to the planet Earth 
I hate every kind of God
Religion, followed by sheeps or not?
I am a Nihilist inside you
This is life? miserable fool

I Hate you and I piss your graves - I was never part of you
I Hate you and I spit your face - for all my pain and hate
I Hate you and I abhor your faith - for all lies in my life
I Hate you and I enrich your pain - lifeless pathetic being... 

All the voices shall sing the grief of annihilation
and the earth shall hear the voice of the Fallen of salvation
All Bodies shall bathe in the Vomit of creation
the lust of the living god who creates the Lamentations
