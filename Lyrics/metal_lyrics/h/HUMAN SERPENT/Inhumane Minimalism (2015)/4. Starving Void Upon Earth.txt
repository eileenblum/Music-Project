The few rule this earth.
Man and Lethargy in unison 
in Nothing (inspired) in one God
Starving Void Upon Earth.The few rule this earth.
All forms of creatures of this rotten world 
dissolve in oblivion

The planet shakes in despair
a nothing In Life...A lie for The Living
existential ground in happiness 
a nothing life in a fake existence
