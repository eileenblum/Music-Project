Who will be playing the fool?
No matter what happens
We have no choice but to
Charge right on through
Align the planets, ready senses
For a gravitational disturbance
They it's unstable
The first time the planets line up
Future or fable?
I guess it's anyone's luck
I can just see it
Class infrastructure collapse
The Earth in a shambles
Rebuild, rename and relapse
So what's your prediction?
Total annihilation?
Or just another date that fades away
The fear factor could almost make you
Pull the plug yourself
Well what would it take for you?
You can't get compliant with solar system demands
The punishing pulling between heavenly hands
Yeah, I can just see it
Reduced to a primitive state
Horrific, desolate wasteland or beautiful clean slate?
The fear factor could almost make you
Pull the plug yourself
Well what would make you?
