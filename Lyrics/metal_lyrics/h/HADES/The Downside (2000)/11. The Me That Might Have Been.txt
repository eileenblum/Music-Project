Because I wonder what makes us tick
Why some are sane while some stay sick
I see the saint, I see the sin, I see the me that might have been
The struggling layman, the lazy lush
Boisterous bragging or modest hush
A suit and tie life, tied down in debt
Or penniless with no regrets
Content to stagnate or get ahead
Much time to rest when we are dead

Alter reality see that me that might have been
High on his luck or rotting in a coffin
Cacophonous sound of our diverse voices
Where would you be now
Had you made different choices?
