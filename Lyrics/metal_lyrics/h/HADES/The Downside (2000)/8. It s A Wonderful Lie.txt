Talking to myself suffices
Better than support devices
I do fine sans such connections
Never need their false protection
Emotion locked safely away
A calm, indifferent doubting display
People always let each other down
In false hope and trust they soon drown
I choose to believe in no one
It's a wonderful lie
Being my own best friend is helpful
Now that I am so distrustful
Isolated, I so hate it
It's a wonderful lie
And it's a pleasure to be living it with you
