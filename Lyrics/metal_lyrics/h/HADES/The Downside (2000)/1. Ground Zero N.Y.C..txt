Bones on the ground, all around, our ideas, our every sound
Wiped away in a heartbeat
Desolate Earth, draped in dearth, only memories of mirth
Devastation so complete
If someone nukes Manhattan
It won't matter what any of us dreamed
Hate U.S.A., devotee of a terrorist brigade
Hell bent religious mission
World wide awake from it's state of a non-event charade
DetoNation decision
Black market warheads smuggled everywhere
My delusional and paranoid care
There is for one potential future I pray
Then we'll ascend above the hatred of today
Make racism a forgotten word
Increase our brotherhood, the great human herd
The Northeast Coast-A silent nothing
Ground Zero NYC, dead center of suffering
Lives extinguished at a ruthless rate
Complete destruction doesn't segregate
A frigid forecast for a frightened flock
Mass murder multiplied by monsters who mock
