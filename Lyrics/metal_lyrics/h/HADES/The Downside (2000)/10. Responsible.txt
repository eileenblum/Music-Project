Sound the bells
Sounds like a death knell
For every child down one parent
It's hard enough to learn
Life's pure and realtime versions
Can't discern them from the virtual
Responsible, Be Responsible
It's cool to be the anti-norm
Ultimately we are all alone
Species-wide
Slippery slope slide
Down the hatch, sleep it off
Next day the world's the same
Our troubles right there
Where we threw them yesterday
