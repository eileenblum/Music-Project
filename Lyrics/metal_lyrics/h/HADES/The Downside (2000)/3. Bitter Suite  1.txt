Cause you've been drifting down that wrongful road again
Your favorite vice has got you hanging on its whim
But just look on the downside
Got no place left to go but up
Exposed from negative, fed up with life
Spit out the pain and stuff the hate inside
Energy, ever building
A polar static charge
It makes the obscure, small things
Seem overwhelmingly large
I am doubting, inner bouting
For a perspective you see
Pessimism? Optimism?
Number one works sweet for me
Exposed from negative, fed up with life
Spit out the pain and stuff the hate inside
Expect nothing and never be let down
The smile, simple inversion of the frown
