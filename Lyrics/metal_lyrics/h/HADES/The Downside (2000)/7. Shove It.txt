What great days lie just ahead
Starving youth, hopes dashed in dread
Such a cherished, sacred thing
Carelessly reproducing
Shove It - When you're bitchin' and your itchin' just to blame somebody else
Shove It - Live your lie until you die cause all you're loving is yourself
Shove It - In your face cause you're complacent and you're draggin' us down
Born into a world of pain
Born unloved, it's such a shame
Finished up before life starts
Broken home breed broken hearts
Right to life alone and scared
Learn to never learn to care
Family values laughed away
See morality decay
