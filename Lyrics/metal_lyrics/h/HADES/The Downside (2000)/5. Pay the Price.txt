Falsified, now laid out on a table
You told your lie and now you pay the price
Greed and lust are motivators
Never trust annihilators
Testified, and now you're six feet under
Your family, your friends all are suffering
Greed and lust, our motivators
Never trust the profit makers
Now you pay the price
