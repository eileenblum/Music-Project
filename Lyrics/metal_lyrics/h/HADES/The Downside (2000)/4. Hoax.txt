We get home and the remote is our best friend
The mind turns off, active thought meeting its end
The have no lives of our own, fictitious roles overgrown
Can't break the hold of the teledrama hoax
Programs just suck us all in, stuck in your head, wheels spin
Can't break away from the teledrama hoax
Are we so easily entranced?
The piper plays and we knowingly dance
So vapid and so hollow, exciting lives, all borrowed
Can't break the hold of the teledrama hoax
Ingrained in the modern day
Entrenched and scheduled to stay
Can't break away from the teledrama hoax
Change the channel to one of purpose
Break the spell of our ignorant curse
Dream of days when we all grow and interact
But the hoax is on and that's a fact
