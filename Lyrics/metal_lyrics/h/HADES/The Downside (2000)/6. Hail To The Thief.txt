I'm not gonna follow
Walk to the beat of your drum
May not be brilliant but I'm not exactly dumb
Not a hurry to align myself with the damned
I won't get buried in their red tape ridden plans
Investigate the scene. Count the bodies, chase the green
Thank God for term limits
Hope that the truths are revealed
Vince Foster, Ron Brown and the whole Whitewater deal
So all hail to the thief
Sucked up every drop of my belief
