Yeah, life's a short lived role
On that point I cannot console
One day shall be last
Sink into the pase
We will, no, we must become Dust
My friend in sickness toils
He sees all those futures sad and soiled
Can't dwell on what could be
While you've got health and youth enjoy it
Time deals but feels no pain
Embrace your life cause it's one quick campaign
