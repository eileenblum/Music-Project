You've all the answers to how people should all live their lives
Well if you show me a wretch who does what he can to survive
Then I'll, I'll show you resistance, you call it a shame
We are the ?

Now deviation is not found in your dictionary
Ask me the question, just how different can equate with free
And I'll, I'll show you the answer, the happiness game
It's rooted in our crime of not being the same
Cause we're not the same
And never will be
