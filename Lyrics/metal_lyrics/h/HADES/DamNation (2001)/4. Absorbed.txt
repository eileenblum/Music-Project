We're all in this fight together
So small are the minds
That try to keep us far apart
Still individuals
Divided we shall fall
Not out to destroy uniqueness
Of race or religion
Or your own completeness
Common denominators
Multi racial and multi cultural
It's gone on for too long
Racism's sacred song
Absorbed, part of the sum
And sum of the parts
Beats the sum of none
We tolerate it
They cash the checks
But the day that we get together
They fear from one to the next

[solo: Ed]

Oh God, shine a revelation
Grant us a unified civilization
I just wish that all of us could
Wake up to the lies we just accept
As truths each day
It's gone on for too long
Racism's sacred song
Absorbed, part of the sum
And sum of the parts
Beats the sum of none
