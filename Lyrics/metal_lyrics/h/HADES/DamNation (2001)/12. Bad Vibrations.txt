They're everywhere
Do beware
Your dreamlike state
Soon crumbles
Into nightmare
To Bad Vibrations
You've got to tune in
And keep a safe distance
Or fall in
The signs are there to see but
Most choose see what they want
All those Bad Vibrations
They're seeking you out
They're destined to learn
Your whereabouts
We blind ourselves
With our desires
Can't tell the trustworthy
From liars
And wander down
The path to ruin
Can only blame yourself
You fool
So keep an ear
Tight to the ground
They proliferate all around
Invite them in
They'll drag you down
So know their face
And turn around
The Bad Vibrations
Should clue you in
To the potential problems
Lying within
