Going into transition
Upheaval by the ton is going on
Part of life's composition
I'm scared, I'm psyched
I'm bound for abandon
Turn the corners of life
Dive headfirst just to find
Reasonable thought flies
Out The Window
Yeah, there's no easy answers
To dealing with a major change in life
But some solutions
Reveal themselves
Across the course of time
We all go through it
Sooner or later matters not
But constant calm is
Sure to end at some point, it's our lot
Turn the corners of life
Dive headfirst just to find
Reasonable thought flies
Out The Window

[solo: Ed]

Wish you knew the future?
The good, the bad, the ugly
Do you dare?
Despite what you think
You never could properly prepare
Cause once it gets here
Shock takes hold and spins you like a top
You cannot see straight
Until your whirling world decides to stop
Turn the corners of life
Dive headfirst just to find
Reasonable thought flies
Out The Window
