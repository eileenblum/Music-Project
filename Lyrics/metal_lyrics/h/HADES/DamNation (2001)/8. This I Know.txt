All that I can say is, "Just find a way to
Grasp the rungs and climb on board"
The train is pulling out and
There is no doubt that
Waiting you cannot afford
This I know
That yesterday the future seemed far away
But now it's my face, in the flesh today
Take a look around you
Don't it astound you?
Short term thinking minds galore
Sure ya gotta earn it
Before you burn it
But work a dead end job what for?
This I know
Cause I was on that treadmill and man it sucks
A chase after my tail in the guise of bucks
Grind away, every day like a slave
Same old same, work your way to the grave
It's a miracle that you can even
Save it for a bright day
They all rain you say
Try to objectively
The cycle just continues
Have, have not issues
Fuel negativity
This I know
A sink or swim solution I call my job
It keeps me on my toes, not a worthless slob
Grind away, every day like a slave
Same old same, work your way to the grave
And besides it's so much fun to complain
Working straight commission
I'm a mission
Never any guarantees
Scratch out an existence, rugged resistance
To mindless mass mentalities
This I know
