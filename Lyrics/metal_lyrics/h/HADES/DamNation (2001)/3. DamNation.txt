They're gonna win most popular forever
Vote or award does it even matter?
The politician or actress
Such a mess
Who is who?
Cause I can't tell the difference
So what's the poor boy to do?
Except be sick of you
In total obfuscation, this damn nation
Starstruck, stripped of our stripes
In total obfuscation, this damn nation
Dumbstruck guttersnipes
The camera loves their every grin
Such a sin
Beat the drums till
The whole country wakes up
That'd be a wonderous, thunderous day
Dream away
We're enraptured
Captured by the linelight
So what's the poor boy to do?
Except be sick of you
In total obfuscation, this damn nation
Starstruck, stripped of our stripes
In total obfuscation, this damn nation
Dumbstruck guttersnipes

[solo: Ed]

They get away with murdering
In vain I sing
With stupid smiles
We'll grant THEM all a pardon
So what's the poor boy to do?
Except be sick of you
In total obfuscation, this damn nation
Starstruck, stripped of our stripes
In total obfuscation, this damn nation
Dumbstruck guttersnipes
