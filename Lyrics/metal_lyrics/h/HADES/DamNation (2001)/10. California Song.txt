The sunshine has a special glow
In California
One you have to see to truly know
In California
There's transplant from across the fruited plain
Soul searchers, They alone know their way
They're gonna race around and chase 'em down
The dreams they've always had
Without a boast they'd raise a toast
To all the "friends" who thought them mad
It's gonna reach out and pull you in
Take you places you've not been
So if you head out, just take along
This California Song
You gotta concentrate and strangulate
Outside forces' goal
A change of pace, a change of face
Start playing your own role
It's gonna reach out and pull you in
Take you places you've not been
So if you head out, just take along
This California Song
To each his own is how it's gotta be
Through your own eyes
Is the only way to see
It's gonna reach out and pull you in
Take you places you've not been
So if you head out, just take along
This California Song
It's not that you can't build a future
Where you already live
But when you move away, I gotta say
It gives you perspective
It's gonna reach out and pull you in
Take you places you've not been
So if you head out, just take along
Your California Song
