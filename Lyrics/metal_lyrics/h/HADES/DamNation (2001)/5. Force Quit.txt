You'll get over it
That's bullshit
Seen it for myself
It wears you down and won't quit
Forging straight ahead
Stopped dead
Like a deer caught in the headlights
Enough said
Shift command
Escape the program, restore
Functionality
Recover once more
Watched it turn a man
By his own hand
Into someone I can
Barely understand
Zapped his will to be
Lost his partner, now he's half
Of what he used to be
Confront the things unimagined
And prepare, but it's impossible
I just hope you can
Land on your feet
When death come calling
On the ones you love
He's gotta fill the void
Paranoid
To live alone
A fate he surely cannot avoid
Time is running out
Without a doubt
Wish I knew a way to figure it all out
Shift command
Escape the program, restore
Functionality, recover once more
