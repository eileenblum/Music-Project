I see the world through the bent
Plastic of my helmet each day
That explains why I see everything
In such a warped way
Oh say can you fly?
By the dawn's early light
Or the cold moonshine?
Pray that you don't die
If you bloast you'll be toast
If you let your focus coast
I've sharpened up those skills but
Still I gotta count on some luck
Eyes in back of my head
Screaming, in a full tuck
Oh say can you fly?
With a twist of the wrist
Punching forward like a fist
Pray that you don't die
If you bloast you'll be toast
If you let your focus coast
It's urban warfare of a
Multi vehicular degree
That's the price you gotta pay to
Feel like you're free
Oh say can you fly?
As you dice with the mice
In the race of your lives
Pray that you don't die
If you bloast you'll be toast
If you let your focus coast

[solo: Ed]

Bloast past the problematic situations
Found on your way
Click down two gears and it's C-Ya
Have a nice day
Pray that you don't die
If you bloast you'll be toast
If you let your focus coast
