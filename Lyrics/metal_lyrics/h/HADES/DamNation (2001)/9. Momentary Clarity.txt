He's fooled himself for now
Momentary clarity clown
I'm the one
Who went and
Got his life on track
Chosen one
Time to kick back
And take it easy
One step up, two back down
Momentary clarity clown
I'm the one
The fool who hides
From his own self
Overrun by the fear of
Looking in the mirror
He's deaf to sensible sound
Momentary clarity clown
For a second he knows
That he has to let it go
Logic dictates the lows
That he's soon certain to know
I'm the one
Who went and
Got his life derailed
Chosen one
For a self medicating lifestyle
I've worn that jester's crown
Momentary clarity clown
