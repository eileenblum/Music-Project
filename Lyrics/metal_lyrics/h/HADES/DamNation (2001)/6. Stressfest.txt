Sometimes the conflict's enough to break us
Make us all throw the towel in
But at the end of the day it empowers
And shows the strength within
Low in this labor of love lurks heartache
Despite the best laid plans
It'd end up being a useless mistake
To turn our backs on this band
Stressfest, heading in headlong
I'm right, you're wrong
But still we get along
Rest stop, everybody out
The bouts, the doubts
We just can't live without
In the stressfest
Yeah, I could find better thing to do with
Such short spare time
But there's a ghost and he'd
Hang there haunting
He'd wear me down over time
But in the pit of my very being
To old ways I'd revert
Because the beauty is in the seeing
The big picture's worth
Stressfest, heading in headlong
I'm right, headstrong
But still we get along
Stressfest, heading in headlong
I'm right, you're wrong
But still we get along
Rest stop, everybody out
The bouts, the doubts
We just can't live without
