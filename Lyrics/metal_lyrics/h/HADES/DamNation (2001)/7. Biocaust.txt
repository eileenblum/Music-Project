Twelve years ago in 2023
Overpopulation, Warring nations
Devastation brought upon ourselves
Chemically
Total human extinction-Infectious cloud of doom
Nullification of creation
This is no hallucination
Earth: Android's heirloom
The Biocaust: Humanity's lost
Into the damned inferno we are all tossed
Android sentience-Computing logically
Clone the DNA before decay
Does take away
The chance to save mankind
Some disagree
A.I. in conflict, Robo-debate ensues
Why reanimate that which creates
Yet decimates itself with hate?
It can't deserve to rule
The Biocaust: Humanity's lost
Into the damned inferno we are all tossed
The Biocaust: Humanity's loss
Into the damned inferno-Nailed to our cross
Covert resurrection experiments ensue
Giving man a helping hand
A risky plan full of demands
Evade the scans and see it through
From a chain into humans
One of each gender turns
Now to educate, repopulate
And illustrate the deadly fate
And hope the new breed learns
The Biocaust: Humanity's lost
Into the damned inferno we are all tossed
The Biocaust: Humanity's loss
Given a second chance
Was it worth the cost?
