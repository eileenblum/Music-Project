Burning midnight skies
The blaze of stars is calling again
Whispering mystic choirs
A promise of immortality

Take my soul to where the falcons fly
To the gates of triumph
The skies are bleeding like an open wound
We are born again

Burning midnight skies
The queen of the night have raised again
She is the goddess of where our journey ends

Take my soul to where the falcons fly
I ride on a tail of moonfrog
Throughout the burning midnight skies

Thy queen - the goddess
The enemy of Christ
I greet you on your throne of star dust
Teach me the art of erotic sin
Grant me the source of bestial lust

Take my soul to where the falcons fly
To the gate of triumph
Forever free
Burning midnight skies!!!
Burning midnight skies!!!
