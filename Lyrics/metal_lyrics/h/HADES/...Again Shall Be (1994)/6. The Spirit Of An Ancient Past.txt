The mist of blue frost
Fills the proud valleys of the north
An ice age of terror
As silent as snow hides the hills
In this frozen land I ride
As the northern light guides my way
A black wind I am
A shadow of war and lust

This path, whom for me is chosen
Forbidden for mortals to see

The night is filled
With diabolical summoning winds
The moon is burning
Like an eye glaring of demonic hate
Watch me as I choose my trail
This journey is forever
The spirit of Gods and Goddess I am
Forgotten at the birth of new times
A reflection of an ancient past
Waiting in a lost realm of ice
For the rising of a forever pagan age
