When the grimson red skies
Baths the horizon in a poisonous kiss
I kiss my hammer
I kiss thy sword
My eyes glear of infernal joy

In my dreams I saw them
They made me swear the oath
At the seventh of the seven mountains
The twenty first of December

The skies bath the horizon in fire
I hold my sword before me and I
Kneel before the blood on the stone
Greet me !!!

This moment was chosen at the birth
Of the gods
A true son of Aasgard I am
And blood that ran on my fathers
Graves
The oath sworn, the blood is given
Now I await you to pass me your forces
