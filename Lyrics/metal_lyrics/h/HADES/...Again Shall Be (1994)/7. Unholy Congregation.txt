Into the darkest forest they go
Dressed in black
Dressed in coats
Women of evil lust

Unholy Congregation

At the darkest hour
Their torches they light
Witches hour
Infernal silence
They wait before the alter
Chanting invocation

In a blaze of fire he stands
Some horrid shape of a goat
Each of them pay his homage

Obsculum Obscenum

White skin freezing in the moon shine
Dance in a circle
Wait for turn
Wine like black clotted blood
Drink !!!
