Darkness entomb us as we watch the
Mountains before
Waiting for the wind to bring us the sign of the Ancient horn

The bells shall chime as the towers burn
In flames of eternal hate
Burn in the name of the elder faith

Black ravens of the war raise your unholy banner
Again the smell of blood shall drift
Under the silver moon

Chant your song on northern glory
Blow your horns for northern pride
Sing those songs so long forgotten
Hail those ravens that once died
