Open your world history compufiles to number nineteen hundred and
ninety eight. Today We're going to look back and bring to light once
again, the mistakes that were made which Caused the democracy
once called America to fall from a great nation to total ruination.
A country spoiled to the point of no return

The Decline &amp; Fall

It's time to reflect on the consequences of shortsightedness and self
defeating ideologies so That we may learn from them, never to forget
that history does indeed repeat itself. There's a Big difference
between assisting the truly needy and throwing the taxpayers' money
at Problems with the noble hope that they'll disappear. Earning
more short term votes all the While. Never once thinking about the
big picture or the future of our children.
$elfish $uicide. $elfish $uicide.

The Decline &amp; Fall

The United States of America taxed and legislated itself both on the
federal and state levels into utter bankruptcy and eventual anarchy.
Anerica the beautifully forsaken. Finished off in Exquisite catastrophe.
Like Egypt and Rome before it, the USA advanced its living
conditions To the point where total apathy consumed its hard working
citizens and government Assistance did nothing but enslave the
downtrodden to the powers that were.
One nation under God, totally divisible.

Our Father

Our father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
And please, please lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from all evil
