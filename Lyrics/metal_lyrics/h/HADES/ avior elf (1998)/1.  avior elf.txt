[Music - Lorenzo]
[Lyrics - Tecchio]

Drowning down and reaching out,
Poor you
Helping handouts,
Now we're drowning too

Stop blaming everyone else
Shut up and save yourself

Dumbing down, we're devolving for sure
Us, ourselves, the answer and the cure

Entitlements you're not entitled to
Promote the problem and distort the truth
