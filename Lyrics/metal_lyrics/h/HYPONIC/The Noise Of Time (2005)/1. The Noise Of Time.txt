The wave of time
Flooding in the space
The noise of time is mourning
The noise growling in silence in creatures mind
For the vast ages
Wisdom fails to dust a trip
Chasing by time beneath the experience
With the evil thoughts
Until the failure of the burning sun
Refreshing the endless faith
In the space of fury
Expanding the hatred in mind
The noise arise again
