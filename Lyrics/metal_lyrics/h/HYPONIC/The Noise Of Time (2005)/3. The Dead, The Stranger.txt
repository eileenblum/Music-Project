Anger saddens fear
All underneath
Power promises fate
Are black memories
Desire secrets
Future are fragments
Brave weakness greed
All emerged
Stranger is dead
The dead is stranger
The blood goes downwards
No space no voices
And faces remain
There's no distance
Your time has freezed
We are more closer and closer
