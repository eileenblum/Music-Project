HÃ¤mmÃ¤styisitkÃ¶, jos huomaisit
Kuinka muisto pimeydestÃ¤ vaanii
Seuraten askeleitasi, kuunnellen
Etsien sopivaa hetkeÃ¤ raivolleen?

[Chorus:]
HÃ¤nelle sielusi juomaksi jaloksi
Vihalle temppeli verestÃ¤ puhtaaksi
HÃ¤nelle sielusi huoneensa valoksi
Taivaalle ruumiisi kohotkoon savuksi

EntÃ¤, jos nÃ¤kisit ja voisit koskea,
Sen olennon kÃ¤teen tarttua
Oppaaksesi tÃ¤llÃ¤ Vihan TiellÃ¤
Tuon unohdetun muiston kutsua?

[Chorus]

[English translation:]

The Path Of Hate

Would you be surprised if you noticed
How a memory is lurking in the dark
Following your steps, listening
Looking for the right moment to unleash its wrath?

Your soul given as a fine drink for Him
Cleaning blood from the temple for hate's sake
Your soul given as a lamp to light His room
Your remains shall rise to the skies as smoke

What if you could see and feel
And grab the hand of that creature
Call forth that forgotten memory
As your guide on this Path of Hate?

Your soul given as a fine drink for Him
Cleaning blood from the temple for hate's sake
Your soul given as a lamp to light His room
Your remains shall rise to the skies as smoke
