Nazarene, nazarene bastard child!
You were born from a whore and you
Will bleed like she before!
Sodomy, sodomy, raping you
With my horns and hellish steel,
Agony and pain to feel!

Suffering, suffering baby cries.
You may reach Gethsemane but not with
Your virginity!
Carpenter, carpenter - not your seed!
Now you know the whore she was -
Dead, defiled and bloody mass!

Sodomy, sodomy, impurity!
Hell will come without a doubt and
You will not be helping out!
Crucifix, crucifix in your ass!
Rotting, dead, defiled and gone - so
Is said so be it done!!!
