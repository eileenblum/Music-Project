Iâll pull these tyrants down to the depths, just like anchors
Bound upon feet, not made to walk even the calmest seas
Iâll pull these tyrants down to the depths, just like anchors
Bound upon feet, not made to walk even the calmest seas

We will not give in
I grow tired of watching us feed like pigsÂ 
I've seen the faults to our own demiseÂ 
The wolves in suits clawing at the undernourishedÂ 
A selfish food chain designed
To keep the lower class on their knees

And the wealthy in power
We, the people turn the blind eye
Such a sad story we will tell our children
How we all stood by and watchedÂ 
As our society crumbled
Our selfishness has overwhelmed us
And now everything seems worthless

The sun slowly deteriorates their souls
And I feel my heart sinking with their dying breathes
I can feel my heart sinking

As they fear the sun, so do I fear our future
I do not question our survival
I question the state in which we survive
As they fear the sun, so do I fear our future
I know that we all die one day, but what will we leave behind

As these tyrants pull them down to the depths like anchors
The philosophy of freedom is long dead

We, the people turn the blind eye
Such a sad story
We will tell our children

As they fear the sun, so do I fear our future
I know that we all die one day, but what will we leave behind

Iâll pull these tyrants down to the depths, just like anchors (just like anchors)
Bound upon feet, not made to walk even the calmest seas (the calmest seas)
