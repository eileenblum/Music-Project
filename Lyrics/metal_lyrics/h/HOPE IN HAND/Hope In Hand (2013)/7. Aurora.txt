Admiration is only possessive in the eyes of the beholder
Our mind creates and unlocks the beauty in us all

We are the vision, we are the interpreters and proprietors of imagination
With dreams and aspirations of bettering ourselves, our kind, and our world

Such dreams are said to flow like a river, drowning the weak yet buoyant for the strong

We have fallen from the tree of life, we are the seed
With a hunger for constant power, an endless aching need

We have a love for an idealistic constitutionÂ 
An appreciation for the ceaseless universe inside our minds
We are the dreamers, now awakened
We are the dreamers, now awakened

We are the vision, we are the interpreters and proprietors of imagination
With dreams and aspirations of bettering ourselves, our kind, and our world
Our world

And so I lay here waiting for my dreams to come true (to come true)
My mind's entwined with a thought of a haven so far away (far away)
And so I lay here waiting for my dreams to come true (to come true)
My mind's entwined with a thought of a haven so far away (far away)
