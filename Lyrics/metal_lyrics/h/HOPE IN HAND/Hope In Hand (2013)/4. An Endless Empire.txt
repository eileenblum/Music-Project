Watch me grow
Watch me grow into a monster
Consume the world for all itâs worth
Iâll bring you all to your kneeâs
Upon this stage for the world to see

Waves of expectation crashing around me
I want it all, and I want it now
I won't stop until I hold this crown
And I won't be silenced (silenced)
I am the minority (minority)
The few to stand for a cause
I won't stop until I find this clarity

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to face you
You will reap what you've sewn
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to face you
I will do this all, on my own

Iâm not afraid
Iâm not afraid to face youÂ 
You will reap what you've sewn
What you've sewn
You cowards, hiding behind doors
Laced in corruption
Condemned to rot as empty vessels

The crown falls into new hands
As the old era dies out foreverÂ 
We find warmth in our hearts again
As the old era dies out foreverÂ 

And in this new dawn, as life moves on
You will find the cold
You will reap what youâve sewn, you are lost and alone
You will fall like snow

This life is dead to me I will not fall away
Don't say I didn't warn you, don't say you never knew
Right from the very start I fought the whole way through
I fought the whole way through, I fought the whole way though

I can't take one more day
I need to break free
This life is dead to me
I will not fall away

Amongst these remains
You left your passion inside your pain
You have nothing left to gain
I watched you walk away
This life is dead to me I will not fall away
