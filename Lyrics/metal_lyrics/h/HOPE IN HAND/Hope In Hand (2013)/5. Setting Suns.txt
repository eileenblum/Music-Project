I feel the rain on my neck
And I know that there must be something more
I feel the rain on my neck and I feel, and I feelÂ 
And I know, that there must be something more

I feel the rain on my neckÂ 
And I flee to escape itÂ 
Away from home, away from my troublesÂ 
A more loving landscape, a brighter horizon

The older I get the sicker I feel
And the sands of time are falling fast
With only a lifetime left to reveal
To me and me only, me and me onlyÂ 
What is really inside of my heartÂ 
Only time will tell, only time will tell
What My heart truly beats for
Only time will tell, Only time will tell

What do I promise myself to keep me all here
What do I tell myself to overcome my fear
What purpose do these thoughts serve
When itâs the pain of others that swells inside my heart
What do I promise myself to keep me here
What can I do to overcome this fear
What purpose do these thoughts serveÂ 
Other than stealing my smile
Other than robbing my pride

And I flee to escape this downpour to find any shelter
Away from home, away from all of my troubles
To a much more loving landscape, a brighter horizon

So, bring me that horizon, bring me that sunset
Sunset

Bring me the beauty I seek
Deliver me to a new lifeÂ 
Restore to me what you have taken so bluntly
Awww
Take me back

Bring me that horizon, bring me that sunset
Bring me that horizon, bring me that sunset
Take me back
To a more loving landscape, a brighter horizon
Deliver me
Awww, Take me back
