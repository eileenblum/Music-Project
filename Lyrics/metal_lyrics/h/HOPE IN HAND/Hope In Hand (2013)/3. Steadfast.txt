Iâve walked this self destructive path, for far too long
Iâve seen love turn to hate, and watched friendships dissipate
As all morality lost effect on my soulÂ 
As my demons inside took their toll

And all my life, Iâve wanted to be free
Yet Iâm struggling to find any tranquillity
Through struggle and distress, Iâve become undone
This world has taken its toll on me

For years I've been searching for this peace
In structures of anguish built up on greed
But we are condemned to this destiny
A bitter descent, a shallow grave

I will rebuild this world, for you and me
I will rebuild this world

Will I ever find a way out of this or am I destined to wander?
When will I find my way back home?

For years I've been searching for this peace
In structures of anguish built up on greedÂ 
But we are condemned to this destiny
A bitter descent, a shallow grave

I will rebuild, this world for you and me
I hold the keys, to our destiny
I will rebuild, this world for you and me
I hold the keys, to our destiny

I hold the keys to a world
You could only dream of
Architecturally sound in creation
I hold the keys to our destiny

A beauty like no other
Perfect in every sense
A world built for you and me
And I hold the key
