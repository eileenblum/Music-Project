Betrayal, you've turned your back on me againÂ 
You've forced upon me something that I never feltÂ 
This is real, my worst nightmares have come trueÂ 
This was never about us, this was just a platform for you

You've sunk your teeth in, you've captured your killÂ 

Still you feel empty
Like it was never enough
Looking to passed indulgence
To secure your position at heart
Your security at heart

I gave my all, you put your arms out and told me to jumpÂ 
I closed my eyesÂ 
I fell back and waited for your touch (your touch)
I longed your heart, regardless if damaged, bruised or bentÂ 
But all I felt was the cold in your eyes
The pure resent

Afraid, terrified to lose what you now have lostÂ 
It seems as if you have finally realized your own faultsÂ 
Oh, how the tables have turnedÂ 
And this time, I won't be there to catch you when you fallÂ
