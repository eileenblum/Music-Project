Our existence but figures, Insignificant numbersÂ 
In reality weâre all the same
We are brothers of the world, yet divided

We stand for race and belief, to what end
Incessant, We are relentless
Our world will be torn apart by a chaos of indifferenceÂ 
There is no victory here, There is only bloodshed
There is only bloodshed, I'm reaching out my handsÂ 
We are called, to take cities
We are called, to be more than conquerors
Where can I run
We are called, to take cities
We are called, to be more than conquerors
Where can I run

Where is the escape from this conflict
Where can I run
When weâve lost all sight of our humanity.Â 

We are the beasts to our demise.Â 

My god,
I'm reaching out my hands
There is no victory here
There is no victory here
Awwwwww
We are called, to take cities
We are called, to be more than conquerors
Where can I run
We are called, to this city
We are called, to be so much more than what this world has offered us

I see humans, but no humanityÂ 
This is not human nature, this is just your disgusting behaviourÂ 
You are the product of a creators perfect handÂ 
Why can't you act like it

My God
I'm reaching out my hands
There is no victory here
There is no victory here

My God
Lost in this broken land
I'm reaching out my hands
I'm reaching out my hands

My God
I'm reaching out my hands
There is no victory here
There is no victory here

My God
Iâm reaching out my hands
This cannot be the end
This cannot be the end
