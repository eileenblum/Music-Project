Hate your soul, till the end
Blame, despise yourself,
Deconcentration to converge,
Sublime oblation to understand

Damn your life, love your death
Sacrifice, disguise, reject
Contradiction to invert
Your symmetric relapse, rebirth, end

Notwithstanding, (you are) praying for what you want as
Repayment ov a life of death

Purpose of redemption to stray the sense of guilt

Divine isolated restrictive existence,
Forget the interaction between the bullet 'N' burst,
Resume to be an instance, legitimate your will

Be glad to end his sorrow defiling your mind

For what u believe in (scream)
Nobody/ could see through/ your self/destruction

Notwithstanding, (you're) praying for what you want as
Repayment ov a life of death
