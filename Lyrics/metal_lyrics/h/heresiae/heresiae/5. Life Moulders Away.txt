Here I m waiting
For your radical change
Call it right
Hold as wrong

This is what that should be done

And life moulders away
But I will never surrender
When life moulders away
You must never surrender

Here I'm waiting
For your radical change
Call it right
Hold as wrong
This is what that should be done

"Don't do unto others
What you don't want others do unto you"

And life moulders away
But I will never surrender
When life moulders away
You must never surrender

"Don't hate each other
Search the light, find the heaven's door... "
Do you feel better
With the I aw of the human God?

Can he hear?
Voices are close, desperate souls
Can he hear me?
I'm screaming
Can he feel?
Can he say
Why, when your things have changed in this way

Life has been made to realize
Your mind illusion;
Life has been made to realize
Your heart occlusion:
Life has been made to realize;
Your last conclusion
Everything is going to die
Your blind conviction;
