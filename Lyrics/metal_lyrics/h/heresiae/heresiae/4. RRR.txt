rise,react, rearm

stay on the ground, your dreams can decay
staying on the ground, it's the way to be proud of your despair

searching, find a star, the can light up the way
searching, find a star, bet you that you can't find it
searching, find a star, that rise beyond the sun
i will, find a star, i'm glad of my desire

rise, react, all that you need is nere
rise, react, all that you want is clear

in spite of
rise
in spite of
fear
in spite of
who want to raise your tears

stay on the ground, your dreams can decay
staying on the ground, it's the way to be proud of your despair

searching, find a star, that rise beyond the sun
i will, find a star, i'll find a fucking star

rise,react, restart

endless torment, endless throes, suffocated, i'm alone
