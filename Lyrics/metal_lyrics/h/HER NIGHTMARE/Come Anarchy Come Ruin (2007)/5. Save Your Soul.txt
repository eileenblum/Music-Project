Our wake up call is set to genocide
Our wake up call is set to genocide
Tip toe around the truth, lips sealed
Recruiting numbers, recruiting
The hopeless, the hurt
I will not allow this controlling to persist
How long till it blows up in your fucking face
Your afterlife is a long ladder
Save your soul
But can you sleep with the watchful eyes on you
Save your soul
The people closest to you
Save your soul
Are now you're biggest threat
Our wake up call is set to genocide
Our wake up call is set to genocide
Our misled ways will kill us all
Our misled ways will kill us all
Now enlightenment is within you
The sacrifice will save your soul
The sacrifice will keep you pure
Close your eyes and let go
The sacrifice will save your soul
The sacrifice will keep you pure
Let go
