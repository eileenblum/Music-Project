Reign
In the day of a working class
A day lasting eternity
Can we surpass
Avoid the crash
The humble slave our destiny
This vicious cycle of the social struggle
Ends meat is a losing battle
When our skills are replaced by a machine
Disregard us
Capitalize on our dreams

Decay under the strain
Class war will reign
Decay under the strain
Class war will reign

Disappearing in the face of modern industry
Famine, hardship, seemed so far from me
Unable to exist among our own class
Fighting to breathe
We sink so fast
Our own hardship is another's prosperity
Forced to rebel for a new beginning
To become more then this commodity
Overcome and surpass this living hell

Decay under the strain
Class war will reign
Decay under the strain
Class war will reign
We sink so fast
