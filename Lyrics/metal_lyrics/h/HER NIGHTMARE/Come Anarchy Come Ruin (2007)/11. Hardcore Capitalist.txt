Time and time again
We're at the bottom, on the losing end
Always played for the passion but now it seems to stand for nothing
I don't mind not making a cent
As long as there's not a cent to be made
From all the bands who are paying your bills, consider this a threat...
Take your hands out of my fucking pocket!
