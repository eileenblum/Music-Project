Burn for me, extinguished flame may never return
Burn to strife, burn until it's made to light
Our warmth so counterfeit
Our life of our blood so long desolate
Fallen as far as the king to the slave
Give up the world, but accept the grave
Never forget the fire that burns
Never forget the fire
We measure our worth like meat on the scale
Compare it to others, we'll always fail
We only count our failures, our regrets so shallow
Our worth is defined by the pain, by the struggle
By the struggle we live to fight
Burn for me, extinguished flame may never return
Burn for strife, burn until it's made light
