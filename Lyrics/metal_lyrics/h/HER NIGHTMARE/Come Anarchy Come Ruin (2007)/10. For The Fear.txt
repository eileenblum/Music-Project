Judgement day is creeping closer
Are we willing to die
No
One step is all we've got left are we willing to die
The sky is falling
Our freedom's falling
For a better world
They're tightening the economic noose
While they rape us
While you're sitting in your quiet homes your sense of values have been removed
It's time to open our eyes
Stop sucking down the lies
Our country's taken by the throat
Who's gonna think for a thoughtless nation
Our leaders can't even think for themselves
There's a leak in this democracy
When everybody's voting out of fear
For the fear
The sky will open
Are we willing to die
While they bleed us dry
Everywhere I look
We're turning for the worse
I see the closing is near
We're fucking doomed by our own admission
What can we do
What can we say
There's a leak in this democracy when everybody's voting
For the fear
We're taken
We bleed out
For the fear
We're choking
Suffering
For the fear
Lives taken
Lives ending
For the fear
Just keep your fucking mouth shut
Or you deserve to die
We're destined to die
