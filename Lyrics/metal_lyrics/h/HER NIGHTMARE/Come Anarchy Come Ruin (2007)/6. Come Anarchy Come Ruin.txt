You can't escape
Accept the strength and rise from death
Wake up sleeper live again
Your dignity's worth more than your master's suggest
Break the chains of objective creeds
Drown in an ocean of conformity
We are the people who have become idle
The masochists seeking bridles
We are the people who have become idle
And willing to make the descent
Disobey your masters, make then fear and tremble
Come anarchy, come ruin
No longer passive in social servitude
Come anarchy, come ruin
As we follow this path of destruction
As we wander this world without function
Turning blind eyes we consume the mass-production but will we make the descent as instructed
Our individuality has been choked under foot
Our idea of freedom has been surrendered
For the material possession that drives us
The very thing that controls us
Ideas of freedom have been surrendered
Disillusioned people accept the strength that comes through solitude.
