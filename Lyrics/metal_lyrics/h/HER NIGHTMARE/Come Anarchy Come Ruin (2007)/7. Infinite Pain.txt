See half the story
What you want to believe
Shadow the facts and wreak havoc
Corruption means nothing without empathy
Defeating, force feeding, continuing to destroy
Limitless gain, infinite pain
Our inability to change
Respect, honor, do onto others
Shameful words lead to shameful acts
But they shall hide the facts
Time to fall
To your knees
Time to fall, it's time to fall
To your knees and beg for mercy
Shadow the facts and wreak havoc
Sorrow will find you.
