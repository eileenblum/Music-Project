Try to remember your better days
Don't be distracted by your life laid to waste
All the years of fighting and trying
A strange feeling washes through our hearts
Try to forget the bad days
All regrets fade away
And all the years just pass us by
The warmth fills our dying hearts
Last goodbye
We want it all, we want to breathe
But do we need one last moment
To help us feel content
We had it all, had to see
But did we need one last moment
To help us feel content
Do you feel content
Hearing the pleading in drastic measures
We never thought minutes could be so treasured
Bargaining, yet quickly realizing we're disappearing in the sight of the storm
I can feel desire laid to waste
I couldn't be wrong
I can hear the cries in the air
I can hear you cry in the air
And I'm feeling content
