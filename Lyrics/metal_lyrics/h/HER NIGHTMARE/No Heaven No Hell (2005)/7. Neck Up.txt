Tear out pages of you past so no one knows who you really are.
Leave behind what they accept, not you, fuck what you've became.
If people could see the fake under your skin,
See that names aren't worth shit to me or this scene.
You'll never be at peace, when status is all you need.
You'll never be at peace when you're afraid to be yourself.
One day you'll fall from the ladder you live by.
You thought you had it all, left for dead now it's all gone.
See that you're not worth shit to me or this scene.
