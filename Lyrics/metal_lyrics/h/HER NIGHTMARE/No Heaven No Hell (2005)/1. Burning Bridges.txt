I'm not here to save your world, to save your soul, or watch it burn.
Call me what you like, your words don't mean a thing.
I'm gonna live, die without shame, when I'm broken and bleeding, ill be the one to blame.
Regrets a bitter taste, your faith is such a waste,
Fuck you for wanting to die, fuck you for believing the lie.
So keep on talking.
We've got no arrogance left, humble beginnings a humble end,
No more fences to sit, all our bridges burned.
All our bridges have been burned.
Regrets a bitter taste, your faith is such a waste.
