A daily struggle, pushing further and further, one step above yesterday,
Today is one step above the rest, overcome every Boundary,
Destroy the path in front of me,
The only one to bring me down is myself never giving up to life I put aside,
Push past the pain, everything to gain, stronger body,
A stronger mind, a shorter path infront of me, closer to all I can be,
Push back the pain, until all that remains, a stronger body, a stronger mind,
A shorter path infront of me, closer to all I can be.
Stand over everything, stand over everybody, but you won't walk over me,
You stand over everything and everyone, now you've started something, ill never let it end.
Push past the pain.
Push back the pain until all that remains, a stronger body, a stronger mind,
A shorter path infront of me, closer to all I can be,
The only one to bring me down is myself, destroy the path infront of me.
