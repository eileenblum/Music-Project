Stand tall, side by side, there's no fear in our eyes, we're owed so much,
We're not gonna let it die, you talk of pain, but what have you felt,
Compared to the emptiness we've felt through all our lives.
Now we're fighting to take back our wasted lives.
Everything you taught us was a goddamn lie.
Brought up to believe in all your fairy tales, just a bullshit system, that always fails.
And we wont stop until we're through.
Until we're cleansed of you.
There are things in this life worth fighting for.
Everything you taught us was a lie.
