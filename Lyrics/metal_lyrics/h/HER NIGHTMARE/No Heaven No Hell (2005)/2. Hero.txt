You've taken from us a chance to see.
Punishing others for your crime, another taken before their time, death of a hero.
Gunned down for what, and your perception of feeling.
What we loved now dead in the dirt, we're not over feeling the hurt.
The punishment don't fit the crime.
You more then crossed the fucking line.
You've taken, from us, a chance, chance to see.
Death of a hero.
You never thought this strong, life taken no remorse,
It wasn't him that destroyed your world, one life wont stop you seeing red.
Destruction of life.
Destruction.
Destruction of life.
