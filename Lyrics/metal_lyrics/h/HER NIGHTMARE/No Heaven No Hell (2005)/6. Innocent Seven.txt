Stalked and taken from the world, forced into a place of filth.
You raped, you murdered and walked away.
No justice to be placed on you, No fucking revenge.
Taking your life isn't worth shit, you think that's what you deserved,
A selfish act only makes things worse.
A world of pain, you should've been given, no revenge for the innocent seven.
No revenge for the innocent seven.
So much hate you can't be dead, we never right the wrong, so much fucking hate,
Victims suffering will never cease.
Gun to your head was an easy way out, you should've bled a thousand times,
Endless suffering never ends, seven victims dead inside.
Innocent seven.
No revenge.
