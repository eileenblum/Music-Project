Tables turn today.
Day after day, what have we done for us, each minute we live, what have they done for us.
This isn't real.
This is a lie.
Leave us alone, leave us today.
A choice we have to make, a choice for ourselves, will you live in a shadow,
Will you follow and trust, or will you push them away and spit on their trust.
I've made by choice, I know what's right for me, stronger then I've ever been,
Your love was never real.
And they can only play dead, only for so long.
Fuck you, tables will turn today, To live our lives.
We're free.
