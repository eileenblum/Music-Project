No more what you know, no more how you feel, my past is well behind me,
And what was taught was not enough to break me, you can't say whats good or evil,
Don't tell me whats right or wrong, neither side gets y respect,
Living your rules never made my life better.
When my time comes I wont feel regret, when my time comes I wont try to save my soul.
There's no white light to guide me, no fire to burn me, just truth I cant escape.
I was taught of a brighter afterlife, and almost thought death was my re-birth,
Now I know whats real to me, I was taught of a brighter afterlife,
And almost thought death was something more, our time is up, we all end.
It ends.
No heaven.
No hell.
