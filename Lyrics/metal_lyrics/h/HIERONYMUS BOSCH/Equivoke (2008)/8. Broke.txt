Feeling low lost in thought
All systems go... Into melting pot
The missing link of logic chain
Steel nerves broke under the straw

[Chorus:]
The ruins of something we hate
Steel nerve 
broken blade
Memory is blank
The empty list

The shallow mind is perfect querist
No more prayers as the daily bread
Since those days when the world was flat
Different actions we have to forsake
No matter what direction our future deeds take...

The ruins of something we hate
Steel nerve broken blade

Broke!
Broke!
