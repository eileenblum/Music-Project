No one word has passed the lips
The knowledge speaks with keys and fingertips

Swim against the shining stream
Of this livid screen
Writing with gray matter ink...
New age world is just a thing
Plastic skull and ribs of steel
Numerator of the free will

Crimson ray makes white arrow fly
Static wind blows high
Above the glassy sky
Stinging letter, killing dot
Insert the word into empty slot

The ages slid by as the moments slid past
Virtual life of timeless cast
The chosen one who monumentalized
And mesmerized by looking through this single eye

[Chorus:]
Hanging by a thread...
Some words are left unsaid
Wish and dream will never blend
Lost without a trace
Under the gray surface
Digged into the open space

Fingerprint labyrinth
The second coming of an ancient myth...
