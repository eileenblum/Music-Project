Light fade...
Phantasma
Dancer in the shadow of shade
Tight silk... white magic above the river of black milk
Faces wet... the twisted cross of body silhouette
Heart's kill, the lips are sealed

Silent life, never to laugh, never to cry
In the corner of the circle
Listening to speechless mime
Reciting unwritten poem
Without reason and rhyme

There's no any choice for the ones who cursed to be unvoiced
The wordless strangers in a world of neverending noise
