Dreaming in silent night...
Dreams of reality, flight of mind...
Psychologic complexity is hidden in your eyes
Difficult to apprehend and hard to realize
When your lauren wreath of flattery
Turned into the chains of lies
And the best of human features
Are killed by perfection of mind

Dreaming of Mental Perfection
Dreaming of Mental Perfection...

Before your hate becomes your shield
New traits of soul will be revealed

The summer in your heart is over
All passions leave in past
Prepare your mind to open
For psychopathic blast

Mental Perfection
Mental Perfection
