Threshold mean of humanity
Highligt of insanity
"Personal Mean Conception"
Against the Three Conversion

It's Apogee of Human ability
And no more guaranty

The power of Human mind
Now Mother Earth is against mankind
Too active intellectual process
And Human brain destroying forces
And Human thought grew stronger
And sense of God no longer
Load the human culture
All on the mother nature
People blinded by decadence
And psychoanalysis experience
"Super-Ego" and nihilism
Instead of the realism
"Personal Mean Conception"
Against the Three Conversion

And the source of Human morals
It's philosophical principles:
"Cogito Ergo Sum",
"Credo Quia Ineptum"...
Out of the Dark and Light
The Mother Earth prepared to fight
The fight to get rid of mankind
It's silent war in cosmic night...
