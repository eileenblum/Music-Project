Mournful voice of my unborn conscience
Becomes the reflection of emotional tensions
And deep resplendence of my reality
Is meaning of my misanthropy
You'll never poses the source of this pain
You'll never break my distrust again
My perception is lost and cannot return
In loneliness live, in loneliness born...

As the form stays the same
My substance cannot change
And this matter has no name
Transforming logic range:
Intelligence in confrontation
And selfish self-determination,
No stereotypes, no ethic norms,
It's different thought racism forms...

Actually and visually (visuality's)
Creating my reality
Portrayal at thought speed
Visual images is all I need.
