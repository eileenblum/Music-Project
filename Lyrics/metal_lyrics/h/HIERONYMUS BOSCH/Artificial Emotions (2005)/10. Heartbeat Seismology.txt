Anatomical landscape, atomized
Unstable in shape, human body sized
Heart sends impulse from your tectonic depths
Playing yourself false
You forced to hold your breath

[CHORUS]
Heartbeat seismology
Rhythmic unison of six billion hearts
Ant-hill psychology
World wreckers
From house of cards

Sow the systalic seeds
Synchronize the throughts and deeds
Oscillation frequency, crust break
Awake the bodyquake

[CHORUS 2X]
