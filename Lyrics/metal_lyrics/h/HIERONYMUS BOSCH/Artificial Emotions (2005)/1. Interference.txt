Why it seems so inviting?
The world of genuine values,
Prominent talents and genius
"Creative Power" it's so mighty...
hypothetical sin that fills you
Like salt fills the sores
You're not worth a curse
There's no easy way in,
No opened doors

[CHORUS]
You'll never fit in
There's no entrance for you
You have nothing to do
Brain drain binding you to...
Make an inroad,
To use the decline
And "Yours is mine"
That is your mode

Oh, it's so sad
You ain't able to create,
Oh, it's so fun
But nothing could be done

You'll never escape
There's no exit for you
You have nothing to do
Ties of despair
Binding you to...
Be an eloquent person,
To follow your guiding force
Misunderstanding the meaning
Of words
There's no easy way out
No opened doors

[CHORUS 2X]
