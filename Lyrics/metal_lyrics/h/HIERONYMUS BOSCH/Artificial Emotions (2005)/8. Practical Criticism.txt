How can you call yourself a genius?
Your confidence provokes my doubt.
You turn my notions all inside out.
Misleading pun...
So miscellaneous...

[CHORUS]
Jeer...
The logic knot defies solution,
the masterpiece that you ignore...
Lampoon...
From academic and classical to folk-lore
world art in material sphere,
from positive image to its primitive forms -
"Creative Grotesque".
It's so weird for you and too late to revise 
the outdated views...
Looking through a prism of practical criticism,
your position is just a fake, last attempt to not make mistake.
Looking through a prism of practical criticism,
your position is just a fake, better way to make mistake.

Prejudiced critic,
not so brave,
refuses to notice
somebody else's succdess
A free artist
or "Mental Labour Slave"?
Vicious criticism
and moral regress... Jeer...

[CHORUS]

Activity,
constructive unrest,
global design,
inspiration is evil jest.
Absolutely zero is everything you wrote,
you have no poison,
but you have antidote.
