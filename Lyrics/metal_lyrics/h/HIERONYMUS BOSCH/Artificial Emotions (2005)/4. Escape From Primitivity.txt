Reject point-blank,
so now we got some peace
In damaged structures
of the conscious maze
Inaccessable hyperrealism
Teaches to play
these primitive games
An innerworld presence,
what a pleasant scene
Waiting for wisdom from above
External sign
of internal discipline
Waiting for mercy and even love.

[CHORUS]
Futile season,
The reason is in the prison
It's primitive captivity
Futile season,
The reason is the prison
Escape from primitivity

Inopportune criticism and witticism
Gets off the point
Sophisticated primitive art forms
And life coil is out of joint
Adequate evaluation of sane views,
Animostiy
Artistic cobweb strives to confuse
We're lost in the style diversity

[CHORUS 2X]
