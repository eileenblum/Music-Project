Tormented for the years and outcast
Crying yourself asleep each night
The tears wash your soul away
While you struggle to keep your sanity
Day by day it slips away
As you welcome psychopathy

The strongest ones beat upon you
It's getting harder to hide the wounds
The others point and laugh to scan you
Always feeding on your misery
The daily beatings take their toll
Pummel your body and scars your soul
No more!
Will you tear or
Cower!
In your fears
They won't knows it's near
You binge a killing spree
Release the violence
Conscious and clean.
Crossing the line of a killing indulgence
Your killing spree â conscious and clean.
