Desolate glossy eyes
Stare back in the mirror
Looking at the world
Void of mind
Just a hollow shell
Of what used to be
Zero capacity
Obsolete

Disintegration
Of personality
Total disconnect
With all reality

No trust in faith
No trust in lust
No trust in life
Just dead and gone!

Falling to cope
As hope fails you
Every day is war
Of your mind
Never won or lost
Out of reach out of touch
What was before?
What is next?

Wasting in silence
In self-destruction
Cold-blooded apathy
Constantly
Exist with agony
This is eternity
Your recognitions
Mean nothing
