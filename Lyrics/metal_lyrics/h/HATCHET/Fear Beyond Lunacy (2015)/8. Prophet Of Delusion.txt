Betrayal is my preach 
trust is my deeds 
I am the chosen - I speak the word of gods
Follow me closely - I'll take you far 
into peace 

Blind you all must be 
Promises I won't keep 
I hold the statue - To which you bow your heads 
Leave your possessions - embrace me beyond 
The grave 

(Leave them to me) 

Prophet of delusion 
Trust beyond your - life 
Deceiver of believers 
Your destiny's are - mine - Prophet of lies 

Believe in me 
I'll save your soul 
Question me not 
Be safe of harm's reach
