Welcome to extinction
Once full of life
Deep inside
A hazardous city sealed in doom

Society of septic slaves
Building their imminent death
Total fate drawing near
It's only a matter of time

Civility coming for night
Enter their final dream
Nightmares full of fright
Sirens stir the night

Confusion wide awake
Panic fills the wind
Hysteria fills the streets
In danger of demise

[2x]
O four, two six, 1986
All sirens scream
You're forced to flee
The ghost streets
Forever will be of certain disease
Noxious breed
Living in, living in extinction
