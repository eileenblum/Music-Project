Join in the misery - of the world beyond
Where all the suffering - souls of gray belong
So bland
So dark
So bleak
No one hardly speaks
Just staring in a void
Eerily serene - in the...
World
World beyond
World
World beyond
Beyond death!

Disturbing it sure seems - there is no release
Some dwell for minutes - some for centuries
No rules
No rhyme
Or reason
How to break free
Everyone just wanders
Waiting anxiously - in the...
Not dead - or quite - living
No one - ever - leaves
Being dead - is to - be free
Few will - rest - in peace - true peace!

Settle in your misery - of this world beyond
Far behind the living - your death just as far
No hurt
Pain
Or pleasure
Emotions obsolete
Suffering no end
Of purgatory's reach - of the...
World
World beyond
World
World beyond
Beyond death!
