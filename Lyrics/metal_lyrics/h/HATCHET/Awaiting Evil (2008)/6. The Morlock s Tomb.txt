Cast out, sent to explore, your only purpose in life
Knowing that you don't belong, not knowing what you will find
Looking for somewhere to run, another passage to hide
A secret pathway under the ground, your fate soon shortly arrives
Arrives! To die!

Evil eyes, peer through your soul, as you enter the tomb
Locked away entombed for years, a secret world you've exhumed
Nomadic creatures plot your demise, as judgment hour draws near
Cold emotions tearing at you, no way to persevere
Persevere! Die in fear!

[Chorus:]
Deep in the Morlock's Tomb
Where the dark ones rule
Deep in the Morlock's Tomb
Time to meet your doom

Heavy machinery, weapons of madness and war
Locked away entombed for year, their hatred grows more and more
Waiting for our death of death, deep in the sewers they lie
Arranging our total demise, destroying what they despise

[Lead: Ramos]

Visions of death and destruction, now they are seeking revenge
Unbearable suffering for you, anticipating the end
Extermination of the human disease, nobody will be spared
Time has come to say your goodbyes, because this world is now theirs
Running scared! No one is spared!
