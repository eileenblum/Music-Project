Face down in a pool of blood,
Choking on your last breath.
Struck down in the cold of night,
As you stare into the end.
Shrieks of death fill the sky,
Streams of blood capture your soul.
Angels of Hell await,
Sending forth their eternal hate!

Reoccurring reveries of war,
Desolation succumbs to us all.
Lands raped by mortar fire,
Frail shells are reduced to ash.
With rage they engulf all hope,
Spewing for Armageddon's cry
No force any mortal could fend,
Now embrace total death!

[Chorus:]
This is your chance to show their frailty
Crush 'em down with brutal force
My God how mortally inferior
Kill them all with no remorse
Step inside to face this reality
No chance of hope in sight!
Mortal flesh rots for all eternity
Bringing forth eternal night!

Crimson Rains, fall from the sky
Soaking corpses, drenched in blood
Breaths of ash, fill your lungs
Rivers of blood, running cold

[Lead: Ramos]

Embrace the winds of death
No fool will understand
Pathetic word won't subside
Hear them cry in despair
Cities crumble into sand
Blackened skies bring our demise
All signs of life are void
Your frail flesh rotting dead
