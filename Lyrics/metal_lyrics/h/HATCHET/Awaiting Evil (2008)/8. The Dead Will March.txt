Breaking from the tombs with hate, to drink your blood
Tearing at your flesh, there is nowhere to run
Crying to your God, beg for security
Running in despair but there is no sanctuary
Cruelest visions of horror, they want to crush your skull
You've fallen victim, now submit unto their ridicule
Hunting you to the ground, prepare to die
Destroy your will, this fight you won't survive

Coming from the ground creatures of Hell arise
Closing in on you, now meet your demise
Prayers won't be heard for destiny now calls
Their missing never ends until they conquer all
Here them march to the beat of total genocide
To rid the Earth of foolish mortal lies
Armed for the fight they tear you limb from limb
No use in fighting back because you will never

Fight til death - Faceless bodies close in on you
One last breath - Take it in before they bury you
Try to defend - Lifeless hands about to strangle you
One last breath - Now face the horrors that subject to you

[Chorus:]
No place to run, no time to hide
The dead will march
The end is here, your time to die
The dead will march
Killing the weak, watch them fall
The dead will march
The dead ones walk, bow to them all
The dead will march

[Lead: Ramos]

Corpses piled high amongst a burning sky
An ancient oath of blood sworn to take your life
Smell of rotting flesh, you feel closer to death
Putrefying stench, now take your last breath
Haunting chants enhance from everywhere you turn
Closing in on you, now you begin to burn
As they terminate you like a parasite
Sanity wears thin as you prepare to die
