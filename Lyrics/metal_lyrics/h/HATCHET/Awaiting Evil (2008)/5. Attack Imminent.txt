Defy! Attack! Take it fucking back!
Sinister thought now is taking place
Decide, degrade, murder mutilate
Simple human sense has come way too late
Too hard to say to see another day
Take them down in piercing pain
Surprise attack, dressed in all black
We are the souls of the crimson land

To see to be the need to let it bleed
Destroy it all, and end all of your creed
The hunt, the kill, we do it for the thrill
No compassion for the lives now lost
Our kin, will sin, you can not win
Victory is our as it always is
It's too late to turn and fight
Turn and run, try to hide

Attack from the past
Take it all down to the pits of Hell
War, another fight
This is the one that you won't win
Spill pure blood
Impale their hearts and smash their bones
Destroy all life
Nothing remains to save mankind

My storm draws near
Blackening clouds fill the sky
Deafening thunder
My adrenaline starts to rise
My sadist eyes
Fueled above from the lightning sky
I stand and rise
This is my time to shine

[Lead: Ramos]

The hunt is done, dawn now comes
Dead prey as far as the eyes can see
The frail, the weak, all of their creed
One by one fallen unto me
The blood runs free, the streets keep bleeding
Treading knee deep in the stench of their death
Your world is mine for endless time
Your lifeless bodies hang from the sky
