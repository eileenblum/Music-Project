Four walls are closing in
The end is drawing near
Chill cries howl from above
Endless torment for the rest of time
Forced into disillusion
An unforgiving world of lies
Void of all depth, no values
Your death has been designed

Stripped from your mind, your soul
No chance to rid the lies
Use you to gain more power
You've become standardized
Locked up and tied away
Damned is your life for death
Hearing laughter as you fall
Cry alone as you meet your fate

[Chorus:]
No escape, time runs short, the walls are closing in...
Time to die, shelter your eyes, the doors are holding you in...
Break away, your last day, hiding in your fear...
Hit the ground, you've lost your mind, the sound of death is near...
Sealed fate!

As they drain your soul it's a disturbing sight
As they strip you of all your will to fight
Sentenced to a term, they take away your soul
Never ending pain, it starts to take control.
Ripping you apart, it is their only goal
Do only what you're told, it now becomes your role
Time to pay your toll into the afterlife
Chasing what is blind into the frozen night

[Lead: Ramos]

No escape, no way out
They are watching at all times
Sweating now as the hours near
Nowhere to run, you face your fear
Only death closes their reign
Choking now on your dreams you fiend
No hope for exaltion, manipulated destiny
