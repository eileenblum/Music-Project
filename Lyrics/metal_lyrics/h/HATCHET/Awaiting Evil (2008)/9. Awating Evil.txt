Lucifer! His power reigns on all
Satan's army - The ones who burn in hell
Evil legions - obeying their commands
Reign of terror - Die by their hands
Procreate - the wicked to unveil
Full of hate - they cast destruction's spell
Conjugate - ready to deploy
It's too late! They are ready to destroy!

Necro - the dead begin to rise
Hell unleashed - right before your eyes
Evil groans - torment your mind
Every corner - you won't know what you will find

Children scream - eyes filled with tears
You now meet all your darkest fears
Holy terror - army of the damned
Evil torment, rise of the undead

Beating you to the ground your final breath
Awaiting evil
Thirst for blood, reach out for you, face the end
Awaiting evil
Lifeless souls, fall through, the gates of Hell
Awaiting evil
Demons wait, thirsting for, your virgin flesh
Awaiting evil...

Cast from hell, lusting for your flesh
Predator
In the shadows, ready for the kill
Terminate
Legions of the dead lines up ready to destroy
Face the wrath
Sign of evil, the bloodshed fills you with terror
Living dead...

Sweet revenge, your blood is on my mind
Satisfy my need for death and crime
Death will rule, creature of the force
Time is out, the end brings no remorse
Serpents fall, demons take your life
Hell's creation, Satan stands tall
No escape! The evil demon's stride
Face the end! Now join evil's side
