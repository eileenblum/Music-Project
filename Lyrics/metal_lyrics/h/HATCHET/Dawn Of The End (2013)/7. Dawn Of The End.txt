The final day of life
A never ending night
Season of the deceased
Takes our world by storm
The total end is upon
All of mankind will burn
The final hour draws near
Brought by our own fear

The time of life is lost
Self-indulged to death
Satan laughs in flames
God hangs his head in shame
There is none to blame
Except the human race
Self destructive ways
Bring the end of life

The last night
The final dawn
Evil is now upon
Dawn of the end
Mass extinction
Operation kill
The end of our world
Dawn of the end
Dawn of the end

Now to hell we ride
One way ticket to death
Those who did not fear
They will surely die

Those who remain
Cordoned, burned alive
Troops line the streets
Directive shoot to kill...

[Lead: Ramos]
[Lead: Webb]

Now you will smell the stench
The human death
Endless bodies will line
World city streets
The blackened end
All desolation
Mankind is extinct
Erased from this hell!
