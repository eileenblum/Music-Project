Wake into your dreams, nightly terrors that plague you
Shut inside your web of lies
Prisoner of your own demise.
Seeking out the cries, plaguing your subconscious
Daring not know where they dwell, they will hunt you down

Into the night
You try to find, a way to escape
Struggle to fight
your inner lies, learn to embrace
Out of the light
Open your eyes, the way to relieve your mind
Screams of the night!

Clenching your fists, trying now to grip your thoughts
Sanity lost!
Hateful emotions, threaten to tear you in two
Soul consumed!
A schizophrenic mind, thoughts dwell in lunacy
To live, to die, a reason to kill
Above their right, into their hell!

Now crawling closer, you clearly see
It's not those, but you who screams

Through the fog and the mist of the night, you can't believe
It's not the way you predicted to be
The hatred bleeds from the nightmare,
Your dream, the vision you seek
Falling from grace you must now be set free!

Coming to grips, there's one thing to do
Voice in your head, commands death from you!
Screams of the night!

[Lead: Ramos / Webb]

There's no stopping, thoughts come from within
Dreams of death!
Can't control yourself, it's programmed in you mind
Void of restraint!
Now you're awaken, your body craves the kill!
Their lives, yours, victims of prey
Trained to kill, the screams you crave!
