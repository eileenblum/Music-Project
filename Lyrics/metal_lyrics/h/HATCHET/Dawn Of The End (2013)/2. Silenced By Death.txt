To take a stand
Repress control
Silenced by the hands of the unknown
Expose their lies
You're the elite
The one who gives hope to those who die in fear!
Against society
No human dares
To tread the blackened waters of the iron fist!
Time to assassinate
What you despise
They know you're coming, time to stare death in the face!

Death walks alone
Concealed in secrecy
A plot to snuff you out, you will never know!
Your covers blown
You're marked a traitor
You've turned your back, on those who are your leaders
So called Democracy
Or more like Tyranny
They'll stop st nothing, to bring you to your knees!
There'll be no rest
Until there's blood shed
You must decide now, it's your life lost or theirs!

Kill! Whoever is your enemy
Kill! To set yourself free
Lie! They'll never get the best of you
Die! It's your only true relief
Kill! For everything you stand for
Kill! To settle your scores
Lie! Tell them what they wanna hear
Die! If you're dying on your knees
Kill!

To despise the higher powers of all mankind
Designed to bring our demise
To save us from ourselves...
Defied, no turning back to heed their lies
Witness all decline
Obey or face the end
Silenced by death

[Lead: Ramos]

The change is upon
Violence will arise
The weak will fall
Cast to the earth
In total silence!

[Lead: Ramos]
