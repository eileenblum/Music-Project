A broken mind
Forgotten soul
Captivated within
No remorse
Eternal pain
Release your solace to the world
Plot destruction
Hope they suffer
Take the lives by brutal force
Anticipating
What you seek
Eager to watch the pain they'll reap

Evil intentions
Desire power
End of life
Mass extinction
Is what you preach
Make them face the fate they'll meet
Suffocation
Strangulation
Violent murder, seize your world
Initiate
Your desire
Feed your pleasure with their pain!

Sinister thoughts
Life lost
Sinister thoughts
Evil mind
Now watch them fall to their knees

[Lead: Ramos]
[Lead: Webb]

Vacant mind
Seeks only death
Lurk among your thoughts
Evil dwells!
