Deranged for a kill
Give into desire
Stripped of life and game
Farther closer now

Agonized, she's conscious
Final thoughts are left
Tantalizing flesh
Salivating, you wait

Attack with aggression
Victimized of an aid
Blindfold and Chloroform
Now claim your way

Lurching to sight
Seize her with force
To your place, of secrecy
Will not return

Taken to the vanishing point
Forced at the vanishing point
Suffer to the point of no return!

Taken to the vanishing point
Raped at the vanishing point
Suffer to the point of no return!

Taken to the vanishing point
Dead at the vanishing point
Suffer to the point of no return!

No return

Back on she lies
Fear has your soul
Screams as you penetrate
Sodomized to satisfy

Release all your tension
To your satisfaction
Your grin of evil
Now steal her life

Staring down, in vain
Killing with no remorse
Frantic eyes, dying
Now claim your next

[Chorus]
