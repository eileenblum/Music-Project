Unto this plague of life
Consumed by greed
Impartial thoughts desire
Objects of lust
No morality
Products of filth
Stitching our eyes shut
Desensitizing life

Drones of the earth

You're fed endless lies
Taught not to think
You drink it with a smile
Ingest the lies
Corruption of the highest
Propaganda pumped through your veins
Excruciating numbness
Welcome to your freedom of lies

Buy into their regression
Process no reaction
Welcome to your plague

[Lead: Ramos]
[Lead: Webb]
[Lead: Ramos]

A vision of perfection
Enshrouded in their design
Just simple false reflection
False ideas forced
Invite the lies inside you
Now greet them with a smile
This plague is now your fate
The masses under plague
