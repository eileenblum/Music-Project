Vile amputation
Surgical disaster
Reality macabre
Tools of disease
Sick pleasure
They amputate brutally
Wires are used to saw through the flesh
Splintered bones can be seen
Tearing muscles easily
Slice with infected knives
Make incisions blind
Dehumanize
Victim lies asleep
Awakes in agony
Lunacy
[verse 3]
[verse 4 + 5]
[verse 4 + 5]
[verse 1, 2 + 3]
[verse 4 + 5]
Inbreeding creates those endless fools
To please Christ
