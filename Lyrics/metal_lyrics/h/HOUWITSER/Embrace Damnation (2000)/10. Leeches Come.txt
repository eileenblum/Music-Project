Starving and shrivelled, dying for freedom
They gave you money and shelter
Inviolable, stealing us blind
You were raised by our leaders
You gave me shelter, now I want more
Give me, feed me
Your government proclaims
Welfare, estate - demand, receive
I am a god
Uncontrolled
Leeches come
They suck the blood out of our bodies
You gave me shelter, now I want more
Give me, feed me
I am a god
Uncontrolled they live among us
Protected enemies, our brooding constraint
It will not be our downfall
Those greedy cunts will never wake
To see a new day
Uncontrolled they live among us
Protected enemies, our brooding constraint
It will not be our downfall
Those greedy cunts will never wake
To see a new day
Leeches came
They sucked the blood out of our bodies
Our legion comes
Decapitates the parasites
They gave you shelter, we were deprived
You took, we claimed
There's no more god
