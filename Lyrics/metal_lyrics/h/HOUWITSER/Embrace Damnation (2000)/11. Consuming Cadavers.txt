Down here the walls corrode
By the stench of defecation
Children cry endlessly
Held by their dying mothers
The sick are smothered dead and buried naked
Devastating mutilations
War, their source of death

On the surface bombs are falling
Shattering all that stands
Fragments piercing bodies
Tearing human limbs
Blasting corpses away
The earth is strewn with the slaughtered
Shelters open their gates
War, their source of life

They survive by consuming cadavers

Mangled bodies prepared
Demonic hunger for flesh
Creating their private cannibal warfare

Leftovers of the massacre
Stripped skin, bones and intestines
Thrown on a pile in the shelters for the holocaust

Down here the walls corrode
By the stench of defecation
Children cry endlessly
Held by their dying mothers
The sick are smothered dead and buried naked
Devastating mutilations
War, their source of death

They survive by consuming cadavers
On the surface bombs are falling
Shattering all that stands
Fragments piercing bodies
Tearing human limbs
Blasting corpses away
The earth is strewn with the slaughtered
Shelters open their gates
War, their source of life
