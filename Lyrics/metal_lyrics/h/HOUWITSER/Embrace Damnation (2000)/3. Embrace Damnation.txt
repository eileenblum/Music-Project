This nation is sanctuary
Paradise for the lowest forms of life
We're deceived by justice
Reaching pussy verdicts
They lock away the bastards
For several years, to return
With hate they return
A chance to kill more innocent women and children
Terror strikes again
Despair and disbelief
Meat for the butcher
Judgement brings hell on earth
Filthy cowards hide in their cells
The new verdict is unhuman death
No more incarceration
Simply strap them to the chair - or stick the needles in
Chop them in half, hack off their heads
Pulverize their bones
Tear their genitals in two - or nail them to a cross
Dispose their bodies in the flames
Embrace damnation
No more incarceration
Simply strap them to the chair - or stick the needles in
Chop them in half, hack off their heads
Pulverize their bones
Tear their genitals in two - or nail them to a cross
Dispose their bodies in the flames
With hate they return
A chance to kill more innocent women and children
Terror strikes again
Despair and disbelief
Meat for the butcher
Judgement brings hell on earth
[verse 4]
Embrace damnation
[verse 4]
Embrace damnation
