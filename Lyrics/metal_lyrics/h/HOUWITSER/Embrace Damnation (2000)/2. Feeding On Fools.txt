Defaced nation, empty lives surrounding
Famine, infections, return of the primate
Homeless females, willing prey for his sick trade
They trade their bodies for remains
To satisfy his lust
Abduction without even knowing it
Butchery, a normal place at first sight
Once inside a sexual need takes over
Compulsion to rape and come while strangling her
Homeless females, willing prey for his sick trade
They trade their bodies for remains
To satisfy his lust
Abduction without even knowing it
Butchery, a normal place at first sight
Once inside a killing urge takes over
Compulsion to rape and come while gashing her
The deed ends with a livid face
The job begins, the cleaver's fiercely hacking
Chunks of meat
Ripping off her tendons
The bones are scraped clean
Feeding on fools
The hunger grows eating his victim
The job continues, the cleaver's fiercely hacking
Chunks of meat
Ripping off her tendons
The bones are scraped clean
Feeding on fools
Homeless females, willing prey for his sick trade
They trade their bodies for remains
To satisfy his lust
Once inside he rapes and comes while gashing her
The casualties
Chained up in the cellar
Mother told me not to cry
The foul stench of the cellar
