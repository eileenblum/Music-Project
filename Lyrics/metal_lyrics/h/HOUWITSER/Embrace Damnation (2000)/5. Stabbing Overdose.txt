Stabbing overdose
Torture myself murdering
Need to kill the urge
Sucked into the abyss
Stabbing overdose
Cannot force out this drug
Evil seed runs through my blood
Stabbing overdose
Torture myself murdering
Need to kill the urge
Sucked into the abyss
Stabbing overdose
Cannot kill the urge
Want for human blood
Pounding inside my skull
I felt reborn when my dagger first pierced
Her chest caved open, the ribs torn aside
Stabbing in her body for what seemed like an hour
Made me come
I realized this would become my way of life
Cannot kill the urge
Want for human blood
Pounding inside my skull
I felt reborn when my dagger first pierced
Her chest caved open, the ribs torn aside
Stabbing in her body for what seemed like an hour
Made me come
I realized this would become my way of life
My life is deranged
Cannot kill the urge
Need to kill myself
Stabbing overdose
Torture myself murdering
Need to kill the urge
Sucked into the abyss
Stabbing overdose
