Catenate casualties
Chained up in the cellar
Mother told me not to cry
The foul stench of the cellar
These days are not forgotten
Fact is : I'm now in control
Mom and Dad are gazing casualties
Humanoid
Chained up in the cellar
Decomposing parents
Grinning in the shadow
I wonder if they felt my pain
Outside is waiting fresh meat
Inside is burning blind hate
Where would you rather be
Lured down into the cellar
New blood drips on rusty links
Facing these 2 bodies
Casualties humanoid
Chained up in the cellar
Decomposing parents
Grinning in the shadow
Now my family is complete
Renew my hate, looking at you
Outside is waiting fresh meat
Inside is burning blind hate
Where would you rather be
Renew my hate, looking at you
