Warm blood covered my hands,
The rebert of insanity
It makes me do these deeds
Violentic murderer

Forced myself do these horrible slaughters
Enjoying each victim I make
I am a nightmare for those who betrayed me
These graves were created with hate

Mutilate with sharp tools
Incisions till the flesh is gone
Knife carved body parts
Paradise to purgatory

Paradise to purgatory
Disordering anatomy
Inclined to perforate
Paradise to purgatory
Demolishing bones
Can't control myself

Forced myself do these horrible slaughters
Enjoying each victim I make
I am a nightmare for those who betrayed me
These graves were created with hate

Paradise to purgatory

Mutilate with sharp tools
Incisions till the flesh is gone
Knife carved body parts
Paradise to purgatory

Paradise to purgatory

Warm blood covered my hands,
The rebert of insanity
It makes me do these deeds
Violentic murderer

Anger Creates my torment,
Unleasing my vengeance
Flesh upon my tool
Paradise to purgatory
