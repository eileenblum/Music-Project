Pulled apart, maltreated rotting away
You're in state of decay
Pile of meat remnants
I'm addicted to the smell of death
Devour these slaughter remains
Blood leaking corpses covering the earth
Horror, I started to shred
I'm possessed, Hunger for the feast!

Engorging dissolved sorrow measures
Your digested body attracts lots of flies
Disgusting odors fills my sickness
Pure festering mankind, Hunger for the feast

My hunger grows by each infest
Eating lifeless human parts
Unleashing the beast inside me
Festering humans, I am a cannibal

Engorging dissolved sorrow measures
Your digested body attracts lots of flies
Disgusting odors fills my sickness
Pure festering mankind, Hunger for the feast

Flesh grinding I devour
Unusual autopsy
Odor of rotting trial
Hunger for the feast

Dismembering these rotting cadavers
Tasting the raw flesh of decaying corpses
Mucous leaks from their rotten innards
I keep on feasting, Hunger for the feast

Pulled apart, maltreated rotting away
You're in state of decay
Pile of meat remnants
I'm addicted to the smell of death
Devour these slaughter remains
Blood leaking corpses covering the earth
Horror, I started to shred
I'm possessed, Hunger for the feast!

Engorging dissolved sorrow measures
Your digested body attracts lots of flies
Disgusting odors fills my sickness
Pure festering mankind, Hunger for the feast
