Vengeance, my soul is filled with hate against this mess
The day I die there will be no mercy for these fools
Anger, aggressive executions
I will not die... before my victory

Liquidate the venomous

I buried the lie, my mind is clean
Hate turns into these feared deeds

Liquidate the venomous
Adrenaline runs through my veins
Liquidate the venomous
Finally, my mind is clean
