Back on the slaughter field
A place with a blood covered earth
Unround with the smell of victory
Only the strongest survive

Marching, through mutilated torsos
Proud with blood on my hands
Unround with the smell of the weak
Blood flows from our hate

Lifeless bodies is all we left
We march with the flag of death
Buried the weak, this place ours
We are the one who survive

Victory after butchery
No graves will be found
Ashes of the enemy
Damage assessment

Lifeless bodies is all we left
We march with the flag of death
Buried the weak, this place ours
We are the one who survived
