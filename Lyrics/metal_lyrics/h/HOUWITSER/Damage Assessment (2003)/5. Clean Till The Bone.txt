Massacre, obsessed by blood hunger, extreme killing
Butchery, my natural instinct, I'm a carnage
Horrible, the way I let my victims suffer
Carnal incisions, they are all cleaned till the bone

Clean till the bone, my morbid mind will kill them
I cut the flesh aside, no one can stop me
Clean till the bone
Addicted to shred
Fillet these lifeless body's
Undo them of their flesh

Massacre
Obsessed by blood hunger,
Extreme killing
Butchery, my natural instinct,
I'm a carnivore

Addicted to rip her skin
A part of my sadistic mess
My sharp tool is carving deep,
Splattering pieces everywhere

Massacre
Obsessed by blood hunger,
Extreme killing
Butchery, my natural instinct,
I'm a carnivore

Clean till the bone
Facial bones collapse
Clean till the bone
Splintered skulls
Clean till the bone
Carnal incisions
Clean till the bone
Horror, insanity!
