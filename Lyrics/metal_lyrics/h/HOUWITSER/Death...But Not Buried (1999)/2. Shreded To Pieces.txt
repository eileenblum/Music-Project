It tastes so sweet, can you smell it ? -What is this I feel - Roses 
in bloom, April sun and red wine - What is this I feel - Shredded 
to pieces - I take some more from the peach of joy - It all happens 
so fast - Feels like I can walk on air - It all happens so fast - Let the 
sun shine upon me, it's the essence of life - In ecstasy of never 
ending sin, I feel divined - It's like bathing in golden light - Now I
never sleep till dawn - the TV is like my sun- Watching my favorite 
porn - spanking my monkey some more -Am I this shit faced demon 
passed out on the floor - Why did you had to leave me -filthy 
stinking whore - Let the rain fall upon me - it's the essence of life -
In ecstasy from vodka, beer and gin, it feels divined - It's like 
bathing in a pile of shit - I taste a dead rat in my mouth - What is this 
I feel - I throw up from vodka, beer and wine - It all happens so fast - 
shredded........
