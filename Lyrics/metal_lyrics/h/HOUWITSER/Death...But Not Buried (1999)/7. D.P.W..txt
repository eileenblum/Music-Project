Beer barrels open, it's party time -let the alcohol flow -
Fill up the tankards, let the beer foam - thirth half begins -
Abundantly the alcohol flows -feigling club NGAR time -
The grass is our domain -we drink smoke and fly -Eating pizza with Jack
killing another six pack -Watch the sun come up, it's after party time -
Delerious partying wrechmen -
