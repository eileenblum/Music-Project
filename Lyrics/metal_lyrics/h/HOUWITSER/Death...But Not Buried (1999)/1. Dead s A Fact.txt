Life's fact - it ends in death - Dead is a fact for all, king or slave
you get the call - Feel supreme or live in sorrow, face the reaper 
there's no tomorrow - Believe in nothing or believe it all, atheist 

or christian you get the call - the beauty of life it`s the thrill, 
don't know when the reaper will kill - Born with one certainty, 
cross the line there's no way back - Life descended - Death's a fact 
- That's a fact !! -
