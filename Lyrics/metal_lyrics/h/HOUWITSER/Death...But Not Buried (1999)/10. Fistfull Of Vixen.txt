My world turned upside down -living in a void -No one knows to where - 
you left -I'm feeling uncontrolled -In my mind I see your smile -pale white -
skin and big blue eyes -may this thought never fade away -I hope to have 
them everyday -Crazy from your screams -insults and harresments -How I 
hated those fights -I thought of your eyes full of fear -as your pale skin 
turned blue -Covered with blood you never looked so fine -with love I sliced 
you up -the dog enjoyed your grinded bones -for my self I eat your flesh
Your flesh so sweat -lustful tender meat -with love I sliced you up -
In ecstasy of these precious thoughts -
