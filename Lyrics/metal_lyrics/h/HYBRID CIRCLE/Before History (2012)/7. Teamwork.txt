Listen!
Teamwork is to have a common goal!
And struggling to organize themselves as well
To achieve it and fighting for it
And once reached to keep it up well
First the organization chart
Second the right motivations
Third you've to trust the team
Third you've to trust the entire team

[Chorus]
All the population started
To trust us and believe in freedom
I see in their scared eyes
THe desire to brake their hidden chains
They saw the surface during a mission
They found the light and now thy're addicted
The fresh air burns their borken lungs
Their eyes always in darkness now hurts

Team the plan is the following
The virus inside the droid will
Infect the others like a bad cold
The only thing we've to do is to leave it free
I want you to agree this plan
In order to reach the right number of drones
To set free the hole
To set free all the resistance

[Chorus]

But sometimes an own idea
could broke all the teamwork

A little symbol...A simple shirt
Presented to the wrong person

Can trigger the anger of Harvey
And put Derek against you

And the common goal risks to
Reach a big and dangerous fail

We left and returned in three of four
But two of us were steel...

All the population started
To trust us and believe in freedom
I see in their scared eyes
The desire to brake their hidden chains

Teamwork!
