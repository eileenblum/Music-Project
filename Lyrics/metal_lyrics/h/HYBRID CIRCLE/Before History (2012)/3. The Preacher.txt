Sometimes i feel a strange need of blood
And all begins when a way meets another one
So i need some blood when i see you
Lesson number one beware of me

[Chorus]
You cannot understand this
When i see you're face again
I feel you're sicked smell
And i feel the hate in me
So i change my way
Because you make me throw up
I feel a bit nervous man
And i got enough oh you

[You] Try to subvert me
And slyly call me a poorfool man
Lesson number one beware of me
Because i'm not what you are deceiving

[Chorus]

I feel a strange need of blood
And it have to be filled soon
When i have you in front of me
And you're eyes are crossing mine

Don't you make another step
Don't you say another word
I really got enogh of you
I will bury you in the ground

I feel a strange need of blood
And it have to be filled soon
When i have you in front of me
And you're eyes are crossing mine

Don't you make another step
Don't you say another word
I really got enogh of you
I will bury you in the ground
