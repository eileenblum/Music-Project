In the darkness of the sorrow
Away from intrusive eyes
We're about to work on the head
The just captured drone's head

[Chorus]
I cannot belive what i just saw
The enemy took my own appearence
It had my shirt and my kind of pants
My face and hands are the same of it
In the beginning ita was like a drone
But the skin appears make me wondering
Derek and Harvey cannot believe too
We have on hand all we have to now

It seems to operate
But it gives no answer to me
I'll be doing the wrong question?
Or maybe i'll deceiving myself?

Spit out all you're knowledge
You can't see me with you're shining eyes
Spit out all you're knowledge
I'm able to broke you're lucid face

[Chorus]

Never trust the droid is insane
Remember that it is the enemy
It can share our position
With CyberVAC

Look it there is no time
It's going to the end of its life
We must connect to its brain
To catch all the information we need

I cannot belive what i just saw
The enemy took my own appearence
It had my shirt and my kind of pants
My face and hands are the same of it
In the beginning made me scared
But finally it starts to talk to me
I cannot believe what i just saw
It spoke a few but it was enough
