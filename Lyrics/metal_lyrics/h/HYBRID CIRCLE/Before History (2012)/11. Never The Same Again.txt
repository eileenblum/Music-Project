Slowly came the fear
I am feeling so alone here
From the top of this building
I'm looking this wonderful skyline
And it all seems too big for me
And all these lives hangs on me
I've lost a great friend of mine
Now! What else can i lose?

The stake is very high right now
No way out! My destiny won't change
Harvey would have said so
No regrets there is no place for tears
The stake is very high now
This time the priority is Harvey
But the battle no not this time
No more war but revenge

Never the same again

Never the same again
I'll never surrender to the drones
They took away a friend of mine
The mission fulfill the last wish
Of the man who got the resistance
Into blood

I can't believe that you gone away
How could you allow this?
I had to stop you but you always
Wanted to walk your way

Prima has saved the mission
Endorsing your death
I can't believe you gone away
I will avenge you too

I don't have so many time
And cannot bring me down
Xelya has to be set free
CyberVAC has to be destroyed

What can i do with Prime?
He is so powerful with the mind
Able to read all the thoughts
Is he friend or enemy?

Derek has to take your duties
I need a Xelyan at my side
I trust him believe him
And i pray you to wake us

I don't have so many time
And cannot bring me down
Xelya ha so be set free
CyberVAC ha so be destroyed

The stake is very high right now
No way out! My destiny won't change
Harvey would have said so
No regrets there is no place for tears
The stake is very high now
This time the priority is Harvey
But the battle no not this time
No more war but revenge
