Day by day we capture drones
And our army becomes so strong
To strike fear to CyberVAC
One goal one resistance

An H and C over the chest
Of our two tousand of drones
So many fellow but one soul
One symbol one goal one resistance

Every battle empowers us! [You make me bad]
Every fight enlarges the army! [I make you bad]
The old technology is back to us
Beacuse old enemies now work for us

But now something of strange is happening
No more onsets no more enemies! [At our skyline]
Too many days without any change
Is this the calm before the storm?

I don't know what i've to expect now
Is something insane behind the corner?
How many huroles have i to meet on my way?
I have a bad feeling i am feeling in a trap

Now is time to have a briefing
We need to change our strategy
Women and child must return into lair
CyberVAC is about to attack us

Day by day we capture drones
And our army becomes so strong
To strike fear to CyberVAC
One goal one resistance

The floor under my feets shakes
I heard a big blast outside
I got too many thoughts in my mind
Is prime an enemy?

Are women and kids safe into lair?
How many souls have i to lose?
Are women and kids safe into lair?
How many souls have i to lose?
