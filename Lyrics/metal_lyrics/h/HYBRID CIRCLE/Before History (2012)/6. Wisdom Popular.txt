Forced into hiding for good
The guards of the wise are searching for us
Usually this kind of hunt would not bring any good
But this time will mean the turning point of the plan

Again between life and death
But now we have used to
An old man once told me
What does not kill you strenghtens

We have to behave

We have to beheave
Seem silly but we must
Fight those who want to save

We have to behave
But we do nothing
We will simply be captured by force

Again between life and death
But now we have used to
An old man once told me
What does not kill you strenghtens
The door roughly falls to ground
From the inside we watched them
No more fear inside our eyes
But only their scared faces looking the droid

Alone in the cage of prison
My mind way busy by scary thoughts
I must find a way to win over them

We have to beheave
Seem silly but we must
Fight those who want to save

We have to behave
I sill bring them to leave the droid
Between panic and screams the will understand

Again between life and death
But now we have used to
An old man once told me
What does not kill you strenghtens
Again this time we saved our lives
We finally opened the mind to all others
Resistance is becoming a reality
We are not alone CyberVAC will fall
