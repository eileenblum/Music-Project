In this moist lair
As a cage of
Hidden tyrant
We're lost prisoners

And i can't reach
The right reasons why
We can't have our lives control

Hunted by the drone slayers
We can't see a way out
To save our souls
And to see the skyline

I can't go trought this
I need to feel free
I want to breath air
I wish stomp the sand

[Chorus]
I saw the surface during a mission
I found the light and now i'm addicted
The fresh air burns my broken lungs
My eyes always in darkness now hurts
But from sky above came a message
The stranger voice was Isaac the no man
Hope was kindled in my heart
But the mission were to bring the others

Iron and circuits
The base of the drones
Ruthless and logical
Apex of perfection
Carbon nitrogen
The base of Xelyan
Faulty and inlogical 
Apex of biology

I saw the surface during a mission
I found the light and now i'm addicted
I saw the surface during a mission
I found the light and now i'm addicted

[chorus]

The virus source code
Is in our hands
Ready to be understood
And dispacthed

The wish is too stronger to
Remain in silence
I don't want no regret
Is time to behave

I can't go trought this
I need to feel free
I want to breath air
I wish stomp the sand

Say these words following me
I would to listen the liar

I can't go trought this
I need to feel free
I want to breath air
I wish stomp the sand

The wish is too stronger to
Remain in silence
I don't want no regret
Is time to behave
