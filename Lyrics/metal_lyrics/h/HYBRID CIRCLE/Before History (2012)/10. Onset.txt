[Chorus]
Fire at will
No mercy fot the enemy
Fire to everything that moves and not
Fire at will
We must build up a heap of scap
Show your proud and use all your mind

Ready to get inside into factory
Surrounded by fire iron and many threats
And sneaky we can break the entries
And sneaky we can breake the stronghold

Nothing is able to stop us now
Nothing is able to stop our anger
Derek will be here in few minutes
We were organized and you didn't know

We are the earthquake for the drones
Creations escaped from their control
We are able to make their surrender
We have the means to catch the factory

[Chorus]
[Chorus]

We sly get the inside
Under the enemy fire
We could die but we must try
This is the bet for the freedom
Is in our souls is in our veins

We sly get the inside
Is what they deserves
For the pain they gave to us
Into the monster's womb
We're going to turn off the switch
We need it to trick CyberVAC

[Chorus]
