[Chorus]
I see the people beside me
I don't know what they will be
I feel so next to the biggest goal
So proud of the walk we've just done

(I see the people beside me)
(I feel so next to the biggest goal)

Drones are everywhere no more time to
Think
The instinct is now the last way to walk
Between enemies and artilley fire
The final target is destroy the monster

[Chorus]

A handful of sand in my mouth
A rocket opens the ground in front of me
The monster begins to give its best
It doesn't accept the great defeat
But resorts to its worst hopeless act
Reacts with a bad bloody rocket rain
Fire by fire i turn off its voice
Fire by fire i get ready to the final act

I saw my people so afraid
But now i see them a real war
I put my fist toward the air
Let's start the big slaughter of the drones

At the gates of the monster's building
We try to chatch it with a clever deception
My drone steals an enemy soul
It will become my access guarantee

The system is locked by a key
Only Isaac knows the right way
I got three attempts to set us free
I can't go wrong i need to look in my mind

Two attempts are gone so bad away
And i feel the void in my mind
I know no one is able to help me
My people are dying waiting for me
But i feel the answer is definitely in me
Hybrid Circle is the key
How did i not think about it?
Login accepted! Drop the system!

I saw my people so afreaid but now i don't see them in a cage
I put my fist toward the air
Let's do a new begin let's do a new life
