Drones are only stupid bastards
Only bolts scarp and oil
No more brain inside the skull
Only disgusting source code

I remember a guy in the photo
I guess was killed by them
May i understand you're sick
And you'll have your revenge!

[Chorus]
I have to fill my need of revenge
They brutally killed my only child
You have to know he had you're same dream
You have to know i never said this to anyone
I always believed that Harvey was a fool
I took him with me because he believe in this
But now i understand why he is so
His anger his nature his ideals

Dawn cames with another threat
A little point runs toward of us
Our trap doesn't work right
And his anger grows up

The action seems slow
I haven't the time to react

Drones are only stupid bastards
Only bolts scarp and oil
No more brain inside the skull
Only disgusting source code

[Chorus]
