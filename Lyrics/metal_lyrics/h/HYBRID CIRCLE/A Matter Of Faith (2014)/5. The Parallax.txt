[Music: S. Di Cicco / A. Mitelli &amp; Hybrid Circle, Lyrics: S. Di Cicco and G. Constantino]

The parallax makes you see
The world as not it is
The reverse angle of the visual is confusing
The falling down civilization

You're inside an hypercube
Without any reference point
I know you're looking around
Feeling trapped in a maze

Your inability to watch
Won't make you see you're at home
And that your world is burning
For a parallax error

The reverse angle of the visual is confusing
The civilization

I have the right angle
The real visual of the entire
Fuck what you see
Believe in my word and shut up please
The ads in your brain
Makes you like a lazy monkey
Jumping in the jungle
And wasting his lifetime

I know what you see
A bright and brilliant planet
Rich and full of resources
But is a bullshit

The reverse angle of the visual is confusing
The falling down civilization

Behind the mirror you see
There are a lot of closed doors
Follow your primitive form
And open a real dimension

Reach the source of truth
And sit by my side
So that I may show you
The true appearance of the place where you live
