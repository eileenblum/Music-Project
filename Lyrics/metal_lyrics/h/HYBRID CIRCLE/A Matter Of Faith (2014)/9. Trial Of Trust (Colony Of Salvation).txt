[Music: S. Di Cicco / A. Mitelli &amp; Hybrid Circle, Lyrics: S. Di Cicco and G. Constantino]

Oceans of liquid methane
Cannot seems to support life
I choke on the thought of living here
And see home as a point in the sky

I don't want to think
I just want to get to my light
And among the stars I keep trying
To fight the evil near me

This is the colony of salvation
A journey through generations
For years I wanted to kill you
But the purpose stopped me

In the name of evolution
We sold the Earth

And among the stars I keep trying
To fight the evil near me

The human being is now called
To an hard trial of trust
And I'm here on the field
To get the last word
