[Music: S. Di Cicco / A. Mitelli &amp; Hybrid Circle &amp; Felix Martin, Lyrics: S. Di Cicco and G. Constantino]

We're living the end of worship
Where reason doesn't mean contemplate
But dominate everything we see
In order to evolve the race
And get the best gain ever

Curiosity is a key feature
Of the human behaviour
Innovation shapes the future
And men realized that

Science works for man
And God makes the same
If you really be
It's because of your thought
We should have a rational view

This is the age of full rationality
Both God and Science fits together and life
The whole life can be explained so easy
Without any kind of mystery
