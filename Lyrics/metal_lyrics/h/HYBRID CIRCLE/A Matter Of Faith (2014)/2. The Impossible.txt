[Music: S. Di Cicco / A. Mitelli &amp; Hybrid Circle, Lyrics: S. Di Cicco and G. Constantino]

The impossible was made
You've lost the connection
Lethal thing as an inner blade
And not even having a reaction
You missed the faith in this crusade

Was enough to kill him hard
The demon of paranoia
Was enough to kill him hard
Because your life is a chimera

Obsolete!
You didn't follow the instruction
Obsolete!
You can't avoid the collision

You've taken lightly the system
Thinking you can hide your duty
But the system is omniscient
It always find the guilty
The old part is changed dude
The impossible was made to improve

Was enough to kill him hard
The demon of paranoia
Obsolete!
You can't avoid the collision right now!
