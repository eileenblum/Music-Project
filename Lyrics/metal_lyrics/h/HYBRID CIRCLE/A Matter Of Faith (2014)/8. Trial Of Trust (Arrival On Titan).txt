[Music: S. Di Cicco / A. Mitelli &amp; Hybrid Circle, Lyrics: S. Di Cicco and G. Constantino]

I slept so mush and so deeply
That I no longer feel my body
And throwing upon awakening
Seems to be born into the world again

To kill you is impossible
I wonder how I get convinced to work together
It wasn't me

After years of hate and anger
Without trust, the men will be doomed
Without any mercy

I woke up before you
Still in a coma
While my mind is wandering

How to end your life
But I swear, I swear to you
I will let you die alone
