[Music: S. Di Cicco / A. Mitelli &amp; Hybrid Circle, Lyrics: S. Di Cicco and G. Constantino]

Imagination can build a revolution
Able to change the fate of all mankind
Where does I can get math?
And how far can go the mind?
And yet you can see someone miles away
Maybe Drake is not so crazy as they say

Sci-Fi!

For ages men have dreamed of flying
And for many centuries they had fallen bad
But imagination never stops
Icarus made his flight to improve the future lives

Where the computation fail
Dreams leave for the answer
And you have to be quite deranged
To build your own fine theory
Science fiction made the world
Despite you, the unfaithful are at down
