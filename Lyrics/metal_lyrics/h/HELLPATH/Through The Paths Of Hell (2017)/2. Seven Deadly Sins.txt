[Lyrics: Thiago C. MÃ¼ller / Richard A. W. Felix, music: Hellpath]

Inside flesh and skull
Worms are eating their way
In death we're all the same
A decomposing body resting in the grave

Madness in true time
We're still alive in our land
Life passing before your eyes
You see the gates blocking your rage

Virtues of men
There's no sin, just a rotten race
Christians' punishment
Ruling over all freeman

Saints and sinners
Rise or fall

Lust, gluttony, laziness
Envy, wrath, and greed
Pride!

Seven deadly sins
Lies imposed on you

Saints and sinners
Rise or fall

Lust, gluttony, laziness
Envy, wrath, and greed
Pride!

Just a rotten race!
