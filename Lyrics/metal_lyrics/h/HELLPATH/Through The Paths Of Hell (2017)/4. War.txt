[Lyrics: Richard A. W. Felix / Thiago C. MÃ¼ller, music: Hellpath]

War!
Weapons of mass destruction
Killing machines

Stand up in armor
Digging the graves
Fighting all alone
Like a beast in a cage

Like a beast in a cageâ¦

Why?
The world is mad
Victims are dying
Citizens are dead

The troops are suffering
Blood absorbed by land
You don't know why
You still in this war-ravaged land

Like a beast in a cageâ¦

Why?
The world is mad
Victims are dying
Citizens are dead

Warâ¦

Like a beast in a cageâ¦

Why?
The world is mad
Victims are dying
Citizens are dead

Why?
War!
