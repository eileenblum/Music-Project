[Lyrics: Thiago C. MÃ¼ller / Richard A. W. Felix, music: Hellpath]

All the hatred remains
We're stuck in the fire of disgrace
Total control of acts
Growing madness in a massive attack

My desire is my deserving
My connection is mind control
Choice in your hands, change in actions
Self-destruction or self-respect

Unleash the power again
Prepare your feelings for all you can bear
Reclaim your system's command
Your self-respect will drive all your plans

My desire is my deserving
My connection is mind control
Choice in your hands, change in actions
Self-destruction or self-respect

We'll fight fire with fire.
We'll lead the life with wisdom.
From inside your mind connection.
Control your real actions...

Unleash the power again
Reclaim your system's command

My desire is my deserving.
My connection is mind control.
Choice in your hands, change in actions.
Self-destruction or self-respect.
