[Lyrics: Richard A. W. Felix, music: Hellpath]

Sky is turning black
Red clouds are passing by
Human faces not in sight
So you are all alone tonight

Tonight!

Found my way
Against the enemy
Their blood in my hands
Will set me free

Killing strength
Murderer power
Hunting souls only for desire

Your time has come...
Won't have a chance!

Bones to ashes
And, soul to dust!

Now...
Your time has come!
Blood rage and fire!
Your time has come!
Kill for desire!

Hear the whispers
During the day
Voices of the dead
Again and again

Stuck in your mind
Taking control
Their blood is falling
Cold like the snow

Your time has come...
Won't have a chance!
Bones to ashes
And, soul to dust!

Now...
Your time has come!
Blood, rage and fire!
Your time has come!
Kill for desireâ¦

Your time has come...
Won't have a chance!
Bones to ashes
And, soul to dust!

Now...
Your time has come!
Blood, rage and fire!
Your time has come!
Kill for desire...!

Your time has come!
Blood, rage and fire!
Your time has come!
Kill for desire!
