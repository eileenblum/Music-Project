[Lyrics: Thiago C. MÃ¼ller, music: Hellpath]

Living in an underworldâ¦
Ride!

Your mind is a secret place
It's where you hide what you really are
A dark room â Impenetrable
The brain's world is illusion's reign

Unconscious life
Natural machine

Ride!
Ride into the underworld
Unconscious thoughts inside your brain
Ride! Living in an underworldâ¦

The road of dreams is an unreal vision
But you can cross it and feel the wind
This compact division in the human brain
A silent pulse moves this secret psyche

Unconscious life
Natural machine

Ride!
Ride into the underworld
Unconscious thoughts inside your brain
Ride! Living in an underworldâ¦

Let's fucking ride!

Living in an underworld
Ride!
Ride into the underworld

Ride!
Ride into the underworldâ¦

Ride!
