[Lyrics: Thiago C. MÃ¼ller, music: Hellpath]

Survive in this gray future
Concrete like my words
In solid days we're living, death's line crossed my road
My life in this gray culture
Concrete like my world
I never crossed this passage, I made a line of my own

Inside these red eyes I'm seeing
Reflexes of life inside myself
I saw my world decaying
Turning black on the moment of my death

Forever
I'm caged in a blackened future

Survive in a blackened future,
Concrete like myself
Unsolid ways I'm crossing,
Death's line chases my cells

Inside these red eyes I'm seeing
Reflexes of life inside myself
I saw my world decaying
Turning black on the moment of my death

Forever
I'm caged in a blackened future

I'm caged in a blackened future
Survive in a blackened future
Again in a blackened future, forever
