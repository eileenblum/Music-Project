[Lyrics: Thiago C. MÃ¼ller / Richard A. W. Felix, music: Hellpath]

Eternal way â Incisive time
My own decay gives me my rise
Insanity of the universe
A perverse hate erodes my mind

Insanity... Drawing people to believe
Hypocrisy... The dirty words you spit on me

Liar â Words I've heard
Liar â No trust, no fear

The way you lose your fucking time
Your mind abused by every side
Manipulate the mass again
The brutal power still insane

Insanity... Drawing people to believe
Hypocrisy... The dirty words you spit on me

Liar â Words I've heard
Liar â No trust, no fear

Insanity... Drawing people to believe
Hypocrisy... The dirty words you spit on me

Liar â Words I've heard
Liar â No trust, no fear
Liar, liar, liar...
No trust, no fear!
