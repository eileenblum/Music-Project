[Lyrics: Thiago C. MÃ¼ller, music: Hellpath]

Eclipsing the earth, moon and sun
The shadows' lord forges our destiny
Dark territory covered by fog
The earth we know â turned into a dead thing
The chances of them allâ¦

My mind, my truth, my disbelief
We're under pain, under domain
A void that chases all movements
Eternal fear, eternal rage
The chances of them allâ¦

On this new Earth there's a brutal chase
An evil force against our breed
Mankind's killer brought his machine:
The endless' chamber will be your grave
The chances of them allâ¦
The chamber will eternize their fall

Each level raises the pain
Living the rest of life in torture's reign

My mind, my truth, my disbelief
We're under pain, under domain
A void that chases all movements
Eternal fear, eternal rage
The chances of them allâ¦
The chamber will eternize their fall
