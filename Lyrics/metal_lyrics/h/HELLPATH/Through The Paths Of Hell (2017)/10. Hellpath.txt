[Lyrics: Thiago C. MÃ¼ller, music: Hellpath]

Dark fog is covering all the ways
You're blind, you've fear, you're a lost man
You try to follow that sign ahead
The life's essence is in the other side

Passage into the other side.
With life in hands, your soul's alive.
Passage into the other side.
Confront the traps from dismal defiance.

From dark to reality
Hellpath â rise â brutality!
From dark to reality
Hellpath â riseâ¦

Dark fog is blinding everyone
This darkness is feeding your inner fear
Your hope could be your last choice
Your fate is made from your mistakes

Right now you can't see the other way
It's time to face this maze
Right now you can't see the other way
It's time to risk your chance

Passage into the other side.
With life in hands, your soul's alive.
Passage into the other side.
Confront the traps from dismal defiance.

From dark to reality
Hellpath â rise â brutality!
From dark to reality
Hellpath â rise â brutality!
