[Lyrics: Thiago C. MÃ¼ller, music: Hellpath]

Aggressors of a nature state.
The human war against the green.
The violence, death in your hands, your greed is causing this revenge.
Volcano blasts and hurricanes, the last seaquake led you to the grave.
Like the energy of a first breath, Earth retaliates in full attack.

Horror and disasters
It's nature's revenge

Forest exploitation, they're stealing our riches
Polluting our waters and buying our ore
The world still sleeping, man is still the plague
And fiction turns to reality
And nature is not the same

The evolutionary factor is the only hope
But not for this time, much less for our race

Horror and disasters
It's time for revenge!

When the flood invades your home
When dust from the rubble is covering your face
When you lose your home in a landslip
Who cares for the others' suffering?

Revenge! Revenge!

Horror and disasters
It's nature's revenge

A molded civilization, our life industrialized.
We're losing our origin, we're wasting our life
The world population is breathing poisoned air.
This toxic contamination infected all mankind.

Revenge! Revenge!
Nature's revenge!
