I pledge unbridled malevolenceI'll stop the sunFamine, thirst and pestilenceUntil this is undone Barrenness will fall across this landAn eternal droughtUntil I feel the touch of her handHades cast her out We'll be togetherWe'll be togetherWe'll be togetherWe'll be together I am the season of sterilityGoddess of fertilityA horse-headed deityThe seed that burns in PersephoneFrom this day forth Blown awayBlown awayBlown awayBlown awayForever
