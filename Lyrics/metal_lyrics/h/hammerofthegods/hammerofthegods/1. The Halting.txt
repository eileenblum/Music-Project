Swords, axes - forged by my own brandLame, cast down from my mother's handThrown from heaven to my fall from gracePig ugly - fire hides my face Gross, crippled beyond all repairFree falling to Sintian careFire... the mountains all over this earthAre on fire, on fireThis is when you fucks will burnRight now Hath, reject me, torn from my own throneTrapped, fettered, this is now your home Fire Fire hides my face I have no motherI have no motherI have no motherI have no one, noNothing
