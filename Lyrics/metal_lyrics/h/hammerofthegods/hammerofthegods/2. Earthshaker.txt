EarthshakerStorm makerOh Harboured amongst colts and lambsFrom the fate of father's handsSovereign of the ocean floorOfferings from every shore Oh, EarthshakerRape what you know and seeds that are sownThis is warHold on to something that cannot be nothingThen this is the voice of the now Beclouded by a Northern hallWood and oil, a waterfallTo wash the plain a monstrous floodExpel the stain of Attic blood Attic blood I'll shake your ground I'll shake your groundI'll fuck this townI'll bring you all...Down
