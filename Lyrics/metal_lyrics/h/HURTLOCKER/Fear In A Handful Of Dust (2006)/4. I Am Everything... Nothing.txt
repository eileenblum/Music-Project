I am nothing to you!

Iâve been gutted out from the inside
Another hollow shell left by the roadside
Another broken man better off forgot
Deciding contradictions by my fucking grave plot

I have seen the end and itâs all too clear
Shallow breath, creeping death as I blindly hang here
Too many failures in my head and I canât get them out
Still I smile in denial as you point them out

I am something, nothing
I am everything, nothing
I will leave you nothing
I am everything, nothing

I am not confused by this catastrophe
Hey, Mr. Big Shot, take a fucking shot at me
I am everything and I wonât forget everything that you havenât mentioned yet

I am full of shit yet you hang on words that I donât regret
Thatâs why I fucking ramble on
I will dig this hole so I can climb in and watch the sunset on another end

I am something, nothing
I am everything, nothing
I will leave you nothing
I am everything, nothing...

I canât believe you did this
You left me in this hole
A shallow broken man
My life beyond my control

Nothing!

I am something, nothing
I am everything, nothing
I will leave you nothing
I am everything, nothing

I am...
I am...
I am...
Nothing!
