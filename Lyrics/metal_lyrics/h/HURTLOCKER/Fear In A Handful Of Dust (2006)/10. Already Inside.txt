You wanted to give me something I already own
You wanted to disillusion me
Something I fucking found on my own

You canât give it to me
I will take it away

You needed to sell me something already inside
You felt that I needed a mouthful of your fucking pride

Your hatred lives in me
Something I get for fucking free
No sale signs, no dollar buys
Just pure hatred for fucking me

And I needed for you to sale me
Some more of those drugs
That make me itch inside my head
I look around, nothing but pain

You fucking lied
You ripped my goddamn soul inside
You canât give it to me
I will take it away

You canât give it to me
I will take it away
