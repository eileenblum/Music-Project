Shadowed by the clouds of doubt, my determined disbelief
Bounded by the need to break down everything I once believe
Trapped inside a meaning that I cannot figure out
Held down by the reasons that haunt me whenever youâre around

You canât believe it
You are not even dead
There are no symptoms
Itâs just in your head

Crawling out from underneath a wall I built inside my head
Counting every friend Iâve lost along the path of the dead
Raging into nothingness for something unregained
Begging for emptiness that I always have retained

You canât believe it
Youâre not even dead
There are no symptoms
Itâs just in your head

Itâs all in your head
Itâs all in your head
Itâs all in your head
Itâs all in your head

I canât help it
I dream of suicide
Thereâs no stopping
This pain that boils inside me
There is just a pile of dust
When the storm comes
I will go where I must
