Goddamn reflection!

So whoâs the fool?
You are, you fuck
So says goddam reflection
Thoughts wander by
I try and catch but thereâs no real definition

Life coming clear but not too kind
Itâs my life, you can keep it
I try too hard but whoâs to say
My dreams they will not stand up

You could only wish that we would quit
Self-destructive sewerâs not an option
Too drunk with rage, too blind with spite
I only live to prove you wrong

I stand here isolated
Mutilated, recreated
Fuck your hatred
Mine is stronger
So much hate
Mine will last longer

Goddamn reflection
A lethal engine
Goddamn reflection
Goddamn, goddamn!

Goddamn reflection!

I stand here unbeat and unscarred
Your words canât hurt my brick wall
You are powerless, almost forgot
Into your face I spit

You could only wish that we would quit
Self-destructive sewerâs not an option
Too drunk with rage, too blind with spite
I only live to prove you wrong

I stand here isolated
Mutilated, recreated
Fuck your hatred
Mine is stronger
So much hate
Mine will last longer

Goddamn reflection
A lethal engine
Goddamn reflection
Goddamn, goddamn!

You canât break me down
Stabbing your eyes out
You are not my friend
Youâre my goddamn reflection

You canât break me down
Stabbing your eyes out
You are not my friend
Youâre my goddamn reflection
