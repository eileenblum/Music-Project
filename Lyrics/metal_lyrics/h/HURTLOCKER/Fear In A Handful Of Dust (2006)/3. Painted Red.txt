This is my delusion
Itâs not your illusion
This time we wonât fucking fall
Itâs my battle call

Itâs your painted face
Your cities burned and raped
You fall into the wake
Death creates your fate

You fall
You prey on confidence
So pray
I donât give a shit
Fuck you
You ended my way of life

Burn like a premonition
Lack, lack of your religion
Hate, refuse their god and paint them red

You feel this was easy
He looks down on you
I donât think youâre ready
If so make our mind up

Decided to fly away
Our pride all strapped in
Bow down because of this
Fuck off not on your life

You fall
You prey on confidence
So pray
I donât give a shit
Fuck you
You ended my way of life

Burn like a premonition
Lack, lack of your religion
Hate, refuse their god and paint them red

Paint them red!

Time for the sleeping to awake
As we hate your faith will shake
Pissed off, fuck off, stand off
You bet not on your life

Decided to fly away
Our pride all strapped in
Bow down because of this
Fuck off not on your life

You fall
You prey on confidence
So pray
I donât give a shit
Fuck you
You ended my way of life

Bun like a premonition
Lack, lack of your religion
Hate, refuse their god and paint them red
