Iâve already made up my mind, fuck you
Canât understand what you want me to do?
Bleeding for us, now Iâm bleeding trough you
Why canât you just go?

Leave me alone like before
Paying me off, locking the doors
No healing of scars, just salting of sores
Why wonât this just end?

This life is mine
This pain is mine
Although unkind
I donât need you

Sickness, no cure
Ending, unsure
I will endure
I donât need you

Why do you bite the hand that feed you?
Pulling back the nub, Iâm bleeding

Pulling back the nub, Iâm bleeding
There is no cure that supersedes you
There is no cure!
I donât think I fucking need you

Iâm sorry, oh god, I take it all back
It canât be your fault that I fell through the cracks
Patience and virtue all that you lack
Goddamn, I hate you!

Your penance is finally served
Alone and forgotten is what you deserve
Leaving the past destroyed in your wake
Absolution first!

This life is mine
This pain is mine
Although unkind
I donât need you

Sickness, no cure
Ending, unsure
I will endure
I donât need you

Why do you bite the hand that feed you?
Pulling back the nub, Iâm bleeding

Pulling back the nub, Iâm bleeding
There is no cure that supersedes you
There is no cure!
I donât think I fucking need you

I donât think I fucking need you
There is no cure that supersedes you
There is no cure!
I donât give a fuck what you do
I donât think I fucking need you

My god
Itâs just amazing how everything comes to an end
I donât need you
A drop in the bucket, so fuck it, you win
You canât love me
Bury your dead to cover your sin
Think you missed on
You run and you beg and you crawl to the end
I donât need you

This life is mine
This pain is mine
Although unkind
I donât need you

Sickness, no cure
Ending, unsure
I will endure
I donât need you

Why do you bite the hand that feed you?
Pulling back the nub, Iâm bleeding

Pulling back the nub, Iâm bleeding
There is no cure that supersedes you
There is no cure!
I donât think I fucking need you
