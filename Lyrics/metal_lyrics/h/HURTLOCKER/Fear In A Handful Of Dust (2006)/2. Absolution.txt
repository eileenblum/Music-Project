Raging all, the dead end roads of all the things I did before
Take a fucking look inside before you try to start a war
Dragging through the waters of a past thatâs all but dead and gone
Be careful what you open up, these wounds have been here far too long

Now that you can see the end is nothing but a twisted thing
What would you decide inside if you could strike the breath from me?
Never won a fucking thing, failureâs what you give to me
Hoping that you never see what it is, you break in me

I am not your pawn or play thing
You donât know a thing about me

Sitting here with my head in my hands
No absolution from my sins
As the pain it comes again
As the pain it comes again

Empty bottles, broken glass
When will I learn itâs what I deserve?
Iâll never see the curve

I am not your pawn or play thing
You donât know a thing about me

Sitting here with my head in my hands
No absolution from my sins
As the pain it comes again
As the pain it comes again

Empty bottles, broken glass
When will I learn itâs what I deserve?
Iâll never see the curve

Raging all, the dead end roads of all the things I did before
Take a fucking look inside before you try to start a war
Dragging through the waters of a past thatâs all but dead and gone
Be careful what you open up, these wounds have been here far too long

Now that you can see the end is nothing but a twisted thing
What would you decide inside if you could strike the breath from me?
Never won a fucking thing, failureâs what you give to me
Hoping that you never see what it is, you break in me

What it is
You break in me!
