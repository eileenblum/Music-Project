No one, now what?

Please, donât try to follow
I could give two shits about you
Good luck with your motives
You think what the fuck you want to
I donât think you understand
That all your shit is not my problem
You might say I condescend
But Iâve always been above you

Fuck it, itâs over, believe it
Truth lies, deceive it
I donât know why I stand for this
Fuck it, itâs over, believe it
Truth lies, deceive it
Fuck you and your motherfucker

No one, now what?
No one, now what?

Believe in your brother
Where exactly does that get me?
Accept, realize, discover
You donât give a fuck about me
Now Iâm in the shadows of your cause
But whatâs all this for?
You will never listen
Fact is Iâve said all this before

Fuck it, itâs over, believe it
Truth lies, deceive it
I donât know why I stand for this
Fuck it, itâs over, believe it
Truth lies, deceive it
Fuck you and your motherfucker

No one, now what?
No one, now what?

Your hate is swallowing me
I think itâs hard to believe
Everything that you do is a smoke screen
Another see-through disguise
You lie in bed with your lies
Another bullshit reason for living

It all comes back in the end
When youâre alone with your sin
When all your stones have been thrown
Who will you blame?
I hope you wallow in shit
Never forgive or forget
That youâre the one who made the bed youâre in

No one, now what?
You believe in no one
