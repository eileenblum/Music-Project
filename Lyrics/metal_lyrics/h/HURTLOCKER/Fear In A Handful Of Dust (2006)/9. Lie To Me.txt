Lie to me!

I was better off not knowing
Believing that you were just tired of me
Now I donât know what to think
I want all my blindness back

You took all that I had and wrapped it up inside
Now youâre dying on me
No fucking way
I have never seen your face

No!
Lie to me!
Please!
Lie to me!

Now that Iâve seen the truth you canât take it back
Now that Iâve seen the light
My god, he turns his back
Drowning in denial as you fade to black
Is this the fucking end?
I wonât let you go!

Just leave me, just die
All alone in my pool of guilt
Isnât that the outcome anyways?
Why postpone to feed me hope?

Iâd give up anything just for one last glance
But it never is to be a victim of circumstance

No!
Lie to me!
Please!
Lie to me!

Now that Iâve seen the truth you canât take it back
Now that Iâve seen the light
My god, he turns his back
Drowning in denial as you fade to black
Is this the fucking end?
I wonât let you go!

I know youâve heard these lies
Before you found them crumbles at your doors
Now you know these lies are true
I donât deserve to be with you
Everything that I hold, dear, means nothing
When I hold you near me
Everything that I thought was wrong
It all ended up in this song
Let me go

Now you see that I donât have a problem
Another fucking selfish belief...

Lie to me!

Wishing I could cut it out
Place it with my selfish doubt
Fuck, this shit wonât go away
Needs to find another place to hide

Never seen my saving grace
Never have I seen your face
Wishing that you would just lie to me
Fucking lie to me!
