Sacrificing the truth just to fuck with me
Youâre just enforcing the proof of this conspiracy
Everything that you do is just disgusting me
I will not let this go!

You live a lie
You live that lie
Iâd rather die
Iâd rather fucking die
You live a lie full of denial
Now you pull that thorn from my side

I canât believe
You will not let this go
I canât conceive it
My time means nothing to you

This is the end of the age of innocence
I prefer the blindness, I refuse to reminisce
Cry all you want, I will not take offense
This is the end of the age of innocence

You live a lie
You live that lie
Iâd rather die
Iâd rather fucking die
You live a lie full of denial
Now you pull that thorn from my side

I canât believe
You will not let this go
I canât conceive it
My time means nothing to you

This is the end of the age of innocence
I prefer the blindness, I refuse to reminisce
Cry all you want, I will not take offense
This is the end of the age of innocence

I made my mind up long ago
These dreams are mine and I wonât let
Everything that you, everything that youâve shown
Comes between me and my sins

Youâre just discussing the facts right here in front of me
One hand behind you back while you call for piece
Everything that you do it just refuses me
I will not let this go!

Redirecting the blame just the save some face
How far was the fall when you fell from grace?
Keep looking at me, Iâll put you in your place
I will not let this go!

This is the end of the age of innocence
I prefer the blindness, I refuse to reminisce
Cry all you want, I will not take offense
This is the end of the age of innocence
