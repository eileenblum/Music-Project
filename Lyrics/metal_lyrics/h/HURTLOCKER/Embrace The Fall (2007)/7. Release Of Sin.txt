[Music: Franrick, Moe, lyrics: Belcher]

You always find a fucking way to shove it back in my fucking face
I hope I live to see the day

I won't take this anymore!

I twist and then I snap your neck
I'll turn your life into a wreck
I'll make these nightmares go away

I won't take this anymore!

You make me feel like I could stay inside my shell wither away
You make me feel I am wrong though I've been right here all along

These thoughts make me feel like I am sick
Just another desperate piece of shit
I'm more pathetic than I sound
I live my life under your ground

Release of sin!
Release of sin!

All I do is sit in my decay while all the others move away
I'm frozen in captivity

I won't take this anymore!

My wounds won't heal my scars are fresh
My life's like never ending death
I'm nothing but eternity

I won't take this anymore!

You make me feel like I could stay inside my shell wither away
You make me feel I am wrong though I've been right here all along

These thoughts make me feel like I am sick
Just another desperate piece of shit
I'm more pathetic than I sound
I live my life under your ground

Release of sin!
Release of sin!

You make me feel like I could stay inside my shell wither away
You make me feel I am wrong though I've been right here all along

These thoughts make me feel like I am sick
Just another desperate piece of shit
I'm more pathetic than I sound
I live my life under your ground

Release of sin!
Release of sin!
