[Music: Franrick, lyrics: Belcher]

Accepting ignorance
Bent on destroying bliss
I will always be the one I choose to fear

My God has no idea
We're meant to burn down here
Drowning in the anger and swallowing my fate

Turning back to meaning
Whispers turn to screaming

I toss to wind the reasons
Inviting in the demons

And there I go again
I'm pissing in the wind
Eyes wide open as the devil pulls me down

I know only lies
I'm drenched in my demise
I'll have another before we start another round

I've made a mess of everything I've ever touched
I'm not Midas, there can't be any gold
As long as there is breath in me there'll be no trust
None so precious and no so bold

Nothing but a ruthless liar
Nothing but a useless fuck

Don't reflect on me your sense of worship
I'm not your god, I don't care that much

I am my own disease infecting what I please
Hands held open as I plot to stab your back

Do you believe in me?
Is this all you see?
Hanging yourself while I feed the rope its slack

Turning back to meaning
Whispers turn to screaming

I toss to wind the reasons
Inviting in the demons
