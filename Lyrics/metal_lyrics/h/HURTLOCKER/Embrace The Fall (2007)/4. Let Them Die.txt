[Music: Franrick, Moe, lyrics: Belcher]

You make believe that you hold no sin
But I see the holes in your plans
You stand and judge with your bloody hands
Yet I can smell the shit that you bathe in

I see you dying inside
I see you trying to hide

You can't leave without me
You can't go before my time
You can't live without me
You can't decide so let them die

Let them die!
Let them die!
Let them... die!

I've seen the truth in your eyes
I've seen the lies that let you shine
It's time to recognize me
It's time for truth
Time to testify

Scream from the holy mountain
Rage from the walls that held you in
Break from the chains that surround me
You can't believe so I'll let you in

I see you dying inside
I see you trying to hide

You can't leave without me
You can' go before my time
You can't live without me
You can't decide so let them die

Let them die!
Let them die!
Let them... die!

You can't leave without me
You can' go before my time
You can't live without me
You can't decide so let them die

Let them die!
Let them die!
Let them... die!
