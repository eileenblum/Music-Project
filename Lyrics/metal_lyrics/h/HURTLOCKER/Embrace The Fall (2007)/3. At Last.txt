[Music: Franrick, Moe, lyrics: Belcher]

These dreams are mine for the taking
Another bullet pushing through the skin
Anchored down by the hate of no one
Suffer through the reckoning

Blinded by the need to reconstruct my life
My focus on your ghost to carry on this fight

My ignorance re-altered
My arrogance rebuilt
Your innocence no longer spares you from the blood that's spilt

You can't blame this all on me!

You had your hands in the dirt
You had your chance to shine
Thank God you are not my burden
At last no longer mine

At last no longer mine!

I could pull back the skin until the blood flows
Surrender my heart into your undertow
I could tell you the truth if you want me to
Never falling from grace like I used to do

Unforgettable face passing through the glass
Undeniable trace of my tortured past
What am I to you but a catastrophe?
The reflection of you is looking back at me

We spend our life together
Fight against the common sense
Our lives in constant unrest
Just to serve the convenience

You can't blame this all on me!

You had hands in the dirt
You had your chance to shine
Thank God you are not my burden
At last no longer mine!

These dreams are mine for the taking
Another bullet pushing through the skin
Anchored down by the hate of no one
Suffer through the reckoning

Blinded by the need to reconstruct my life
My focus on your ghost to carry on this fight
