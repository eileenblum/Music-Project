[Music: Franrick, Moe, lyrics: Belcher]

I am the chosen one
I'm sent to burn you down
I am the empty one
The scream without the sound

I am the hollow black
Confess or shed your skin
I am the devil's love but the devil's not my friend

I am napalm
I am napalm

Death comes for everyone
The wicked and the pure
For me there is no cure

Befriend the little horn
He is behind the wall
Deliver unto him your soul if you should fall

I will hold your hand
And I will show you peace
I will quench your thirst with the fire from the beast

I am napalm
I am napalm

Death comes for everyone
The wicked and the pure
For me there is no cure

I'll take you to the gates
But then I'll trade you in
I'll laugh behind your back while I barter with your sin

I come for everyone
For me there is no time
I'm there at your first breath and I'll be there when you die

I am napalm
I am napalm

Death comes for everyone
The wicked and the pure
For me there is no cure

I am napalm
I am napalm

Death comes for everyone
The wicked and the pure
For me there is no cure
