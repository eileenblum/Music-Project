[Music: Moe, Franrick, Jurgevich, lyrics: Belcher]

They spread their lies a disease
Then hide so no one can find them
They write it all in Japanese
Dumb us down so no one can fight them

I know the truth, I've seen the light
I'm blinded and won't let them stop me
I'll spite them all and blaze the path
Burning bridges as sure as I find them

I will not fall
Silence will not come
This can't be all
I'm not the one
I'm painted in
Not figured out
This is the end
I have no doubt

They pave way, turn us slaves
Cover up the lies and the scars
I will call them out from the mountain shout
Who the fuck do you think you are?

We are not alone, a fucking army strong
And we'll throw the kings from their thrones
Re-writing history is not up to me
We'll spread the truth while we dance on their bones

They built the cross to what it is
They pulled the sky down around us
They kill our youth without a glance
Drain the blood from the weak but the righteous

They are the ones who said kingdom comes
To the ones that follow their bullshit
They stole the word turned it inside out
If you live then you'll live to regret it

They pave way, turn us slaves
Cover up the lies and the scars
I will call them out from the mountain shout
Who the fuck do you think you are?

We are not alone, a fucking army strong
And we'll throw the kings from their thrones
Re-writing history is not up to me
We'll spread the truth while we dance on their bones

Blame me for all your mistakes!

They pave way, turn us slaves
Cover up the lies and the scars
I will call them out from the mountain shout
Who the fuck do you think you are?

We are not alone, a fucking army strong
And we'll throw the kings from their thrones
Re-writing history is not up to me
We'll spread the truth while we dance on their bones

Blame me for all your mistakes...
