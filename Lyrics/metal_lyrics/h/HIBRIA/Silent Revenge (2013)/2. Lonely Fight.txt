[Lyrics by Camargo]

I don't trust any of you
I don't need any of you
Why not prepare justice with my hands?
You betrayed me causing pain, taking all my heart away
Where are you?
What goes around, comes around
All my days, I'll hunt you 'til the end

Start crawling on the floor
You will be my prey
It's payback time
Wondering why, who the fuck am I?

I don't know anyone to trust - Lonely Fight
My life inside a solitary shell
I'll get to break free from the prison inside
Then I'll smash you down to death

Every day and every night
Sure he knows his life is mine
I can see her pain surround me and I know it's only me
I close my eyes and I need to hear her voice - begging for - REVENGE!

Where are you?

Lonely Fight
