[Lyrics by Camargo]

Early in the morning
Only flashes on my mind
I've been loving you for years and tears away
I've taken all I wanted
I've been lost and despaired
Hell knows I've grown so sad
Gosh, life is so unfair

Words will not relieve my pain (Am I ever smiling again?)
She will never be back home (tears away)
So my heart is crashing
It burns in so much pain because I remember your love

Should I leave it behind?
Shall I keep burning?
