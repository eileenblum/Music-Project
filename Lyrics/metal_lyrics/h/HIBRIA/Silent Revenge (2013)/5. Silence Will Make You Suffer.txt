[Lyrics by Sanson/Camargo]

Living as a stranger
All I feel is my anger
Justice will fall on you, reckless man
Facing all the emptiness, melting all my happiness
Falling apart while you're not confined

It's getting near now
Silence will show you the way and how your mind will kill you
It's getting closer now
I'll give you one last chance to realize
Soon I will kill you!

I'll chase you
I'll drag you to Hell
I'll raze my future just for you

I wish it were so different
Now I got my revenge
Justice will fall on you, reckless man
Could I live an emptiness?
Where is all the happiness?
Trying to live while you're not confined

It's getting near now
Silence will show you the way to die
The pain will kill you
It's getting closer now
When every second agonizes
Soon I will kill you!

Suffer... Suffer...

Silence will make you suffer
