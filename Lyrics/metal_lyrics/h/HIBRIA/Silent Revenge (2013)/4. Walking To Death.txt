[Lyrics by Sanson/Camargo]

One strike, one chance
That's how life is
Kill with guts, your fears
To pay, the price
Strength must be your name

You'd better make your blood burn inside your veins
Once you bring to life all your fears and disgrace

Say your fears from the past
You're a shame and you stay alone
Not a tear, clear your regrets
WALKING TO DEATH

Mess up some lives
And fool your friends like a puppet game
To match your pride with all losers around you

I'll let you stay behind
Time for clear minds
I'll let you stay behind forever
You're a shame
