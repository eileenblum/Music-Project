[Lyrics by Sanson]

I'm not here to save you
No one can defend you
I'll get inside your mind

I will stay behind you
All your life will break through
Four walls and no one to confess

Calling up the past by words and memories
Changing all of our life line
Watching only dust and ashes
Even past decisions can bury you

I know you want a bullet
To ride inside your head
Forever you'll be burning
And suffer in the place that you belong

A passion can be fiery and miserly,
Violent and frenzied
What is right for the roots of love?

I'm not right
I'm not wrong
I will make it on my own
That's my life from now on and on
