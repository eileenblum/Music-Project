[Lyrics by Sanson]

How could I know that all I dreamed would fade away?
That anytime my blood would freeze and stop my way

No mercy for your life
No time to say goodbye
I'm falling down but I'm revengeful

You're in my head
You're not already dead
Love will never end
Deadly Vengeance

When you erased "my love" from me you felt free
That every step you took would break my heart in two

So I'll never close my eyes
Until you pay the price
Then will come the flames that will feed my veins

Look in my eyes
What do you see?
I am the anger that you will see
You raised this pain
Now I can feel
All the memories of my frozen dreams
You took my passion
You gave me pain
By your creepy love game
Now I am stuck for all that you've sinned

You're in my head
You're not already dead
Love will never end
Deadly Vengeance
I'm in deadly vengeance
