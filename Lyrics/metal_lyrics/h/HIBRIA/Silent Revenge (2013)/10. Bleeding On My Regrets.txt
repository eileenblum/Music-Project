[Bonus Track][Lyrics by Sanson]

Hard to believe that you want me alive
But you do not know if I will survive
Make my own luck to play your mind game
Fucking with my life it's not the same

Drowned in my tears I feel cold
Drowned in my tears, where is my strength?

Now I'm stuck here inside
I won't survive
Bleeding on my regrets
Stuck here inside
I won't survive
I'll meet the end bleeding on my regrets

Now I'm trapped and I can't see the sun
Eating what's left of my festering past
I made my choices and my crush died
A love that was once for me denied

I had my choices
Even if someone had to die
Imaginations from inside
But I bet I would do it again with pride

Stuck here inside
I won't survive
Bleeding on my regrets
Stuck here inside
I won't survive
I'll meet the end
Bleeding on my God damned regrets
