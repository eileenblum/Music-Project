[Lyrics: Panichi]

[Verse 1 (Black Hawk)]
You made me stand
The pain of fire burning all my veins
Frozen remembrances
We dream to meltdown to live it all again

[Bridge 1 (Shiny Blade)]
Living under ice
Is our battle lost?
Left behind we were but our men are marching on

[Chorus (Black Hawk)]
Please make me believe in
There is a spark to light me at all
I'd burn myself to melt it down
Not to be living under ice

[Verse 2 (Black Hawk)]
My latest breath of fire
Struggles on to make you blind it all again
I'm tortured by time
My fuel is freezing and so my will to fight

[Bridge 2 (Shiny Blade)]
Make my wonder why
I shall not believe
In everlasting coldness if we're
Living under ice

[Chorus (Black Hawk)]

[Ripper]
To melt the ice around you light your soul
And burn the limits inside you
Your heat will start the flames
Of the encaged men
Melting down the cage

[Chorus (Black Hawk)]
