[Lyrics: Panichi]

[Verse 1 (Ripper)]
You were defeated one more time
By the faceless in charge
Ruler of lives
You've never lived your real fate
Cause you were undesired
Over and over the times

[Bridge 1 (Ripper)]
Burning and dying in vain
Steel Lord look deep at my light
Come on - watch your lives all together
Come! See yourself thru (time)

[Chorus (Ripper)]
The past life vision is now your prize
Catch it and use it to change your life line

[Verse 2 (Ripper)]
You tried hard to show the world
The Inquisition was wrong
You burned as a witch
You wanna leave the revolution
To have freedom of speech
You were shot by the Berlin wall

[Bridge (Ripper)]

[Chorus (Ripper)]

[Steel Lord]
I don't wanna have this feeling any more
Not accomplish what I fought for
Now it's my turn to change it all
Anger is my fuel to destroy
Mercy and justice to whom will die
Freedom of mind to the land I will fight for

[Steel Lord]
I won't believe in their justice
I won't be trapped once again
Death to the ones who slave minds
Strength and honor to all who will fight
Pride and glory to all survivors

[Chorus (Ripper)]
