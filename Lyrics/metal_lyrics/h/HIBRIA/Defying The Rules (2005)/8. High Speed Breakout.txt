[Lyrics: Panichi]

[Verse 1 (Narrator)]
Speeding up on wasted lands
They ride across sand shades
The gateway they will reach or aim at
Bravely die for

Hearing thunders from the hills
Suddenly they freeze
A bright blinding lightning storm
Turns night into day

[Bridge (Narrator)]
Come the Journey Lightning
The tale turns to truth
They're now stronger

[Chorus (Rebels)]
We are the lightningstorm
Riders of fate
High speed breakout is taking place
We are the lightning storm
Riders of fate
High speed breakout to the gateway

[Narrator]
The journey Lighting has finlly found
The real warriors the Beasters shall join

Speeding up to join the Beasters on hill
They are under deadly attack
Faceless spell no longer threats the trespassers
They can now trap them on their rear

[Mr. Faceless]
Yeah, I feel them near
High speed approach
Surrounding us here
Dig on our rear
Trenches of ice to hold their attack

[Narrator]
Up from the hills they see
Behind the trenches fire
On horsepower rage the Hoggers attack
Exhausted Beasters yell
Hailing the Hoggers force
Inspiring themselves to resist

The lightning Storm
Roughly approaches
High speed breakout is taking place

[Chorus (Rebels)]
We are the lightning storm
Riders of fate
High speed breakout now took its place
We are the lightning storm
Riders of fate
The high speed breakout
Took the gateway
