[Lyrics: Panichi]

[Verse 1 (Sharp Knife)]
Hurry up,
The time to attack it is near by
Under the moon glow our swords will slash the lies
That were always told

Faceless slaves,
Your shields aren't enough for the furious swords
Look the reality and think by yourself,
Is the world free?

[Bridge (Narrator)]
Inside the dust and smoke
The roar of the engines is approaching
Threatening the Faceless lands again

[Chorus (Rebels)]
Headway to truth,
From now they'll call us
Masters of Fate
Fight till the end,
Defying the rules of the power

[Verse 2 (Narrator)]
The dusk has come,
The thump of their hearts starts to crash the path
Ready to join all the Beasters on the hills
And take the new lands.

South to north,
The rebels are joining to bravely fight
Against the Faceless who's trapping their lives
And stealing their souls

[Bridge (Narrator)]

[Chorus (Narrator)]

[Stell Lord]
Fire, destruction is all the way
Bloody leather, our fate
Time, it's been many years of hate
For how long a lie prevails?

[Ripper]
All who lived this fight
Were carrying on their sins
Everyone will be forgiven
But everyone must live it (all)

Must live it all...

Defying the rules of the power
