[Lyrics: Panichi]

[Verse 1 (Steel Lord)]
I wanna know the meaning of this race
A road to nowhere, a hog and rage
Glory to few but the death is for all
To win, the rule is - kill!

[Bridge 1 (Narrator)]
Oh, no! He's breaking the rules
Wheels on fire
To be the winner
Young master
The slaughter is the reason to play

[Chorus (Narrator)]
He is the Steel Lord on Wheels
Up coming stranger
With guts to make it
He is the Steel Lord on Wheels
Defying the power
Lord on Wheels
Steel Lord on Wheels

[Verse 2 (Steel Lord)]
I won't kill just for their pleasure
Of seeing a brother killing other
Without blood is my way to win
Although my life is now in danger

[Bridge 2 (Narrator)]
Breaks off! His fuel is not enough
Wheels on fire
They're trapping the stranger
Young Master
Your vision is not clear at all

[Chorus (Narrator)]

[Narrator]
Not far from him among the crowd
He can see the finish line
Cheering for him, but something is wrong
Now it's too late to avoid the trap
Hog falls apart and burns at all
Loosing control - he will face death
Now the Ripper helps him go

[Chorus (Narrator)]
