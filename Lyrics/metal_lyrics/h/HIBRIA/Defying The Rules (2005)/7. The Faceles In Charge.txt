[Lyrics: Panichi, Sordi]

[Verse 1 (Mr. Faceless)]
Listen, I am the Faceless in Charge
I am in charge of your life
I'm the Empire
All, all of your dreams I will feed
I'll frighten all to believe
You are a king

[Bridge 1 (Mr. Faceless)]
I'm the news all watch
The prejudice all trade
The preaches all believe

[Chorus (Mr. Faceless)]
So, hear my spell and you'll have
All that you need and deserve
All I want back is your soul
Safe in my chamber will be
Come to be my slave
Or into hell I'll throw you

[Mr. Faceless]
Look into my eyes,
The eyes of skill and truth
Listen to what I say little beginner
You cannot find your life,
My jungle will pick you up
Too much for you,
You're my prey

[Stell Lord]
The underworld has blown
Your lands we will trespass
You cannot hide us for so long
The men without their freedom
Mr. Faceless you can bet on that
These men are now already dead

[Narrator]
And he says...
The burning cold silence
Is wasting away the souls
Dead dreams awake
Inside the men in chains
Mr. Faceless says "guilty",
For the crime of try
He's waiting for your decision
To give up and say goodbye

[Verse 2 (Mr. Faceless)]
Wars, I'm the war bringer of all
My media tells why die for:
Mind slaving all
How... how can you start a breakout?
If I will make all believe
God is by my side

[Bridge 2 (Mr. Faceless)]
I tell to whom you'll pray
My laws you will obey
Do not go further

[Chorus (Mr. Faceless)]
