[Lyrics: Panichi]

[Verse 1 (Narrator)]
Fear in the guardian eyes
The roar approaches again
Rebel men show up to cross other ville now
On the back a speed machine
Join them on the fight
Stell Lord returns from his revealing trance

[Bridge (Narrator)]
Their leather is now all blood
But they tame the new path
Were not caught by the spell
Hailing Stell Lord the new brave

[Chorus (Rebels)]
Come to raise the new land
A kingdom to share
Among brave men
Who fight against the darkness

[Stell Lord]
Kingdom to sharenow we build all together
(The) dream of the men is coming true
Not only land but a new evolution
(A) new state of mind to mankind

[Ripper]
You've got the power to change your fate cause no men
Should mind slave another
You must fight, the Faceless inside you and then
The ones who oppressed you
Now is our time to leave behind
All the world's pain, (to) forever live
That's our prize, after reborn
Under my will

[Chorus (Stell Lord)]
