[Lyrics: Panichi]

[Verse 1 (Mr. Faceless)]
Underworld, rebel men are
Rising a break out
But my puppets can't know
What is about

[Bridge 1 (Mr. Faceless)]
Curse their lives
Rebel men must not show up
Until the gateway is crossed
And the Beasters enslaved

[Chorus (Narrator)]
Millennium quest
The gateway of fire
Who reaches (it) first will rule the times
Millennium quest
The gateway of fire
Perpetual power to rule the times

[Verse 2 (Mr. Faceless)]
Illusion's land is overtime I've
Dried and wasted all
Before ruin it down I must
Cross the way out

[Bridge 2 (Mr. Faceless)]
Slaves can't know
But once the gateway is crossed
Their bodies will fall down dead
So new slaves I must have

[Chorus (Narrator)]

Millennium quest is calling
For the attack

[Mr. Faceless]
Hear my spell, your spirit is held
You are reckless trespassers

[Narrator]
All who tried to cross
Faceless has enslaved
Mesmerized they were
Puppets they became
All who tried to cross
Faceless has enslaved
Mesmerized they... were
Caught by the spell the spirits were
There is no other way
To reach the Gateway of fire

They... they've got to cross the Faceless lands
The only path to reach it
But to not be caught by the spell
The Ripper shall carry'em on
Millennium quest is calling for the attack

[Chorus (Narrator)]
