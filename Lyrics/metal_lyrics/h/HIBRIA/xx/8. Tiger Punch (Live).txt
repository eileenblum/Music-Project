The sirens warn the runway attack
The fire burns all the tanks
To stay on ground is a shortcut to death
The only escape is the sky

You have waited for this chance
With no fear to assault

Tiger Punch
In a light speed attack
Cuts like a blade the horizons he flies
Tiger Punch
In a light speed attack
With Steel Heart and soul like an eagle he flies
Tiger Punch

It's time to prove you're what you believe
Or on the ground you will be
Forever comin' back until one last time
The sky is where you must die

You have waited to protect
With no fear to assault

Domination across the sky
Terrifying fear at night
From the sky down below looks so full of joy
Hell on earth, beast unleashed
Fighting fearless evil eyes air-borne

Stronger than fear all has fallen in his eyes
Alone in the sky he's the last to survive

Tiger Punch
The King of the Sky
Tiger Punch
The last to survive
