I'm stuck with lots of words
I need someone to talk to
Someone to discard easily
Just wanna know the truth

I know my brother, my father, my mother
But who really cares?
I'm coming in, I'll let you out
Poor speeches with one dirty word

I feel my pain is turning
So goddamn terrifying

You don't even care for the answers of your life
With a thousand pills to go on with your tiny mind
As someone placed in a grave

Forever will be part of the scene
Where the leading lady cries
Burning the screen
Where the leading lady cries

I have sold my soul for Rock 'n' Roll
I will lose control with Rock 'n' Roll!
