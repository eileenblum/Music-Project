No future if you don't care about the past
I can't look back, the suffering's freezing me
And burning my brain
Slowly facing all the remains
Violating the rules of my own freedom

To hell with
Your fucking lies
I'll live just to fuck
With you â all the way out!
You only care about yourself

Cry â I wanna hear you
Cry â I wanna hear you crying 'til the end of your life
'Cause no one will listen to you
Cry â I wanna hear you
Cry â I wanna hear you crying 'til the end of your life
'Cause no one is hearing you

No future if you don't leave the past behind
I can't move on, the suffering's ripping me
And cursing my soul
Slowly facing all the remains
Violating the rules of my own freedom

Cry â I wanna hear you
Cry â I wanna hear you crying 'til the end of your life
'Cause no one will listen to you
Cry â I wanna hear you
Cry â I wanna hear you crying 'til the end of your life
'Cause no one is hearing you
Silent revenge
