I'm out here on my own
I'm sick carrying my bones
Walking in circles, being punched
But sure I know how to get this done

I'm gonna hide my raging mind
And every step is like a tightrope
My deadline will fortify
The laws I am paying for

I'm out here on my own
Can't miss the chance to blow
Walking through my deadly storm
How could I know?
What are my last words?

I'm gonna hide my raging mind
And every step is like a tightrope
My deadline will fortify
The laws I am paying for
Or am I just a spoiled man?

Maybe I pushed myself too far
And played a game that's my own war
So in the end I kissed the feet of rotten laws
Throwing away a life to live under regret

I'm out here on my own
I'm sick carrying my bones
And every step is like a tightrope
