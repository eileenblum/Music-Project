Oh I hear the music and it keeps me feeling free
Just hear the music, I don't need your luxury
No politics, no religion, baby
Just plug and play, that's how it's gonna be

My guitar will speak so clearly
Can't hold on any longer I will shout so loud!
Scream, feel the song penetrating your brain
Scream, come with me, would you yell insanely?

When the band is ready and the amp starts to hum
You'll scream much louder
Feeling you can't run away
Feeling good you wish to stay
You'll scream much louder
Feeling good you wish to stay
That's the music taking over your own mind

Oh I hear the music and it keeps me feeling free
Just plug and play, that's how it's gonna be

My guitar will speak so clearly
Can't hold on any longer I will shout so loud!
Scream, feel the song penetrating your brain
Scream, come with me, would you yell insanely?
Scream, feel the groove, band your head, dear baby
Scream, come with me, would you yell insanely?

When the band is ready and the amp starts to hum
You'll scream much louder
Feeling you can't run away
Feeling good you wish to stay
You'll scream much louder
Feeling good you wish to stay
Feeling great to rock this way
Can you feel it? Can ya? Music is the only way!

Play out, my friend, play out and you'll be ready to stand
Play out, my friend, music speaks for itself, you bet!
