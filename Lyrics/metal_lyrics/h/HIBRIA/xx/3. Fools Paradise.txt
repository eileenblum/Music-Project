Greed is back! Watch out! The nest war is runnin'
And you do know you are the next
Revival of the greediest men on Earth
Money is growing through my brain, I'll get the power to remain

Cashlovers seek for it to the end
Leader of the heartless men, that's my trend
There is only me with my strength
Me and the power, there's no falling

When I'm here
When I close my eyes it lets me fly away
When I'm here
When I close my eyes I'm burning inside

Lost in the shadows, there is a hole destroying all my soul
Lost in the world I will keep myself alone
Yes, I am the greediest man on Earth
Money is growing through my brain, I'll get the power to remain

When I'm here
When I close my eyes it lets me fly away
When I'm here
When I close my eyes I'm burning inside
Lost in the shadows I realized my fool's paradise
