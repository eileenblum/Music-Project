Face to face, eye to eye
No one has lived or survived
We are the hunters of a new world

Their heads will prize me and keep the circle alive
Our names cleaned up and our pots full of gold

[Chorus]
Screaming ghost will be found betrayed
Fighting hard to clean up their names
Screaming ghost will start a damned cursed revenge
To knock all down
Screaming ghost will be found betrayed
Fighting hard to clean up their names
Screaming ghost will start
A damned cursed revenge

There they've failed side by side
Letting their prize walk alive
They've burned a thousand years of pride

Never the circle had a member identified
Never the circle had a prey talking live

[Chorus]

We'll never have the chance

To get back to our life
We'll make the truth come up
Or terminate them all, oh yeah!
We are the hunted ones, and all the best
Will be trying to take our lives
They've told the Master's flag we've

Failed burning the flag's name

Truth is the first one to die in a war and
Who tells the version to the books is the wining side
When the silent man's talking
All the proof is demanded

But when rage's talking
Everybody listens up

[Chorus]
