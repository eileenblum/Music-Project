A siren warns
They all must reach the closest way out
Those who don't trust their faith in time
Are being led by the fear inside
A note is sent
She's in the last chamber at the right
There is no better chance to play
The unexpected guest at the wrong time

[Bridge]
All the fear inside your flimsy way of life
Is a precious drop of fuel to
Build up all your nightmares
There's no way to escape
Your fear is my strength
To hunt you in hell

[Chorus]
And I'll be shutting down the lights
Watching your search for a way out
Before you kneel and say a prayer
Devoted to your fear

All I saw
Pieces of broken glass on the floor
Please wake me up cause all I feel
Is the beat of my heart
In a frozen corpse

All I've heard
a window crashing all over me
I am a stranger to all here
In a smoking corner set on fire

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Devoted to your fear saying a
Prayer building up your nightmares

While you're dying,
I can see your scars from tortures
there is no evil we can
Carry with clean hands
I have shocked you
All night long with a wired thunder
In a bed of glass your
Skin turns to blood
No one here will tell me it'll be fine,

Hang on, carry on,
It's just fear and anger
There will be no better words
To say than goodbye Lord
Please, forgive me I have sinned, save me

You can't see me crying
Cause I can't feel your love
One last time, I will give
Them my loudest laugh

[Chorus]

Devoted to your fear saying a
Prayer building up your nightmares
