You've knocked me down
I'm kissing the floor
You've made feel as you've dreamed
You're the seed of the hate
A seed I have grown
Meantime we're washing our hands

We have wandered all over the world
To fight ourselves somewhere else
We couldn't wonder, we'll fight who we are
Looking close at the eyes of a child

[Chorus]
Fly away from the blood red skies of hate
With bonded wings of wax
Far away from the blood red skies of hate
Flying high, airborne we fall

I wanna feel your passion for your pennant
To feel it one last time in my cold heart
Make me feel your way
So much I want to feel this way...

On your own shoulders
You will feel the weight of hate
On your own shoulders
You will feel how heavy
Is to carry it in a long legged race

Termination into your eyes
Restless power on your own hands
You've always fed your days and (the) desire
To hang our heads and resurrect your past

You can't even think beyond
But your own rebellious world to shoot it right
There is no forgiven try
You can't even thinkin beyond
But your own rebellious world
Making me sick of all
Blasting raging power collecting souls
Blasting raging power

[Chorus]

Fly away from... blood red skies

I have been fighting for our masters
But never they've shown up
At the end, I'm always on my own
I have been searching for my targets
In endless dead end roads
Speeding up to reach them

Fighting all for real, is my deepest passion
Fight all for real, lonely stranger
All I did has kept our rite - live bravely and die
With your boots on!!!

Don't pull me down: Fly away from cold darkened rooms
Don't pull me down: Keep away from hard strong wishes
I wish I knew my soul shall not wander
I wish I knew I couldn't fly so high

[Chorus]

The labyrinth is on fire... There's no way out
Wings of wax are melting... You can't fly away
Fallen angels regretting living this pain

There's no way out... The labyrinth is on fire...
You can't fly away... Wings of wax are melting...
Airborne we fall
Fallen angels regretting living this pain
