Back in time in an ancient rite
A Fallen angel of fire
Has planted on his dark
Seeds of hate
To spread his empire

[Bridge]
Freedom now, freedom now
You can be just
Like your gods
Just listen to my call
And join me now
In this new ride

[Chorus]
All who fell down in this hole
Wanted to be a god and rule
Many have listened
To this poisoning call
And all became the so called
The Skull Collectors
The Skull Collectors

A labyrinth on their minds
The Skull Collectors will catch 'em
Feeding their inner greed
To make 'em believe they're next

Forever, I'll make you feel the same
Anger, fear, hate and
Merciful love in my eyes
Forever, that's how I will prevail
Twisting people's mind,
To keep 'em alive,
Through their hearts

The human greed is calling
Rotten sent of darkness
I'll let 'em hunt each other
they won't see
They get nowhere else

Can you feel
The weight of time?
Can you hear my voice?
I will track you just like a rat
Can you escape
My tiger eyes?

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
