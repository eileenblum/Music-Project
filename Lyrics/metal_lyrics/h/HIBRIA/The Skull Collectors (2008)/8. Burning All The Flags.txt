Marching on bloody green fields
No one stood alive when our flag
Was defied by oblivious lords
We have carried all the secrets
Kings have trusted us
Until they reach their final destination

Time has gone by
A thousand years we survived
All who tried to defend
Their fields could not stand, cause we are

[Chorus]
Burning all the flags
Red blood is our cross
And our path
Burning all the flags
Honor in our blood
Or our death's last breath

The flag will fade to red if secrets are not shown
find the white flag's master and tell about the gold
We just won't live our lives if secrets are not told
Find the white flag's master and tell about the gold
Gold of desire
They said their souls, they sold our flag
Gold, gold of desire
To have their own, our secret's told

We ride faster than the wind to reveal to our master
Let him judge and start a merciless hunt, yeah
All who spotted our flag were then judged by the master
all who sold the flag have not lived anymore
Something in my heart, something in my soul
Tell me I won't reach the master's home
Something in the dark is chilling out my spine
Fuck! They've trapped me on this dead end road

[Chorus]
