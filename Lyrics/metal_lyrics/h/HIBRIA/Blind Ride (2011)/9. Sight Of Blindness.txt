[Lyrics by Sanson/Camargo]

Can you tell me the reasons
Of this white flash in my sight?
I'm going out of control
My delight shall be over fast
Where is all that fun that I felt with my all - blessed eyes?
Sure I'm going to die
Down there among the blind

[BRIDGE]
There's no assurance
They'll rescue me
I will join you in this creepy fucking life
There's no time to step back and regret
Dismissed and hungry we shall fade away

[CHORUS]
Shooting at a helpless blind
For the pleasure of blood
Made me feel like a beast in disguise
Shooting at a helpless blind
For the pleasure of blood
Cause all the sight of blindness is inside my eyes

"You, shut up with your lies"
"Fuck ya, I didn't kill a life"
Pain, you don't know how fear kills your mind
"You, shut up with your grief"
"Listen, I didn't ruin a life"
Death, I only unleashed the poor life
Of the infected blind already dead

Now the pain became so hard, and desperate I feel
Death's so close
Last words on my mind as crying I close my eyes

[Solo]

Shady nights - lousy room
Being quiet is the only way
So I hide... and wait for the next surprise
Help me, I beg

[Solo]

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
