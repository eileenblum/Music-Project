[Lyrics by Camargo/Sanson/Kasper]

(I'm) Losing control
(I'm) Screaming in silence
Blows me away, this scary madness
My dying soul has no more hope
Just sadness will lead my way

[BRIDGE]
When you face all the pain that enslaves you
Bending your knees you will pray
When you break all the chains that make you
A slave to the darkness

[CHORUS]
Beyond regrets of the past
Sleepless fears not left behind
(A) Way out - I'll try all my best
But I just can not get rid of my mind

Rage and hate I feel when I look at the scratches on my soul

Burn up the past
We always have to move on our future
No matter if we're lost
(The) growing fear will make us strong to survive
And keep on realizing

We just have on life to cure
The shadows we keep confined
Don't surrender the fight, struggling inside
Blaming the world won't make you heal

[Solo]

When I feel I'm not strong
Damn darkness I know will hold me again
I'll force my mind - to face my regrets
That keep me in the past

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

Beyond regrets of the past
