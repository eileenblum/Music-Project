[Lyrics by Camargo]

Death, are you listening to me?
I'm begging please - Shoot me down
Death, are you having fun?
You're my only chance - Shoot me down

In silence I cry
In silence I die
Stuck on this goddamn nightmare
Hopeless I am
Just a lamb
Facing the Devil laughing on his chair

[CHORUS]
Shoot me down
I beg you please
Shoot me  down
Damn - Shoot me down
I'm dead but I can't close my eyes
Shoot me down

Death, can you tell me, please,
How you choose the ones you'll take away?
Death, is that not enough?
Life's been more than tough
Shoot me down

In silence I pray
In silence I stay
Stuck on this goddamn nightmare
Lonely I am
Just a lamb
Facing the Devil laughing on his chair

[CHORUS]

[Solo]

One last ride going down
It's all I'll say to you:
There is nothing left for me
This silent nightmare is driving me to hell
No words left on my grave
To nobody I'll say goodbye
You'll see, I'm going down
No, don't you wake me up - Let me die

[Solo]

I'm so close to my fate
Crossing the world's gates of the dead
Eyes wide open - no fear
Scenes from the past
Will be left behind

[CHORUS]
