[Lyrics by Kasper]

Mind-numbing speech
Fills their souls with beauty and cheer
Collective trance
Leading their hearts to flood the temple
The outsiders they'll execrate
They will behave as empty shells of hate
From here to eternity they will act
Forever blind, as judges of you and me

[CHORUS]
Unveil the poison
Their hate is never-ending
Their world is as small as their God
Blinded by faith and by fear

Blinded by faith

Promising hell
Raising their children to condemn
Inheriting the beast
Their will confined
Refusing to see what's real

[CHORUS]

Blinded by faith
Blinded by fear

Hell is so damn close
A step away from paradise
Dare to cross the line
The wrath of God will fall from the sky

Hypnotic mantra on their heads
Swallow lies! Obey! Behave!
Stupid blind disease
No criticism
No way to cease
The foolish thoughts of their brainwashed minds
Worthless to try
Their mouths decry
The grace of being free to decide

[Solo]

[CHORUS]

Blinded by faith
Blinded by faith
Blinded by fear
