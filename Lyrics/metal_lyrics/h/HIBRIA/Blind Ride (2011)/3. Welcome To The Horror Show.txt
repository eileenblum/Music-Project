[Lyrics by Kasper]

They come out of nowhere
And push you outta control
Perplexed you feel
Your senses scream they're real

Obscuring thoughts are all around you
The shadows grow beneath your scared, sweat skin

[CHORUS]
Welcome to the horror show
You realized there is nowhere to run
The unknown came to fright
Paranoia is guiding your life
Welcome to the horror show
You realized there is nowhere to run
The unknown came to fright
Obsession is ruling your mind

Alone, there's no resort
Conspiring friends you can't trust
Trapped by your instincts
Nobody around to believe

Wide eyes are always all around you
The shadows grow beneath your scared, sweat skin

[CHORUS]

Helpless you crawl
Insanity beast devours
Voices from within
Announcing the final hour

[Solo]

Corroding inside your brain,
Thoughts that won't give up
Devising anxiety, seducing your soul
Evidences so unreal, eyes and ears misled to feel betrayed
The nightmare now is on

[CHORUS]
