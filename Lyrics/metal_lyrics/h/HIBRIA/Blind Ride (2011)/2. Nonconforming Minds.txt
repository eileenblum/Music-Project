[Lyrics by Kasper]

Don't fool yourself, it's a kind of disease
Kneeling to clean the boots of whom you should please
If getting used is the way you could find
Playing their game is just a matter of bridge

[BRIDGE]
Hear me, you've got to see
The more that you bend the less you get their respect
Refuse this, you have to face it
The chance is here, it's your time to raise your
Nonconforming minds

[CHORUS I]
The mass will rise and burn their dead void speech
Truth reveals
We'll scream so fucking loud they won't pretend
They can't hear
Nonconforming minds

Reject to grow as a walking dead
Decline the ones overbearing our heads
They only want their hands to be clear
Fading the voices of rebels they fear

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS II]
The mass will rise and burn their dead void speech
Truth reveals
We'll scream so fucking loud they won't pretend
They can't hear
So many voices telling you what to do
Leading your life as if they decide for you
Now we'll gather and make it in our own way
With no fear
Nonconforming minds

[Solo]

No, we won't embrace
The decadent fates once chosen
Years before we were born
We're not alone, many more will come
Inside ourselves our souls shout:
Freedom!
It's not a gift or miracle
Better fall and die fighting
Than gratifying our enemies
Watching us conform

[Solo]

[CHORUS II]
