FOREVER, SURRENDER
EFFECTS OF WAR
A WITHNESS OF LOVED ONES
FACING DEATH

I don't need this
Don't wanna see this
There's a red ground under my feet
Children killed and maimed by the bombs of war

It's all that's left
Throw away your past
It's all that's left
That's the war effect

I don't wanna live a deadly legacy for years NO, NO
I will rewite my story - no more rapes
I don't wanna live a deadly legacy for years NO, NO
I'm on my knees but I will rise and be the one

DISASTERS, DISORDERS TO MY STRESS
REACTIONS, BESIDES DEATH
CHILDHOOD UNDER THREAT
