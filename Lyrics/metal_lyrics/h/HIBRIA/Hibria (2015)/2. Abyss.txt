"I am the one with the cure for these ages of evil.
Then give me your vote!
I am the one with the torce on my way to the lynching.
I'll feast with your blood!"

HEY!
Speaking through others' words
HEY!
Won't get you anywhere
HEY!
Time to be in control
HEY!
It takes a brave and humbel man
To step away and look again

Before we drown in blood
And hatred orystallizes
Gaze into the abyss
And maybe you'll realize

"I am the one with the right to abuse when it suits me.
There's no one to blame
I am the one who will gamble with souls if I need it
And we are the same!"

Before we drown in blood
And hatred orystallizes
Gaze into the abyss
And maybe you'll realize
When it looks back into you
The kind of monster you've become

I'm made of all
I'm love and hate
I'm foe and ally
I'm Sinner and saint
I'm made of all WHO ARE YOU?
I'm love and hate WHO ARE YOU?
Who are you?
