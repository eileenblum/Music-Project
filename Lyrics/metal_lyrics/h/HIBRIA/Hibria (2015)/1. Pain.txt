Father, I beg, please forgive me, but I have sinned
The Butcher is coming to take you, he is known as me
For putting a knife in your back
The demons should take me down
I'm willing for absolution, set me free!

Unholy God guides my destiny
How can you fight, while you're down on your knees?

Feel my pain (looking to kill once again)
Feel my pain (sorry for all I have sinned)

Father, I beg, please forgive me
Feel the anger, I'll you once, kill you twice
It fills all my heart
Make me feel better
Please, just tell me the words

The circle may never end
The nightmare is on me
I'll save a prayer for all of you
I'll rape your soul, and steal your innocent lives
