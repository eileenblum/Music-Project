Feel the greed in my hands
I'm no one
Never cared about my learning
There's only pride
Chasing spotlights everywhere
I will shine
I will build my world and raise my money pile

Look at my favorite boy
I'll keep you as a toy
Will you write my poems?
Look at my favorite boy
I'll keep you as a toy
I have given you a choice

Chasing fame, not in vain
It gave me everything
Chasing fame, for all my days
Buying people, that's the way I play

Information psychopath
That's who I am
Come on you fools, it's just the game I play
Let me live my dream alone
I have the power, I'll pay your compensation, now!

Chasing fame, not in vain
It gave me everything
Chasing fame, for all my days
Buying people, that's the way I play
