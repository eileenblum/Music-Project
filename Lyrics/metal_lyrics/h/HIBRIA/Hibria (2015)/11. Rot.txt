I only ask my heart to be clear
Facing the row of death
I keep myself holding on to my faith
Sleeping on my knees
They dream about my death, I am sure
My world is full of tears
They dream about my death, I am sure
Help me, don't blame me, don't kill me

I've been looking for a way out
But it seems so far away
Bravely fighting against the white wolves again
Screaming for life

As I drown in the sand
I ask for a hand
HELP ME!
As I rot
I hold up my breath
Stuck by my own death
HELP ME!
As I rot

Blaming myself I was doing wrong
I was innocent - in that cell in town
And the ones that I loved turned their back on me
Then I realized I was all alone
