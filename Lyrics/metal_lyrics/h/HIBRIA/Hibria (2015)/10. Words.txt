Now I feel I'm doing better
Than I have done before
All those days, head hanging down
Sick and tired, looking around
And you laughing at me

Was I sick or just getting by?
Now I'm proud of my fucking fight
Are you looking for a better life?
This is my battle cry

A movie playing in my head
Loneliness works just for the dead
My words will be forever read
You will hear it 'til your last breath

Now you cannot hide from me
Even if you shut your ears
I'm the real, your are the fake
Never changing, never facing
Are you laughing at me?

A movie playing in my head
Loneliness works just for the dead
My words will be forever read
You will hear it 'til your last breath

A song is playing in your head
You can rise and live your today
Hold on and never turn your back
Your words can be forever read

There is a world standing in my way
And I will find the light
Would you have the same guts I have to make your dreams come true?
