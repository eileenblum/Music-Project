Everything is borken
Everything is sick
I have told you to stop it
I have told you not to cheat

I look around
There is no one else
It's haed to stay alive
Listen to me
You'll pay your bills
Misleading minds that change
From stillness to a secret - so predicatable

You can't tell me to stop it now
Digging deep to bury you alive

I'm gonna bury you now
I'm gonna bury you down
All my life I'll hunt you till the end
I'll kill you!

SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, ASHAMED OF YOU!

I'm not here to save you
I am here to bury you!
I'm growing insane and proud
We'll die here and fade

I'm gonna bury you now
I'm gonna bury you down
Money and you are just as one
I'm gonna hurt you, I'm gonna kill you!

I'm gonna bury you now
I'm gonna bury you down
All my life I'll hunt you till the end
I'll kill you!

I'm gonna bury you now
I'm gonna bury you down
Money and you are just as one
I'm gonna hurt you, I'm gonna kill you!

I'm gonna bury you now
I'm gonna bury you down
All my life I'll hunt you till the end
I'll kill you!

SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, ASHAMED OF YOU!
