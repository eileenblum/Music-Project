Sunlight wipes the darkness from the city's gray
Hazy voices rushing by the roadway
Body bags aligned on every fornt-page
HELL AIN'T FAR FROM HERE
Power buys the vigilant's resilience
Justice turns its face away from violence
Fire armed to angels of apocalypse
CAME TO CLAIM THEIR FEE

ECHOES FROM THE STREET
Sing the gutter's lullaby
DANCE ON BLISTERED FEET
Spectral figures in the night
SOULS THAT FALL ASLEEP
Only witnessed by the sky

But then the lightning strike
Makes lead and flesh collide

Around our castles of glass and gold
Emerge the reign of ghosts
Pursuing blurry dreams
Forbidden to exist
Around our castles of glass and gold
Emerge the reign of ghosts
Pursuing blurry dreams
And deliverance from their sins

Sweaty hands anticipate the consequence
A brokwn man, stripped ofg his self-confidence
Reaping the rewards from social somnolence
MEET HIS DESTINY
Wishing for the land of opportunity
Pushed to live a life in mediocrity
Choked under a bias of inequity
NOT ALLOWED TO BREATHE
