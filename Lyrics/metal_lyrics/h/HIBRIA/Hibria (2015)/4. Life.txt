Don't you tell me how I feel
The moving ground is so unreal
Forever I will dream about your love
I can't tell you how I feel
Cause my heart is full of tears
The road is blind and I will have to suffer

I don't know how to deal with my frozen heart
I'm such a fool to believe in all I pray
Ive been struck by my innocence and all my fear
I sure know I WILL CARE
I sure know I WILL MIND
Life's not fair

Life is just one - The one I need to heal
My tears were made to make you free
Death's set me up, I'm on my knees
Life is just one - The one I need to heal
Taken away has been your hand
A loss is so hard to understand

So unreal - My love
How I feel - Full of tears
Suffer
