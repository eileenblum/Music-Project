Your money is my lord but your thoughts are dull in my head
But, you don't know - There's no one - You are dead

DON'T TRY to keep my mouth shut
HOLD ON I want you fucked up
WAKE UP! Are you still waiting?
No more prayers tonight

This house will shine
Supporting my lies
Place all your money by my side
Please, be my guest in my church in hell

Your money is my lord but your thoughts are dull in my head
Cause, you don't know - There's no one - You are dead

This house will shine
Supporting my lies
Place all your money by my side
Please, be my guest feel at home
This house will shine
Supporting my lies
Place all your money by my side
Please, be my guest in my church in hell

I'll meet you in your mind
I'll take you to my church in hell
DOWN, DOWN, MEET ME AT MY CHURCH IN HELL
I'll buy you with my lies
I will pull you down
DOWN, DOWN, MEET ME AT MY CHURCH IN HELL
No more prayers tonight
