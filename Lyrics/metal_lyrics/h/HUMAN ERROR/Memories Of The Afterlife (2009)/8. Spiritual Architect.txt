Another user, Another OD,
you beg on the street, just to get what you think you need.

Shattered and broken, hollow inside,
try to numb the pain that you cannot hide.

You fall
and you say
"This will take my pain away".

"Help me"
"Save me"
There is nothing left to save.

If god is the needle and the hit is your prayer
then heaven is the gutter and you're almost there.

If life is a train and the driver is fear
then the next stop is hell, and I'll be waiting here.

And my need is gone...

Can't see the problem, can't see the effect
can't see the good man, who is now wrecked.

Take a look in the mirror, take a look at yourself,
you don't even remember, the face you see.

No chance and no hope,
just too late to save.

You spent your whole life
digging your own grave.

If hope is a bullet and faith is a gun
then salvation is death and your life is done.

If this life was a dream and its the end it seems
then i would be drowning now, will you follow me?

And my need is gone...

Another kid to young to die,
didn't want to say goodbye,
didn't want the fun to end,
I guess I just miss my friend.

And my need is gone...
