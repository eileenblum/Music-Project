Ffucking street kid, you never learn..
you beat another person just for fun,
lose your trust and you lose your friends
you traded your mind for a fucking gun.

You will waste away in silence
when you lose your taste for the violence,
what the hell have you gotten into,
they have made a monster out of you.

I see your killer disguise,
still wearing a child's eyes,
so sad the monster we see,
isn't the boy we recognize.

Punched on, kicked in and beaten blue,
you pay your due to your fucking crew,
you prey on the weak and get your first kill,
god forgive you, cause no one else will.

Shot and killed on his birthday,
I still remember his favourite toy,
mom and dad look down at him and say
"Look at how they destroyed our boy".

I held you 'till your last breath,
watching the fading life in your eye,
I wish you the peace in death,
I could never give you in life.
He was alone, streets were his home,
the boy died on his own,
a slave to the gun,
we bury our only son,
what did we let him become?
