Sitting, watching, fearing all I see
many, secrets, held inside of me
cold and shaking, sweating all over
this is my first breath after a coma.

They can't understand, why I never speak,
you'll never see me again the way you remember me,
the way you wanted me to be,
now revived, half alive, not nearly enough to survive,
forget my name and forget the past,
your heart will be set free from me at last.

Do what we say and follow the rules,
if you start to talk we swear you can leave
but promises only comfort fools
and its hard to speak when you cant even breathe.

You can't understand
this is where I remain
I can't watch you fly away,
fly away.

If this could be real
then I'd try to feel
for just one day.

A medicated mind, an injection directly to the brain,
a near lethal dose, to kill the pain,
I dont recognize my face, I don't feel the same,
a spiritual momentary affliction, a catatonic fit,
quiet now, this won't hurt a bit
the permanent silence, the ultimate hit.

A flock of ghosts by my bedside
a silent whisper and I am free
the final trip, a lucid ride
was all I ever needed.

You can't understand
this is where I remain
I can't watch you fly away,
fly away.

If this could be real
then I'd try to feel
for just one day

Staring through the window
into a thousands lives ago
like a memory of a dream
that I swore I've never seen.

Quiet now
come along for the ride.
