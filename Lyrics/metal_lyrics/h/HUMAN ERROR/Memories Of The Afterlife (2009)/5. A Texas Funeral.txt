Drunk, high and stoned
on a 100 straight kms of torn up road,
a fugitive with his foot to the floor,
and caught by the local law.

No one crying, no one grieving,
"We just bury 'em breathing",
no memories to share, no songs of joy,
just a good old fashioned texas funeral boy.

Give 'em a torch and a bible,
and hammer the fucking lid shut.

Dirt falls through the cracks
and hits the page
of the last words he will ever read.

Flashlight starts to blink
and it stabs him with fear
crys untill his mouth fills up with tears
last thing he read was...

"When you find your home
I'll fade away" repeated on first line
(Don't - you - know - what - you've - done?).

Punching the walls, screaming 'till he bleed,
scratches the roof untill his fingers break,
a lifetime flashes before his eyes,
calming down, he accepts his fate.

He read verse for verse,
the battery getting worse,
the air starting to wear thin.

He says his last prayer
as he gasps for the air
wondering if anyone would even care.

And all of a sudden
everything went black.

Dirt falls through the cracks
and hits the page
of the last words he will ever read.

Flashlight starts to blink
and it stabs him with fear
crys untill his mouth fills up with tears
last thing he thought was...

"When you find your home
I'll fade away"
(Don't you know what you've done?).
