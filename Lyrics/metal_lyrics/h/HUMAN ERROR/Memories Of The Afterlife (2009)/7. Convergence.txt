I keep watching this spirit
that consumes the street,
its voice is violence
and its song is deceit.

Try to reach out and touch,
try to pretend,
but everyone who you called a friend
thinks you are already dead.

Chalk my outline on the concrete
and leave the flowers by your feet,
next to the building that is burning down
under the stars of stray rounds.

A freeway of scars on my mind,
a cure for time, I cannot find.

One thing you say will find me your eyes
all that you fear will converge in time
all that you see, all that you dream
all that you never ever wanted to be.

Where are those that need my help?
Where are those I must protect?
Where are those who fight with me?
Where are those who want to be set free?

A freeway of scars on my mind,
a cure for time, I cannot find

One thing you say will find me your eyes
all that you fear will converge in time
all that you see, all that you dream
all that you never ever wanted to be.
