Everything you once cared for just became another possesion,
and everything you thought you loved was just another obsession,
a painful confession, a numbing aggression,
a sober reflection of a world of depression.

You cannot fail,
hold your breath and follow me.

I cannot see.
spread your wings and fly with me.

Every breath is a gift,
but life is all you make of it,
you fall and break, just take my hand,
and I will help you never fall again.

I can now see clear
far beyond my fear
one last chance to say...

A swandive to the concrete, a front row seat to a life complete.
Born and raised in a loving home, but craved a life on the street,
a failure to recognize, a growing problem in disguise
a wounded soul in the throes of demise.

I can't feel you
you've taken so much from me.

Can't save yourself
a crying heart begging to be freed.

Every breath is a gift,
but life is all you make of it,
you fall and break, just take my hand,
and I will help you never fall again.

I can now see clear
far beyond my fear
one last chance to say...
