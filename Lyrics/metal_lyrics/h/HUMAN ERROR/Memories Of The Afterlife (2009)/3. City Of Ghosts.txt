Pale faces and hearts of stone,
every child is his fathers clone,
an entire lifetime spent alone,
every killer is bred at home.

Shredded flesh upon your swollen fists
and scar tissue across your wrists,
broken down soul, scavenger of pain
never the same, only a face remains.

Learn to all live the same
and condemn all that you cannot name
aspire to be next to nothing at all,
live blind and the blind shall fall.

Beaten to death and back to life again.

(I awaken)

Your eyes bleed sunshine
but your heart remains so cold
in a world where I can't tell apart
a ghost from living man
and here I am, walking in your shadow again
here we are, worlds away but never far apart.

Forced to show signs of fear and weakness
but how could I just repent?
Endorsed by a benign sense of sickness:
innocence, hope and blind remorse.

Watching their eyes shine
in the burning house that used to be mine,
people move along like puppets
on the burning streets that are their stage.

Beaten to death and back to life again.

(I awaken)

Your eyes bleed sunshine
but your heart remains so cold
in a world where I can't tell apart
a ghost from living man
and here I am, walking in your shadow again
here we are, worlds away but never far apart.
