Nerve branches corrode and recoil
my eyes cloud and cataract
and I see clearly now.

Devour this dream
I've lived my entire life inside,
deliver me to the paradise I've been denied.

Conceived and deprived,
born in catatonia,
sever your addiction
of a life of fiction.

Disconnect this spirit from me
and destroy the false being within.

Centuries erased in seconds,
but death only hurts the ones we leave behind
awaken inside distant memories
elevate me to something more.

Desensitized orphan of war,
a sensory corrupted passenger
on the road to a divine trauma.

Infected with fear, I can't breathe,
and the virus flows through me
and I still don't believe.

Shed this vile skin that poisons me,
remove the shackles of guilt that imprison me.

Centuries erased in seconds,
but death only hurts the ones we leave behind
awaken inside distant memories
elevate me to something more.
