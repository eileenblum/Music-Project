21 gun salute for our fallen brother,
hand another folded flag to his mother,
standing in line trying not to cry,
they empty a full mag into the sky.

Remember them
every friend
coming home
in a bodybag.

Another atom blast lights up the night
and the tears are wiped with stars and stripes
children laying in pieces, I'll never understand,
don't ever ask for peace with a gun in your hand.

Our future revealed
on the battlfield
nothing more
than a human shield.

He looked at me, he fell away
a fallen soldier, my only friend
marching all night, we ask each other
when will this war ever end?

The madness of war they all adore
blood drunk and asking for more
those die who weren't afraid to fight
how can any of this be right?

Laying in the rain writing his last letter
to his wife and his child he never even met,
full of regret, he tells her not to wait
he hugs his rifle and smokes his last cigarette.

Bred for war
since we were small,
a sign of the times
a lifetime by design.

He looked at me, he fell away
a fallen soldier, my only friend
marching all night, we ask each other
when will this war ever end?

The madness of war they all adore
blood drunk and asking for more
those die who weren't afraid to fight
how can any of this be right?

Enemy fire blazing through the sky
reminds me of fireworks on the 4th of july,
like stars in my eyes, what a lovely sight
laughing as the priest reads me the last rites.
