Never thought that I could get in your way girl
I only wanted to show you my charm
I never thought that I could get in your way girl
I only wanted to show you my charm
Well here's to tonight where everything could be a moment of pure elation and sensory
Binary code revoke them of magnetic waste
The things I said I've never done
Speak louder then the silent ones
Still hold fast the day
I take a moment to examine my surroundings territories that crash and burn
I think the time and effort spent on this will make up for what I've never learned
There's a familiar trend
Take everything and smash it to pieces
And it seems to me that something must be wrong
The pieces reform and sit collecting dust

There was a time when I could not stand
To take you on the thought of it frightened me
I never thought that I could get in your way girl
Bathed in blue light a city that quietly sleeps
I only wanted to show you my charm
Tired and true absences
I never thought that I could get in your way girl
Trust in me with confidence that everything will turn out right
I only wanted to show you my the pieces reform and sit collecting dust
I never thought that I could get in your way girl
