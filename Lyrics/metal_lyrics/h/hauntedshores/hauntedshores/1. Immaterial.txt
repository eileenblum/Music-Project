Shield your eyes
protecting life lessons from truthful impressions
tragic love
what I do is not without purpose I'll follow through
trade places with me I promise you fortunes
think about it carefully the fruitful possibilities
It's what brings us closer
It's above you all
take this it'll help to keep you warm through the cold night's chill
rumor suggests that that I'm on my last legs just don't forget me yet
I'll watch this wine turn into water
I'll watch this water turn into clouds
I'll watch these clouds turn into water
love what I do is not without purpose I'll follow through
tomorrow I'll pick a direction one has never gone
it surely can't go wrong
I wish I could have tried to survive
don't worry about me it's silly I admit to lose sleep
hold me closely tonight
watching waiting
take the warmth right from me now I'm all alone over indulged in precious things
I've left a legacy
trade places with me I promise you fortunes
think about it carefully the fruitful possibilities
It's what brings us closer
moving the mountains
