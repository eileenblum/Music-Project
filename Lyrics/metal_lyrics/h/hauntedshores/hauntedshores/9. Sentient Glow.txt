Bound to a fading sense

an ancient dream arises
conjugate all the fractions
Though I'm a man
I feel part of something grand
on the day they reach
I'll know that it was me

we drown our mistakes in rivers of emotion
behold how far the progress must go
imagine horace, without time to seize
provoked, our lives will nourish the soul

we fall apart
this is the perfect time
whatever makes your heart escape
the feeling is lost in time
balance has fallen

now here we are again
alive and lacking presence
analyze my reflection
why? i can't put this to rest
on the day we meet
I'll know it's meant to be

we drown our mistakes in rivers of emotion
behold how far the progress must go
imagine horace, without time to seize
provoked, our lives will nourish the soul

(love)
for all the things that have washed ashore
a certain future reminds me
(of)
the time it takes
for pieces that broke to unite

this is the perfect life
to move ahead
the ground that shakes
beneath your feet
faith moving me

whatever makes your heart escape
the feeling is lost in time
whatever makes your heart escape

the feeling is lost in light
