As we grow with rusty nails in the coffin
among potential of diamonds and pearls.
This sea of blood fills the crevice between
our lifeless body and the whispers for which we reach.

Behold as the water floods the red.
Time commands of us
to meet again in silence.
Awakening to a higher light.

If we sever the distance between one another,
and cross out the fear we learn,
all are one and nothing is keeping the love in our souls from bursting infinitely.

Now what have we become?
An entity of survival.
The rotting flesh of the fallen stains our ego.
Now the moment is at hand to rise above what was once so prevalent.

Folding time within the mortal boundaries lived upon. Moving onward.
We will never fade.
Fall into another dead end.
Will it end the same?
Lines are drawn for the rest of the story.

If we sever the distance between one another,
and cross out the fear we learn,
all are one and nothing is keeping the love in our souls from bursting infinitely.

This life is one that we must live.
The peace once embraced from so long ago
sleeps deep within our mind.
Stay forever or be erased
from the harmonic physical state of being
existing in this dimension.
Lies are covered, but only for the moment.

The blood of the weak will carve the way for the innocent.
