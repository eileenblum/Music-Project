In the face of time I hold my breath
My hands are tied, my system wired
To the source
My incantation speaks your name
I am lost all the same
In a maze

Alignment â realignment
With the moment, with my self
Never have I been so open
To the workings of my self

In my mind, I see fear
In my heart, I am clear

I just know
Overcome by what I see
What I hear, what I feel
About you

Taste the moment, come back here
Feel my self changing gears
I am gone
Resurrection, I am back
New perspective, I collapse
Into grace

Open â to the core
Fragile â even more
Blessings â I am here
Hopeless â we draw near
