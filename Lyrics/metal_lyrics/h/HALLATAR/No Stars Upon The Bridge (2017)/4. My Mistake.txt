Into the future of my days
I look through all the gates
where I've blocked the way
due to my mistakes
But if a circle cannot break

Then why don't I feel safe
When I see what I eventually will have to face
When day turned into night
I lost my way
All the signs were so bright that I went blind to one detail

I would break the silence if
In all this they call life
I make my way

Its a lot to undertake
clear the way from my mistake
open lines to all that pain
In the dream I'm wide awake
But in their eyes I seem to fade
How can I explain?

This fortress made of ice
will break some day
From the waters we'll rise again
Like razorblades

When day turned into night
I lost my way
All the signs were so bright that I went blind to one detail

I would break the silence if
In all this they call life
I make my way
