When dreams burn down
And reason comes around
No one can fill this void I have found
For centuries it has walked with me

Eye of the storm
See the fading light
Turn to stone and ice
With a broken sword
A name inscribed
In blood and ice

I can avoid the hurt with anger
And protect myself with hate
But in the end what this comes down to
Is that there are no mistakes
You made me see my weakness
Where I thought that I was safe
And where my whole independence
Was still tied up in chains

When dreams burn down
And reason comes around

No one can fill this void I have found
For centuries it has walked with me
