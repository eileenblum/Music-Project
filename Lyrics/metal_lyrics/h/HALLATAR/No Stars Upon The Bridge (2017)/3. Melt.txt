I came here for my love
For your eyes, for your gaze
Light, embrace me
Night, grace me
I am yours
In the silence

Dreams caress me everlasting
Let me see where I am holding back
Gazing in silver twilight
For the dawn, awaken into black

Hold me closer in acceptance
Let me feel the line where I draw back
Overdue
I melt
With you

Dreams caress me everlasting
Let me see where I am holding back
Gazing in silver twilight
For the dawn, awaken into black

Now, where are you in the morning
Why am I broken into one?
I am I, breathing half-light
Forcefully undone by daylight done

Send me in to silence
Close the doors, the falling has begun

Now, where are you in the morning
Why am I broken into one?
I am I, breathing half-light
Forcefully undone by daylight done

Dreams caress me everlasting
Let me see where I am holding back
Gazing in silver twilight
For the dawn, awaken into black

Bring me in, I am waiting
For you
Dream me in, let me find you
My True love
