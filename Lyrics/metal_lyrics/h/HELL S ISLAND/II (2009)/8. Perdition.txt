From now
Walkinâ down the street of blinds,
No voice
Sounds in the ears if times...
A town
Breaks the laws of fate,
A pain
A lake of naÃ¯ve mistake...

As death borns from a flower
Souls arise in a sea of perdition
And a crow looks at the passage
Of a breath has lost its perception

A black
Waterfall in the sky,
No hope
To feel in a dark so dry...
An instant
Makes a wound as a dream,
Unheard pain
A lake where to bleed

As death born from a flower
Souls arise in a sea of perdition

The thought becomes a thorn
Waitinâ for a meaning born
The silence in a storm
Waitinâ for a raising soul

Waitinâ for an opened soul
