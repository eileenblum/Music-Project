Bleed inside
A new friend of mine
Spurts inside
To another life

The price of being yourself
Yesterday could end

Upstream vagrancy
Trust in the eternity

Visions in a magic theatre
How and why can it be there?

A wolf in the darkness
A solitary prayer

Thousand shades on a mirror
One end without sorrow

Mind and wisdom fight
Wild instinct of time
