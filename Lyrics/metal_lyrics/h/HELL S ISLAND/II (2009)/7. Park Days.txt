Sitting on that bench
In the garden of ice
Dissolving blank feelings
In the talk with the devil

Hidden by trees
Undressed unleashed
Risk more than death
A gash to escape

Fall in
Park on a dead land
Dark hand

The castle watched the smiles
Ephemeral but intense
Everyday going there
To face gods with no care

Fall in
Park on a dead land
Dark hand

Fear and chaos
Poetry and instinct
Sliding losing senses

Exploring
Stranger ways
Losing sliding out of the land
