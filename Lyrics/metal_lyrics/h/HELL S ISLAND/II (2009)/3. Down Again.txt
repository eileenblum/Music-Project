Have you killed it
Or have I let it die?
So sweet to forget
Your name in red

I leave again
Deception in a glass
Joy as a grab
Laying on your web
Down again
Death in her dress
Reminds me an escape
Down again

A chair so cold
My hands on you
Your father is right
My brothers are died

I leave again
Deception in a glass
Death in her dress
Reminds me an escape

Down again
