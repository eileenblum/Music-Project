Can you sleep?

How can you sleep?
I canât I donât want
How can you breathe?
Iâm burning in depth

Donât think donât think
How can you sleep?
Donât think donât think
How can you breathe?

Youâre talking alone
Watch the eyes behind you
Rape doubts inside you
Youâ re living alone

Stones take me home
A river makes me fast
The sky lets me last
Stones take me home
