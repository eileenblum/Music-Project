Dark time in life when nothing shows.
Constant struggle/constant fear.
I cant explain and the words escape me.

Endless roads and sleepless nights.
Empty thoughts and countless fights.
I cant get out Im suffocated.
I cant explain and the words escape me.

My cold and weathered headstone.
A worthless pile of bones.
Faillure carved on my casket.
And a hate-filled rotten heart inside.

The anvil, and hammer to forge a better man.
Are now used to build my last and eternal home.

poison tears stream down my face .
my heart beats at unsteady pace .
as I tried to stand again .
I opened scars, they're never healing.

Endless roads and sleepless nights.
Empty thoughts and countless fights.
I cant get out Im suffocated.
I cant explain and the words escape me.

The words escape me/My mind betrayed me.

Amity, will never be.
the wistful river now pulls me down.
