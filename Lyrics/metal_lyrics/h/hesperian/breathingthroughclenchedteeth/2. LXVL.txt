An insincere and evil friend is more to be feared than the wildest beast.
You can't whisper in my ear, and you could never bring me down.
Hate, the wicked envy is their way of admiring.
Life across villains and liars was the best choice I ever made.
but We can learn the art of fierce compassion.
Find our strength, the fire in us all.
Deconstructing isolation, and re-new a sense of love.
Educate, appreciate
The beauty of our world.
If there is no struggle,
It will be dark forever.
