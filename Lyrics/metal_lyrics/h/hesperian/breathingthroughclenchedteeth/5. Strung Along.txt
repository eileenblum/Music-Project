This room is rotating.
I can't tell if it's warm or cold.
And I wanna hold you tight, but at the same time id rather be on my own
Is it prevalent that the more I think, The more I shatter?
And is it confident to think that the harder I try, the more I better?

NO!
I've been strung along, for three fucking years.
Have felt numerous times where love and hate meet.
"We gotta try, just a little bit harder"
Can't think of what we could have been, the result is here, you gotta live your fear.

The fury in me, has reached it's peak.
Still can't believe I'm going through with this.
"How can I love you, when I can't even love myself?"
Truth is, you'd fucking hate me..if you knew the truth.

For pleasures past, I do not grieve nor perils gathering near ;
My greatest grief is that I leave NOTHING that claims a tear.
