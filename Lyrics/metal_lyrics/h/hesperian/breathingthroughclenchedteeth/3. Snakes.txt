In this arsenal of friendship, you could never be.
You mean nothing to me, and you never will.
This is where I rise, this is where you fall.
Pushed your falsified mentality right back in the snakepit.

left to be found.
Nobody's coming back for you.
Did you really think somebody would help you?
Don't ever forget, this is all thanks to you.

I won't be there, to get you through.
because of what makes me, but breaks you .

left to be found.
Nobody's coming back for you.
Did you really think somebody would help you?
Made to be me, and you're a fucking waste.
Don't ever forget, this is all thanks to you.
