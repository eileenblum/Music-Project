All this guilt that's stored inside of me, it eats me up inside.
I can only dream of what I can be, consumed by regret.
Break free from the chains that keep truth at bay.
Set free what's inside of me.
Become all that I can be.
Seize this moment, undo my mistakes, no longer hold back.
Burn all the lies, spreak straight from the heart.
Forgive but never forget

I've dug a pit to hide for the truth. Buried my darker half that should be kept from the world.
So here I lie, caged underneath the ground with the weight of the world pushing me down.
For way too fucking long I've been choosing the wrong directions
I can no longer run from my mistakes, buried myself so deep I can never escape.
For way too fucking long I've been facing away.
As I lie and wait till I die I just wish for someone to hear me out.

Set me free, with no cross to bear.
