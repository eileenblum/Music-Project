My hate revealed in front of God
The mark in my brain is an inverted pentacle
Made by hellfire, Satan, be a part of me
The wrath of almighty father burning free

The age of darkness come to humanity
The beast emerges and extinguishes the angels
His blood draw the run to Hades
Is the utter aggression against Heaven

Satan, show me the path of rapture
Guide me into the varathrum
Bring me to blackest dimensions
Grant me the seed of self destruction

The Earth is sick flesh under a blackened sky
I am the immoral, the stigma of corruption
I destroy unbound, and life disappears
I scorn the impotence of Christ

My hate revealed in front of God
The mark in my brain is an inverted pentacle
Made by hellfire, Satan, be a part of me
The wrath of almighty father burning free

My soul is infected with grotesque sense
Calm is over, rage rebirth inside me
My humanity deformed by inferior domain
Meet the gateway to ineffable perfection
