Spawned in the deepest Hell
Holocaust is my mission!!!
Fire in the sky is the sign of my conquest
The great goat command this great attack
Black seeds of holocaust sprinkled on the soil
Satanic forces infesting the earth
Antichrist eternal in the bloodshed camp
Hell's commando are devastating

The violence falling like rain
On the remnants of the golden skies
When only rise the fist of antichrist
Signal of eternal and holocaustic victory

Apocalyptic hail to the Hell mercenaries
Newborn Satan's soldiers berserker in fury
Blasting the divine hordes of Heaven
With toxic and uncontrolled hellfire

Raised upon from an abhorrent legions
Out of flesh, every Christians suffer before me
Mortifying the moribund messiah
Betrayed by God, the mankind never learns

The beast come infesting the fucking Earth
With his commands of death bringers
Endless attack of unhallowed Hell's battalions
Until Heaven surrender, scream for his near end

Raised upon from an abhorrent legions
Out of flesh, every Christians suffer before me!!!

The horned Lord reborn in hatred
This is the time for the rape of angels
Carnage shall consume the Christian misery
On every nations, to every humans

Apocalyptic hail to the Hell mercenaries
Newborn Satan's soldiers berserker in fury
Blasting the divine hordes of Heaven
With toxic and uncontrolled hellfire
