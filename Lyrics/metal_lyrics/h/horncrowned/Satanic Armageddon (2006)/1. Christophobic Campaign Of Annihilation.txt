On furious iron and hate is devoured the planet
Nothing live after devastation march
All the god's creatures must live a violent fate
The mission of machines is total genocide

Demonic powers incarnated on wrathly tanks
The Devil's forces command the cataclysmic hunt
Purest inferno break all the gates
Hate and fire spawned in alliance with war

Calling the flesh and steel for the battle
As flames to scorch on the Earth
A hymn to christophobic annihilation
The machines have return to fulfill the mission

Demonic powers incarnated on wrathly tanks
The Devil's forces command the cataclysmic hunt
Purest inferno break all the gates
Hate and fire spawned in alliance with war

Massacre and havoc will be my guide
The inexorable advance of predator machines
To live the Earth in control of Hell
The holocaust is here, the triumph of baphomet

Bring the violence all over immense world
The machines lurk in the smoke for survivors
Heaven and Christians face the last attack
Unholy conquest is the final destiny

Demonic powers incarnated on wrathly tanks
The Devil's forces command the cataclysmic hunt
Purest inferno break all the gates
Hate and fire spawned in alliance with war
