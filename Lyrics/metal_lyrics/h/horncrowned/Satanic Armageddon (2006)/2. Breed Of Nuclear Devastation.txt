Is the reich of endless desolation
A nuclear Hell purify the planet
The uttermost destructions are imminent
Millions of corpses plague the face of the world

Breed of nuclear devastation
Chosen to walk the Earth alone
Breed of nuclear devastation
Make this sphere blackest than Hell

A red plague shall dominate
Over this place without survivors
Radiation storms calcinating the surface
Total condemnation, the final solutino

Hatred
Anger
Panic
I'll do it for the world!!!

From the east to the west
The blade of death triumphant rides
Nothing leaves of the Earth
The nuclear victory prevail

Terror
Pain
Desolation
By my side!!!

From the north tot he south
The blade of chaos triumphant ride
Nothing leaves of the Earth
The nuclear triumph prevail

Chaos
Hell
Devastation
Is my law!!!

Breed of nuclear devastation
Chosen to walk the Earth alone
Breed of nuclear devastation
Make this sphere blackest than Hell

Toxic rains strike forever more
The humanity has failed into a lifeless reign
Contamination is loosened upon this world
The nuclear breed prevail

Terror
Pain
Desolation
By my side!!!
