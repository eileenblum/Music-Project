All humanity is crucified
Destroy the "Eden" forever
Angels race are extinct
Vanquished is God, is Heaven

Return Satan to his throne
Legitimate king of the universe
Hell battalions march victorious
On the ashes of celestial kingdom

Crowned is Satan, Crowned is Hell
Magnificent king of darkness
Oppressor of Heaven's servants
Hail Satan!!! I swear allegiance

Blood red clouds on the sky
Black rain over the world
Fire in the surface
Satan rise triumphant forever

Crowned is Satan, crowned is Hell
Hail Satan!!! Rege Satana!!!
Crowned is Satan, triumphant is satan
Hail Satan!!! Rege Satana!!!

Heretics in the power
Christians will never appear
Satan dominator of this blessed creation
Only Hell will remain

The holocaust fill the air
God and Heaven burn down
Satan is the controller of human destiny
Master of every kingdoms

Satan is one with victory
The Devil soldiers honored in war
Feel the strength of the beast
The horncrowned triumph!!!
