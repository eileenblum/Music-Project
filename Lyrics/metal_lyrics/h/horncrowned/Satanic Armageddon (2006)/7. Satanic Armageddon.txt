I'm the cursed, I'm the arrival of satanic armageddon
I'm not human, I'm the heaviest war machine

Demon legions come permanently
Ruthless mandatory of the cursed

The new phase of abomination
All bridges among humans are destroyed
The bloodlusting forces unleashed
Carnal devastation over holy ground

All crowns ascent from Hell
Lucifer in rage destroy the Earth
Belial poison the air with fire
Leviathan's blackstorm to all seas

Satanic armageddon
The final confrontation
Unlimited destruction
Total rapture
Blood rain from asunder red skies
Firetides, mass destruction to all creatures

Bloodsoaked, to kill everyone
Total war is now, fire and human pesticide
The triumph of hate over mankind
Determinate the end of Christianity

Satanic armageddon
The final confrontation
Unlimited destruction
Total rapture
Blood rain from asunder red skies
Firetides, mass destruction to all creatures
