The beast born through my unpure force
Disaster is near, I desecrate the grave of God
I am the goatsoldier in antichristian war
Son of fire, blackest conscript

The alliance with the hellfire tyrant
Destroy any vestige of divine manifestation
There's no have pause in my fight
Time to battle, when victory scream

Killing to God again and again
Beneath my skin only violence prevail
Wrath and revenge rise in strongest rage
Is the purest war, demonic mark inside me

The alliance with the hellfire tyrant
Destroy any vestige of divine manifestation
There's no have pause in my fight
Time to battle, when victory scream

The baphomet's mark in my burning heart
Strongest plague, rule my fate
Christ blood in my weapons
The sign of the conqueror

The alliance with the hellfire tyrant
Destroy any vestige of divine manifestation
There's no have pause in my fight
Time to battle, when victory scream

Inexorable is the end of the Earth
The lands ripping and scorched
immense hell to exploit in fury
Inexorable is the end of God

The alliance with the hellfire tyrant
Destroy any vestige of divine manifestation
There's no have pause in my fight
Time to battle, when victory scream

Missiles toward creation of God
Fire blast from my tank
Goatsoldiers demolish the holy cross
Demonic beasts with only death on their mind
