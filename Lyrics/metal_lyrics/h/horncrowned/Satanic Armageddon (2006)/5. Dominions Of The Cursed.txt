Satan, lord of the sulphur empire
Destructive force upon the Earth
Hurl down the despot Christian God
Retaliatorial return of your inhumanity

God send his fetid light of salvation
That's distorts the mankind mind
Total war protracted to the end of Heaven
The abyss eradicate all vestige of Christ

Satan, turn the life into war
Satan, slaughter the angels and God
Satan, desecrate the temples of skies lord
Satan, torture the Nazareth's son

The cursed son shall dominate
Plagues and devilsoldiers are his attack
Emerging from blackstorms of Varathrum
Misanthropic campaign of supremacy

Satan, turn the life into war
Satan, slaughter the angels and God
Satan, desecrate the temples of skies lord
Satan, torture the Nazareth's son

Antichrist reach higher of flames
The court of Belial send messages of death
From the shadows of Gehenna
When the power of Christ is futile

The cursed son shall dominate
Plagues and devilsoldiers are his attack
Emerging from blackstorms of Varathrum
Misanthropic campaign of supremacy

Peace is forgotten on the Earth
Agonizing the seraphs drag on soil
Misery and cruelty punish all man
Chaotic revelation, now is true

God send his fetid light of salvation
That's distorts the mankind mind
Total war protracted to the end of Heaven
The abyss eradicate all vestige of Christ

Satan, turn the life into war
Satan, slaughter the angels and God
Satan, desecrate the temples of skies lord
Satan, torture the Nazareth's son
