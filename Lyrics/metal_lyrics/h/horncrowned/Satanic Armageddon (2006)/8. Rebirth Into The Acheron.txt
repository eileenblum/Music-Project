Thousand of legions spawned in the magma
The vengeance burning inside his hearts
Forthcoming the final battle
The maximum chaos rise from the Acheron

The soldiers of hate are rising from the lava
Extermination is the only mandatory
Monstrous magnificence is the legacy
To each warrior, to each demon

Rebirth into the Acheron
Chaos and consummation rules
Destructive instinct under the skin
Raise the turbulence forged in Hell
Rebirth into the Acheron
Demon of fury, hate inside me
Bringer of fire, devastation and sick
Blasphemy in word and creation

All walls of Heaven are demolished
Infectious plagues emerge from beneath realm
And invade all cosmic order
The existence, involutioning into despair

The legions of Acheron raise now
Condemn to extinction all celestial kind
Demonic anger dominate the Earth
Never again shall God reign

Baphomet's cloven hoof in the holy soil
The enemy of darkness are buried
Anti-human 666 in the altar of the chasm
Jehova nailed tot he ground forever

Rebirth into the Acheron
Chaos and consummation rules
Destructive instinct under the skin
Raise the turbulence forged in Hell
Rebirth into the Acheron
Demon of fury, hate inside me
Bringer of fire, devastation and sick
Blasphemy in word and creation
