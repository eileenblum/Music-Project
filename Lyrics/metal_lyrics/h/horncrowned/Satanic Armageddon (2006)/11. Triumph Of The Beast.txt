Soldiers marked by the seal of the beast
Are devastating the land of God
The day of the end has arrived
All the Christians will die in this war

Attack!!!
Diabolic forces finally congregate
The beast commands the great final chaos

Under the beasts command
We will burn all the Christians corpses
The churches remained in ashes
And the Satan's triumph will be proclaimed
Then, the terror age will begin
The armageddon will be eternal
Fire and wickedness in every place
All the souls will be offered to the crowned with horns

The sky is full of demons
The fire spreads on everything
Burn!!!

Under the horned's command
We will destroy all the Christians souls
The crosses remained in ashes
And the horncrowned triumph will be proclaimed
Later, the age of darkness will arrive
And the Satan's soldiers will defend the throne of evil
The pentagrams will shine in the sky
And the blood of the weak will be sprinkled on the Earth

Satanic forces possess me
The Earth in ruins is my final objective
Hell!!!

Under the diabolic command
We will destroy all the bastards souls
The saints remained in ashes
And the Devil's triumph will be proclaimed
Later, the age of darkness will arrive
And the goatsoldiers will defend the black horde
The fire will shine in the sky
And the blood of the blessed will be sprinkled on the Earth

Under the beasts command
We will burn all the Christians corpses
The churches remained in ashes
And the Satan's triumph will be proclaimed
Then, the terror age will begin
The armageddon will be eternal
Fire and wickedness in every place
All the souls will be offered to the crowned with horns

The evil kingdom demands its throne
My blood is offered in battlefield

Under the lord of evil's command
we will annihilate all the Christian existences
The priests remained in ashes
And the beast's triumph will be proclaimed
War!!!
