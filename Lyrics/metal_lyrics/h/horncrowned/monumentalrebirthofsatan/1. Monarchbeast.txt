I am the Reptile
in the altar of the flesh
I'm the revelation
of misery days
I am the beast of evil perfection
I am the symphony of Apocalypse

I am the monarchbeast
the supreme dictator
and bringer of destruction

Dishonor in the territory where always in might
for millenniums, my dwelling and dominions
I am the elite to the weak
I am the confidant of them, despoiled of the pride

The half light was extended to all the cosmos
as in a immense and inert garden
the obsession of the king of light
is an absolute lie of (your) cry

[Chorus:]
I am the banner of omega
I am the anathema of hate
I am the deity of extermination
I am all hell and me at same time

fornicate with the whores of the entire world
I am engendered me to myself
all my descent walk for the desolate earth
was full of twisted roads

I was the stepfather of children of the lamb
that they knelt swear me allegiance
They inherited the early treason
buried to god an his angels

the age of the Antichrist in height
and army that put end to the bone
of redemption of the weak
the eternal promise that the god of the desert did them

[Chorus]

Monarchbeast!!!

[Repeat first verse]

cold venom in my flesh
is the fate of all crown of the earth
my manifesto is the last sign that will be seen
i disappeared the last prophet

[Chorus]

Rerbert malish
