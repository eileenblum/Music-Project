It is time they attack the armies
of the great kingdom of the abyss
christian domain won't be eternal
the legionaries won't leave more
then ashes of their decadent skies
they walk trough fire
with their banner hoisted with pride
the new ruler's pride

They will feel our force, like a hellfirestorm 

The sacred cathedrals have their counted hours
on the horizont it won't be seen more than flames 
god no longer listen the cry of his angels...
angels that will be extint
for the unmeerciful fire of our storm
the armies are deploying
and they will establish their dark seed 
has finally flourish their for the oppression of the faithful ones

The domain of the deeps, 
has dictated sentence 
he hangs on the world
a hellfirestorm

It is time they attack the armies
of the great kingdom of the abyss
christian domain won't be eternal
the legionaries won't leave more
then ashes of their decadent skies
they walk trough fire
with their banner hoisted with pride
the new ruler's pride

The domain of the deeps, 
has dictated sentence 
he hangs on the world
a hellfirestorm

As thunders they are our voices
that the scream the new domineering's name...
