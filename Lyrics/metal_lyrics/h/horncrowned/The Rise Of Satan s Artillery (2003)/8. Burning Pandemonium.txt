In the land reign ferocious plagues
the blood flows like an endless stream
time after time, rain fire and pain
christians suffer sickness and pestilence

The throne of lucifer 
Established on the earth
burnin pandemonium
The throne of lucifer 
Established on the earth
burnin burning pandemonium

Destiny is torment, never salvation
without hope arise, the fear within
Sun no raise in the dark realm
surrounded by predatory beasts

We have return, but now we are inmortals
in our wicked spirits born the beast
the resurrection of nightmare on the earth
is the path for rebirth of chaos and death

The throne of lucifer 
Established on the earth
burnin pandemonium
The throne of lucifer
Established on the earth
burnin burning pandemonium

Destiny is torment, never salvation
without hope arise, the fear within
Sun no raise in the dark realm
surronunded  by predatory beasts
