Our artillery exploring ahead
as a wrathly beast of prey
bloodtides flowing in the tortured
rows of angels imploring mercy

Satan, lord of infernal legions
attack with the fury of thousand demons
his cannon seen blaze in the battlefield
and his soldiers like wolves attacking without piety

Satan....hear my call

Rise the satan's artillery
heaven's destiny is sorrow
Rise the satan's artillery
we march victorious

As a powerful dragon
charge against the soldiers of light
the run for theirs lives, run like cowards
but is too late....death is arrived

Satan.....come forth

Rise the satan's artillery
The razed earth is our dwell
rise the satan's artillery
thous soldiers burn with your hate

Satan...grant the strengh to all thous troops
carry the destruction all over the world 
and finally establish thou powerfull realm
founded on the ashes of flaming heaven

As a powerful dragon
charge against the soldiers of light
they run for theirs lives, run like cowards
but is too late....death is arrived
