Warlord, attack, destroy, torch
crush the sign of the liar, the cross
origin of cowards and slaves
conquest all the holy empire

Belial, guide me away from hellfire
antichrist, command our demonforce
hellbrigadiers, in battle brings warheads
world's redemption, turns in damnation

We are the invincible demonforce
combat on horses of steel and fire

Slaying force, total violence
bloodthirst demons, march to genocide
forget the ashes of razed earth
come the impending extinction of christianity

We are the invincible demonforce
brutal hate destroy all the weak

We are in league with the oponent of god 
slaughter, overkill and agony for the humanity
towards devastation we march with pride
a crusade of everlasting desolation 

We are the invincible demonforce
combat on horses of steel and fire
we are the invincible demonforce 
brutal hate destroy all the weak
