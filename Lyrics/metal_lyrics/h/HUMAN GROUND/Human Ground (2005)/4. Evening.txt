Slowly I open my eyes
Nothing around me has changed
The darkness is the same
And there is no-one else
To hear the sound of falling tears
The things that hold me alive
Trying to keep awake the feelings
To cry for not to die
All I know is now it's evening
Again, another endless one
Makes my mind feel so exhausted
To burn alive
And to know that now it's evening
Hope that soon the sun will rise
Makes me smile upon my shadows
They'll take my hand
My world is just an endless circle
That keeps me silent, holds me tight
And tries to take away my feelings
For I shall never cry
I'll go ahead to face the darkness
To meet a man from yesterday
To ask him if the day I was born
Was just the day I started dying
