Going down to the roots
Visiting the place under
Passing through the levels of time
Seeing "Gods" in dirt
At the gates of deepest fear
Cold will tear you apart
It hits you like a spear
All your fear lies in the dark
Let them rest in peace
Would you like to be disturbed?
Let them rest in peace
Would you like to be disturbed?
Soon we'll find ourselves
Next to thee
The deeper you dig
The further you leave me
Try finding the right way back
It's not going to be easy to see
Graves are filled with bones
They don't want us to be there
You've been warned
So get the fuck out of here
