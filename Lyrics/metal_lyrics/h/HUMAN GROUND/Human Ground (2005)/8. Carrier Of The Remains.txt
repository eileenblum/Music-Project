This one was born on a rainy night
With the intention to save the world
Clear in his blood and sight
He's the one who brought us the faith
When we're all gone, you're on your own
With our thoughts you'll stand alone
Use wisely the things you've learned
Don't let 'em go to waste, don't let 'em burn out
Killed are the ones you loved
The silence won't let them say a word
Life slowly fades away
Leaving you everything that's left behind
That makes you the Carrier
The Carrier of the Remains
All beliefs and experience
You'll pass away when your time comes
One day you'll be gone - he'll be on his own
With his thoughts he'll stand alone
That makes him the Carrier
The Carrier of the Remains
