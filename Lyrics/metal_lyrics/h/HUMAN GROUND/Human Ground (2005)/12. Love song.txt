Sometimes I wish you were dead
Eyes closed, lying in bed
Sometimes I wish you were dead
Stone cold, covered in red
You're lying in my bed
Nice view
That's how I like you
What a nice view
That's why I love you
Nice view
That's the reason I killed you
What a great view
That's the way I like you most
That's the way I like you most
That's the way I like you most
That's the way I like you most
