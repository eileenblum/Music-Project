I'm lying inside a cave of lies
Waiting for you to make me true
Make up your mind and I shall rise
To bring for you gold and jewels
I am the one to load your gun
I am your name, your life and fame
Just let me come to light your sun
To hide your shame and feed the blaze
Just take my hand, no pain to stand
No pride to lose, no blame to choose
I'll give you light, dark as the night
A taste of time as sweet as Wine
Don't want to be grand, wine turns into sand
âTil I'm untrue waiting for you
I am you might a way to delight
Just seek the sign and cross the line
As I feel it inside
It stays right beside
The road leads me ahead
It's hollow and dead
