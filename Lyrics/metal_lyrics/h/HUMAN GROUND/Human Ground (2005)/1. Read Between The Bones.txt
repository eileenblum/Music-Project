Mass destruction, brutal death
Deep holes are filled with bodies
The Hand that leads or takes their breath
Even a single nerve doesn't move
Evil has taken the land
Every soul shall die
Smell the grease and ash in the air
Just wait for your turn
Your turn!!!
They've been suffering, tortured in pain
Read it between the bones you see
Poisoned gas and surgeries
Chambers filled with screams
Body disposal, the end of youth
Your flesh has turned to steam
Trains will take you away
Treaded upon like animals
Your life has turned to a nightmare
Living terror disorder!!!
They've been suffering, tortured in pain
Read it between the bones you see
