I came across the folds of space
Come here to reap the human race
Traveling on light between the waves
Deceiver from another plane

Lightwave
Fold space

Lightwave
Fold space

Dimensional rift inside of time
A warp of science and of mind
I can command the dead to rise
I am the demon lord of flies

Lightwave
Fold space

Lightwave
Fold space
