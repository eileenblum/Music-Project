Working here inside my tower
Reaping lightning from the air
Feeding life through my conductors
To the corpse that's lying there

In disbelief my peers could never see
My genius they don't understand
Now they'll believe that with electricity
I have created man

In my own laboratory
I've researched for years of time
For the science and the glory
I shall give the dead new life

In disbelief my peers could never see
My genius they don't understand
Now they'll believe that with electricity
I have created

Body parts
Sewn from eight corpses
Change of heart
Handpicked brain
Fire of life
Electric pulse courses
Into its mind
Animate

In disbelief my peers could never see
My genius they don't understand
Now they'll believe that with electricity
I have created man

In disbelief my peers could never see
My genius they don't understand
Now they'll believe that with electricity
I have created

It's alive
It's alive
