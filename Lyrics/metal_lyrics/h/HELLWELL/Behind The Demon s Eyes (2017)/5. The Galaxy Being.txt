Experimenting with transmissions
Into the galaxy beyond
I feel that life has to be out there
My computers say I'm not wrong

Message inside of mathematics
Revealing my coordinates
I've worked a lifetime on this theory
That life is not just only this

Time folded frequencies
The galaxy being
Will bring us to our knees

And then one night to my amazement
A signal coming back to me
Transmitting to my holographic
Computer's 3D imagery

Before my eyes I see the being
A biped radiating light
Establishing communication
Decoding voice, not only sight

Time folded frequencies
The galaxy being
Will bring us to our knees

Time folded frequencies
The galaxy being
Will bring us to our knees

Electromagnetic energy
He told that he was solely made
An accidental surge of power
Has transferred him into this plane

Across the spans of time and space
This fusion entity was hurled
He's radiating devastation
And I have brought him to this world

Time folded frequencies
The galaxy being
Will bring us to our knees

Time folded frequencies
The galaxy being
Will bring us to our knees
