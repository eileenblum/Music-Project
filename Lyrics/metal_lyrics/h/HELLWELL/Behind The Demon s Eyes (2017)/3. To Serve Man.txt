My secret is foul
And still no one suspects
That I'm feeding them all
With human rejects

My cover the church
Known as father to all
Every life has its worth
When it's under the saw

I'll play the organ for you
Gloat while you pray
I'll carry the cross for you
Over your grave
Dream of the taste of your brains

I'll pickle your flesh
No body parts spared
What I do not eat
I turn into wares

Pickled meat of my sins
Shoestrings made out of hair
Soap from bones, belts from skin
These I sell in the square

I'll play the organ for you
Gloat while you pray
I'll carry the cross for you
Over your grave

I'll play the organ for you
Gloat while you pray
I'll carry the cross for you
Over your grave
Dream of the taste of your brains

I'll play the organ for you
Gloat while you pray
I'll carry the cross for you
Over your grave

I'll play the organ for you
Gloat while you pray
I'll carry the cross for you
Over your grave

My knives are sharp
I stay busy
Carving the meat away from bone
The human hearts
Delicacy
I feast upon when I'm alone

I give refuse purpose in life
To feed the worthy they must die
Like angels of the god who fell
Descend
Welcome to my hell

Welcome, my friend
Unto my den
A secret I must tell to you
I'll bleed your head
Until you're dead
Of you I'll make a tasty stew

I give refuse purpose in life
To feed the worthy they must die
Like angels of the god who fell
Descend
Welcome to my hell

Dare thee fight
You don't deserve to live
Serving man
Cleanses me of my sins

Sitting here in my cell
No longer free
I'll sacrifice myself
And death I will cheat

Axe to head
You were supposed to die
By my hand
I shall escape this life

Sitting here in my cell
No longer free
I'll sacrifice myself
And death I will cheat

I guess I've had my fill
Of human meat
There is truth to the tale
You are what you eat

Sitting here in my cell
No longer free
I'll sacrifice myself
And death I will cheat

I guess I've had my fill
Of human meat
There is truth to the tale
You are what you eat

I played the organ for you
Laughed while you prayed
I carried the cross for you
Over your graves

I played the organ for you
Laughed while you prayed
I carried the cross for you
Over your graves

I played the organ for you
Laughed while you prayed
I carried the cross for you
Over your graves
