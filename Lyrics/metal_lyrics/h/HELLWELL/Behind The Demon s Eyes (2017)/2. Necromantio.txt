At the great Marathon
Was my honor to fall
Coins in eyes for Charon

Into Hades I go
On the ferryman's boat
On the river of souls

Still enslaved by the Fates
I am called to the gates
Where the living await

Come commune with the dead
With a ghost who has bled
With the heroes of men

Down the Acheron flow
Is the temple of souls
At Necromantio
