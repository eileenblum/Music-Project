No choice of mine 
The heart I have to find 
His venom binds me to his will 
Serpentine wine 
That blurs my possessed mind 
With nightmares of the gem that kills 

I'm cursed to search the lands 
Across the Stygian sands 
The Heart of Ahriman 
The key to Acheron 

I've searched for years 
Enslaved by magik's fear 
To find the Heart of Ahriman 
This sorcerer's key 
Can rise the dynasty 
That was the mighty Acheron 

I'm cursed to search the lands 
Across the Stygian sands 
The Heart of Ahriman 
The key to Acheron 

I found the tomb 
Where hid the gem of doom 
I feel my master call to me 
Into his hands 
I gave the fate of man 
And now I fear the earth shall bleed 

I'm cursed to search the lands 
Across the Stygian sands 
The Heart of Ahriman 
The key to Acheron
