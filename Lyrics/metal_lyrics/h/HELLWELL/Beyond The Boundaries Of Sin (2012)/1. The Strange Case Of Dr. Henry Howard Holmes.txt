1893 in Chicago 
Tesla lights the worlds fair 
Be a guest at The Castle 
If you dare 

Devils in disguise as a doctor 
Built the hotel of hell 
Muted screams in gas chambers 
Hundreds fell 

Flesh 
Stripped clean from the bone 
Death 
Skeletons are sold 
Damned 
Butcher with no soul 
Mad 
Dr. Henry Howard Holmes 

Macabre is the mind of this terror 
Watching his victims die 
In his lab in the cellar 
Evil hides 

Gruesome mastermind of deception 
Mortal demon on earth 
Plead his case as possession 
From birth 

Flesh 
Stripped clean from the bone 
Death 
Skeletons are sold 
Damned 
Butcher with no soul 
Mad 
Dr. Henry Howard Holmes
