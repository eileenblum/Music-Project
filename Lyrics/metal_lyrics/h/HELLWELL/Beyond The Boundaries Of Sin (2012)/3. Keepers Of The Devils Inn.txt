Neath the prairie moon 
Upon the Kansas plain 
Was a family's trading post 
Where evil found its name 

Murderous family of robbers 
Bender's of evil and sin 
Here there was death by the hammer 
At the Devils Inn 

Many an unwary traveler 
Came to an early demise 
None of the Bender's were captured 
Slipped into the night 

They'll drain the life 
Out of your pocket and your head 
And bury you out by the shed 
A trail to hell that led to deeds so foul and grim 
The keepers of the Devils Inn 

Who was it wielding the hammers 
Laying the blows to the head 
Mother or son, father or daughter 
A family to dread

Seances and bloody murder 
Fall through the trap door of hell 
Crimson and gore in the cellar 
Where the bodies fell

So Evil 
Family that feeds off of fear 
She devil 
She'll cut your throat ear to ear 
Souls that fell 
Beyond the boundaries of sin 
Fiends from hell 
Keepers of the Devils Inn 

They'll drain the life 
Out of your pocket and your head 
And bury you out by the shed 
A trail to hell that led to deeds so foul and grim 
The keepers of the Devils Inn
