Twelve vikings clad with sword and helm 
A lone Arab seeking himself 
Across the seas the thirteen sailed 
To save a king's curse ridden realm 

Human flesh cannibalized 
Come the fog and worm of fire 
Odin's warriors fought and bled 
With the eaters of the dead 

Out of the fog the monsters come 
But yet they bleed just like humans 
Men in bear skins that eat the dead 
The viking king takes their queen's head 

Human flesh cannibalized 
Come the fog and worm of fire 
Odin's warriors fought and bled 
With the eaters of the dead 

The king victorious 
The witch queen poisonous 
His life is fading thus 
Into Valhall 

The night leads to the fight 
Cannibal warriors strike 
The king comes back to life 
To kill them all 

The viking prayer is spoke 
To strengthen heart and hope 
Odin accepts his soul 
Into the Hall
