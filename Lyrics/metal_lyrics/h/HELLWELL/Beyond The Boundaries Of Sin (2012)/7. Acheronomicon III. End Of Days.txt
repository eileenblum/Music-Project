In the hands of the unnamed one 
The Heart of Ahriman burns bright 
Alien science or black magik 
Python's purple towers rise 

The time is come 
Acheron 
Raised from the dust 
Acheron 
The serpents rise 
Acheron 
Mankind's demise 

Metamorphose of the planet 
Mountains crumble to the sea 
Come the tides of war and chaos 
Now the race of man shall bleed 

The time is come
Acheron 
Raised from the dust 
Acheron 
The serpents rise 
Acheron 
Mankind's demise 

Gleaming spires touch the sky 
Vampire flights every night 
Serpents eyes none can hide 
Mortal cries from the fires 

Midgard's fate war and pain 
Ancient hate man made slave 
All hope fades world in flames 
Loss of faith end of days 

Inside the temple of the Old Ones 
The Heart of Ahriman still beats 
Bringing the plague of decimation 
The likes the world has never seen 

The age of man is gone forever 
The sons of demons rule the earth 
born out of fire a new world order 
Brought forth by Acheron's rebirth
