Science of cells
Genome from hell 
That men created 
In the lab themselves 

The planet plagued 
The gods outraged 
Man's desecration 
Of our DNA 

Reanimate 
Hell's spawn awaits 
Deadly nightshade 
Hell's gate 

Technology 
That breeds disease 
Contamination 
Across the seven seas 

A war with death 
Aim for the head 
There's only one way 
To kill the living dead 

Reanimate 
Hell's spawn awaits 
Deadly nightshade 
Doomsday 

Reanimate 
Hell's spawn awaits 
Deadly nightshade 
Hell's gate
