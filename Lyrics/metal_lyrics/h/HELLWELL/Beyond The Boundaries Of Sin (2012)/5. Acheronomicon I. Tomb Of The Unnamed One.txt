You have found me and woken my spirit of life 
In the ruins of Python your tomb we did find 
I have slept here in waiting for eons of time 
You have slaughtered my comrades 
And enslaved my mind 

Seek out the magik gem 
And place it in my hand 
The Heart of Ahriman 
The Serpents of the damned 
Once more shall rule these lands 
And end the reign of man 

Out of the ashes of Python 
Raised from an unholy grave 
The last of Cthugha's dark titans 
Venomous magik of chaos 
Would ravage the earth like a plague 
Come Acheron 

Tis the time of the dark rift aligned with the sun 
I'm possessed by your bite 
Poison runs through my blood 
You will serve 
And protect me help raise the Old Ones 
Rendered helpless by magik my life is undone 

Seek out the magik gem 
The Heart of Ahriman
So Acheron can live
The serpents of the damned
Once more shall rule these lands
And end the reign of man

Under the statue of Dagon 
Monster that I cannot name 
Son of the father of demons 
There will be no hope of salvation 
Vampires will rise from the flames 
Come Acheron 

Out of the ashes of Python 
Raised from unholy grave 
The last of Cthugha's dark titans 
Venomous magik of chaos 
Would ravage the earth like a plague 
Come Acheron 
Under the statue of Dagon 
Monster that I cannot name 
Son of the father of demons 
There will be no hope of salvation 
Vampires will rise from the flames 

Come Acheron
