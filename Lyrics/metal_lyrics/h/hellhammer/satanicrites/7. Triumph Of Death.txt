When you have been (once) down in your grave
Your mind decays and you're the coffin's slave
And when at midnight the uncanny bell tolls
Terrible noises the dark graveyard calls...

Limbs break through the dirt
Decay stinks like Hell
Dark creatures in the fog
Crusted blood on the dead

Eurynomos sends his souls
Buried by horrible mistakes
They feel they are eaten by the worms
And the night's alive again

Triumph of death
Triumph of death
