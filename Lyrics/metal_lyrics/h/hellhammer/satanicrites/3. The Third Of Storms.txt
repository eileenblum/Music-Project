Three days of absolute eclypse
Introduce the evoked tribunal
Hailstorms proof, they told us the truth

Total destruction, mankind to hell
Blind and insane the misguided repent
But it's a bit late...

In the heat of infernal lightnings
And in the shadows of poisoned clouds
The world will die under the sword of destiny

Go out and see, the omens are here
A church is red like blood of an angel
The rich and the poor, both will fall into the
Flames of malice...
