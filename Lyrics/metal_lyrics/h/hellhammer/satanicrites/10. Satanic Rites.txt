Satanic rites, satanic rites...
Virgin in moon's shine
Can't resist my lust
The night controls my mind
Watch out, there's something behind
Ignore her plead for mercy
And do my perverse deed

Satanic rites, satanic rites...
I love the screams of children
I love to see 'em hang
They are so little and helpless
So I'll do what I want

Come on you pretty girl
I know a silent place...

Satanic rites, satanic rites...
Be a good girl
And just do what I say
I whip you 'till you faint
I cut off your sweet, sweet legs
I fuck your helpless body
And bury it in the dirt

Satanic rites, satanic rites...
I am just a human
Aaaaaarrrgh!
I know what's good or wrong
But when I feel the darkness
Ha! I'll strangle them again!
Cause I'm an ordinary man...
