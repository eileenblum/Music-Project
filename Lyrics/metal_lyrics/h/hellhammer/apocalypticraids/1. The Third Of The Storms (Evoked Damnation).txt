[Lyrics by Tom Warrior (1983)]

Three days of absolute eclipse
Introduce the evoked tribunal
Hailstorms proof.  They told us the truth

[REFRAIN:]
Total destruction
Mankind to "Hell"
Blind and insane
The misguided repent
But it's a bit late...

In the heat of infernal lightnings
And in the shadows of poisoned clouds
The world will die under the sword of destiny

[REFRAIN]

Go out and see, the omens are here
A church is red, like blood of an angel
The rich and the poor, both will fall
Into the flames of malice

[REFRAIN]
