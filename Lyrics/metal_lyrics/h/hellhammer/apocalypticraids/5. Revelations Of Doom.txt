[Brazilian Bonus Track]

In the days of Armageddon, starved souls, greedy bodies 
Ready to punish, ready to kill 
Sword by sword they stand 
Strike on strike, faith is dead, Gog and Magog on 
Nergal's left hand... 

See, the rust gnaws on Michael's mystic sword 
Frozen's the lightning in Jehovas hand 
Angels it rains from the sky 
Extinct planets, pale meteors 
Captive of sins, slayed by the word 
Born in fire, a plundering horde 

Picked angels fall into emptyness 
Inverted crosses, damned saints 
A dead priest can't celebrate a mass 
Ravaged cities, slayed in the night 
Black holes, Belial's hour 
The Antichrist, born by church's power 

Havoc in heaven, hell reigns on earth 
The sperm of Sodom, born again 
So hail Balaam, we will serve 
Souls are thirsty to receive your command 
Vows of damnation poison the air 
Life in pain, 'til the end... 

The unholy trinity h olds the dominion in the 
flickering lightning of a black eye...
