When you have been down in your grave... alive
Your mind decays and you're the coffin's slave
And when, at midnight, an uncanny bell tolls
Terrible noises, the dark graveyard calls

Limbs break through the dirt
Decay stinks like hell
Dark creatures in the fog
Crusted blood on the dead

Triumph of death!
Triumph of death!

Eurynomos sends his souls
Buried by horrible mistakes (Let me out)
You feel you're eaten by worms
And the night's alive again

When you have been down in your grave... alive, alive, alive
Your mind decays and you're MY coffin's slave
And when, at midnight, an uncanny bell tolls
Terrible noises, the dark graveyard calls... you, you, you, you, you
