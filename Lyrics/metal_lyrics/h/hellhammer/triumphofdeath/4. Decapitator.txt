Eternal insanity, his mind's defaced
Thousands will die, lunatics have risen

Decapitator, ...
Termination, barbaric expression...

Harsh sounds when steel meets entrails
Decease will come, neck pierced with nails

Got no control about his deeds,
Hatchet in hand, the tool he needs

Repulsive noise as axe cuts bone
Head off the neck in an abhorrence tone
