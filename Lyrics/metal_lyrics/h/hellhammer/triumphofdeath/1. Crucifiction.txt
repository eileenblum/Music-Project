Crucifixion they called the game
Bestial penalty, a deadly maim
Crucifixion, the way that sinners go
Holy torment, last malice ya got to know

Crucifixion, crucifixion
Bloody Hell, I won't die here
Crucifixion, crucifixion
I'm bloodcovered in pain an' fear

Hundreds of years they raised the cross
Evil dark priest(s), black stones they toss
The bible, it prayses that bloody wood
A priest, he prays with an uncanny hood

Rusty nails sended them straight to hell
Illtreated, they just got their souls to sell
Crucifixion, the way that sinners go
Holy torment, last malice ya got to know
