I am the mean an' evil kind
I got the devil in my mind
I got an axe right in my hand
And I'm looking where my victim stands

I'm prowlin' through the night
And I'm searchin' for my fight
I'm ready for slaughter
Ready for slaughter

I see a girl I wanna kill
I follow her, it's my thrill
And when I see her broken skull
I know I'm livin' under Satan's rule

When the full moon's high and bright
Ya won't survive the night
Cause I'm ready for slaughter
Ready for slaughter

And when I see she feels the pain
Satisfaction is fillin' my brain
I know she feels the bloody heat
She's dying in that lonely street

I am the mean an' evil kind
I got the devil in my mind
I got an axe right in my hand
And I'm looking where my victim stands
