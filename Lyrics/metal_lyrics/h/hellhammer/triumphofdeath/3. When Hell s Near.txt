Premonition, last decision
Bloody hell, sin to sell
Creature in black mask
Sold by Satan for its task
Heavy ax falls on the block
Crowd roars in a shock
Execution, execution...
Wearin' black, on death's track
Cryin' in fear, when hell's near
Cold's ya breath, fingers of death
Yer last fun, the crowd has fun
