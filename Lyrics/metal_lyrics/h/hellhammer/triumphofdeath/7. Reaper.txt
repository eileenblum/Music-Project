When night's over the land,
A mural in darkness stands,
Evoke the Reaper's addiction,
Remember his symbol: a scyte...

That girl... she hears the rover,
She feels the coldness of a grave,
She's lookin' in her mirror,
And sees the face of... DEATH

He takes her to the shadows,
On gleaming wings they ride,
Mournerer is his victim,
As Reaper inherits his price
