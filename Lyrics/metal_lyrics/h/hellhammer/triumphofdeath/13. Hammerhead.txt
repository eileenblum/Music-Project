Thunder above fills the sky
Evil gleam his mean red eyes
Possessed by hell's rules, a terrible fight
And no one will ever forget that night

There was no weapon against hammerhead
There was no weapon against hammerhead
Savage damage, the sky was red
There was no weapon against hammerhead

Got no chance against his armour
Plates of steel, strong like hell
A beast of prey they called him
And mayhem ruled his hammer well

Lightning shows, death is near
I cannot hide, but I have no fear
Die in Satan's own round
Crashing skulls, a horrible sound
