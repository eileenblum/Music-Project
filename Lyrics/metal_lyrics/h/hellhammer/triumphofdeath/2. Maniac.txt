Midnight - Satan claims my soul
Feels right - Mayhem is my goal
Twelve times - Tolls the deadly bell
Moonrise - Messenger of hell

I'm a maniac, fight for hell
Devil's on my back, obey him well

Axeblade - Messenger of death
Dark shade - Cuttin' of Your breath
Night time - I'm raisin' my axe
Mean crime - Hell open it's gates

Possessed - By the demon's rule
Insist - Cleavin' victim's skulls
Torture - I don't kill in vain
Mortals - they will die in pain
