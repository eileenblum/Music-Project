Horrible warriors
Prowlin' through the night
Legions of darkness
Heroes of fight
Axes in their hands
Comin' across the swamp
Stalkin' their prey
The victims got no chance

Dark Warriors
Livin' in the night
Hungry for flesh
Thirsty for blood

The gate of hell breaks open
And Satan's sons come out
Who will now survive
When the warriors are in town
Axes in their hands
And daggers in their waists
Some sluts are lying dead
Killed by this evil force

The nightmare was over
When mornin' came around
The town has never been the same since that night
Smell of death is in the air
The blood runs through the streets
Maimed and slaughtered over all
No one survived that night
