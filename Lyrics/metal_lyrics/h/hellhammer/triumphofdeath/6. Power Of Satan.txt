Horrible things
Have to be done
Clouds in the sky
Away is the sun
I'll be the tormentor
On Satan's command
The victims will die
I'm the master's left hand

I know the tower
Where the sorcerer's at home
I feel the power
Of Satan in my soul

Havoc and hate
My weapon's my mate
I'm a soldier of death
I'm killing for hell
Blood lust I feel
My axe is from steel
I'm a hero of fighting
And I know it so well

Torture I'll bring
A devilish thing
Black is the sky
The nightmare will come
The moon is shining bright
It's the only light
My legions will fly
Fly for the night
