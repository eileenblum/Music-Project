Come here, my dear
Show me the dynamic mode
Look, there behind the door is passing time
Thrill me
I need to get teleported today
To the other side of the town
In the end of the dayâ¦ Iâm yours again

I will get back sooner than you think
But still, Iâm limited by the speed of light

Surrounded by the modern world
Driving faster in a new car
Too fastâ¦ faster than you think
However Iâm still very late

Come to me
Donât look behind
But still we are defined by the speed of light
Letâs drown in the deep sense of the world
Letâs leave the elastic events behind
We will fly into the universe
I will show you that penetrates the space
We will watch the life through my telescope
Someone alone in the emptiness

The period of days and nights becomes faster
Donât worry, Iâll be with you on next weekend again
Your synthetic voice in the telephone
Iâm losing you, You disappear again

Come to me
Donât look behind
But still we are defined by the speed of light
Letâs drown in the deep sense of the world
Letâs leave the elastic events behind
Itâs a new life
Where I lose you
So come quick to me
Yet I have time for you
Itâs a new life
When I control you
This is a real time
I cannot save you
Itâs a new life
Automatic people
I cannot save you
