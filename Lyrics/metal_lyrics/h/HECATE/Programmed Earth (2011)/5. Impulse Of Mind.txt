Nocturnal curses
Heavily blurred mind
It closes my eyes
Silence speaks instead of me
I want to suffer
Deep down below the frost
To feel like an animal
To think and to forget suddenly
Iâd like to be a swan
Into million pieces
To decompose my mind

Take me down
Yes, I wish it so much
May I never see and â¦
May I never hear
The decay of my mind
Take me down
Maybe I needed
To forget how itâs to fall

Open your hands
And collect this filth
Cool me down
With your warm kiss
Let me feel
The joy of fear
Let me to walk with my eyes
Covered with a scarf
Because everything is strong
Because the time walks against me

I canât flee, I got no energy
Day by day Iâm falling down
Heal me
With a shot into my heart
Undress me
And maybe you will understand
Iâm sick
