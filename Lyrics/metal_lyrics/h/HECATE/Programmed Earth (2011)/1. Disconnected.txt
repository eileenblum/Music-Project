Seems like Iâm at home
Seems like Iâm disconnected
Give me a call
And you will get an answer
Call me
And I will be unreachable
The exchange in my head
Reciever out of control
Networking, computing
I play between devices
Itâs a process of transmission
My body on the dancefloor

My body out of control
Signal zero, foreign home
I hear that sound around

It seems like Iâm disconnected
Thrown out among the walls
Where are you?
Iâm trying to call
I was just late, Iâve realised
Iâm broken it was so tight
Send me a sign
Iâm here and ready for your wills
Move me to the light

I will call a friend
We will go to a TV party
Yeah, it will be a show
So, like in the old times
Room No. 69/ connection aborted
Signal to noise ratio/ level zero/ foreign home

So finally I have came
Seems like itâs too late
Our common music
Itâs not common for us anymore
Send me a sign
I want to be on the network
Send me a sign
That I donât belong to you anymore
