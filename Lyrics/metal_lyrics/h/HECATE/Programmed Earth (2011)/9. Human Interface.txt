Hollow now
Remain on the chair and see
Turn on now and connect

Iâm here and the ether above me
Undress yourself
And come naked to me
Clear the white noise
Set your voice
Itâs a real show
Just ones and zeros
More force, more light
I say to you
Expand your mind

As gravity of a black hole
As a human sanity
I found the virtual control
What is your new theory?
Synchronize me!
Connect!
Youâre so free

Restore my brain
Through the device code
Completely without human words
Alone within four walls
Information hasnât failed
But wonât fail anymore

As gravity of a black hole
As a human sanity
I found the virtual control
What is your new theory?
Synchronize me!
I havenât told you something
Iâm free but at the same time bound
Only for my irresolution
You may ask me
Iâll be there / Iâm here for you
You may remove me
Only for our dead friend
