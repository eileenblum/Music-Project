A small time interval
And youâre back with me
If you eat me alive like this
Why donât you damn me forever?
Psychedelic mist in me
It supported your aims
Do you think youâre smart?
While youâre just breaking me?

Itâs hard to replace
What you have once missed
It was like a hard fall
In a moment
It was like a thunderbolt
Do you seem youâre smart?
While youâre breaking me?
Possessed by something sick
Then I realize all those
Destructive consequences

Psychedelic mist in my mind
Gives you power
Your ego is growing
Lead me to the sun
And Iâll shape its rays
I want to see all these feelings shining over there

Itâs new space
New kind of energy

Iâm trying to be immune
But you still hold me to the ground

With the falling
Itâs worth something to sacrifice
Psychedelic mist in my mind
Oh, Catch me and let me leave
Without senses
Itâs worth something to sacrifice
So abuse me
This sigh is dead
Make me sad
Well, why not
Youâre in the charge
There is a time
To make a thick line behind me
Psychedelic mist in my mind
Oh, Please forget about me
Youâve destroyed all that remained to me
Vain you search
You are not more  
(Youâve destroyed the last thing that had remained to me)
