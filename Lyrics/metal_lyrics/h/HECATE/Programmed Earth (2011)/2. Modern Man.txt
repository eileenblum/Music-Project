My son, IÂ´ve made you up
Look at me!
I am the modern man
IÂ´ve thrown away my past
What are those years already passed?
IÂ´ve created my son
IÂ´ve designed a program
And it works according to me
Can you see?

After hard work I go for a drink
On a bright day along the street
By the dark night into virtuality
Of first class quality
I will build you
Custom-made cloned child
But costly you will pay me
For the future technics
I am the modern man
Can you see?

I have created a body
I have created a brain
Your daddy has changed the tomorrow
I am the modern man
Make-up on my face
A silver computer
Filesystems full of brainscan
Yes, I have programmed my son
I am the modern man

Follow me, donât feel the pain
I love your electric brain

Start the operation
And use my instructions
The data transfer will begin
The password is: _God_

I am the humanoid, I can control it
I believe in the synthetic memory

I have created a body (I built a silver face)
You will be more perfect than me (Just as youâve taught me)
The operation is completed (Listen to my synthetic voice)
I am the humanoid
