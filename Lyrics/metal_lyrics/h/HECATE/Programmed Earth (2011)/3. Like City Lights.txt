I donÂ´t wish to stay at the same point again
As yesterday, maybe onceâ¦
Our path through the forest has overgrown
And something still reminds you of me
As I donÂ´t forget it

We find ourselves in an empty circle
Inside of an obscure feelings
I stand here with you
Face to face each other
I am not too far
Just on the otherside
My flabby arms
Iâm unable to embrace you
My flabby legs
Iâm unable to run

I look at you through the glass wall
Sometimes itâs better to be blind
Just one fragile touch of a doubtful mind
And sometimes itâs better not to feel
I donât feel

Help me, give me your hand
Take me out of this circle
Because today
I donÂ´t understand anything yet
Echoes of my own mind
I paint on the glass

Without heart, my hope
Maybe IÂ´ll start to live more
Give me one more sign
And letâs find begin and end
Only cold wind makes me shiver
But no other way is here
Oh, I feel the emptiness around us
I paint a bit of you on the glass

I look at you through the glass wall
Sometimes itâs better to be blind
Just one fragile touch of a doubtful mind
And sometimes itâs better not to feel

The spirit of light blinds my eyes
Sometimes it is better to be blind
The spirit of love is dying
And sometimes it is better not to feel
