Itâs long time
Itâs long way to the future
The oceans are boiling
The atomic accelerator in the underground
Evolution!
We have to leave the earth
Before the human perdition

The future are cold cities of glass
Faster neuron networks
We will build up a synthetic planet
By the day and by the night
It reflects the lights of the stars
Live their technological lives

Universe is the other way
There will get a light ray
There is a time to move
Far away from the sun
50 light years away

Radio from distant galaxy
Flood from a magnetosphere
Not from this world
The sun will swallow it
Far away from the earthâs orbit
To extraterrestrial home

Universe is the other way
Where will get life again
There will get a light ray
There is a time to move
Far away from the sun
50 light years away
