Please bow your head down
And drown these dreams with you
In the veil of dark sad evening
Gloomy face of your flowers
When rain was stroking your hair
It left the feeling inside of me
How to be oppressed by sorrow

So I`m turning to the window
Where moves me the dusk
There somewhere
I`m on the edge

When I`m listening to voices
Which are whispering your name
When I see that deep abyss
Through which I penetrate to you
These are my illusions
These are my emotions
These are my wounds
It`s just me
Oppressed by sorrow

I`m standing in front of you
And I am losing balance slowly
I`m silent
Falling into despair
I`m somewhere on the edge
I`m oppressed by sorrow

Why don`t you diffuse in the mist
In which I`m surrounded
Trip up my legs
And I will escape your embrace

Why do you follow my steps
So kill me at last
Because I`m not able to be
Oppressed by you
