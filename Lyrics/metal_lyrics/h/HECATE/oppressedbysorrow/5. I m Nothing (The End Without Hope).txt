When i picked up myself from the ground
Everything seemed to be alright
But my inner vibrations
Didn't move my body
Feelings perfectly hidden within myself
I came and lost my way
I didn't want to get here
1 can't to escape from the emptiness
To escape from myself
And now show the truth

I feel so helpless and alone
That 1 accuse myself, where is the fault
But the fault is my own
And so i constantly
Became only a victim

I want to find
What i haven't found for so long
I want to find it for me
And maybe i will understand
What i hooked for so long

Quietly i roam among walls
Of my own labyrinth
I can't escape
I feel so helpless and alone

I want to find
What i haven't found for so long
I want to find it for me
And maybe i will understand
What i looked for so long for all the years

Maybe i'm narrow-minded and going down
Cause this is not the way
That i express myself
To prove something
To lie to myself straight into the eyes
And to fear of everything that i do
And be not sure, if it's right
It paralyzes my faith
It leaves hone to try again
And therefore...
Already i don't believe in me
