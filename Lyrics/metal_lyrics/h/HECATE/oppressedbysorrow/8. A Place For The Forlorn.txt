The sea is a waste
Cause all went away
It remained alone as a palm
I saw only castaway
Who came from the waste land

Ever led to ruin
Help?
No, there is no help!

All went where another being was
Being which was better
They all forlorn began
And that was good matter...

The sea is a waste
Cause all went away
It remained alone as a palm
I saw only castaway
Who came from the waste land

Ever led to ruin
Help?
No, there is no help!

They all came to Paradise
