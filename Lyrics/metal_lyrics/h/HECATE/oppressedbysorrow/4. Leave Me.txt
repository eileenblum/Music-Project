She was the cold wind in my heart
She was the empty well of my tears
I want to forget on the warmth of her hands
I want to forget on that moment in my dream
So lost, so waste
My eyes

You gave to me
What you weren`t able to receive
You gave me merciless pain
With tears in your eyes you see
What I meant to you
You gave to me
What you weren`t able to receive
You broke my hope and you`re waiting
So you will see, my time has come
Please, leave me

I feel the weak touch of her breath
I feel her last embrace
Leave me tonight

Afraid I still feel
After all these years I couldn`t forgive
And I don`t want to be
The victim of your psychical storm
Your desire weeps for me
Look into the mirror
You will see you`re dying

You gave to me
What you weren`t able to receive
You gave me merciless painWith tears in your eyes you see
What I meant to you
You gave to me
What you weren`t able to receive
You broke my hope and you`re waiting
So understand, my time is coming
Tonight...
Leave me
