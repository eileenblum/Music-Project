On the watermirror I am watching your last flight
On the watermirror I see dim contours of your face
You percieve touchs of burning sky
How pain of not guessing innocence

In every awaking I`m followed by your shadows
In every thought I feel sorrow
Even if you are so close to my heart
You are so far away ...
Forever

Oh, your times were fragile
Look at your mysterious places
So reveal the face of your future
And I`ll promise, that I`ll wait for you

You turn back to the place
Where I cry
I don`t know why, I can`t touch you
There`s no way back to my desires
In pain I see just a view on heaven
It`s the last flash of your wings

In every awaking I`m followed by your shadows
In every thought I feel sorrow
Even if you are so close to my heart
You are so far away ...
Forever

You`re like clouds dissapearing in the water
In the water, above I`ll wait for you
