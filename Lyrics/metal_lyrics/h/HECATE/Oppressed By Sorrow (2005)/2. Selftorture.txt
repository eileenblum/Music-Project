You are silent 
And your hands are bleeding 
Imprisoned in your secret pain 
You don`t fear, when you look to your inside 
You don`t fear, it can be seen in your eyes 
Your body is covered 
With a fresh scars, 
But your hands are bleeding 
Under the hot memories 
You will fear, when you look to your inside 
You will fear, it can be seen in your eyes 

You`re lying in the corner of the darkroom 
You`re lying on thorns of your doom 
You pretend to regret the scream of agony 
You`re lying on thorns of your destiny 

You crippled your soul and you crippled your flesh 
There is your cruel past, you hate the present 
You are falling on the floor with your face down 
And fragments of glass fade in your hands 
Tears are washing hot blood from below your satisfaction 
Under the eternal masquerade with silent reverence 
You torture yourself 

You hide all the suffering in yourself 
Release your waste paradise 
So forever lost in space 
You feel fear, when you look to your inside 
You feel fear, it can be seen in your eyes 

Your wounds are eternal, you are silent still 
Your wounds are eternal, don`t search way out 
Your wounds are eternal forever
