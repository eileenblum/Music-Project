She was the cold wind in my heart 
She was the empty well of my tears 
I want to forget on the warmth of her hands 
I want to forget on that moment in my dream 
So lost, so waste 
My eyes 

You gave to me 
What you weren`t able to receive 
You gave me merciless pain 
With tears in your eyes you see 
What I meant to you 
You gave to me 
What you weren`t able to receive 
You broke my hope and you`re waiting 
So you will see, my time has come 
Please, leave me 

I feel the weak touch of her breath 
I feel her last embrace 
Leave me tonight 

Afraid I still feel 
After all these years I couldn`t forgive 
And I don`t want to be 
The victim of your psychical storm 
Your desire weeps for me 
Look into the mirror 
You will see you`re dying 

You gave to me 
What you weren`t able to receive 
You gave me merciless painWith tears in your eyes you see 
What I meant to you 
You gave to me 
What you weren`t able to receive 
You broke my hope and you`re waiting 
So understand, my time is coming 
Tonight... 
Leave me
