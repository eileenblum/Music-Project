On the watermirror I am watching your last flight 
On the watermirror I see dim contours of your face 
You percieve touchs of burning sky 
How pain of not guessing innocence 

In every awaking I`m followed by your shadows 
In every thought I feel sorrow 
Even if you are so close to my heart 
You are so far away ... 
Forever 

Oh, your times were fragile 
Look at your mysterious places 
So reveal the face of your future 
And I`ll promise, that I`ll wait for you 

You turn back to the place 
Where I cry 
I don`t know why, I can`t touch you 
There`s no way back to my desires 
In pain I see just a view on heaven 
It`s the last flash of your wings 

In every awaking I`m followed by your shadows 
In every thought I feel sorrow 
Even if you are so close to my heart 
You are so far away ... 
Forever 

You`re like clouds dissapearing in the water 
In the water, above I`ll wait for you
