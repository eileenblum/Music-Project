Please bow your head down 
And drown these dreams with you 
In the veil of dark sad evening 
Gloomy face of your flowers 
When rain was stroking your hair 
It left the feeling inside of me 
How to be oppressed by sorrow 

So I`m turning to the window 
Where moves me the dusk 
There somewhere 
I`m on the edge 

When I`m listening to voices 
Which are whispering your name 
When I see that deep abyss 
Through which I penetrate to you 
These are my illusions 
These are my emotions 
These are my wounds 
It`s just me 
Oppressed by sorrow 

I`m standing in front of you 
And I am losing balance slowly 
I`m silent 
Falling into despair 
I`m somewhere on the edge 
I`m oppressed by sorrow 

Why don`t you diffuse in the mist 
In which I`m surrounded 
Trip up my legs 
And I will escape your embrace 

Why do you follow my steps 
So kill me at last 
Because I`m not able to be 
Oppressed by you
