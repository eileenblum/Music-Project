The sea is a waste 
Cause all went away 
It remained alone as a palm 
I saw only castaway 
Who came from the waste land 

Ever led to ruin 
Help? 
No, there is no help! 

All went where another being was 
Being which was better 
They all forlorn began 
And that was good matter... 

The sea is a waste 
Cause all went away 
It remained alone as a palm 
I saw only castaway 
Who came from the waste land 

Ever led to ruin 
Help? 
No, there is no help! 

They all came to Paradise
