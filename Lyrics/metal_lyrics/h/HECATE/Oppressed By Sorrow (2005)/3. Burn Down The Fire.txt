Only awake... 
Another break in the river of time 
My snake`s tongue 
Added to smouldering fire 
Fire of hate 
Destroys the bond so strong 
I find myself again on the edge 
Asking why 
Mother, answer me it`s my snake`s mouth 

It could be all different now 
But the time walks forward 
Just such a little impulse 
A little part of me 

To rectify it all 
Will be hopeless 
Neither just a little spark of hope 

Asking why 
My snake`s tongue imposed 
The loss of trust 
Remorses oppress me 
I tempted unstable soul 
I tempted the evil 

Dreadful theatre 
Tears in my eyes 
The little spark went out 
Oh mother 
Why just me 
It`s my snake`s tongue 
It`s out of control 
Therefore I`m suffering now 
I pray for forgiveness 
Give me one more chance 
My snake`s tongue 
Will be damned
