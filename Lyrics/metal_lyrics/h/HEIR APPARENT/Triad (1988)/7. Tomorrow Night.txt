I look into your eyes as you look into mine
I see you smile and look away
I sense a passion burning deep within your heart
Can this be real? I look away

And then I wander through the maze of my emotions
Looking for the answer to the question in my mind

Another dream has come and gone
I watch it fade away

And now I wander through the maze of my emotions
Looking for the answer and waiting for a sign

Tell me now - you lead, I'll follow
Will I be with you tomorrow night?

I look into your eyes as you look into mine
I see you smile and turn away

And now I tremble in the midst of my emotions
You are the question and the answer to my dreams

Tell me now - you lead, I'll follow
Will I be with you tomorrow night?
Tell me now - you lead, I'll follow
Will I be with you tomorrow?
Will I be with you tomorrow night?

I look into your eyes as you look into mine
I see you smile and come my way

Tell me now - you lead, I'll follow
Will I be with you tomorrow?
Tell me now --- you lead, I'll follow
Will I be with you tomorrow?
Will I be with you tomorrow night?

I see you smile:
