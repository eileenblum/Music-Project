Show me a tear, and I'll know you're a dreamer
Caesar's, one and all we cry for Rome
Tears like empires falling to the ground
Yet we're shackled to those dreams
We're tied and we're bound
So show me a tear and I'll know you're a dreamer
Caesar's, one and all we cry for Rome
:Caesar's, one and all we cry for Rome:

Show me a tear, and I'll tell you a tale of glory
Caesar's, one and all we cry for Rome
Show me your fear and I'll sell you a timeless story
Caesar's, one and all we cry for Rome

Nero's song of mourning weeps
As pillars fall like rain
Only shattered hopes and dust remain

Show me a tear and I'll know you're a dreamer
Caesar's, one and all we cry for Rome
Show me your fear and I'll know that you're a seer
Caesar's, one and all we cry for Rome

Tears like empires falling down
See them on the ground
Yet, we're shackled to them
We are bound

Show, come on and show
Show:    show:.
Are there any dreamers?
Are there any dreamers?
Show me a tear and I'll know you're a seer

Nero's song of mourning weeps
As pillars fall like rain
Only shattered hopes and dust remain:
