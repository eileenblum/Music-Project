I'm waiting for morning, but night lingers on
When will the darkness give way to the dawn?
Is there an end?

Cast in a shadow so lonely and cold
Wondering whether I'll live to grow old
A question of "why?"

The quest for survival is second to none
Can we unite before our end has come?
Open your eyes!

Cast in a shadow so lonely and cold
Wondering whether we'll live to grow old
A question of time

And what do we have down this road that we're on?
A world of hatred, pollution, and pawns
Futility pounds in my brain!

And what of the people who dream they'll be saved?
Are they immune from the fallout and flames?
If we're responsible - who do we blame?
