We, the people
Face the challenge of our lives
Apparent heirs of this domain
The time is short for us
To set a new priority
Or we will surely pay the price - of the world
- Your world
- My world
- Our world

In the name of progress
We take more than we need
Respect for life exchanged 
For corporate greed
Chemical waste destroys
Our land and sea
With no regard for the future
Of our world

We, the people
Face the challenge of our lives
Apparent heirs of this domain
We, the people shape our destiny
And the time is now to take care - of the world
- Your world
- My world
- Our world

We must unite -to survive!
