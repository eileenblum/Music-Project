Here I am in a spotlight
Alone:  all over again
And you are home by the firelight
With someone else, instead of me:

The words seemed so real
And baby that's why I feel
Alone again
I swore you were my friend
Now I'm all alone
All alone again

The rhymes I could make
If me heart wasn't breaking
In two: over you
Oh I'm the fool
For believing in things
I can't hold in my hands
I don't understand

The words seemed so real
And baby that's why I feel
Alone again
I swore you were my friend
I'm all alone
All alone again
