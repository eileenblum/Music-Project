I looked unto the Old One, in the Sacred Halls
I found him there amidst his grief, and crumbling walls
The tears that lined his face 
Told the tale he tried to hide
Of castles made of sand, and of the tide

A whisper through his sobs
I heard him softly say
"My kingdom for a wise man: yesterday"
"No one can save us, no one can stop the end"
Not all the king's horses, or all your amen's:

There's no disarming, no forewarning
Morning is over - forever burns the night
Time's forever fused with the night
The passions of men -in a flash
Put an end to the light

No one can save us now
Nothing can stop the end
Not all the king's horses, or all your amen's

No disarming, no forewarning
Morning is over- forever burns the night
Time's forever fused with the night
The passions of men -in a flash
Put an end to the light

Shadows seething - darkness fills the sky
Ashes wreathing - fire burning on high
Suffocation - the light all gone away
In the end - no final words to say
