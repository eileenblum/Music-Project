...And the poor shall kneel down at their Master's feet
And dedicate themselves to please...

Raging rivers run for the lucky one
For the Keeper of the Grail
And the lower men, subjects of the King
On their hands and knees remain

Raging rivers run for the honored one
For the Keeper of the Key
And the lower men, servants of the King
Live to suit their Master's greed

The Keeper of the Reign
The Keeper of the Reign
Feels no pain...

Raging rivers run for the Royal One
For the Keeper of the Crown
And the lower men soldiers of the King
To whom their lives revolve around

The Keeper of the Reign
The Keeper of the Reign
Feels no pain...

Raging river run with the blood of mad men
Battle is the Keeper's game
For the Lucky One, to him no harm comes
The Keeper never feels their pain   - No Pain!
