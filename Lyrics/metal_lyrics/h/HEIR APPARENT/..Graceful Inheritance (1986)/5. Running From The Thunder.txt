I hear it in the distance
I can feel it in the wind
Somehow, some way
Will it return again?

I see a change taking over
A taste of things to come
Somehow, some way
Am I the only one?

- Running from the thunder
- Reaching for the sun

I've heard it in the distance
I've felt it in the wind
Sometime, some day
Will it return again?

I've seen the changes around me
The threat of things to come
Sometime, some day
Am I the only one?

- Running from the thunder
- Reaching for the sun   -Lookout!

Running from the thunder
Reaching for the sun...
