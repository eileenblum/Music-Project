They dwell in a palace of ivory and gold
In beauty and comfort, a fortune untolled
Yet, out in the courtyard injustice prevails
They've turned their backs on what Lordship entails

They squander their riches on oceans of wine
The masses are starving while ministers dine
The Bringers of Sorrow, the Masters of Pain
Rise up in anger, let sweet vengeance reign!

Tear down the walls  - tear down the walls

A code of corruption, a throne of despair
A common affliction the townspeople share
Depriving the hungry and robbing the poor
Slaves to a system they loathe and deplore

A bounty of torment, abuse of command
The wicked are crippling this misgoverned land
The innocent perish, the cruel remain
Take up your sabres, let sweet vengeance reign!

Tear down the walls - tear down the walls
Tear down the walls - tear 'em down!

The peasants are storming this palace of gold
By evil repressors, no longer controlled
The banner of justice unfurled overhead
The victors rejoicing, the conquered lie dead

Yet few of them know what the future will bring
Another unjust and unmerciful King
The nature of Monarchs is always the same
Soon time will come to let sweet vengeance reign!

Tear down the walls...
