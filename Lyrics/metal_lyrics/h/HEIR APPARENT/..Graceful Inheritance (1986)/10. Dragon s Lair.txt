Looking through the windows to your mind
Can't you see that there isn't much more to find?
As you take the crystal deep within
Waiting for the magic to begin

And are the broken mirrors of your soul
Dying for a lesson to be told?
And will you ever find an answer there?
Daring to approach the Dragon's Lair

And the dragon beckons you nearer
And you think you're so damn strong you've got no fear
Are you a victim - a blind man - a fool?
Living in illusions, you can only lose

Shooting deadly arrows in your heart
Bleeding from the moment that you start
A rush that never seems to satisfy
Tempting you once more before you die

And are the broken mirrors of your soul
Dying for a lesson to be told?
And will you ever find an answer there?
Daring to approach the Dragon's Lair

Dragon's Lair
Are you there?
Do you care?
...Illusions
