Face the facts of Life On Earth
The nature of Mankind
Pages from our past are now defined
Humanity has common sense
We all know right from wrong
We've lived in False Pretense too long!

RISE!!    RISE!!
Face the facts of Present Day
RISE!!   RISE!!
Rid yourself of ancient ways

Fear of gods and demons is the folly of your mind
Acknowledge facts of Science -don't be blind
The war of Good and Evil is what you create within
The Facts of Life are where the truth begins

RISE!!    RISE!!   RISE!!

Prepare for your future -don't live within the past
The ancient cultures never knew the facts
Technology has given truth where myth had been before
It's time Humanity stepped through the door

RISE!!   RISE!!

RISE!!   RISE!!
Rid yourself of ancient ways...

RISE!!   RISE!!   RISE!!
