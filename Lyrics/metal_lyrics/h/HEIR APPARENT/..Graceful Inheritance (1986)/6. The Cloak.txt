The black night is the cloak I wear
I'm a nightmare borne on wings
A dark image of boundless fear
On the street I'm King of Kings

A pale specter of shattered hopes
I'm a symphony of lies
A vague shadow, a nameless pair of eyes...

A stained picture of broken dreams
I'm a twisted demons' rage
a cold whisper, a silent scream
I'm a panther left uncaged

The dim glow of the haunting moon
I'm your deepest fears unveiled
The wind mocking your every step
I'm a dagger cast in steel

The black night is the cloak I wear
I'm a serpent's icy gaze
A grim chorus, a siren's suite
I'm the misty twilight haze

The chill stabbing the midnight air
I'm a frenzied banshee cry
A blind evil, a mindless beast
I'm the fate you can't defy
