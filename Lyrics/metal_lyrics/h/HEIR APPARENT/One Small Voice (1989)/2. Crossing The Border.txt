Barbed wire and barriers are holding me
Though the barricades are only in my mind
I can't seem to break through the walls
Even though I am made of steel
Like steel to a fire I weaken and bend in the wind
Create the desire for crossing the wire
I'm laying it all on the line

Crossing the border
Leaving the sadness far behind

Surrounded by anger and fear
I'm the eye of the hurricane
Like a leaf on a tree in the wind
I yearn to break free

Create the desire for crossing the wire
I'm laying it all on the line

Crossing the border
Leaving the sadness far behind
I'm crossing the border
Fleeing the echoes of my mind
