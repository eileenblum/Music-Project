Memory- go away
I grow weary from my running
Hiding for so long
I've lost my way

Morning light's reminders
Painting colors in my prison
Daylight brightens every shade of grey
The pain never ending, and now its so cliche

Yesterdays are creaking doors
And noises in the nighttime
Feelings, only chains across the floor
Voices on the wind, softly moan
I hear them whisper
Mirrors mock the man I was before

My mind slowly fading
Like paper in the rain

The haunting, it still remains
The haunting, it still remains

Turning and burning in my bed
A never-ending ghost
That lives inside my head

Memory- go away
I grow weary from my running
Hiding for so long
I've lost my way

Yesterdays are creaking doors
And noises in the nighttime
Feelings, only chains across the floor
My mind keeps decaying
Like paper in the rain

The haunting, it still remains
The haunting, it still remains

Turning and burning in my bed
A never-ending ghost
That lives inside my head

Memories remain of the haunting
Can't stop the pain of the haunting:
