Watching the setting sun
You feel the days gone by
Autumn is ending- with winter impending
Was summer just a lie?

But just like the seasons
You know you spring will come

You're young forever                  
Just like the setting sun
You'll rise again
You're young forever
Taking on time in a race
That you can't win

Down but not out it's clear you're wise
Beyond your years
Time is a ship that keeps on sailing
Despite our hailing tears
But just like the ship
The wind will fill your sails

You're young forever
Just like the setting sun
You'll rise again
