All the pieces seemed to fit today
The sky blue matched the city grey
The roads all led to somewhere
The words I heard were true
Everything seemed to fit but me and you

All the pieces seemed to fit today
Laughter came from children's play
Something came from nothing
One and one made two
Everything seemed to fit but me and you

We are two lost pieces to the puzzle
We are two forgotten words that used to rhyme
We will never fit together
We are two hearts beating out of time:
