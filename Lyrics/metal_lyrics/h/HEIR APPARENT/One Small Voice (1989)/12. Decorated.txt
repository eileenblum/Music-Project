Hero, Warrior
Sit behind the lines and make the call
Leader, Believer
A vestal three-piece high above it all

But until you've walked the miles
With the people that you lead
You can't understand their pain
When the common people bleed

Fuhrer, Big Brother
Victimize the weak and make us strong
Teacher, Savior
Sanctify your answers, right or wrong

But until you've walked the miles
With the people that you lead
You can't understand their pain
When the common people bleed

--You should be decorated
  Adorned by scarlet bars
  A celebrated General
  To brandish blackened stars

--You should be decorated
  Your ribbons frayed and torn
  Upon your paper pedestal
  For the children to adorn

--You should be decorated

Leader, Believer
Victimize the weak and make us strong
Teacher, Savior
Sanctify your answers, right or wrong

But until you've walked the miles
With the people that you lead
You can't understand their pain
When the common people bleed

--You should be decorated
