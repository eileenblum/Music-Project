One small voice had a dream
Now he's seen the other side
One small heart ached for his people
His children, and his pride

Just one man
With one hope for the world
Just one man
And one small voice was heard

One small voice had a cause
So he lived in a cage
One small love that endured
Through his pain and his rage

Just one man
With one hope for the world
Just one man
And one small voice that was heard

One small voice
Just one small voice
