When the light starts to dim in the evening
When the day starts to fade
Your body echoes an uneasy feeling
You know you're feeling afraid

You don't know where you're going
Or where you've been
You try to run- but it's too late
You've stumbled in 

-Now you're 
Screaming, 'cause you're afraid of the dark
Screaming toward the light
Screaming, 'cause there's a fear in your heart
Screaming into the night

On your face I can see that you're worried
On your face I see fear
Is this the time that you said you'd run lady?
From your darkest fears

You don't know where you're going
Or where you've been
You try to run- but it's too late
You've stumbled in

-Now you're
Screaming, 'cause you're afraid of the dark
Screaming toward the light
Screaming, 'cause there's a fear in your heart
Screaming into the night

It's too late to run now
I'm right behind
You're over now- I see you
Screaming into the night
