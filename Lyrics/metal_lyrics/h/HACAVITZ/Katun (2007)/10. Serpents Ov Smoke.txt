In the land of my ancient ones
They born from fire
With the fragance of the death
Dwelling in the land
Rising with might
They come from fire
The reverence rise

Rise high
Serpent gods
rise high
White smoke

Bringing magic rites
We awake the smoke
We summon the snake
Through burning flames

Rise high
Serpent gods
Rise high
White smoke

Making sublime
The welcome of the gods

They said they speak
They said they praise
They said they health
Serpents ov smoke

They born from fire
And rises with might

They said the live
They said they protect
They said the clean

They said they speak
They said they praise
They said they health

Serpents ov smoke
