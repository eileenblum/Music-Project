Anguish brings this night through the light
Magick unknown of esoterian might

Through the spells of the black
I cast upon
This heaving earth
Of ablazing misery

As this night becomes midnight
Lunacy and dementia transforms in the clouds

This darkened moon grieving in panic and fear
Of this trance of darkcraft spelled
Theres no colour through dark of this night
As this evoking of the black
The unholy one
I preach in opacity
Towards the fear of god
Of this useless fools
As humans conceived

through the mundane ecstasy to worship him
Within drugs as this human realm of the absurd
Feast into angst ante anguish to this work
Of the night to self destruct and beyond

The living spells
That towards the night and far beyond deceives
And fortuites in darkness untold
Magic so dark as night
Between witchcraft
Works of doom on earth ablaze

The castings at the alchimia of the none
Brings wisdom of untranquil anxiety
To shape the vistas of cosmos and within

Through the most absurd
And obscure darkness

The gleams of the most darknight moon
Brights magically
Between shadows

Forlorn now forever the evil in the night
Its spreaded in this nightcraft form
Vermin the air in plagues from unknown
Pest those flesh in earth never known

Anguish of despair within the trance of the night
Fevered into this malpractices of the earth
Angered gardens of darkness unveils
This unfathomed obscure opening of the gates
