Life of darkness i had chosen
For honour to sin so absurd
Bliss of the undead
Embracing repugnance of the obscure

Inhaling and self destroying
For principles profound on this earth
Self humiliating so lustful we wait
The death of the night 

Smoke of wisdom
We shall breathe for the night

Prepared to walk
The path horrendous of the earth

We shall become one in sorrow
As life its meaning of none 
So time will happen in darkness
Within ages of anxiety to meet again

Night so black is the night
I had bright as nightlight of the moon
So i learn the secrets of luna
Those taught to cleanse this fate
Progeniture of this darkened medium
Virtue in magnificent wisdom

So black is the death of this sense
Of mortal heresy
And misery pageantry

Triumphant on death and beyond 
And in clouds of smoke you ride
Feasting in loss to transmigrate
The afterlife you brought in pestilence

Thus confine to nothing
As nothing we had become
As night so dark and black
We near in anger, no longer trust

O precious power of the dark
Let the day be the night
