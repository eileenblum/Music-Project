[performed by Hacavitz]Do it tonite, raptors ov light
Reach in the night, the frenzy ov thee unholy one
Raven crawling haze
Ov blackened rapting maze
Pestilent revealed face,
Ov fate and doom to this earth

For eternal dark,
In this possessed
Internal disaster
ThieAves ov unlight, Deceit?

Reckoning irae, Tyrant so grand
Invade, and erase life. Into reality and here
From beyond and forth into thee

Darkness,
Chaos,
Evil,
Hate,
Death
Beyond the realms ov life

Awake,
Spirits in the deep
Reside fornever unto me

Altar ov death,
Deceiver ov life
Forward to steal
The holy light

STEAL THE LIGHT

[Verse 1 &amp; 2 repeats]

Darkness, chaos and evil
Hate, Death and despair
Steal the fucking light
