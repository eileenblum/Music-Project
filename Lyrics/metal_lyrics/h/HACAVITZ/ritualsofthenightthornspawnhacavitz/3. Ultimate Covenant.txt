[performed by Hacavitz]Lords ov the universe 
Dwelling into obscurity 
One voice 
One aeon 

Those witness ov ruin 
Those bringers ov vengeance 

One eye 
One vision 
Under your name 
Sacrificed be the past 
Souless 
Senseless 

Gods ov the universe 
Standing in silence 
Destiny lies 
On your hands 

Shall this wrath dissapear 
Or in honour ascend 

One at the execution ritual 
Cut the disease 
A last covenant in life 

Blessed be your mighty 
Take this birth of chaos 
And take it to your reign 
Last covenant in life 

Ultimate covenant 
For honour and glory ov the death 

May you put 
Through the right path 
Take this ultimate covenant 
Our birth and death 
Are yours
