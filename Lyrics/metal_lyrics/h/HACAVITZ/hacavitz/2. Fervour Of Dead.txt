Enchant my will
euphoric haze of the disease
cult to the dead fulfill
my fake sacrosanct essence
I deny my present
This tongue and reality that flesh made
Past burden me as reality
Encrypts this bastard fascinate
Death calls me
As my ears fathom deep
Incessant fervour of the dead
Trialed in sin
And moral bounds
Dogmas and test of the false
Break into fallen despair
My days will come, to wither this lie
Through fire, blood and heart
Since our roots will never be apart
Enshrouded origin of mortality
Embrace my sight so fever
Vice my spirit
Through this impurity
My heart never pounded so hatred
Feverish, impending cult of the undead
Yearning for this absurd fall
Consagrating the lands so obscure
Lands of eternal night
May the mictlan rise!
