Heart in hand, and hand in grief
stoicism frenzy for burning
pride, obscurity drowns it so deep 
darkened bestiality shall rise
writhe the heralds of nothing 
immense tyranny haze on within
abrupt the flesh of fools 
inscript my name through them 
im made from nowhere
and decreed for nothing 
ungraced be those who against it 
fornever shall no rest 
abyssous hate
never ending, unstoppable
extreme burning antagonism
trough this very flesh so dirt
enlight me lords
of the undead
lords of nothing
maze of endless pestilence
fall so deep
burdened in sin
I pray every time into this flesh
For you
To never be again 
Pride
Made for elite
Nocturnal sounds enrich us
So unite in bold and iron hate
Enthrust this treacherous revenge
Ordained for anger and lust 
Created for this impure curse
Branded through this very flesh 
For vengeance i 
Had born
Ashamed and dishonoured
Through this false flesh and tongue
Awake in tyrannous anger
My name and my roots 
Shall brand your fate
BORN FOR VENGEANCE!!
Verse I repeats 
For vengeance I had born
