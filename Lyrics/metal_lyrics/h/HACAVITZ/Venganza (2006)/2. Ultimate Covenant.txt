Lords ov the universe
Dwelling into obscurity
One voice
One aeon

Those witness ov ruin
Those bringers ov vengeance

One eye
One vision
Under your name
Sacrificed be the past
Souless
Senseless

Gods ov the universe
Standing in silence
Destiny lies
On your hands

Shall this wrath dissapear
Or in honour ascend

One at the execution ritual
Cut the disease
A last covenant in life

Blessed be your mighty
Take this birth of chaos
And take it to your reign
Last covenant in life

Ultimate covenant
For honour and glory ov the death

May you put
Through the right path
Take this ultimate covenant
Our birth and death
Are yours
