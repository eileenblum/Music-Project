Darkness absolute
For the inherit hate to mankind
I pray for death and beyond
The secrecies of thee
Earth beneath
Of the uncessant needful desire

To terminate life and all that is
Living burns deep within
Raise in deep dark astray
Terminate to the core
Endless perish through
Forsake inner strength

Blackness forward and beyond
In nihil contempt
This earths nihil

One doom!
Forfeit in destiny of men
Forever intoxicate
Dismal arrival to endless dark
The earths nihil reborn
Conceived in nothing
Darkness deep within
Endless darkness absolute
Trying to call them within

Enlighten darken conception
Fevered in tongues never heard
Conceived in nothing
Darkness absolute and beyond

Morbidly the feathers
Of this vicious fever
Hide into voids of voids
Down there where nothing dwells
Begotten earthen rot
To the prayer of death

We had born of loss
None of us had being teached
Of decreed for none
Into death forever
The earths nihil reborn
Conceived in vermin

The earths nihil
Conceived in vermin
Enlighten in putrid rot
Flesh and blood turns into dust

Disease to what we call life
Denial of hope
The virtue of manking
Rest in morbid dark
