Behold Death
Putrid flesh made for rot
Enter to the dephts
Never seen, Darkness Beyond

For darkness and beyond
This strife to end all life
Resides within this very flesh
Through this blood of doom

Excrement of thee earth
And cancer for life
The precise solution to this world
Disease beyond

Blaze into purest Unclean
The fires of most unpure disease
as we wrote through the ages
And named the obscured
With deceit

Captive morbidity
The reason of darkness inherit
forged in order to destroy
The chaos raise and evolve

Necrology for a human conception
Putridity into this spoilt flesh
Incepting the fall of this earth
Terror onwards the flames
Of the dark

Nor god or divine
Into this realm of the Obscure

For darkness and beyond
This life belongs like shit
For mortals and fools to earth
The enlight and pride
For Heretics
