In virtue of sorrow
For mankind, darkness and beyond
Had told the unspoken names
Of the spoilt feast for them
Fornever obscure

So is it for darkness now
The time for us to be
So is it for death now
The exact time for us in disease

For deaf and blinds we speak
The tempter furor of the unknown
Shall they tremble just for fear
Those tears in anguish for perish

Breeding forth in disease
Dismise and despair we sing
Withering all the limits for the word hope
Time for darkness is now
Forever at last

There's no future, there's no return
And forth in deceit of the human kind
Death is now and fornever
The final solution to our time

Time for darkness is now!

Grim lairs into despair
Next step forth in misery
Into mens fate and final doom
I pray for total death

Death to all and forever
Nor light nor hope set in the way
of human can comprehend
The real truth and misery
of death

Death is now for all
And for future to come
No path to life had done
No light had bright more
Into dark

There's no future, there's no return
And forth in deceit of the human kind
Death is now and fornever
The final solution to our time

For now and on, hope is no more
For now and on, life's so futile
Bright for death
And for now on
The grieving end for all

I for myself
And just mine, deny within all of me
As a living being, forth in disease
I pray for total death
