Nex Incipit Vitae
Nex Eclesia Mundi
To outnumber the living
And forth dogmas conceived

We are the last solution
Cast for death and beyond
Por siempre seremos
La solucion final

Earth's decay
Humans conceived as humans

Fools for a fatal error ocurred
We are doomed to perish
Obscure infinity at last

None shall survive
Doomed as vilest cancer
Future is at hand for a few

Misantropia Logia Mundi
No truth is prepared for what is life

Gathered the vices in this world
Virtue as the vilest of the cancers

Vermin life into despair
Future into
Life fornever

We are heresy
For the earth
The solution for it becoming
Wrath for tyrants
And demise to all

Darkness absolute and beyond
For obscurity perpetual
For the enduring death
Feeling in this flesh
Rottening every day
