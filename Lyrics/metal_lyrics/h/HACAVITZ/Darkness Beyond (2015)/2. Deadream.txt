Angst forth to the mourning symbols
Prey of the underworld and demise
within the realms of subconcious
Death and despair, shall rise!

Along the dimensions of unconcious
Between the life of the deads

Forfeit and fortuite
The Umbrae
Dreams of the death and beyond

Barren voices from deep below
Underworld pressence within

Death to all
And for all
Living moribund to the core
Darkness sublime and absolute
Absolute!

Fullfill this tremble for disease
Lord of dreams cast in far north

Perish at the dawn
Of the mourning signs
Envisioned perception loss
Neverending trip
To the deep within
Comes to truth and beyond

Captive truth
Against all truth
Feasting reality
Unset me free
Once there darkness
Time before all time
To each one
For all and beyond

Even death must die
Into the dreamed sleep of the death
Subterranean might

A place that is conceived
In the deep
A conception in loss for fools
Darkness eternal
All what is beyond forth beyond

All that is earthly
All that human forgot
Even dead may dream
Through ages in living
Perpetuum
