[Point Of No Return cover]

Endliess nights of persecution. Reopening wounds - never healed. Always 
willing to suppress our attempts to be free. Violence is always a tool in so 
called democraty. Agents of the state allowed to spread terror, seeking to 
eliminate sparks of political resistance. Endless nights of violation. 
Breeding fear - anguished cries. A blood oath to never surrender. Committed 
to the struggle. Until all fences are burned. You'll try the taste of pain 
we endure every day. To quit without resisting would be to live in vain. 
Attentive eyes guard the tents in the twilight. Women and men ready to 
counterattack. Full moon shines... The enemy crawls in the dead of night. No 
way back... The masked cops take their final step. You're trapped. 
Surrounded by the mass. Laws are ignored. Justice from bleeding hands.
