Deep inside my heart, where their reign will get no power. Where their 
violence can not hurt me. I will breed the thoughts and ideals, that bring 
them down, down to their knees. Their poisoned souls are wicked minds, these 
eyes have seen the death of freedom, but no fist ever rose. This righteous 
rage consumed by ignorance. Freedom - My heart is strong. One truth - I will 
not fall. Passion - I'm not alone. Denial - Your lies will burn. My heart is 
strong, I swear I will not fall. I'm not alone, I know we'll rise to bear 
the worlds in us. They can't erase the world in me - too deep inside, too 
strong in me. I'll bring it to life, more than just dreams. The vision that 
keeps me upright their only truth will rot in peace, crack down their 
ideals. I'll watch them burn, I'll see them fall.
