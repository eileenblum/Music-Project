This beatiful world, it looks so nice filled whit sound and light, it smells 
so fine so much bliss, so much perfection a modern world a new society life 
is fast, but I'm not fast enough. Wealth and recognition to the strong, the 
paradise is here, but i'm too weak. No graceful look, no charming smile, 
fate has set me down - below you all hold us captive - behind a wall of 
silence. We live our life in a prison of ignorance. One of the forgotten - 
an unwanted son a life made just for you - not me and my equals. I know, my 
feelings are not worth the pain. Will you affected pitty ever turn to 
respect. How can I long for warmth and love at all? Do you think my heart is 
dead? I should be dead, slain or poisoned - and everything could be so easy 
for you.
