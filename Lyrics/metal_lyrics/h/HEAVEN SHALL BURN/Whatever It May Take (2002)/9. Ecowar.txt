More and more, this certainty will rise. It's far too late, until you'll 
understand. More than ever, I feel there is no way. To make you see, what's 
so drownright. They betrayed the generations after them, framed their 
childrens, left a fateful wisdom you still consume, consume this matricide. 
You still believe, believe these fatal lies. Their machines, they kill for 
us. But if we refuse, if we remonstrate at last. They will go down! They 
shall stand still. Forever! How can you be so indifferent to this creeping 
ecocide? I'll fight against this way of thinking, to make you see, it dies! 
This is my war, an Ecowar! My mother earth will not be assassinated by these 
parasites. This is my war, an Ecowar!
