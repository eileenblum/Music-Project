One by one they fall - and I just close my eyes. It won't be over soon - do 
you regret this time? I thought so many things were certain. So many friends 
turned to the ones I hate. You fade away forever - the hands of time. I 
wanna see the things just how they are feel them, like a child would do. 
Will this kid in me will survive this process? Narrowed minds - I'll burst 
your mental chains even, if I'll live like them - my heart is free. I won't 
become a tool, a puppet. I'll bite the hand that wants to feed me. My will 
to live against your world of zombies. Blindfold the eye, that watches all 
of us and even, if I live like them my heart is free. I'll never walk your 
way - whatever it may take. You never break my will - whatever it may take.
