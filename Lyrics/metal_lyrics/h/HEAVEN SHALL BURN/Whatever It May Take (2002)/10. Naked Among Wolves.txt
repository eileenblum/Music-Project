One life, one hope - this is our life in hell punished for telling the 
truth, for unwanted ideals. Innocence means nothing here - we stand and fall 
together, the only way to ever leave this barren hill. The smile of a child 
set free our minds, a symbol of life in this domain of death they want to 
erase it, if these bastards ever come to know, they'll kill us all. They 
search everywhere - everyday, they infiltrate us, they torture they slew my 
best friends, as he would never betray as he saved the boys life, he set a 
world free. A symbol of moral victory, we're invincible! We raised from the 
dead, winged by this struggle, we judged our tormentors, they fled like 
cowardly bastards. The boys grew in freeom, we saved the whole world.
