To see the world with sober eyes, if everybodies mind is paralyzed by 
thumping lies. Looking in the face of their fake savior, this assassin of 
humanity, without respect, without fear. Wee see the awful thoughts behind 
his golden words, we hear the coming doom, there will be no paradise you'll 
never rule the few upright, the few, who think and act. It's far beneath 
this nation's dignity who walk the tyrant's way. Refuse to close our eyes, 
refuse to follow them, never sacrifice our animus. We are no army they could 
fight against; we are the poisoned youth, that still remembers liberty, that 
still his thinking free. You didn't trample all the flowers before they 
spread their seeds.
