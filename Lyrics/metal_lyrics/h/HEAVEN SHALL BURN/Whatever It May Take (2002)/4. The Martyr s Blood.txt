Last words of confidence still penetrate the cannonthunder, so many daring 
dreams will fall, the vision of a better world dies in the bombingrain. No 
time to say farewell, the world shall hear about their fight. Betrayed by 
spineless servants, conspiracies - so many heroes shot from behind. No 
thoughts of giving in, no stampede - no more negotiating. This desesperate 
fight will set a sing - they died with the gun in their hands. Time will 
avenge one day. The sky is colored red by the martyr's blood, the same sky 
under which. The victors marching in again, bringing back the slavery, the 
oldest order, under rule again - it's been too early, but they shall rise 
again. If it all came down to me, would I shed my blood for what I lived 
for? Would I clench my fist until the last breath?
