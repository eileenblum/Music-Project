Conformity, the agony of freedom. An epidemic eats our worlds. I know your 
eyes will be to weak to see the way to walk. Not able to live the single 
moment. Your skin is far to cold to feel a kiss. Feeling numb to all this 
suffering. Where is the place we use to hide? Will it be enough to tell you 
about the freedom you could have. About the stars, the green, the happiness, 
about the soulless slaves you're following. Will this be wnough to overcome 
the mechanism, that keeps you away from our hands they will never suffocate 
this fire. They will never extinguish my flame. I won't let you fall from my 
hands. I'll fight until the end, I promise. It burns within!
