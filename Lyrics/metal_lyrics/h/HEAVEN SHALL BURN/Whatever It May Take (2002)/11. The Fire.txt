The grass is green today, here where my brothers lay. Buried in this goddanm 
ground, where I lost my life forever too. How can it be? - the sun, it 
shines today over fieds and hills - where we lived in the mud, where we 
heard the thunder we met the beast of mandkind - as we arched into the fire. 
No light, no wind, no calm - It was no place on earth at all. One by one my 
comrades died, sacrificed in the battle of brothers. Thrown into the fire - 
to make a few meters of land. We left our homes with a smile, as we arched 
to the music - as we said farewell to our beloved, we felt like heroes so 
high awaited glory and honor - became cheap canonfodder instead the few, who 
returned are broken forever rain washed away our blood - our cries gone with 
the wind but forever in my head, My soul has burned in the fire, I had the 
hell on earth. Will you remember?
