No one will shed a tear
With frozen souls and darkened eyes
We're marching to the point of no return
No sorrow strong enough to tear apart our bleeding hearts

Not searching for a peace in heaven
No one will ever shed a tear

With my hands raised to the sky
We will not wait for someone to decide
Our sober minds will face this barren truth
Not longing for distant paradise

This is the final levy from bleeding hands
They will receive the final stroke from dying voices
They will hear the curse we whisper

While marching forward without intermission
And tearing down the halls of the extorioner

Not searching for a peace in heaven
No one will ever shed a tear

With my hands raised to the sky
We will not wait for someone to decide
Our sober minds will face this barren truth
Not longing for distant paradise
