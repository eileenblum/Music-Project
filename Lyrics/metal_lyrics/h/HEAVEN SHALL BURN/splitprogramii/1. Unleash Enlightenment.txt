Once risen from the dark centuries
With inflamed hearts and noble minds
Now driven by a vision of the glowing world
And lighted nations in freedom
Now blinded, chained and strangled
Thrown into a dungeon of corruption

Our fathers wisdom lies
Mercenaries in a war against ourselves

Petitioning dastardly idols
And following a godless savior

Puppets of consumption unlearned creating
A mendacious wealth secured by silent slaves
Inane parents, mistead children raised to soldiers...

Mercenaries in war against ourselves
A waste of precious blood and dignity

Petitioning dastardly idols
And following a godless savior

We let them come to power
Unless we unleash enlightment!
An ancient dogma builds new kingdoms
Unless we unleash enligtment!
