[Merauder cover]

I am the Lord, your God, kneel before me and pray
Forbidden acts of evil forced upon people in different ways
Suffering children preyed upon by the man in black
Through the years you look the other way
Here lies the victim of a vicious attack

It's the downfall of Christ
You see him nailed to the cross
It's the downfall of Christ
Betrayed by all of us

If only you will forget I am the one you called
Suppression of a different kind, as you die you call for your God
Seeing me as I bleed before you, you'll be the one to cry
Looking down the roads towards a miracle
My God, he cannot save my life

It's the downfall of Christ
You see him nailed to the cross
It's the downfall of Christ
Betrayed by all of us

Sinners - benevolence is not in your soul
(Our) healers - temptation has led you astray
Judas - using religion for war
Pestilents (persuasion) - it's their holy holocaust

Centuries of merauders fighting in the name of their gods
People dying everyday, hell has opened it's doors
Manipulation for murder, crucified on the cross
Revel in victims blood, revival of their religious wars

It's the downfall of Christ
You see him nailed to the cross
It's the downfall of Christ
Betrayed by all of us
