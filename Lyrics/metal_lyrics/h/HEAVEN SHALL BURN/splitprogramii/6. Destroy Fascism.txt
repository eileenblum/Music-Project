[Endstand cover]

I've had enough of your lies
Now it's the time to make it stop
Spreading false propaganda how your race is clean
How can you be so stupid? Colour doesn't mean a fucking thing

Now we're ready to fight for everyone's right
To live without fear getting attacked by you
Baldheaded assholes this we won't tolerate
It's time to put end to this fucking hate

Destroy fascism!
Antifascist action now...
