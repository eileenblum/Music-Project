you all have seen
you all have seen the suffering
you all knew it, you all know it
but your eyes
but your eyes lie to your heart
morality corrupted and profit conducted

born in a factory
cold steel machineries
and driven by this greed - you're breeding the disease
infected by this deadness - you're breeding the disease

You're still the shade of lies
Driven by this crime

But I will not accept
Accept your carelessness
Mass production
Mass destruction

Born in a factory
Cold steel machineries
And driven by this greed
You're breeding the disease
Infected by this deadness
You're spreading the disease

You're still the shade of lies

You will face relentless changes
You're breeding the disease
You're spreading the disease
