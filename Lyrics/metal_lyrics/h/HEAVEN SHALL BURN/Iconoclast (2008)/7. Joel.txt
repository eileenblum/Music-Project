golden domes and massive towers
false icons, show their perfect smiles

all joy and benefactions, they give it with a smile
big hearted deeds and wise words
they donate it all with pleasure
As you have paid the price

wise words of advice
you should pay the price

insignia of doubtful unions
an untruth factory, the Jesus industry

a preacher in a palace, deriding Luther's fight
jugglers rise to icons, fiddles play ingsaints
selling hope and worship mammon
blindness, fear, delusion - their intrinity
as you have paid the price, welcome to paradise

insignia of doubtful unions
an untruth factory, the Jesus industry

disbelievers, greed and wastage
Joel is gonna burn in hell

these disbelievers in a preacher's suit
success and happines they sell
accountants save your soul
as you have paid the price, welcome to paradise

As you have paid the price
Welcome to paradise

I don't know about sins and sinners
But Joel's gonna burn in hell
I don't know about sins and sinners
but Joel's gonna burn in hell

insignia of doubtful unions
an untruth factory, the Jesus industry
