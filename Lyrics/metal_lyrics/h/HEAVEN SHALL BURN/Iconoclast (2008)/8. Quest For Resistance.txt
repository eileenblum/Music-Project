A quest for resistance

a nation reborn
reborn into a new world

awoken from the eras
ruins of an insane dream still cast their shadows
and demons from the past still walk among us

an age that bore no heroes

no answers to the few who raised their questions
just like a poison, silence killed the truth

a quest for resistance
you're searching for an easy truth
you betrayed them, they could not trust in you

You betrayed them
Your heroes
Could not trust in you

A nation reborn

as you marched in lines and circles
as you held your flags up high
they had nowhere to run to
your heroes, they could not dare to speak to you

a quest for resistance
a quest for resistance
you're searching for an easy truth
you betrayed them, they could not trust in you

You betrayed them
Your heroes
Could not trust in you

but the courage you're reclaiming,
it died a bitter death with them
no one here and no one there,
no one heard them calling
no one heard them calling
