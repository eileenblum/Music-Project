their shadows burnt into the walls
so many lives reduced to ashes
so many homes razed to the ground
a shine like from a thousands suns

betrayed by their proud leaders
and executed by atrocious enemies
so many homes, so many lives
a silent sense of guilt should rise

a thousand books all full with with vindications
simple explanations and coloured declarations
where silent sense of guilt should rise
but a victor's story cannot lie

Betrayed by their proud leaders
So many homes, so many lives
A silent sense of guilt
Should rise

one modest truth they teach their children
a victor's story, it cannot lie

see these branded generations
hear, their bells are tolling
hear, hear them calling

Betrayed by their proud leaders
And executed by atrocious enemies
So many homes, so many lives
A silent sense of guilt should rise
