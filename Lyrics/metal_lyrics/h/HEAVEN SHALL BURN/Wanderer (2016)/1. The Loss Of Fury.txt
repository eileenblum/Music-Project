I will not fear this misleading
No tears will drown the fire in my eyes
And I shall not labour under their illusions
Exploiting all your sorrow
Suffocate your dearest dreams

I saw you drowning
In this stream of deadness
You did not seize my hand
What a carven surrender

Obliteration
Of this most essential emotion
This is the loss of fury
This is your silent demise
