This is the reckoning
End staring into voided skies
Bury your fallen angels
No one to save me
All lines to follow perished
No one to lead me

Save me

I see them march again, hailing the darkest kings
And even if I leave it all
This downfall resonates across the acorns

Deceptive calm surrounding the unaware
Resting in the eye of the storm
Cross my hearts and hope to die
I will not wait for them to save me form the falling night
You feel these days are closing in
Yet unmistrusting, still not reflecting

Am I the only one to see
And do I really roam alone
Along the shores of our empty seas
Screaming my lungs out, against the forceful winds
Now this will break your heart, full of deceitful hopes
Devoid the passion, opposition unlearnt

Cross my heart and hope to die
I will not wait for them to save me from the falling night
Stench of indifference, carried by the rising winds
Blowing on the fires eating up this world

Am I the only one to see
And do I really roam alone
Along the shores of our empty seas
Screaming my lungs out, against the forceful winds
Now this will break your heart, full of deceitful hopes
Devoid the passion, opposition unlearnt

Hear them chant again, hailing the darkest kings
These walls are closing in, idle minds fight no repression

I was the only one to see
Now I wander all alone
Along the stormy shores if my beloved seas
Sail into silence, using the forceful winds
Mourning the broken hearts, full if deceitful hopes
All their broken hearts, full of deceitful hopes
