No light of dawn will shine upon their false red flags
There is no compromise, today retreat is not an option
Grim faced and awake we watch their crimeful gathering
As their hallow slogans echo through the East End streets
Right here, right now, we will put them in their place

See the Blackshirts are marching
But this time they will not brave the storm
Shoulder to shoulder we stand
This is a somber season but my heart is filled with confidence
Believe me today, they shall not pass this way

Not yet corrupted
Not yet forced into their lines
Adamant and resolute
Under streaming banners they defile
Lulled into false sense of security
Nevermore the sound of marching boots
Will hall through Cable Street
Those who play with fire shall burn themselves today

See the Blackshirts are marching
But this time they will not brave the storm
Shoulder to shoulder we stand
This is a somber season but my heart is filled with confidence
Believe me today, they shall not pass this way

From different sides of a society
But now together upon the barricade
Side by side we fight the fear and terror
Hand in hand we strike â united by the enemy

Strike down their colours
They shall not pass
They will pass
Never again
