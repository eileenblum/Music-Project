I threw my useless life
Into their wars and riots
For the ideal
To serve the ones I love
Yes, all too soon
No recognition for
My pointless sacrifice
And far too late I saw

I left my home defenceless
This world's a slaughterhouse
And men like me are not the butchers
I brought justice to no one
But there was no doubt
It always stands to reason
Protect the just
Conquer the felons

Returned
Wounded and broken
But I never left these barren fields

And now I understand
There is no war to end all wars
Take it from me
Drowning your honest love
In mindless violence
I bring the war home
Still raging within me

All too soon
These children lost their fathers
And far too late I saw
That not for them I fought
The gods of profit
Led me into
Their battles

I never brought security
To those I wanted to protect
Feeding the machine
And staining this world
With blood instead

And only now I understand
There is no war to end all wars
Take it from me
Drowning your honest love
In mindless violence
I bring the war home
Still raging within me [2x]

Take it from me
You'll carry the war home
I brought justice
To no one

Now they spit me in the face
I did not recognize
The real offenders

And now I understand
There is no war to end all wars
Take it from me
Drowning your honest love
In mindless violence
I bring the war home
Still raging within me

We brought affliction to the masses
And splendour to a few
We are aggressors
Not defenders [2x]
