I close my eyes and hear it rushing
From the cradle to the grave
This pulsating ever flowing stream
Running through my veins

An ocean within me
Tides of the deepest red I know
Drowning the filth of the outside world
Ever vibrant, never resting protecting me
Healing me, a treasure beyond gold

Ever heartbeat a movement order
For an army marching through
Every single heartbeat, an army marching through

Never resting

Mystified and sacrosanct
A mesmerizing force from times immemorial
A fragile balance, in need of perfect harmony
All too often tainted and defiled

An ocean within me
Tides if the deepest red I know
Drowning the filth of the outside world
Ever vibrant, never resting protecting me
Healing me

Never resting

Every silent breath I take fuels this vivid stream of ever shinning red
Raging currents, silent waters, an uncorrupted mirror
Reflecting my state of mind

My river of crimson
Never be my enemy
Never run into my ocean of sorrow
Be my companion, I shall never leave

An ocean within me
Tides if the deepest red I know
Drowning the filth of the outside world
Ever vibrant, never resting protecting me
Never resting, ever vibrant, my silent remedy
