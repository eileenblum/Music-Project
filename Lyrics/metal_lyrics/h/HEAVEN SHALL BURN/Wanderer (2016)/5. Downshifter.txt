Stricken, but I will never fall
There is nothing in this world I fear
Forsaken, but I will never call
The ones that want so see me down, forever crawling
To their feet, forever begging for their noble deeds
I shall never kiss this crown and there is nothing I regret

I always knew this day would come
Faint premonitions blend into knowledge
This is the time of new departures
So many fists, so many shining eyes
So many voices shouting out the will to power

I seek salvation in the distance, leaving the turmoil of this world
And all my dreams falling silent I left the lost, so very long ago

As masses converging around their towers
An apodictic certainty arose in me
That I shall wear this sign forever
That I shall never kiss this crown, nothing I regret

I know the apostates, I carry the truth in me
As new liars invade my riven fatherland

I seek salvation in the distance, leaving the turmoil of this world
And all my dreams falling silent I left the lost, so very long ago

I see vassals face away from frantic leaders
Lies of omissions ensnare the changeling
I see heroes decay, I hear pontiffs betray
Betray their canon sermonized over ages

I seek salvation in the distance, leaving the turmoil of this world
And all my dreams falling silent I left the lost, so very long ago
