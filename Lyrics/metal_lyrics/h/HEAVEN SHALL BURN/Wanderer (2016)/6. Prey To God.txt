There is a void within the soul of every man
A secret blind spot, so numb and callous, careless and cold
So far beyond all empathy

Worthless appendix of incarnation
Yet the gateway to poison questing minds
Casting upon you, the spell of segregation
Tear all love from you, in total desolation

Total incapacitation

Self-knowledge denied and all your dignity defiled
No matter the names they bear
No matter the saints they fear
Lying prophets, fallen hollows, untruth revelators
Your fear of hell will drag you into a godless abyss

There is no way to cure the human race
Forever abandoned to disgrace
Waiting for you to surrender at last
Suffocating in religious haze
Implanted image of a prudent god, so wise and gracious
So far above the plagues you fear

Self-knowledge denied and all your dignity defiled
No matter the names they bear
No matter the saints they fear
Lying prophets, fallen hollows, untruth revelators
Your fear of hell will drag you into a godless abyss

Fear of hell, prey to god, self-chosen hell, prey to god

Self-knowledge denied and all your dignity defiled
Momentary gods abhorred
But ancient demons adored
