Trotha!
His name was Trotha, never forgive, neveforget!
This irate oath we carry in our darkened hearts forever
A march into damnation
Peregrination towards the open gates of hell
Our fathersâ blood ran down the Waterberg, our mothersâ cries
They died away in endless deserts
Under a radiant sun an azure skies
We died a wretched death under their bright eyes

These few survivors scarred for life
Dammed generations to follow
Tell me will you ever pay the price
Breaking the silence at last

No more hiding the truth

Fallen from your doubtful grace
An invocation of the beginning of your end
Our fathersâ blood ran down the Waterberg
Our mothersâ cries, the dies away
Imploring remorseless oppressors

These few survivors scarred for life
Dammed generations to follow
Tell me will you ever pay the price
Breaking the silence at last
The shadows of this genocide
Eclipse my haunted soul forever
Your empty words to regret, deriding the dead
