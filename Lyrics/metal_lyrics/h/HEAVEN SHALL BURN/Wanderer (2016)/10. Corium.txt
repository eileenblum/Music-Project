Supervision end to end and unprovided
For events beyond control
Once committed to progress
Now impelling the downturn, unable to confess
Megalomania, fueled by long gone visionaries
Reign of misguided futurist

No reason to see, the cataclysmic silence they still teach
In the name of progression, admitting of no option
Technology evangelists misled
An evocation of relentless distress

Now fallen from the highest of your victory
Still undiscerning, on and on into misery

Swallow their timeworn doctrines
Absorbing the lies like released iodine
Without protest
There is no yearning for deliverance form malediction

No reason to see, the cataclysmic silence they still teach
In the name of progression, evocation of a certain nemesis
Standstill in the name of progression, we lost control

Now fallen from the highest of your victory
Still undiscerning
On and on into misery

In the name of progression, in silence they still teach
They bought this fatal regression
On and in into misery
