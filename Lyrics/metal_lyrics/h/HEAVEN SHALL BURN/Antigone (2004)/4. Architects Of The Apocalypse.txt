Greed and addiction drowned their pity
Washed away their thoughts of compassion and regret
A world left wounded, slaved and raped
Your paradise is hell for your descendants

Cathedrals of justice in a kingdom of hypocrisy
Castles of self-righteousness built on graves

Masses kept in forlorn, nations laid to waste
The dynamo of northern golden age
Darkened our future, blinded by greed
Sold your fate to the highest price

I don't believe in you!
You are the enemy!
A rush into our doom, as if your God came down
And cures all failure
