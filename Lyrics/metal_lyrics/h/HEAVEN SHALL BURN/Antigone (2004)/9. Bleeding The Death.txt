Deceived of all your dreams
Betrayed by all your leaders
This shall no place to be
This, a dead-end future

Take a walk through grey, concrete deserts
Apathetic faces, empty eyes - the only thing you will see
A whole country bleeding to death
One big illusion - bleeding to death

No young hands to built it up
Cities fall to ruin
Just old men left to mourn
Four decades of a life denied
Abused good will to exploit us
Brothers turned to victors
Fooled by ancient propaganda
A bottle - your illusion
Your home just like a colony
