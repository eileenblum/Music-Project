Risen from the ashes, the ashes of the dreams you burned
So many wars these eyes have seen
So many agonies my soul went through
I died with them so many years ago
Just in darkness my eyes see the world
There is nothing more to lose

Forlorn in desperation, the fruits of your power
A world of slaves and servants - the only aim to rule them all
Punishment to nonconformists, death and terror to the upright ones

Coups and interventions, nothing will be uncontrolled
My life against your reign
A final judgement will be given
You come with me, this is the end

A time will come for all of you
To harvest the storm
My blood will drown your flame of greed
The time has come for you:
To harvest the storm

No single tear, no single scream
A silent smile - the time is now
A moment of redemption
The time has come :
To harvest the storm
