Dreams torn to pieces, broken like glass
Hope faded away, withered like leaves
Not knowing is blessing, ignorance the only protection

Nothing is numbing my pain
The fragments of my faith
Became the blade in my hand
Just darkness my eyes see
Pushed me to the end of all dead-end-streets

A curse - cannot lie to myself
I'm doomed - cannot silence my heart
Fear is the tool, conformity our medicine

How can I smile as this age dies, like everybody else
Dancing around the fire, that burns this world

Cannot bend down, I would just break
I hate myself for playing their game
Parents poison their children, never teach them to question
If it only wasn't for this certainty in me
I am a giant in their tiny world
