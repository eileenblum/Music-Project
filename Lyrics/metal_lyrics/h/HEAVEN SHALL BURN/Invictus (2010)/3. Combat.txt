Welcome to a world of pain,
This is the day of your conversion mortification
Dragged away from home on blood red nights
Slave to a brutal system, forevermore
You are an orphan now,
Adopted by the beast of war
The end of all your childhood dreams has come
No more will you meet a smiling face
Now peace has left your sleep forever
There are no arms to hold you,
Yet there are no hands to wipe your tears
Constrained and forced to kill
These cruelties will haunt you
A life in combat,
Your fear will make you bleed
Your inner combat
A life without a future, you will forget your wishes
And nothing to embrace, but the rifle in your hands
You are an orphan now,
Adopted by the beast of war
The end of all your childhood dreams has come
A life of combat, forevermore
No more will you meet a smiling face
Now peace has left your sleep forever
There are no arms to hold you,
Yet there are no hands to wipe your tears away
There are no arms to hold you
Peace has left over your sleep
"There are about 300.000 child soldiers worldwide, most of them are forced to fight in armed conflicts."
