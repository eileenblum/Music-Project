Symbols of addiction - It won't hit your life just over night. It creeps and 
wait inside you - Longing for weak moments. Reaching control step by step, 
but too strong my will, too oure my oath. Inside my heart I feel are 
creatures of light where demons rule. I'll cary colours of life, where wind 
wind just blows ashes away. No need for false fortune - No mercy from me for 
your fallen heroes.
