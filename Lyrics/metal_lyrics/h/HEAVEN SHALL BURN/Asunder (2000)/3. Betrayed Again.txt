No single fate, a broken generation. Once guide by hope, now fallen into 
despair. The chosen few play their game. A man, his hands want to grasp, but 
they don't need him anymore. His eyes without light, his walk weak and 
still. He lost all pride already years ago. Sleeplessness every night - 
Throught of regret. He knows there will be a tomorrow, but why wake up 
again. All he wanted was freedom, the hope to perhaps fulfill some dreams. A 
better life for his children, a little piece from the sky... But fate 
betrayed him again. Family and friendship, the only things he never had 
Destroyed by comsuption, replaced by egoism and greed, just shame remains. 
From the very beginning he had no role in the game. Given up, driven to 
alcohol, to forget about everything. The hope of a revolutioner died, 
silent, slowly and forever.
