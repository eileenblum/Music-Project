Now I know you knew it all before. It was doomed to failure - All my love 
and all my dreams. My empty eyes embrace the sky. Impossible to penetrate 
your clouds. The epidemic you created fills my heart, infescts my soul. With 
my broken hands I'll never reach your stars. My frozen skin is longing for a 
fire. An outcast you created to feel stength. To rule a world of addicts. 
Your paradise no place for me. All feelings lost, the rain of ice. But if I 
drowned - I'll take all of you with me.
