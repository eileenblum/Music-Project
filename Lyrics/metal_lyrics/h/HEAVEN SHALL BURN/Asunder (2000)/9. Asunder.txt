A suffering race, what will remain. My world comes down. I'm not divine 
anymore. All power leaves - My blood is gray. My guiding light of hope - A 
dying sun Darkness rises, a chill limps our love. Where I am... Who I am... 
All that once belonged together. Divided by hatred. Emotions died - my 
dreams... ...asunder.
