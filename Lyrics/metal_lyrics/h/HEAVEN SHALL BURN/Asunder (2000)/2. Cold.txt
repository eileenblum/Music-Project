I don't know when it came. This cold, it fills my soul. I still feel a fire, 
but I dosn't. Warm anynore. Where is all energy, we once got from love? 
Paralyze througths, our hands are frozen. Empty eyes - There are no words, 
there are no tears. A few stars left, but too far to reach. All green seem 
like grey in the dark. Who said it would be over soon. Who thought we could 
conquer our nature? Impossible to overcome, there is no end. Nothing will 
disappear, but all will change. There will be no path, but we have to march. 
All throught the cold.
