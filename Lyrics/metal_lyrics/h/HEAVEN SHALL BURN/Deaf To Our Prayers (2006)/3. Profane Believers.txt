Loosing touch with reality
In your world of plenty it's also easy to preach love
Holier than thou, your order that shall rule
Yet, at the walls of your cathedrals poor sinners starve to death

[Refrain:]
Ungodly wastefulness and petrified profanity materialized in golden temples
Within the walls of Babylon profane believers follow their fateful leaders

This world is up in arms
The time has come to bid farewell
A true belief will rule
Our true belief will rule

A pure commitment will blow away an unreal constitution

[Refrain]
