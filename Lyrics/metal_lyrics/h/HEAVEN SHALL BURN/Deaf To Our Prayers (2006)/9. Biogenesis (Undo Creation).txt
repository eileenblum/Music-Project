An overbearing dogma in disguise
Superstition displacing all reality
Debasing mother nature and dreaming of intelligent design

Let sanity prevail!

Adulterated doctrine,
So abstruse,
Beyond all reason
And apart from any evidence

Let sanity prevail!
Defending Darwin's throne

Idolizing supreme forces while trampling down creation
Unable to accept their unimportance, insignificance
Their insignificance

Prospecting vindication for existing misery
Scorn this indoctrination,
Pressed on by a profane confraternity
Shame for the summit of creation

Let sanity prevail!
Defending Darwin's throne
Where blind belief and science meet we're defending Darwin's throne
