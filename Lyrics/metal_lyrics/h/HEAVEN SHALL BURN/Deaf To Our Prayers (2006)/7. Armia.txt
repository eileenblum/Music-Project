An insurrection of the lost
With courage born from despair
An end for the years of anguish;
A battle in the nation's heart

[Refrain:]
Uprising of the lost;
In the abyss between the worlds
They all averted their eyes
A home behind the enemy's lines

They raped and burned our fatherland
We know that nothing shall remain; there's no tomorrow,
We'll bring it to an end

[Refrain]

Our souls scorched with our homes
But fitful we hold our ground
Ragged figures but brothers and sisters we are;
Through fields of debris we crawl

Uprising of the lost; the world averted its eyes
Red vultures awaiting our end
A home behind the enemies lines

[Refrain]
