Unrelenting, their endeavour to rule lives
Teaching you an artificial truth,
That you will grieve no more,
That you will die no more.
Narrow minded mercenaries,
Slave traders, soul collectors.

Send a promise of destruction to those who will not kneel.
Derision of the upright ones; as fear devours all doubts

[Refrain:]
But there are so many things I hold beyond their reach
The doom you promised me may come, I'm not afraid
You cannot save me
I am the counterweight.
No need to save me
For I'm the counterweight.

And I will grieve no more,
I will die no more

[Refrain]
