Blood trickles away in the sand
All hope crushed, perished in the border fences of a secure stronghold

We crossed this lost world, so much distress we have seen
The home we left behind offered nothing but despair
Under the veil of darkness we marched for endless years
Beyond the silver bright horizon a brave new world exists

[Refrain:]
Trespassing the shores of your world,
Piles of dead bodies at the walls of Fortress Europe
Cast a shadow on your paradise
Oblivion and apathy will keep you warm

A continent beyond recovery
Like dark invaders they receive us
A gaping wound in the flesh of this earth;
A bleeding they refused to staunch

[Refrain]
