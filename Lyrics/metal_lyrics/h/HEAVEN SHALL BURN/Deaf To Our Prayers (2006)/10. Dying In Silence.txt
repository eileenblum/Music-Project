Yaaaahhhhhhh!
How many times can they bend your will until you break and die inside?
Is there still a heartfelt discomfort in you?
Deep down inside to live these lies
Addicted to goodwill

[Refrain:]
On bleeding knees you're waiting for the answers
(with gazing eyes you're hoping for a sign)
Annihilation of your spirits
Dreams die in silence and piece by piece you go with them
Forsaken, unseen. Forsaken and unseen!

Always accepting the inevitable
Won't make you find your peace
There is no substitute for your lost dignity
No one shall ever poison the worlds in you,
The treasures in your heart

At the end of life there's only black and white

[Refrain]
