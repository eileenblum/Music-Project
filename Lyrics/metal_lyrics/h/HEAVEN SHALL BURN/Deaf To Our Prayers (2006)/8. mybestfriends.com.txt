Are you still the one I used to know?
Where is the fire in your eyes?
Do you remember all the things we used to share?
Your strong words gave hope to me so many times
But now there's only silence when we meet

[Refrain:]
These are the darkest of your days, where are your thousand friends?
And who will guide you through the night as all the light went out?

In the darkness of your room, the only moment that you feel free
The solidarity you feel is only solitude you share - solitude you share

[Refrain]

This is where they want you to be
Washing all your thoughts and passion
The solidarity that you feel is only solitude you share - solitude you share
Your strong words gave hope to me so many times
But now there's only silence when we meet

[Refrain]
