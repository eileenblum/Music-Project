False prophets rule your life!

The whole world absorbed by the darkness in your heart
Only flames of sorrow light your way through the night
Your hands will never touch his face

False prophets rule your life!

As you poison the river of life, erasing the greatest gift of god
All you need is yourself

False prophets rule your life!
