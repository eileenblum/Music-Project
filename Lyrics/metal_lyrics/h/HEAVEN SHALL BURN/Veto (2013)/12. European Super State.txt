[Bonus Track][originally by Killing Joke]
[with Katharina Radig]I'm a Judeo-Christian morality
With a Greco-Roman intellect
It's the way we're short-wired
It's a civilizing force that demands respect

From the Baltic to the Straits of Gibraltar
A blue flag gold star sparks a brand new empire
Ours to build, ours the choice

I'm in a European Super State
Every citizen required to debate!
I'm in a European Super State
Every citizen required to debate!

Why are the proud descendants of Plato
Paying off more debts accommodating NATO?
We the caretakers of democracy
No longer tolerate this hypocrisy

Baltic to the Straits of Gibraltar
A blue flag gold star sparks a brand new empire
Ours to build, ours the choice

I'm in a European Super State
Every citizen required to debate!
I'm in a European Super State
Every citizen required to debate!

Old Europe, old Europe, old Europe
Old Europe, old Europe, old Europe

I'm a Judeo-Christian morality
With a Greco-Roman intellect
It's the way we're short-wired
It's a civilizing force that demands respect

From the Baltic to the Straits of Gibraltar
A blue flag gold star sparks a brand new empire
Ours to build, ours the choice

I'm in a European Super State
Every citizen required to debate!
I'm in a European Super State
Every citizen required to debate!
