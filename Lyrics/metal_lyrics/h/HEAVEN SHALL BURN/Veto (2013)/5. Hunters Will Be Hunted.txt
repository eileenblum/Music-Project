This is the end of all endurance,
No mercy for assassins
Violence against violence
And hunters will be hunted
Until the slaughter ceased to be
Believe me, you'll regret your deeds
We took a stand and won't retreat
Until their malice ceased to be
Nothing justifies your greed
You will not succeed

You shall regret your felonies
We took a stand and won't retreat
And hunters will be hunted
Until the slaughter ceased to be
Across the open seas, together through the storm
You'll make no creature bleed, nevermore, forevermore

No drawing back, direct, actions strike upon you
No compromise, no giving in
Defending those who cannot fight
Justice must prevail
A campaign for relief

I looked him straight in the eye
This moment of compassion
I found my mission in life
We send them to the bottom
Forevermore
