Fallen, long fallen are the righteous ones, long gone their high ideals
Corrupted are their leaders, feeding the machine, dreaming of yesterday

Never will I be someone, frightened by your threats, beaten by your clubs
Words are my weapon, conviction is my shield,
A new sun rises but bludgeoned are the upright ones

No remorse, still in power are the criminals, enforcing vicious claims
Wounded and hunted are the deviants, convicted and condemned

Never will I be someone, unsettled by my fears, corroded by this greed
Words are my weapon, conviction is my shield,
A new sun rises but bludgeoned are the upright ones
Never will I be someone, poisoned by your lies, betraying this demise

But your dominion turned my love to horror,
Converted my compassion into my darkest hate
We were about to stall this merciless machine,
Leading a strong-willed youth out of the shadow of your past

Raised in the bombing rain, scarred by an unforgiving war
Executed those who sparked the masses,
Unrepentant, state-aided violence takes its course

Forever will I be the one, draining your blackest tears,
Holding your darkest fears
Real are my weapons, terror is my yield
A dark sun rises and bludgeoned are the upright ones,
Forever bludgeoned are the upright ones
