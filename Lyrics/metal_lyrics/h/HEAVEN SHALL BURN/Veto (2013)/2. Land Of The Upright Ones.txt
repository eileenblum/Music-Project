The dawn of a new age is near,
We'll put an end to all the chaos and fear
Under angry skies we march,
Against this downfall,
Against this unjust regime

No masters, no leaders,
This is the end of treason
There's nothing they will carry on
Black-hearted are their promises
Believe me, liberty is paid by blood

There's nothing they will carry on
There's nothing they will carry on
Nothing they will act upon
Nothing they will carry on
Nothing they will act upon

No masters, no leaders,
This is the end of treason
There's nothing they will carry on
Black-hearted are their promises
Believe me, liberty is paid by blood

There is nothing, I can pledge to you
But whatever we will win is more than slavery
This life, this golden future â it's in our hands
This wealth belongs to all of us

No masters, no leaders,
This is the end of treason
There's nothing they will carry on
Black-hearted are their promises
Believe me, liberty is paid by blood

Looted and defiled
Those days are over now
Felons will be brought to justice
Why don't you learn from my mistakes?

This life, this future, we'll build a new foundation
A new era we will bid welcome

This life, this future, this is a new foundation
A new era we will bid welcome

Your master, your leader this is the end of reason
There's nothing we will carry on
Good-hearted were the promises,
Why don't you learn from my mistakes
