Come save me from the burning,
Ride against these dire times,
Versus all apathy and disregard,
Yielding new hope to all the fallen ones,
To all the silenced, to those unheard...

A sign of hope in peaceless times,
A shining light among the darkest nights,
Godiva, your silent rage will bury them,
Godiva, promise me, convey our hate and screams...

Will you bury them, Godiva will you bury them,
No truth will ever reach them, no word will ever touch him,
A life beyond all sympathy...

A sign of hope in peaceless times,
A shining light among the darkest nights,
Godiva, your silent rage will bury them,
Godiva, promise me, convey our hate and screams...

One day the tide is turning,
And nothing will be left for them,
Of all their vanity, of all this selfishness,
Godiva will bury them, Lady Godiva,
When will you ride again...

No truth will ever reach them,
No word will ever touch him,
A life beyond all sympathy...

A sign of hope in peaceless times,
A shining light among the darkest nights,
Godiva, your silent rage will bury them,
Godiva, promise me, convey our hate and screams...
