There is no peace to find and
Empty words of regret fade away,
As greed of gain has drowned all temperance,
There's nothing left to stem the rising blackness

This is the agony of human sympathy
Merchants of misery assumed control
Leading a biased trail, the ruin of democracy

They sell the seeds of perdition
To the highest price
Like gods among mortals they walk
The way of damnation

Deathmongers, elected and legitimised,
Sitting in secret councils
Corrupted henchmen, no beholder
Fraternity is wiped from the face of this earth

They sell the seeds of perdition
To the highest price
Like gods among mortals they walk
The way of damnation
