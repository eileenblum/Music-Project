We don't comply to normal standards,
Non conform and freedom-loving outcast
We've turned away! We won't betray!
A haven for the seakers, a shelter for the renegades,
No where else there's tolerance to find
Protecting the freedom of our thoughts, beyond compulsions
And against their uniform constraints, we had nowhere to go,
But here we can at last express our senses

This is the voice of those who turned away
And never to be victimized again
Now you can follow the calling of your heart
A place to be, claiming your needs

This is the fight of real believer,
A true defender of essential liberties,
Against their cultural defaults
And versus clerical blockheadness
Harassed and controlled,
Spied out and monitored without a gap,
Betrayers commanded unquestioning obidience,
But a stubborn mind bore up against the tide

We've turned away! We won't betray!
A haven for the seakers, a shelter for the renegades,
No where else there's tolerance to find

This is the voice of those who won't betray
And never to be victimized again
Why don't you follow the calling of your heart
He fought for you, so claim your needs
