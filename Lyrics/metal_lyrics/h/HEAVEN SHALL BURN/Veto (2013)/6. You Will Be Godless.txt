Godless old men, confess your sins,
Why don't you practice what you preach

An isolated super state,
Lead and controlled by rotten tyrants
Detached from this world and disconnected from reality
Maintaining power is the highest destination
Suppressing real enlightment and ruling by oppression
Misanthropic doctrines, committed only to their profit

Follow them and godless you will be
Preaching love but feeding hatred
Forgiving sins, concealing crimes
Just follow them and godless you shall be

Infallible, an ultimate authority,
Without any explanation
Manipulation, profiteering
Money greedy hypocrites, power-hungry dotards
Downtrodden believers, trapped within archaic structures

Why don't you practice, what you preach

Follow them and godless you will be
Feeding the sawyer, taunting the starving
Worship creation, while agonizing creatures

Black hearts beating under snow white cassocks
Their golden beringed hands, pray to a distressed icon
Ancient traditions of justifying dark suppressors
