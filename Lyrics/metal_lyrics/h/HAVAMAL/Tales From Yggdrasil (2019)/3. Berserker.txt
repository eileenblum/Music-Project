Born for war and reaping of lives
Our warrior stands alone

Death surrounds his every step
As his fate is carved in stone

Frozen lands unveils his fate
To fight until he dies

Now son of bear with cloak of strength
Unleash your furious cry

Blood and war forever sworn

Known through ranks of enemies
More beast than man in mind

Hundreds have been forced to die
Their heads his axe will find

Inside lives a raging beast
An animals lust for more

The bear inside outgrows the man
And throws him into war

For my gods I do declare
Blood through loathe will be my oath

Berserk
Murderer
Servant
Of the gods

Slayer

A warrior beast demanding blood!

Forced to live a warn-torn life
A bear disguised as man

His strength and hate will know no end
He's like a battering ram

To the frozen north he bends his knee
His will is with the gods

With the axe in hand and a bear in mind
A berserk shows his form

With the gods I will conquer them all
Blood and war forever sworn

Berserk
Murderer
Servant
Of the Norns

Slayer

Murderer
Sound the horns
