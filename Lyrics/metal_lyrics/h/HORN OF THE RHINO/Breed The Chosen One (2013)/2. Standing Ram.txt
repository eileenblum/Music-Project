Eyes
Closed but alive
Feeling
Presence in my wine
Cold
Power in the room
Serpent
That brings our doom

You think you're safe you're free
You're covered in your dreams
But know this is for real

The voices in your head
Make you wanna beg
Still you don't see it

The fire burning fast
Awaiting for the clash
Sun melting our past

Believers can't believe
What their eyes are seeing
The standing ram is here

Born
Will not born again
Fever
Calling from within
Death
Against you all
Silence
Broken by the gun

You think you're safe you're free
You're covered in your dreams
But know this is for real

The voices in your head
Make you wanna beg
Still you don't see it

The fire burning fast
Awaiting for the clash
Sun melting our past

Believers can't believe
What their eyes are seeing
The standing ram is here

And your life means nothing
Cry at a loss just like the
Bitch you are
On your knees for your master
Pray the new lord
Pray to the bringer of no life
