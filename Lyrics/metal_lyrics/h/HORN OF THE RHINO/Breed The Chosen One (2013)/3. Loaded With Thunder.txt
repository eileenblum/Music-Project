The fever takes away the love
Takes away the soul
To crush the gates of innocence
To crush the fate of god

Walk through fire
Bullets no need
Riding
On the back of the beast

No matter if the soul is dead
No matter just because
The guns loaded with thunder
Full of blood is the road

Walk through fire
Bullets no need
Riding
On the back of the beast

Behind the throne of heaven
Inside the pits of hell
The monarchs are hiding
With fear of his hate

Walk through fire
Bullets no need
Riding
On the back of the beast
