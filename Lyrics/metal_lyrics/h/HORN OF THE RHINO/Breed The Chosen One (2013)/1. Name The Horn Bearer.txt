Know the road's to long
Feeling anguish, a doubt
Want to take a shortcut
You want to cross the door

Join me, take you high
Want to breath no more lies
Just say my name
I'll set you free from chains

Seven
Vomiting your life
Bullets
Say goodbye

Leave your faith at the door
And don't stain the floor
Horn of the rhino
Devout to the goat

Join me, take you high
Want to breath no more lies
Just say my name
I'll set you free from chains

Seven
Vomiting your life
Bullets
Say goodbye

Know the road's to long
Feeling anguish, a doubt
Want to take a shortcut
You want to cross the door

Join me, take you high
Want to breath no more lies
Just say my name
I'll set you free from chains
