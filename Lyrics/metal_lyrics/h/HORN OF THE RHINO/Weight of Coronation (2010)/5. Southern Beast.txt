Plague of carrion
Darkest hour
Seed of evil
Bleed your mother

No time to rise the axe
The throne buried in ice
No more restrained anger
Rotting this blackened earth

Instant justice
Cry for mercy
There was no warning swords are thirsty

No time to rise the axe
The throne buried in ice
No more restrained anger
Rotting this blackened earth

It's time to show
Those in the need
Eradication is the key
Fire with fire
Eye for an eye
Mistaking bastards for kings
Creep in the shadows
Free from everything
But outside the whip is waiting
Their heads on the anvils
Hammers on their heads
You know that karma's a bitch

It's time to draw a line
And show the blackest heart
Let the thunder comes
Let gas this carrion

The blackest heart!!!
