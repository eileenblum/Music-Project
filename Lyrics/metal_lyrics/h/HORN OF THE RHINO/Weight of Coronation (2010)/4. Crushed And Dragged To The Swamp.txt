Awake in the mud, one with the ground
Ancient hunger, cold fire burns
Silent dragging, wet death awaits
Watch the grotesque opening its gates

Swamp mother
Serpent whip
Swamp calling
Devil's gift

Under the blood red skies of past
Breaking all bones, turned into dust
For the right hand path now it's too late
Swamp has a crown, one with the ground

Swamp mother
Serpent whip
Swamp calling
Devil's gift
