See this throne surrounded by bitches
The king is blind
Beware with the horns of the beast
Our sacrifice

From the deep building the sentence
A bleeding back, a cross to bear
Speaking in tongues of pestilence

Dogs barking from the other side
Whores're on their knees
Love in the blackest church of horror
Priest of the deep

From the deep building the sentence
A bleeding back, a cross to bear
Speaking in tongues of pestilence

Blind faith heading
To the sun
No matter for what
Is beyond
Open my arms
To the void
You should fear the goat
You should fear the goat in the dark

From the deep building the sentence
A bleeding back, a cross to bear
Speaking in tongues of pestilence
