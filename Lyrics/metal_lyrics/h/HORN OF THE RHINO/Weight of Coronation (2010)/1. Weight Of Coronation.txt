Sky watchers with no eyes
Fury of water into the land
It's so deep, the wound
Creeping cancer inside the womb

The girl's the bearer of our fate
Breath my child to live again
The coronation's on the floor
Horns covered with blood

Useless martyrs bear the flag
Let the horses drown in the swamp
The horizon it's almost here
The crown's weight is our defeat

The girl's the bearer of our fate
Breath my child to live again
The coronation's on the floor
Horns covered with blood

You're waiting for a miracle
The numbers you want to see
Turn sixes into sevens
But you can't kiss the crucifix

The girl's the bearer of our fate
Breath my child to live again
The coronation's on the floor
Horns covered with blood
