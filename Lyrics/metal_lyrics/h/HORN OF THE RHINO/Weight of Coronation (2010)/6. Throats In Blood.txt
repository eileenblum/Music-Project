Fire tongues and fever
Black drum load as hell
Unspeakable horror brings us the end

Signs aline
Comes from the sky
The eternal burning eye
Severed crust, melted lives

Long line of crucified
Upon our wound
Long line of crucified
screaming throats
This time silence's forever
Long line of crucified
Long line of crucified

Travel fast
At the speed of light
The eyes of the demigods
Slowly, threshold to be crossed

Prepare to sleep forever
Don't want to wait for the gods
In a circle, throats in blood

Long line of crucified
Upon our wound
Long line of crucified
screaming throats
This time silence's forever
Long line of crucified
Long line of crucified
