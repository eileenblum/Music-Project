Wake the devil
Hymns of failure
With forgotten names
Born with a mark
In the forehead
No saviours no saints

To take the whip away
The time has come
To hit the ground with the crown
The time has come
To spit the venom out
The time has come
To set this world on fire
The time has come

Church of sinners
No forgiveness
No deliverance
Bloodfull rivers
Angry givers
Heads to crucify

To take the whip away
The time has come
To hit the ground with the crown
The time has come
To spit the venom out
The time has come
To set this world on fire
The time has come

Cry
Erase our names
Black
Clouds come in
Scream
Scream once more
God's
Not at home
