Seven snakes
At once coiling in my neck
Bury my hands in the warm heart
Engulfed in red
The thing that cannot be dead
Venom breathing beast, alive!

Free slave
In a black and white hell
Ending with hopes of new left
Free again
A world to incinerate
Brimstone breath, let there be death!

No one dares to watch its eyes without a price
Crushing winter descends to stay forever
Strikes the earth twice, mortal wound, world left to rot
Beast is fear, beast is here, beast arise!
