Hellions, stand up.

We will embrace revenge, at our own expense
and bite (break), the hands of amends that never fed
youâre fucking this up, donât ruin it all for us
you betrayed our trust, we can see
that all our friends are living by your double standards
living in comparison to the pretty and pampered

Black hoods hang from our worn heads
itâs time to tear straight down a fraudulent covenant
wonât take the blame for your mistakes
itâs like that, thereâs no clean slate
eat shit.

HaHa

The rage inside, its still alive
and its calling out and it says
it has to start somewhere
it has to start sometime
what better place than here
what better time than now

It begins here, its begins now

Wonât take the blame for your mistakes
thereâs no clean slate.
