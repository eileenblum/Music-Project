Time is just a measurement
my friends and I are testament to that
fall back, into collective clarity intact
to blur the line between what we think and what we know
young and so reckless
canât take the hours passing so slow.
Before we spin out of control,
we will overindulge
before weâre jaded and old
we will squander our innocence
and we will overcome the cold

So take care my friend,
(donât fray the wires, they may not mend)
we take this for granted until all of this ends
(theres more to this, than what weâve got penned)
the common life, it calls but we wont answer it
'cause we never look so far, we never think too far ahead.
'cause I'm not ready to hang up my youth
it was never preordained for me to grow into a suit
by and by, my friends and I
sing sydney city blues until auroraâs rise
where will I be when my late twenties catch up on me

So take care my friend,
(donât fray the wires, they may not mend)
we take this for granted until all of this ends
(theres more to this, than what weâve got penned)
the common life, it calls but we wont answer it
'cause we never look so far, we never think too far ahead.

Do you believe that we could be truly
free of our fears as long as weâre running?
or will we have to come to terms with this?
with the fact that this could one day turn out purposeless

Do you believe that we could be truly
forever young as long as weâre smiling
time was always just a measurement
so ingest inequity for we are testament

So take care my friend,
(donât fray the wires, they may not mend)
we take this for granted until all of this ends
the common life, it calls but we wont answer it
'cause we never look so far, we never think too far ahead.
