When you drag yourself around
when you look like shit, I know you think about it
the tempest, and when it will hit
if this dependancy were to turn to urgency
if this becomes more than just a thirst this week
I canât come back, I canât bare to see
you fall hard, face down without the ability to speak
youâre fading now, your ashes circle the drain
This isnât it old man, please sit up straight
'Are you coming with me love?'
it wasnât fair to ask, to divide a terminal illness
to multiply the loss
'at long last, my darling Persephone
will you take my hand and remove this harrowing disease from me
Iâm so exhausted, Iâm not sure that the kind of tired I am
can be fixed with rest, but I swear to you, Iâm doing the best I can
With enough of his medication
and a bloodstream full of alcohol
a stomach full of poison, sealed in with Maxalon

21/10/ 91

'I cannot live without your father,
please forgive me my sonâ
and side by side before his very eyes
there they lie, intertwined and
she bid a silent adieu
to a benevolent life and to the world that you knew
three sons and your infant grandchildren will walk beside you,
through that valley, of the shadow of death
I guess that things can never be the same
not with this void running deep in my old manâs veins
it cannot change, itâs plain to see youâre ready to leave
when you heard a voice through the stereo, starting to plead
'hear our song, please just hang on'
sing along to our message to you

'Don't you forget who'll take care of you'
please.
