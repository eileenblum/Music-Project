Spoiled lazy, bored belligerent
a litany of sycophants
revel in embellishment
and no, I ain't living in the dark no more
why live in periphery of war
to circumvent the pending call?

Can you hear us call?
we are crawling right beneath you all

Boycott the lost sheep
haha
abandon the scrap heap
ahah
bring that shit in

Leave your shells and fill the streets
find your feet and learn to speak
the time is now, answer the call
for honesty eludes us, each and all
if you want change then change yourself
rebel against the cards your dealt, haha
if you want peace donât stand defeated ah
donât be one to not learn the world
if you want change then change yourself
donât be the one to rot on the shelf
if you want peace inhale the bitter shot, exhale the bullshit
Hellions, we never call it quits
