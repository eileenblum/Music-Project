Race, rabbit heart race
red wine coursed through vindictive veins
red river, run
help me forget what I have done
and what Iâve yet to do,
everyone Iâll hurt when Iâve seen this through
if I canât cater to the likes of you
whoâre you to dispute armour of valid truth
Seven doors, curtain call
half way around the world Iâve lost it all
each inhibition, all prohibition
thrown to the wind as a nation listens
with their ears to the ground
coveting the forfeit of a crown
that doesnât exist
with their ears to the ground
if you speak of a demon now,
it appears.

All Iâve ever wanted was to believe
before my familyâs eyes are torn from me
Iâm finding it hard to believe
in the things I cannot see
(like I used to) [2x]
like I did

Most days Iâm tracking back in torment
when I remember when
our innocence quelled ignorance
a peripheral indifference
now itâs âfuck that, you made your bedâ
you think I donât regret what I did to them?
I canât take it back and I wonât pretend
but Iâm man enough to have dropped her hands
like Iâd said.

All Iâve ever wanted was to believe
before my familyâs eyes are torn from me
Iâm finding it hard to believe
in the things I cannot see
(like I used to)x3 , like I

I know I fucked up but I was only a kid,
I was too short sighted to see what I did
I destroyed what was left of the little you had
and now nothing can bring it back
