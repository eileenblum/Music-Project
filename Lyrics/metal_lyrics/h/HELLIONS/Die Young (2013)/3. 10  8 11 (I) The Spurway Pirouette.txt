Pour me up a real strong one girl
Iâve got a phantom to forget, so letâs make this hurt.

There may be only one more thing
that you canât take away from me
my stupid sense of honesty
you take for granted consciously
everything you took from me,
with lies and infidelity
Iâm finally free, I finally learned how to breathe
I woke up, 21
to an email I hoped would never come
31 of 365, still young
of all the people you meet
of all the company you keep
he was always there,
right beside you, right in front of me

Remember girl, our open door
a home unlocked to any friend of yours
but you sold us out, yeah you fucked it all up
it took everything I had in me
to set the one that mattered free
just to watch you rot, crawl back and flee, again

So I ran, just like you did
when we were kids

Sometimes, people just change
thereâs no saving face once a mind is made

Granted, once I shut the doors and drew the shades on you
but it doesnât validate the shit you put me through
Iâve heard enough to let go and take control of my life
I loved you, but I know that it wasnât our time

Remember girl, our open door
a home unlocked to any friend of yours
but you sold us out, yeah you fucked it all up
it took everything I had in me
to set the one that mattered free
just to watch you rot, crawl back and flee, again

All is said and done, so just do me this honour
stay faithful to him and be good to your mother
I have every reason to smile
and I lead a life free of spite and denial
Iâm so lucky to have learned so much, so young

Remember girl, our open door
a home unlocked to any friend of yours
but you sold us out, yeah you fucked it all up
it took everything I had in me
to set the one that mattered free
just to watch you rot, crawl back and flee, again
