Breathe, be still, be free
be the anomaly that you deserve to be
bitterness, let it go
for as long as it has you, youâre all alone

Youth exudes, this is how it is
ain't a thing stiff gin and cigarettes cant fix
we are the wild ones,
ain't a thing gonna change
young Hellions, liberated,
taking our place

Hindsight can relieve, but it wont set you free
these contemporary lies, are fucking poisoning me
why should we squander, ever-waning youth
on some pseudo-dogma bullshit that they told us in school

Fall, let go, youâll soar
lead the civil war that they cannot ignore
on hypocrisy, running far and wide
for a youth so crass and desensitized
truth exudes, brother canât you see;
you can be anything youâve ever wanted to be
and to the wild ones;
live at your own pace
for our true enemy has yet to show itâs face

Hindsight can relieve, but it wont set you free
these contemporary lies, are fucking poisoning me
why should we squander, ever-waning youth
on some pseudo-dogma bullshit that they told us in school

All of this, all that Iâve got -
Iâd lay down for my friends

When you choke, brother I stop breathing
and when you fall, you know that I start bleeding out,
beyond all doubt, each day in, each day out
for everything that weâre doing now
is a result of what we did back then
old lessons, reinforced, (again and again) [2x]

We are just specks in time
particles lost in a grand design
we all exist, but so few live
burn out in a brilliant blaze
donât fade into an idle haze
we all exist but so few live

(We are the wild ones
forever free, forever young. ) [2x]
