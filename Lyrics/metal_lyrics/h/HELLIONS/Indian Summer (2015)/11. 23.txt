The world has changed its aspect because I willed it so.
In the infinitude of its scope - I am free to roam, I'm free.
So keep tour wooden world in your sleeve.
And not for anything, should you stop running.
Mother, please forgive me.
Father, listen to me now.
Brother can't you hear the inexorable sound?
The march of time drawing close.
Just like a phalanx of ghosts.
I was eating crow for a good eight months.
Before I found the good sense to regurgitate it all up.
These are still salad days, the rudimentary runs.
And there's not a fucking thing to keep you from what's yet to come.
You're free. So keep your wooden world in your sleeve.
And not for anything should you stop running.
I know a liberation that so many don't.
And I've felt a camaraderie that so many won't.
I believe that the rat race will put ice in your heart.
And I know not to take my dreams for granted.
If I don't want them to fall apart.
(I know hindsight can relieve but it won't set you free. Let it go now, no)
I know a liberation that so many don't.
Just knowing that we'll never run out of road.
Hindsight can relieve but it won't set you free.
These contemporary lies are no longer bothering me.
I'll never squander ever waning youth.
The bullshit doesn't matter because you've always got you.
