In a land, far away from here, a castle stands in the mountains
I was the King of this fortress, but one day,
I was killed by the holy crusaders, and for many years,
My soul has been haunting the castle and the land
And the time to revenge is near

I am the ruler of this land,
So dark and cold are my gloomy skies
My soul against Christians will stand forever,
And Iâll be the King whoâll crush their lies

The dark castle again it must be mine!
My hatred is immortal; madness shines in the depths of my eyes
I shall find the almighty power to crush their skulls and to hear their cries
Merciless I shall stand tall; I will fight to purify my skies
The dark forces I call, as I always did to become strong and wise

I fly over the land!

My dark castle is breathing hatred
Its stones are hurt and its anger is fed
The huge and thick walls are full of secrets,
Thousand yearsâve passed but theyâll never forget
The stairs have seen hundreds of people walking,
But it traps will see the holy ones dying

Revenge is near
Revenge is near

Powers are coming to me!

My hatred is immortal; madness shines in the depths of my eyes
I shall find the almighty power to crush their skulls and to hear their cries
Merciless I shall stand tall; I will fight to purify my skies
The dark forces I call, as I always did to become strong and wise

The holy legions are slowly progressing toward the castle;
Now the time has come to kill them one by one
Storms are throwing lightning through their heart
Rocks are raining and crushing their heads
Swords: invisible but theyâre destroying their shields
Ia!
My soul is at one with the forces of Hell

Darkness is eating their lives!

The ones who succeeded to cross the drawbridge
Thought they were safe, but were awfully wrong
Ancient spirits took their souls into Hell
To make them taste the eternal punishment
Over the land, the battle is raging
For Satanâs victory Iâve started to sing!

It is a victory
An evil victory!

Light has totally disappeared from my skies
The enemies have paid for their lies
Now I am the King again,
And no one shall defy the haunted caste of rising solitude
