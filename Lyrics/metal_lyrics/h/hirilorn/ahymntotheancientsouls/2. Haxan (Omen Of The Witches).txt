Welcome to our world: sorcery,
Omen and damnation
The first time you meet us is the last one;
Remember: escape is to die

Hidden in the Titan Woods;
We live and pray for them
Cursed will be the ones who believe in God,
Our magic will rape their holy soul

Omen of the Witches!

Souls of nature protect our physical life,
We invoke the cursed spirits to help us in our aim;
When the Sabbath begins in the night, incantations,
Spells and screams haunt your mind in the dark
Your sleep is tortured by nightmares that we have created
In the spheres of your unconsciousness

Hidden in the Titan Woods;
We live and pray for them
Cursed will be the ones who believe in God,
Our magic will rape their holy soul

Our heart is dark, blasphemy is in our flesh
We are the daughters of the Unholy Goat
Alone, we fight against all who are weak in mind
Women, whores of the mighty night and her spirit...

Hidden in the Titan Woods;
We live and pray for them
Cursed will be the ones who believe in God,
Our magic will rape their holy soul
