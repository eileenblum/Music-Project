It is in the heart, It is in the veins
Slight little reminder to speak out that death remains
It is the soul, Coming straight out of hell
Lying pale on this deathbed screming through this shell

[Pre-Chorus:]
It is close to midnight
Time to leave the shores
Getting down on my knees
Start screaming, come hail the dark lord

[Chorus:]
Death is coming
Take it in, Spit it out, Feel itÂ´s jaws
Death is coming
Time is closing in
Gotta ride it out for the dark lord

It is in the core, Deep within the soul
So wide awake but now this life is cold
It is in the heart, It is in the veins
Slight little reminder to speak out that death remains
