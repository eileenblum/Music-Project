I close my eyes, itÂ´s a quarter to midnight
IÂ´m losing time, Mr Death is here
This canÂ´t be right, this canÂ´t be my time
Just wait a second, need to befriend my fears

[Chorus:]
It is time to get in
IÂ´ll be free from my sins
Wait a minute, hold on, one last dawn
It is freezing my skin
IÂ´ll be gone with the wind
Come tomorrow, baby - IÂ´ll be gone

IÂ´ve shut you out, this demon is my crime
This little voice that come speaking of death
IÂ´ll write him off, try with a fake rhyme
Just wait a second, need to take one last breath
âNow it reveals itÂ´s hidden side, and now the other
â thus it falls, an autumn leaf.â
(Ryokan, 1831)
