Under the sign of the moon
The creatures come alive, going high on the seventh night
Streets full om misfits, scumbags &amp; fools
DonÂ´t break the oath, donÂ´t break the oath - weÂ´ll slit your throat
Dobermanns howling in league with the wolves
Chained in their fortress - releasing them soon
Vampires &amp; werewolves part of this crew
Oh releasing the nightmare outside

[Chorus:]
Ghouls and goblins
Evil doings and spells
Round midnight

The evil come crawling back from the dead
Releasing their anger and humans are shed
Even them pirates like Blackbeard &amp; Jones
DonÂ´t break the oath, donÂ´t break the oath - weÂ´ll slit your throat

âBattle not with monsters
Lest ye become a monster
And if you gaze into the abyss
The abyss gazes also into youâ
(Friedrich Nietzsche)
