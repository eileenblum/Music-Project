I slay the beast within &amp; choke itÂ´s servant
I take one on the chin just to hit back harder
So tired, so tired - of this constant madness
These fears inside, just couldnÂ´t care less

[Chorus:]
Crush the worlds and the wars and within...
These weary eyes are just tired of sin
Alienate before you choke my last breath
This hole is the ocean of death

I scream for help to kill the fear, but...
No-one can see, no-one can hear - no one can feel them
These little ghosts, theyÂ´re in my mind &amp; in my dreams but...
When I wake up theyÂ´re all gone until the evening
