WeÂ´ll keep on rocking til the sun goes to moonlight
So damn strong weÂ´ll survive a catfight
WeÂ´re the devilÂ´s pride, singing his song
With an awesome ride
WeÂ´ll keep on fucking this up til the last fight
Downtuned and ugly but so right
No fame, never divine
Pure rock n roll with an awesome shine

[Chorus:]
Rocking free forever on
I do believe when you feel, when you see
Oh when youÂ´re dreaming
ThereÂ´s magic in these words
Underneath, the battleÂ´s on
Climbing high and reaching up to the ceiling
The beat goes on to be heard

So youÂ´re up for a dance in the moonlight
Swinging hips, delivering so tight
At the devils side, doing the steps
with an awesome pride
YouÂ´ll keep on fucking this up til the last night
In the end youÂ´ll survive the big fight
No shame, always on time
Pure rock n roll delivered with pride
