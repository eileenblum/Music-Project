Nineteen sixty seven, not really spawn from heaven
Mean machine, so much of a wet dream
Burst out of flames, eight cylinder games
Itching my skin, like that leather &amp; gin

[Chorus:]
Goldclad firebird, roadking of the black flame ring
Send mighty roars unto the sky
Listen up, you might be heard
Being blessed with the devils wings
Come along and ride with me tonight

Raised in Ohio, or maybe California?
Bandit was riding, Smokey on the corner
Hardcore in driving, lightning a fuse
LightÂ´s out, gotta play me some blues
