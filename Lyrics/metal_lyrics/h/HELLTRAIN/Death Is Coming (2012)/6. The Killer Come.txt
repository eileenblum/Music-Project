Itâs been a long time since rock n roll
Itâs been a long time since the Rolling Stones
Come hear that rock n roll guitar screaming wild on the radio
âLord Almighty, feel my temperature risingâ
Tupelo, Missisippi where the king was born
Come hear some boogie woogie rolling out over the piano

[Chorus:]
Iâm one, Iâm two and the killer come
(I wanna do what ainât been done)
Watch them last rays of the sun
These sleepy eyes have seen it all
Iâll set my sails...
Iâll watch the dawn, when light is shun
Take that last life with this gun
How man has failed...

Itâs been a long time since the New Orleans
Way back up on the woods among the evergreens
We heard some riffing going wild, screaming out on the radio
And in the 70-ties we sold our souls
The later years were just craving for more
Them devil tunes are playing high all over the stereo
