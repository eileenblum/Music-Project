Walking down this deadly aisle, 
â¨clutching the last gasp of life.
â¨Taking this 666 for a deadly ride, 
â¨in this hour thereÂ´s nothing but night.
Within these walls the dead come to speak to meâ¨, 
I am of an inhuman breedâ¨.
So IÂ´ve been lurking, doing the darker deeds, â¨
down in the shadows below.

[Chorus:] 
â¨Late at night and youÂ´re safe &amp; sound, 
â¨meet Mr. Cooger as he haunts the groundâ¨. 
TyrantÂ´s sleep where no demons go. â¨
Here goes Mr. Cooger to come reap and sow.

Strolling through the park aliveâ¨, 
no Mr. Cooger in sightâ¨.
Your restless eyes they close for a whileâ¨, 
Cooger comes firing his knife.
Iâve been lurking, waiting for darker deedsâ¨, 
deep in the shadows below.

[Chorus:] 
â¨Late at night and youÂ´re safe &amp; sound, 
â¨meet Mr. Cooger as he haunts the groundâ¨. 
TyrantÂ´s sleep where no demons go. â¨
Here goes Mr. Cooger to come reap and sow.

When thereÂ´s no more room in hell â the dead will walk the earth.

[Chorus:] 
â¨Late at night and youÂ´re safe &amp; sound, 
â¨meet Mr. Cooger as he haunts the groundâ¨. 
TyrantÂ´s sleep where no demons go. 
â¨Here goes Mr. Cooger to come reap and sow.
