Crushing &amp; thrashing, all around bashing 
Setting time-bombs on the ground 
Pounding, grounding - war heads sounding 
The mighty Juggernaut arriving to town 
Foul sights dreaming, horrified screaming 
Bombastic sounds to this venomous bloodhound 
LightÂ´s out - bring Â´em your dead 
The mighty Juggernaut arriving to town 

[Chorus:]
Through the fire &amp; the flames 
Living death through history 
Riding high where the fire still burns 
An army made of steel 
Running through the maze 
December now, itÂ´s colder days 
Living high where the sunset turns 
Where the Juggernaut earns 

Plain sheer terror, computerized, no error 
Shooting missiles with an infinite range 
Ghost invader, looks like from the 80-ties 
Fucked up creature with a violent way
