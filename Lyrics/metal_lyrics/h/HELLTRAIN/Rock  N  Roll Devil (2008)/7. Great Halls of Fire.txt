gotta do what it takesto become the hellhoundsend that package of badass blitzdown your fucking spineyou've gotta know gotta flowto sing sing sing sing hi hoget a piece of the actiona little attraction it's friday night so you're bitter and your life is a boreyou'd better get up goin' twist a little more take a swing wanna sing wanna danceput on hold, it's so cold am i getting old ?i'll write a summer song in pure desperationi'm looking out and the train has left the station do you know what it takesto pass by unsound?it's like livin' the wind's life somehowdo you really wanna do that now?but i don't want i don't huntthat damned damned damned cold ridei want heat i want beati want to sin in my life turning left turning left turning righti am ease i am sleaze a bit of dynamiteso i was told that seeing is believin'well i don't know but i haven't got this feeling
