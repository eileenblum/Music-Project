born on the bayoutrue country hillbilly stylei come ride to see youtwo bags of booze it's a couple of milesdon't keep me waitin'i'll be dancin' all night longain't hesistatingtwisting and turning doing a beer bong step up do the punk rock waltz gotta run gotta dance gotta kick and hiti'll make you stumble 'cause i'm doin' this shitdon't get me wrong it's a song it's a rhymei'll keep you rockin' 'cause i am the misfit born on hertz islandin true black metal stylenever listened  to venomjust some motley crue and w.a.s.p. in a whilestarted out doin' punk rocknow we're back in the beatshould i do it like blackie?chainsaw supporer and throw in some raw meat
