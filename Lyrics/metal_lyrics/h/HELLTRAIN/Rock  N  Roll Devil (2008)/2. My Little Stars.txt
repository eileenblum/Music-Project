my little stars while you're sleepin' i watch you growi'd love to keep you but i know i have to let you gowhen you're cryin' i dry your eyesi love your laughter the smile in your face when dawn arise when i close my eyes and rest my facewhen time has come to go and leave this placei'll be standing proud in front of who you are i love you all my little stars when you're smiling i feel hopei hope you feel it too and know i love you someeting up again is wonderful you know
