an everlasting night and angels out of sightthe soulless are gathered for a feastchains can be heard dragged on the streetno one dares to go out this is the city god forgot to savethe place where the sun never shinessins are on the menu for eternal timefor those already damned ghouls plunder graves tonightthe grim reaper's thirsty for human life a whispering fog lies thick on the groundembracing the life of those who sinif you dare to go out and walk among the deadthirsty for people of the light the sound of howling wolves echoes through the nightwaking up the ghosts of the cursedreflections of what's waiting on the other side of lifea mirror of a void filled with dirt
