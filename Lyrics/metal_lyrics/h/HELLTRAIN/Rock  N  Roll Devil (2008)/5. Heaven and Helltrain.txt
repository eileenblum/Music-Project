speaking of tells between heaven and helli have a demon in my foreheadwhen damage is done i am the seventh sonfeeling like the living deadi'm going out on a cold december nightspreading out the evil seedif you're doing it right black will turn to whitemetal might is all you need i cout the lases the beast is tornthe devil in me will reap what's sowngoin' straight down the white linei walk the devil's pathi can see it clear now so close to the gatesi am one with dakness and hel lawaitsgoin' straight down the white linei walk the left hand path speaking of saints while we dry out the painta pentagram is on my backlike a monkey to speak and you listen to priests?do you really think that god is fat?i was left out the can well i'm the boogie mando you dare to do the beat?i never listened to priest though it seems like a feasthere we go and off the heat i don't speak of the deviloh it's the devil that speaks to me
