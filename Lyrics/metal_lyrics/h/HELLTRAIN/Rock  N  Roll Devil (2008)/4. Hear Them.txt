leave it out out of nowhere right?i hear them bitchin' i just don't wanna fightand i don't wanna go feelin'that i just might leave itand i'm one i'm two you're rightwe're like a motorhead of speed we're up for fightsand we bring that feelingof that rock' n' roll dreaming we're so close i can hear them breathingit's like i feel that i don't belongand when it's done i can hear them screamingoh this night it seems so longthey're out of turn i can see them fallingit's like a dream that i had for longand when they drop i would love to catch themspit them out and kill 'em all suck it in suck it in suck it outwe're goin' nowhere so you better just stop and shoutand we're out there screamin'doin' hell signs to the dugout beatin'and i'm this i'm this you are thatwe bring that rockin' off the damned black wizard's hatyou've gotta stop that whinin'do this tune it's a fume that's rhymin' i am one i am two you're rightit's like a fucking motorhead of speedand we bring that feelingjust kill 'em all
