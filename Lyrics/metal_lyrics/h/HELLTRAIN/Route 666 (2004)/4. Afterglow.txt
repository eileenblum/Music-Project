I lie awake while the gods are sleeping, I trust in death as the only real thing
I denied god two times and twenty years ago, I believe in things you never want to know

[Pre-Chorus:]
There's no such thing as heaven. I'd rather go with the flow

[Chorus:]
Gotta go, gotta sing the songs I know, to keep it rhyme along in the afterglow
What do you feel? If it's pain well then life is for real

I hit em hard, I've never once tried the other cheek
Regrets? We'll those I'll keep for the eternal sleep
Not once in a lifefime have I thought about it twice
Who am I to speak if I don't differ from the mice?
