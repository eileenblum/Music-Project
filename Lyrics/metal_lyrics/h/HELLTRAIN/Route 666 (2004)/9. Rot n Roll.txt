There's a circle of claws and a sharks shaped jaws
Go for the kill before paying the bill
You'd better watch your back - wear the wizard's hat
It's coming up fat - the rot n roll attack

[Pre-chorus:]
Oh hey - feel it squeezing all your bones
Hell yeah - feel it pissing right down your fucking throat

[Chorus:]
I am all evil, vicious and old - I've laid down my soul to the gods rot n roll

A million ways or so they say
You're going down - the king has lost his crown
Step in the ring, we're the knockout kings
So fucking THAT, the rot n roll attack
