I'd better step into my boots - keep shocking, a box of red wine keeps my head up rocking
A big pack of kicks and I'll go again

You'd better start to wake up baby, a few more miles and then we'll maybe...
See the shores that we call our home again

[Pre-chorus:]
Do you dare to call the sins of a tifetime? S.O.S - you've got to gamble to win

[Chorus:]
It's a time warp, feel it on the sidewalk, it's a sin, it's a second of skin
It's a time warp, feel it on the sidewalk, s.o.s - you've got to gamble to win

I'd better run away from home - keep rocking, like the soldier on his own
So fucking arrogant to ask for death again

It's like running with a gun, sleep safely, going out there on my own, honestly...
Does any of this make fucking sense?
