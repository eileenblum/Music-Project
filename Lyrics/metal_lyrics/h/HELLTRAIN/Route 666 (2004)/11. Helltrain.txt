Moonlight and the wheels keep turning, moonlight and all lost souls burning
Hell high, just keep cruising on, I've got a ticket to ride

Light's out, there's a spooky voice, light's out, for the devils choice
Hell high...

[Chorus:]
I'm on the helltrain now, all night long
Where the devil dance and I sing his song
A ticket stamped, a lit rocket ramp
A one way road to hell

No time to recall your ticket
Gotta ride with all them wicked
End line - first class choice
Gotta listen to the devils voice
