Damage done and the seventh son, holy hell we are sleepless
Comatose red in the serpent's bed, hell we are dying in fever

Dinner's served on silver plates, one last gasp of freedom
Before going out to kill the snake, in search of holy kingdoms

[Pre-chorus:]
What do you want from me? A life of peace and harmony?
I just wanna rage and all, a hundred years and then I'll go

[Chorus:]
Come close and watch the downfall, like pigs in filth we crawl
Living life tied up in chains, prayers, morals, stupid games

One last call to the mighty halls of sanity and wisdom
One last kiss and then we'll miss, these times of freedom
