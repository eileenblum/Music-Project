There's this southern snake, 50 feet and heavy as hate
Long time gone for man to see, true devil's servant, kill you and me

[Pre-chorus:]
I'm the venom in your bones, like a rusty trigger
King-sized, heavy and all

[Chorus:]
Down the drain man - ain't no king or queen
Just the devil and his serpent - do you know what it means?
And it's long to fall - no depth at it all
Down the drain man - like you and me

There's this killing machine, bullets/guns - slaughter and mean
A Laughter away, one more, the clown won't stay
Ruling on the fucking kings highway
