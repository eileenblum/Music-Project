We're in a state without action, now these kids want some satisfaction
Wanna keep on rocking all night long, having some fun, breaking some bones

Fat fucks with pay checks like 15, keep on catering like filthy crows
No wonder kids come messing all night long, having some fun, breaking some bones

[Chorus:]
Eins zwei - eins zwei - Don't mess with Polizei
Eins zwei - eins zwei - We wanna hit them high
Kids come messing with bricks and stones
We're armed with guns and we'll make up some holes

Where to fight if not back on the streets? Yeah - like some fucks would listen to me?
Hey - now the cops come watchin', doin' the deeds - reddening some skin
