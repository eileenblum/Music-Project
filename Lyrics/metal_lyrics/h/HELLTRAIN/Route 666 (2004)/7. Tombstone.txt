Slowly wake to face another day
Hell, I can't escape
Can someone tell me what is going on?
Working for pennies, singing a song

[Chorus:]
Like in wasteland
Eyes cold dead buried and gone
And i don't want it
No more than moving to Tombstone

Someone told me only death is real
Well...what the fuck do I feel?
Like this would be a fairytale?
This life is fucked-up, can you tell?
