Sovereign and subtle sources of souls
Planets mightily merge in one vacuity
A distant dream from afar arises, arises by the sea

Untouched by immense unlight to be
Life flows across in aeons of human self-conceit

Call me the devil, call to arms darkest one
To be your voice in the dark
Call me your horror, call me to crave
when your heaven is torn apart

Untouched but seen by those yet unseen
Light flows across for aeons in spectral self-conceit

Call me the devil, call me the flame, call me when your heaven is torn apart

Oh blackest aeon â evaluated force
Holy mother, dreadful creature â be the reason for all cause
Sing for me rightful father â marrow of the soul
Sacred seal of iniquity open up, open up thy womb

Severed souls, take me to the netherworld
where sacred souls take you down inside
This blood guilt incurred by communion
casts down the flame of hate to one

Untouched by immense unlight to be
Life flows across in aeons of shallow hearted self-conceit

I see you burn in rousing fire

What came from the water must be drowned in the sea
