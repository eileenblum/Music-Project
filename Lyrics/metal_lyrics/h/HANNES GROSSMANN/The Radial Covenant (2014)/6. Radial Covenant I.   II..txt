[I.]

From now and beyond
beyond this world, beyond the sun
One soul shall become
the magma of radial dust

By leaps of time steep unsound
a dimension opens up and closes down
beyond this world, beyond the sun
(lies) our bodies' overflow
multidimensional

Truth lies behind the portal of three
Cast down your mortal being,
become the all and everything

Slice time like spirals
Taste the lips of immortality
Become spectral beings
become the all and everything

By leaps of time steep unsound
temporary monuments held unbound

Create a universe abysmal and wide
with no such place like heaven in sight
Create a universe abysmal and wide
with no such place like heaven in sight

Slice time like spirals
transform in all eternity
Embrace this alien euphony

For time is non-linear
and death is merely a portal
the end means just revival of it all

For I am the masked messiah
spiral dust and black light conspire
once I fall through the sea of lies
my soul shall arise from eternal hellfire

Drowned by quantum gravity
Reborn a soulful entity
originates

[II.]

Fresh from the origin it elevates
sent by the oceans of time
Like a harlot's disappearing
rapid, unconscious - human kind

High and higher
Fly above us
Seed hope like orchids
on a grave

By reversing all physics
This grain of a soul is sent back into you

Back through the portal of three
you give birth to a new entity

My soul is a naked figure of old
but my mind's eyes revolt

From now and beyond
beyond this world, beyond the sun
One soul shall become
the magma of our life's reward

Devise a life abysmal and wide
Create your heaven deep inside
Devise a life abysmal and wide
with no such place like hell in sight
