Step through the stars and stare into your dreams
Slip into the sun and starve into mortality

Lock down the one perception of creed
The stars' shining duration a single soul exceeds

Step through the stars, step through the gate
Step into the sun and kiss your god awake
Step through the stars and stare into your dreams
Through the sun, into infinity

Lock down the one duration of oscillation
Read burning fire as you grow higher
Become solar cell fire


Step through the stars and stare into your dreams
Slip into the sun and starve into you
