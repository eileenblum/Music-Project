Gazin' into the depths of night,
A pale,dark sight with howling winds,
Like a callin' from a dead past
hunted by oblivious voice

Wherever I go I see your face,
So beautiful, So cold
Searching for an escape; A cosmos without you
Never to be found ,nor I would like !

The wind torn,like my heart
Burning with deep sorrow
Casting the delight away
For me to embed
The oblivion within me

"Why do you keep holding your memories ?
Why can't you just forget ?!"

"Am I to forget what once was mine ?!
Am I to forget my sweetest sorrow?
You made your choice,
Soon I'll make mine"

Like the wood burns,
My soul is burning,never to be extinguished
Like ashes fade with the wind,
I'll soon fade with time,
But your memory will never fade...
