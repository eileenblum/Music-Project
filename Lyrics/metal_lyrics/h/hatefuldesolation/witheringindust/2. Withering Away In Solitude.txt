Deep in the heart of night,
Where silence reign
As the light slowly pass away...
Underneath the oppressive moonlight
where coldness is the true ruler...

you are your hate,you are a lie ! 
you never have existed,you never have succeeded
Shatter before the final ray of your fragile existence has decayed...

Damned in the everlasting vortex of complex
Breathing without knowing weather you are in reality or dreaming.
Drowning in the vast abyss of disillusions &amp; failures

Withering away in the utter obscurity,
There will be none to witness your downfall
as darkness slowly enshrine your soul
your mental sanity will slowly fall 
into the obscured plains of sorrow.
In the abysmal depths of isolation.
watching your decay,
your world is falling

Withering away in this hell of your own
