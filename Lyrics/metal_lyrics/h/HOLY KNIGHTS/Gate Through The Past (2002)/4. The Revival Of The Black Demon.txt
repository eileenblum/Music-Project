The warmth of an eternal sleep, of an intrepid horseman,
Makes mystical and magic the legend which tells his exploit.
Once when peace and love reigned together,
A legend tells that a black demon rose again from a charm,
That forced him to fall in damned abyss,
To come back and reign in eternal chaos!
Only the most valorous knight coming from the past
To a new life, will fight once again
The demon and cast him into hell.
