Just here stand all the valorous tonight
Sitting all around a magic table round
Brave men comes to Arthur's court
Hoping to be chosen as members court

They're telling about their trips and adventures
Revelation of force bravery and honour
Brave men had fighted face to face
But no one will see a new dawn of peace

Only the chosen one will find the Holy Grail
Only misery and pain for who will fail
Only the chosen one will find the Holy Grail
No one will come back to sit at the round table again
