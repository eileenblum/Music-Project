In a waste land once beauty and spell
A demon, sovereign from hell.
He's coming to be a new fearful king
In the name of the sins he will be.
His dark power reigns over all the lands,
Suffer and pain once again
Rivers of blood fire and steel Chaos forever will be?
The scream of the soul are calling the lord
From the sky to the land to take revenge
A thunder in the air a new judgement day
The good and evil fight again.

Mystical knight what have you done to win your fear...
Alone above echoes of sword come near... but you...
You hear the howls of your child, so face the real.
A gate through the past, your fighting spirit comes here.

A new war begins, the clash of two kings
The echoes of war ride the wind
The good on one hand, the evil on the other
Neverending bloodshed on the lands.

Mystical knight what have you done to win your fear...
Alone above echoes of sword come near... but you...
You hear the howls of your child, so face the real.
A gate through the past, your fighting spirit comes here.

The fight's at the end the good wins again
The demon will fall into the hell
Wherever the peace and love will be killed
The knights will revive from their sleep.

Mystical knight what have you done to win your fear...
Alone above echoes of sword come near... but you...
You hear the howls of your child, so face the real.
A gate through the past, your fighting spirit comes here.
