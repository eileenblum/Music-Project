In a dark forest lives who has no awe
A wild and brave man rides sad and alone
He'll fly up one day to a new life
He does not when his value will rides around the world

Your destiny you must to find
So chase the dragons to fear no immortal man

Your fate is sealed you've got to find it
Ride to places where nobody's been before

Why...? I...?

[Chorus:]

Percival, Sir Percival, you're the world master Percival, Sir Percival, immortal knight

You are the only warrior, brave and valiant
Grasp your sword, be the only, forget the pain...

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
You feel so tired, you feel so drained

You must gain your end fighting for your land You've wasted your youngness and your life for a holy quest...

Why...? I...?

[Chorus:]

Percival, Sir Percival, you're the world master Percival, Sir Percival, immortal knight

You are the only warrior, brave and valiant
Grasp your sword, be the only, forget the pain...

Percival, Sir Percival...

Percival, Sir Percival...

You are the only warrior...

Grasp your sword, be the only...
