He was called salvation
Of his land and his inhabitants
But the cruel king Haaron
Abducted his wife to spur him
He'll have to confront a bloody fight...

On his breast he brought his knight's cross
Now it's time to unsheate your sword
On your house all your courage
Now become angel of bloody death
You're the one so don't draw back..

Fear in your mmd
Like an eagle you're hunter no win
Nevermore you'll ride away.. oh.
Fear in your mind
Like an eagle you're hunter no win
Nevermore you'll ride away.. oh...

"What a cruel destiny to save my love
And it seems like my mind
running around a strange light.
So I'll live forever
I hope together
With my always shining star".

Now you're back, but what happened here
"Cruel king hasty homicide"!
Unsheathing your sword against god-cross
You sentenced to death of your humanity
Warrior of darkness you'1l die!

Fear in your mind
Like an eagle you're hunter no win
Nevermore you'll ride away. . oh...
Fear in your mmd
Like an eagle you're hunter no win
Nevermore you'll ride away.. oh..
