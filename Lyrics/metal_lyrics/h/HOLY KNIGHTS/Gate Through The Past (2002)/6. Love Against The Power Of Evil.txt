Proud on the horse blindig in his shining suite of armour
The night came back victorius from the dangerous battle

An adverse fate expected him while he was coming back to the castle
When he arrived there the first rays of the star lighted the castle

But no ray could wake his beloved 'cause victim of a spell
Of the evil witch coming from the land of dark valley

[Rit:]

Go warlike in love -
Run to find the antidote before it's too late
Go warlike in love -
By your bravery results her terrible fate
Go winner warlike -
Your winged horse knows of the unhappy mischance
Go triunphant warlike -
Cross marshes, destroy the mystical spell

Now you have found the magic draught come back she is waiting for suffering
Remember to stay far from the black and dark valley

The enchanted lake could be the only refreshment place
And the night goes down and runs around the angelic nights creatures

Now your trip is at the end your beloved you've saved ones more
And her eyes lights up with a sweet smile of a shining sun

Go warlike in love -
Run to find the antidote before it's too late
Go warlike in love -
By your bravery results her terrible fate
Go winner warlike -
Your winged horse knows of the unhappy mischance
Go triunphant warlike -
Cross marshes, destroy the mystical spell
