Into the sea of life, you can hear now wind blows tonight
I can't feel now the reason of our living
I dream tonight what I'll leave of my life
Wind blows tonight through this heart

Wisdom is what I searched to defeat my fears
And find the way of life
What I see are only traps for my mind
Delusions for my soul

There's no chance to come back for me
I must go to goal
There's no one have the answers for me
I am going slightly mad

And so now it seems like a wall was created
I'm feel so alone
No cry to cheer me up, something is changing inside me

Now I dream to fly high through the skyline
Cover my blind eyes, running to be free
'Cause wisdom can break any wall

Everyone can change one's fate
i was the maker of my anguishes
No, I don't want still to look back
Sleeping like in a torture bed

Finally it seems like the wall was destroyed
I feel so brave
No cry to cheer up, something is changing inside me

Now I dream to fly high through the skyline
Cover my blind eyes, running to be free
'Cause wisdom can break any wall

Found the meaning of mistery
To award a frozen paradise
The man who stands before you
Wants you to keep the promise you made
Why do we suffer so just in vain
Every holy soul had just lived one's better day
