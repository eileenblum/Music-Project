Leave my mind, i pray all times... with my hands
All the things inside my head
Are screaming cause my soul
Leaved my secret far from God believers
Runs from winter's fire to be free
Life in not enough for this my soul
it leaves the warm of star
Leaved my fear of darkness in my pocket
Leaved the only way to the sun
Life is not the way that choose my soul
Darkness I want alone

What will be my mistery, a story never wrote
You think that all around
Their screams want damn your mind
Life is a mistery, a story never wrote
You think that all around
Their screams want damn your mind

Since 1941 men believers
Lived a fear that eyes will not see
Mistery is something that you know
Sleep in you all life long

Only ray of light can hit this sleepers
Mistery is time to be real
Open wide your eyes but faith in God
Leave you, now you're alone

What will be my mistery, a story never wrote
You think that all around
Their screams want damn your mind
Life is a mistery, a story never wrote

(So I pray all time)
Leave me tonight I'll come back through the skies
You're still in my mind

What will be my mistery, a story never wrote
You think that all around
Their screams want damn your mind
Life is a mistery, a story never wrote
