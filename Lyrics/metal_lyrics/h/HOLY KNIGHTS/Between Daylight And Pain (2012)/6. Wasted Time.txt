Is it all wasted time for us?
The illusion of choosing to live between daylight and pain

Be creators of their lives
Is very hard for all those who live the life today

Our mind is looking at the future and past
The present is calling
And while we're crying another day is gone

Oh... if you could see

Maybe we're wondering
Simply to be heard

I close my eyes and find a way to write a new story
Is there still time for me and you?
I'll never give up because we have dreamed together

So I need to take care of my future
Share my life with you if I don't understand which way to go
I don't have very precise outlines
I'm like the water, I become what is useful to be

I close my eyes and find a way to write a new story
Is there still time for me and you?
I'll never give up because we have dreamed together

Look into my eyes, have you ever tried?
What you feel inside?
My bleeding heart can feel the pain
Why am I going down?
We have yet to learn...

I close my eyes and find a way to write a new story
Is there still time for me and you?
I'll never give up... I'll change all the rules
