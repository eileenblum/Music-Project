I have long been a sailor of the sea
But my slowness was not good for my heart
Something was wrong, I felt tired
I slept while my ship across the seas
No crying during my search of my life
Only sadness and anguish within me
I felt like a superstar
But over time I realized my misery

If you are a warrior you will realize
If the wind blows on your side
To be a warrior you must treat
Yourself to have the strength and to fly high

I tried to explain those feelings to myself
To try not to waste my whole life
I spent all my time looking
Away from me what I had inside
No crying during the search of my life
Only sadness and anguish within me
I felt like a superstar, but over time
i realized my misery

If you are a warrior you will realize
If the wind blows on your side
To be a warrior you must treat
Yourself to have the strength and to fly high

The wind blows, I'll be alone with me
I'll go beyond the mist

I will go down deep inside of me
To bring new ideas at my mind
And learn to look at the stars
That hide the truth to believe

If you live in the heavens you know the rules of life
To rejoin the beauty of the stars again
On and on
