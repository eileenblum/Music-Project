I feel this ocean of blindness and madness
I can not blame anyone...else myself
I'm feeling out of place like love in a blue day
Can we decide to cross out this big haze?

We kill the emotions just because we're afraid that our fragile heart
Could become slave of too much pain
Too busy to analyze this life...

We think we're enemies
Mankind can make this true
But our spirits will raise to light the route

One day this prophecy
Will happen to unite all the truth
The meaning of life 'll be clear

We kill the emotions because we're afraid that our fragile heart
Could become slave of too much pain
Too busy to analyze this life...

I'm spending all my life
Hoping that the angels will fall down to make me free
When the light will make clear our soul
To make clear our soul
We'll be awake

We'll find a new energy
To fly away to a new world
It seems like to aspire at a reborn

One day this prophecy
Will happen to unite all the truth
The meaning of life 'll be clear

We kill the emotions because we're afraid that our fragile heart
Could become slave of too much pain
Too busy to analyze this life...
We kill the emotions because we're afraid that our fragile heart
Could become slave of too much pain
Too busy to analyze this life...

When the light will make clear our soul
Make clear our soul
Where the truth will rules
