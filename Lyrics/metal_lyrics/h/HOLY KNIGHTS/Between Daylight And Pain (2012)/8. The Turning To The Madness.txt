We'll fly up together, like a white dove for ever
The wise man prays so that the sun rises every day

We will pray together, for the same right reasons
Freedom will break our chains through the wings of life

How long do I've to remember?
I'm sure I've tried deleting all bonds
To go beyond the veil and discover the true shape of things

The turning to the madness...
A look into the darkness...
The flame of creation...

Oh, now you do not know what is your inspiration?
Be guided by the stars
They know more than you

All feelings of hatred remain
And obscure the beauty of the night
That becomes black, red, gray
Just like my heart
