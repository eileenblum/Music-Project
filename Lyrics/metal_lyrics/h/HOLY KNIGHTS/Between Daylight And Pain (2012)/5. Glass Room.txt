Inside my glass room
Can't see my demon and I feel so alone
The justice will ride tonight but
Will you remember that...

We're fighting
We'll die for
We breathe we grasp our "True's sword"

Win your freedom your last fight is just began
The time for fight IS just...
The fight is just began

No! But I won't tell you about a doom
Make of blood...
Where my justice ride alone
We all make a better world
If only we think before to say
...another hatred words
Then we'll see shining our soul!
