And it did
(Just like it always does)

I'll walk home tonite
To stay out of sight from myself
Because I'm not feeling right

All good things must come
To an end, so lets stop
So abrupt

Since May third left and came
I've held my head in shame
I think I breathe
To never breathe again

And I can see, the train
Has come to a halt
And once again
I'll be departing on my own

But I'll sit
At the station
Maybe for awhile
'Cause it'll all be worth it
To see you one last time

I guess I'll try to forget you
But I never fucking will
Sorry to disappoint you
But I never stood a chance
You took the life from me
