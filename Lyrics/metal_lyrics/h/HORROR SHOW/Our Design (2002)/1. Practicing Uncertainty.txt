On the third
The month of May
Saw eye to eye
Took my breathe away

I stumbled on your every word
The sweetest voice ive ever heard
When you pulled me in so close to you

I lost myself

Nose to nose
Our eyes were closed
I snuck a peek
I couldn't help
I can't help
Falling for you

What the fuck am I to do

Take it slow
Is this the one
Or a good time
Well wheres the fun

I guess I'll give it a shot
I'm stuck with you and I'm so scared
I'm stuck to you and I dont care
(But I'm sure I will)
