Friends came and went
They always have
Some at my side
They never left the fights

The drinks, the youth
They've passed
Still in my heart
Always thinking back

Reminicse the arguments
The innocence days grew cold
They always do

Stay gold

I'll see you soon
They've gone but not for long
This is my ode

To the kids, who fought side by side
To the kids, who would talk and stay up all night
To the kids, who made up our lives
To the kids, who fought and lost to time

I'll see you soon
