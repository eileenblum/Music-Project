Stuck again, nowhere to go
I've made my choice now
I'm out of roads now I guess
Time passed me by
Much to fast too realize
That everything comes back to haunt
Changing lines you thought you knew
Erasing pictures that you drew
Maybe I was meant to be nothing
Maybe I will never be
Somebody's everything
I would try but it's too
Late to fucking start
Not another sad song
Just words from my heart
I get knocked down and I'm tired
And I dont want to get back up
It's a bit discouraging knowing
You never gave a fuck
Stuck again
