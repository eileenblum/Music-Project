With wondering eyes of blue
She turns to me
To tell me sweet nothings

And that's what they were worth
I'd cut myself, into peices, for her
Ready to give, all I can give
On your mark, just to, show her my heart
Still beating and bleeding from
The last time, that she, tore me apart

Why won't you let up

I'm taking it back
Bearly alive
Bearly able to breath
Just enough to whisper goodbye

I can't afford one more try
On your sleeve, my heart will die

Watering eyes and choking speech
Look at what youve done to me
A beating heart is only worth so much
A bleeding heart, from your, careless touch

With wondering eyes of blue

She turns to whisper sweet nothings
The smile on your lips
And the worth of words
That may have been true

With wondering eyes of blue

She turns to whisper sweet nothings
But in the end
All along were always meant for you
