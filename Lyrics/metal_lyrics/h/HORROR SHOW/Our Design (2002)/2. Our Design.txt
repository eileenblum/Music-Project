Watery eyes drawn to themselves
A beauty that was being built
Like a highrise set
In a vast nothing
Alone, just me and you
I felt so scared
And felt so numb
From injections of no guilt
Just small stab wounds
To draw a blood
To sign and close our deal
Hoping we are not a world apart
Kissed my neck
I gasped you stole my heart
A task obtained by you too easily
I packed my bags decided I would stay
(Knowing this all goes away)
I didnt even want to
Take the chance because
Could all only get worse
But I couldn'tve stopped even
Knowing in advance that
This could all only get worse
