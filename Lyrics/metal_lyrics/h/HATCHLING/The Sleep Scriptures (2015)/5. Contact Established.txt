Waking, enveloped in the recess of a curious sphere.
Glossy and translucent.
Reaching my hand out slowly,
Pressing against the surface
At last, my deliverance...
A fissure in the cortex...

Possessing gelatinous properties

Breaching its husk

An expanse, unprecedented, glorious and foreign.
All supposed logic and explanation, defied.

Clearly indicating our ideas of solitude in this domain were foolish and conceited,
I am once again ashamed of my relation
With the pseudo-sapient bane of all other concurrent life.

Monolithic structures surrounded by unknown organisms.

...And beckoned by alien dialect.

Humbled by their presence,
Baffled by their artistry.
Etched in ancient stone,
Aligned in formation, precise and with purpose.
Remembering my origin, contact established.
