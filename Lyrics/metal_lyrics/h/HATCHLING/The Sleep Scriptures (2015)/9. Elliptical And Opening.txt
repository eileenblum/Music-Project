Blossoming creation of chemical reaction,
Equa-distant in radius from one's...
Ancestral descent in the grand circle of life.
Advancing identically in the scheme of time.
...Until the direction of said circle is diverted.
Elliptical and opening, I see behind the curtain.

Violet, pulsating elegance captivating,
Fluorescent capsule glistening.
Encased in glass. Tethered by cords.
Despite valiant effort, I haven't much time.
My preservation is indefinite.
I slowly reveal the whites of my eyes,
Frailty detected.

An inclination so completely resolute.
Slowly migrating
Into my destitution.

Remembering
Life, astonishing---Rich with bold color---
Each splash of water, every drop unique.
Endless meadows of green,
Specific strands of grass chosen with no two identical blades ever to be found here.

Status
Declining. Convulsing frantically.
Insect - akin sporadic movements.
Imply my conclusion must be near.
Release the neck's tension, I lay my head back to die.

Supported by my own body's buoyancy,
I float within semi-liquid glop,
Inside the vacuole of foreversleep.
Black. Cold. Pulsating.

A knot in the throat and a grit of the teeth, a massive, abundant endorphin release.
Will I dream or will thought cease?
This is it. I've waited my entire life for this very moment.
To feel nothing. To be nothing. To be removed from the ellipse... perchance to begin again.
