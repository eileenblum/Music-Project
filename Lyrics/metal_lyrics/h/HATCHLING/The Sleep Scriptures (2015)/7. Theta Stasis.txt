Rapid eye movement

Void of sensitivity, I have become one with all elemental singularity.
All is tranquil and serene in my lucid stasis.
In astral, new-found nature, I am awakening.

My aura shining, glowing radiantly.
Physically blinding, though no less enticing.
Severing my sight, yet I retain vision.
Surpassing third-dimesional borders.

Lucid disembodiment,
I achieve levitation
Theta stasis

Onward and upward, I leave this planet.
In transit between planes of existence...

I nurture the brainchild within the mind of my paralleled self,
Yet I remain oblivious as to whether my actions are duplicitous...
Or perhaps replicated.

My gaze remains constant and upward whilst I am suspended...
By means unknown and unquestioned.
The vastness of the sky, while impressive, compares not...
With the broadness of my mind.

My aura shining, glowing radiantly.
Physically blinding, though no less enticing.
Severing my sight, yet I retain vision.
Surpassing third-dimesional borders.

Lucid disembodiment,
I achieve levitation

Finally I feel as if euphoria is within my grasp,
And all answers will be revealed at any moment.
All that is divine will be known, definite.
Heaven itself... and then I woke.
