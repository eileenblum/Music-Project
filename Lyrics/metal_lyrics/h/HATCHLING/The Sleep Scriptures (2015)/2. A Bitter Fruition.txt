Fairest dusk, your grim onset,
Does curve the lips upward and
Lift my head Eastern in direction (Divulge)
I yearn to bask in the pale light of
Your silver, spherical nucleus once again. (Oblige)

Delve into my nature...
All loathing.
Speak my name.

The wind chills and in a way comforts me...
Knowing there are things colder than I.

A plethora of bitterness, I am...
The fulcrum which maintains the balance of
All things now disputable within,
The bacterial body I uphold.
A plethora of bitterness, I am...
The fulcrum which maintains the balance of
All things once disputable within,
All celestial bodies.

My marks upon this world are miniscule
and insignificant.
...And yet I persist with the utmost dilligence.
And as these beads of rain trickle down my face,
I know soon I will lie beneath the ground I tread.

A plethora of bitterness, I am...
The fulcrum which maintains the balance of
All things now disputable within,
The bacterial body I uphold.
A plethora of bitterness, I am...
The fulcrum which maintains the balance of
All things once disputable within,
All celestial bodies.

From a breath to inanimation,
Flourishing to an abrupt dissipation
A life of effort sans merit
Such is a bitter fruition

The wind chills and in a way comforts me...
Knowing there are things colder than I.

A plethora of bitterness, I am...
The fulcrum which maintains the balance of
All things now disputable within,
The bacterial body I uphold.
A plethora of bitterness, I am...
The fulcrum which maintains the balance of
All things once disputable within,
All celestial bodies.
