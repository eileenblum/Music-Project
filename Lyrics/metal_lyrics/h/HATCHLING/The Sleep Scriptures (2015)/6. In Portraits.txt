Risen, I am projected energy rendered and shaped.
No known sense of direction or purpose in this space.
Portraits hanging still adorning these halls bare my face.
Passive. Senseless. Subsequent to all of vitality.

Split the seas of cerebral hemispheres.
Extract the truths concentrated inside.
Re-evaluate our earthly durations.
What sayeth you of my departure?
It is I, exalted and majestic.
Stimulate the suppressed sacred gland.
Alter thine shape geometrically.
Astral body is now resurfacing.

Seasons elapse and I remain ageless forever.
Woven into the world of the living seamlessly.
Free me from all external obstruction. Enlighten me.
Out of body. Empty. Glaring into infinity.

Split the seas of cerebral hemispheres.
Extract the truths concentrated inside.
Re-evaluate our earthly durations.
What sayeth you of my departure?
It is I, exalted and majestic.
Stimulate the suppressed sacred gland.
Alter thine shape geometrically.
Astral body is now resurfacing.

Precipitation flowing from the tear ducts of...
Angelic figures, statuesque and ominous.
Purifying, their sweet, succulent nectar runneth over me...
Channeling my tongue to recite the passage:
I have ascended far beyond all others in my stature.
Towering pillars surround me in my uprise.
The shifting of the sand above me beckons my rebirth.
Prepare yourselves. My reign shall be eternal.

The labyrinth of slumber recollected...
Ectoplasmic fluid flowing forth from every facial orifice.

Split the seas of cerebral hemispheres.
Extract the truths concentrated inside.
Re-evaluate our earthly durations.
What sayeth you of my departure?
It is I, exalted and majestic.
Stimulate the suppressed sacred gland.
Alter thine shape geometrically.
Astral body is now resurfacing.
