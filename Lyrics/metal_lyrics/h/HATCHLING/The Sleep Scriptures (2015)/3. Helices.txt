These helices, models of my internal design.
Illustrate, color and shepherd my physical being.
My vessel.
My everything.

On a molecular level, I am as complex as any other.
We all share a frame of reference.
Nucleic acids, strands of pure information.
In search of all life's origin, unwinding the double helix.

Genes replicate, scripting one existence at a time.
Duplicate. Direct my composition.
Developed natural practice.

On a molecular level, I am as complex as any other.
We all share a frame of reference.
Nucleic acids, strands of pure information.
In search of all life's origin, unwinding the double helix.

Growing. (Resonating in us)
Shifting. (An ever-constant pulse)
Changing. (Inclusive and open)
Evolve. (This frequency does pull)
Adapt. (To deny connection)
Create. (Is not to separate)
Improve. (This is everlasting)
Perfect. (This bond is sarosanct)

The tree of life, once only a seed...
Of which I was the sower.
Is still but a mere sapling within an orchard of distinct eldership.
Much like a lantern on a window sill, left as a beacon,
I will always be here. Glowing, hopeful and forever-prompted.

Fiber based and carbon formed, of all the things I've felt before.
Nothing equates or can pacify more,
Than the answers I seek being washed to the shore.
As I relish the findings and bathe in the wealth,
Of the knowledge of gained about us. About self.
I am assured, substantiated, relieved.
That I am more than I've grown to believe.

The chain remains unsevered.

Prokaryotically, from whence we have come.
Genetically predisposed, radiated by the sun

Mathematically developing continuous strains of reality.
An elaborate procedure executed with surgical precision.
And through all of this...
Change will occur.

And our roots gather foul water; diluted nutrients.
Yet we wonder why we remain unripe.
