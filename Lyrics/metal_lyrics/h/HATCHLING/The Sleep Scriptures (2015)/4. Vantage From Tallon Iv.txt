Departing the orbiting Frigate Orpheon with much haste and fervor,
Dispossessed and weary. Incredulous. Precarious. I am boarding my means of separation.
We're worlds away and I cannot fathom the distance nor displacement in my absence.
I give chase though sworn I never would again, but this is change. Brace for impact.

After gathering thoughts and breath, I disembark. No degree of inhalation could have readied me.
Vines reaching as far as the eye can see,
Vegetation, bulbous and tempting.
At the sight, I do salivate but I do not dare indulge.

Trees gnarled in an elaborate conglomerate of tangled organic wonder,
Doors, hexagonal.
Ushered forth by bioluminescent spores in my descent,
Into cavernous peril.

Exotic foliage upturned by the onset of an ever-lingering humidity.
Evoking the thought of an open hand. Here is mine.

I endure where you could not.

Assuming the form of spiderball

Revitalize and resuscitate
A biome in my palm.
Reclaiming the varia.
Among the artifacts.
Collected in reservoirs,
The blue toxin, nil.
Remember me as I am now.
Prime.
