[Altus/White]

Superstition creeps within
They alter what we hold in our perception 
Our subconscious stores the clues
To what is in our mind and what is real

[Pre-Chorus:]
No one knows the reason 
No one has the key
To unlock the door of this mystery 
Will we ever find out?
Will we ever see?
What's behind the curtain of perplexity?

[Chorus:]
So many things in life we just can't explain 
There is so much that's still unclear
If we dare to enter the forbidden zone
We'd no longer feel the fear of the unknown

Images of the unseen
Wander through our imagination
It's all so strange, the wonder of it all 
Our hopes and fears, the rise and falls

[Repeat Pre-Chorus &amp; Chorus]

This unseen power mystifies the hour 
Transforms the blue skies to red
The howling moon is calling 
As the dead of night is falling 
These spirits dance upon our souls

Sometimes you can feel it
You might not believe it; but things happen that 
we can't control
Nothing has changed 
It's still the same 
Unanswered questions will remain
