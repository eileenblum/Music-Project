[Piercy/White]

Drawn forth by terror, they gather to see
The wreckage and the carnage, it's like a disease 
We read it in the papers, we see it on the news 
Conditioned by the media, how can we refuse?

Sirens screaming into the night 
A victim of circumstance
A blur of flashing light
Out in the streets, a crowd forms to see 
The twisted remains of what used to be

Everyday we run this deadly race 
Anything can happen at any time or place 
The future isn't certain, no matter what you do 
When your time has come, fate falls upon you

Sirens screaming into the night 
A victim of circumstance
A blur of flashing light
Out in the streets, a crowd forms to see 
The twisted remains of misery

Curious people attracted to death
Capture a glimpse of someone's last breath 
Subject of interest for public view
What happened to them could've happened to you

Some people can't wait to hear it 
The disaster of the day
It makes them feel better 
While their own lives decay

Drawn forth by terror, they gather to see
The wreckage and the carnage, it's like a disease 
How will this affect the future in time to come?
How will they perceive us when all is said and done?

Sirens screaming into the night 
A victim of circumstance
A blur of flashing light
Out in the streets, a crowd forms to see 
The twisted remains of what used to be

Curious people attracted to death
Capture a glimpse of someone's last breath 
Subject of interest for public view
What happened to them might happen to you
