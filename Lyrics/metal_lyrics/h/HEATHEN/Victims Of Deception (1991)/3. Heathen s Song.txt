[Altus/Sanguinetti/White]

Echoed voices silently 
Whisper to me in my sleep 
Though the words, they are not clear 
They say the things I want to hear 
Lightning strikes and don't you know 
What to say and where to go
In time you'll find your way 
In my sleep the voices say

Over the mountains and across the sea
I've searched for the land where I could be free 
Freedom is something that I never had
I gotta set myself free or I'm gonna go mad

Just let me be my own way
Have my own god to whom I pray 
Don't need your mass conformity 
No place for me in your society

Well I believe in life and all it's worth
I never ask the question "who created the earth?" 
But I fled from the worship of the other men 
Because what you believe must come from within

Just let me be my own way
Have my own god to whom I pray 
Don't need your mass conformity 
No place for me in your society

[Repeat first verse]

Voices calling 
Times are changing 
There's no time to rearrange the past 
Forgotten sorrow
Until tomorrow
It's overshadowed by the willingness of your soul

Passage walls of glory revealed before my eyes
A narrow task of blissful skies appear within the light 
A heathen's journey to a pagan moon
A meeting of the minds 
Leads to the challenge of life 
Until the end of time
