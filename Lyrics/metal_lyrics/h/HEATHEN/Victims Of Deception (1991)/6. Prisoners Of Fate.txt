[Altus/White]

There's got to be a solution 
There must be a cure 
Something to get me through this confusion 
What will it take to set me free?
The time that's passed is full of frustration

So much to tell, but no words to say
I've suffered enough and my dues are paid 
No turning back now
I'm on my way

When I look back I see 
A time of misery
At times it seemed that it would never end

[Chorus:]
Life is a gamble
No matter how you play the game 
Roll the dice and take your chances 
Win or lose it doesn't matter 
'Cause there's no escape
When you're a prisoner of fate

Anything is possible
But nothing is ever really sure
Not always knowing what's wrong or right 
Your only choice is to decide
I stand alone in the pouring rain 
I just had to say
Capture the moment before it's gone 
You've got the strength to carry on

I was condemned to feel 
This pain that's so unreal 
The chains that bind me are behind me know

[Repeat Chorus]

Once I was lost in the abyss
No longer could I go on like this

[Repeat Chorus]

Prisoners of fate [4x]
