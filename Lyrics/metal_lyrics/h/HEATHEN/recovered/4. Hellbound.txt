[originally by Tygers Of Pan Tang]Ripping through the clouds at the speed of light
Gonna shoot him down if he gets in my sights

I'm hellbound, spellbound
Shot down, heading for the ground

Now I'm closing, he's got dues to pay
I've got no thoughts of pity, his end is on his way

Now he's on my tail and there's a smile on his face
Half a second later and I'm wasted in space

No, no, I'm hellbound
