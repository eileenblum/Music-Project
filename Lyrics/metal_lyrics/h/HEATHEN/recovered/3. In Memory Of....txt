I'll never be the same
"never" forever our lives were changed knowing the memory of you
Nothing last forever, no never
Memories are all that remain
There's really no one to blame

We live and we die, were there's truth, there's a lie
I try to understand the reasons why we all must go
The meaning, the feeling, there is no fear to feel
But the pain will never dissapear

A thousand words cannot describe this pain, so for you
I write this song in memory of your name
So I can only say goodbye, "goodbye"
So long my friend until we meet again

We live and we die, were there's truth, there's a lie
I try to understand the reasons why we all must go
The meaning, the feeling, there is no fear to feel
But the pain will never dissapear

I'll never be the same. "forget you I will never do"
I will never be the same
In each of us is a part of you and every moment is just a fraction in time
A moment to live, a moment to die, I will never be the same
