Masses form into religion to fulfill their lives
Seeking answers in the bible, hear their helpless cries
Mindlessly, no thought, they follow false prophets of the flesh
Depend on the spirit of the One to grant their every wish

[Pre-Chorus:]
It's not too late to change your fate
You must control your own mind
You're the only one that can release you
It's yourself you've got to find

[Chorus:]
Fools give money to the church to earn their place with God
In our eyes it's contradiction and religious fraud
Hypnotized by what they say
Your mind is under their control
Hypnotized you will obey
Your fate will soon be called

You must make your own decision of what you think is real
Your soul was given on to you and not for these thieves to steal
Don't be fooled by these hypnotic forces, they will rob you blind
There is no excuse for their actions
Making a mockery of mankind

[Repeat Pre-Chorus &amp; Chorus]

Masses form into religion to fulfill their lives
Seeking answers in the bible, hear their helpless cries
Don't be fooled by these hypnotic forces, they will rob you blind
There is no excuse for their actions
Making a mockery of mankind

[Repeat Pre-Chorus &amp; Chorus]
