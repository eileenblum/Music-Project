[Music: Kragen Lum]
[Lyrics: David White]

Can you hear the warning?
What's been done and what's been said?
People always talking
But no one's listening to the dead
I'm beside myself in disgust
Watching the world turn to dust

I heard someone screaming
Where will we be once all is lost?
And who's gonna count the cost?
Who's gonna count the loss?

I see the madness in their eyes, in their eyes
Their empty words are filled with promises
But they're lies
Siphoning everything draining blood from the earth
A day of reckoning and suffering
Will cover what's left of this world

Temperatures rising
A new end is drawing
The sky is crying red tears of disgrace

When the shadows fall
There'll be peace no more
And nothing left worth fighting for
Days filled with dread
Rivers flowing red
When we bite the hand we choke on regret
'Til there's nothing left

I hear the sadness in their cries, in their cries
Spilled tears through the years have all run dry, bone dry
Wanna start a revolution not a war
Wanna find a resolution before we melt to the core
Temperatures rising
A new end is drawing
The sky is crying red tears of disgrace

When the shadows fall
There'll be peace no more
And nothing left worth fighting for
Days filled with dread
Rivers flowing red
When we bite the hand we choke on regret
'Til there's nothing left
Stormclouds over head
Raining tears of red
