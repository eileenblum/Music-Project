[Music: Lee Altus]
[Lyrics: David White]

Hey, it's dying season
Bodies dropping in an endless grave
Promise, promise broken
Liver are lost, dissolved in vain
War, war and treason
Power minds set the stage
Loss, loss of reason
Disappearing in an endless rage

Fist full of sand, mouth full of disdain
Stepping stones melt into flames
Ancient methods historically stained
Soldiers marching onward into dust

Cradle the crying, extol the dying
Blood shed like paint to the wall
Sanity scarring, a prayer underlying
A season, a lifetime to fall
Crack in the sky, black is the night
A towering shadow divides,
Piercing creation, sever a nation
Compose a season to die

Hey, crying season
Bombs are blasting with a deadly force
Tears, tears are falling
A river stained must change its course
Lost, lost forever
Sacrifice is fate's reward
Time, everlasting
Only memories and timeless scars

Fist full of sand, mouth full of disdain
Stepping stones melt into flames
Ancient methods historically stained
Soldiers marching onward into dust

Cradle the crying, extol the dying
Blood shed like paint to the wall
Sanity scarring, a prayer underlying
A season, a lifetime to fall
Crack in the sky, black is the night
A towering shadow divides,
Piercing creation, sever a nation
Compose a season to die

Wars result, is it really worth the cost?
So much pain, the suffering never ends
War and fate, is where the bullets fly
Dust to dust, when death and life collide

[Solo: Lee]
[Solo: Kragen]

Fist full of sand, mouth full of disdain
Stepping stones melt into flames
Ancient methods historically stained
Soldiers marching onward into dust

Cradle the crying, extol the dying
Blood shed like paint to the wall
Sanity scarring, a prayer underlying
A season, a lifetime to fall
Crack in the sky, black is the night
A towering shadow divides,
Piercing creation, sever a nation
Compose a season to die
