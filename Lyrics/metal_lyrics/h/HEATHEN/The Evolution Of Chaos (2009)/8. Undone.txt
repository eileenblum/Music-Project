[Music &amp; Lyrics: Kragen Lum]

This feeling that inside me burns
Reveals its face to me in turn
To sow the seeds of self destruction
Once hidden, now concealed no more
Its power greater than before
Led down the path to where renewed temptation lies

Internalize
These wicked cries
Is fate deciding?
What's become of me?
Creation's son
Thy will be done
There's no defying
I'll be undone

Relent and give in to its needs
Incessant chaos which it feeds
Digs my own grave without intention
And now the hole is six feet deep
Return to reason far too steep
Walk further down the road to where salvation dies

Internalize
These wicked cries
Is fate deciding?
What's become of me?
Creation's son
Thy will be done
There's no defying
I'll be undone

[Solo: Kragen]
[Solo: Lee]

Relent and give in to extreme
Incessant chaos draining me
To sow the seeds of deconstruction
Once hidden now the path is clear
Its power greater than my fear
Led down the path to where the flames of cremation rise

Internalize
These wicked cries
Is fate deciding?
What's become of me?
Creation's son
Thy will be done
There's no defying
I'll be undone
