[Music: Lee Altus]
[Lyrics: David White]

Twisting on a fine line
Shifting up the incline
Coasting down along this narrow road
Creeping up my blind side
Sidetrack to the dark side
Try to get my spirit to transcend

I've suffered inside the grey and the black
I've walked through coals to get where I'm at
I've saved a lifetime in a jar of miry clay
Shaping my existence to never fade away

Fade away
I will never
Never fade away

Drifting on an ocean
Life without devotion
Hollow is the man without a soul
Blinded by ambition
Short signed in his vision
Redemption's not a place that he calls home

I've suffered inside the grey and the black
I've walked through coals to get where I'm at

I've saved a lifetime in a jar of miry clay
Shaping my existence to never fade away

Fade away
I will never
Never fade away

Twisting on a fine line
Shifting up the incline
Coasting down along this narrow road
Creeping up my blind side
Sidetrack to the dark side
Try to get my spirit to transcend

[Solo: Lee]
[Solo: Kragen]

Draining out of the poison
Infection's now in motion
Got to find the source before it spreads
Facing my destruction
Reaching out for something
To free the embrace of this quicksand

I've suffered inside the grey and the black
I've walked through coals to get where I'm at
I've saved a lifetime in a jar of miry clay
Shaping my existence to never fade away

Fade away
I will never
Never fade away
