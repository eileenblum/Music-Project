[Music: Jon Torres]
[Lyrics: David White]

Endless cycle, in hungry packs they feed
Survival in turmoil is the way of the streets
There is no honor among thieves, no concern or remorse
Legions upon legions march in a centrifugal force

Bloodkult
Senseless blood will spill
Kill first
The code is kill or be killed

Hopeless denial, desensitized to death
Nothing more than a passing glance to aggravate your arrogance
Deadly weapon in your hand, confidence in the steel
Trigger is your only friend, the bullet's fate is revealed

Corruption's running fast and deep, and there is no cure
Contamination infects the rich and the poor
Humanity is lost, their mind are filled with dread
Demons of wrath condemned to eternal flames

Bloodkult
Senseless blood will spill
Kill first
The code is kill or be killed

Prisons and graveyards are filled with this plague
This vicious cycle, is too far gone to be saved
Nightmares, cold stares, better run for your life
Gun shots, sirens wailing, cuts through like a knife

[Solo: Kragen]

Endless cycle, in hungry packs they feed
Survival in turmoil is the way of the streets
There is no honor among thieves, no concern or remorse
Legions upon legions march in a centrifugal force

Bloodkult
Senseless blood will spill
Kill first
The code is kill or be killed
Blood Bath
Drenched in the crimson reign
Bloodkult
Disciples of death in vain

[Solo: Kragen]
