[Music: Lee Altus]
[Lyrics: David White]

Darkness has consumed your soul
Now you curse the sky
Agony and solitude like worms feed on your pride
Innocence has been erased
As shadows stain the sun
Now it's time to pay the price for all that you have done

Silent cry
Hear the voices whisper, "Do it!"
Shattered life
Fading into silent nothingness

Phantom of the universe
Devouring mankind
Infection to humanity poisoning the blind
Centuries have come and gone
Nothing seems to change
Evil is as evil does, the sin remains the same

Silent cry
Hear the voices whisper, "Do it!"
Shattered life
Fading into silent nothingness

[Solo: Kragen]

Never show fear
Use your second sight
The wolves are always near
Lurking in the night

Never show fear
Use your second sight
The wolves are always near

[Solo: Terry Lauderdale]
