[Music: Lee Altus]
[Lyrics: David White]

I'm looking for a reason, I'm watching the signs
This head on collision is a race against time
Is this an illusion? It seems so unreal
This manifestation is drawing me near

Something to grab a hold of
Capture a glimpse from the mind's eye
Releasing all that I contain
And all I perceive to be

Feel the pressure building
Got to take this journey on my own
I have to seize the moment
Leave no stone unturned until I'm done

Just like a vapor, moments flash by
Way beyond measure, like the infinite sky
Realization, a token of faith
A constant reminder of my ultimate grave

With nothing to hold on to
Cherish each breath until you die
The sands of time have been measured line by line
A calculation designed for the feast

Feel the pressure building
Got to take this journey on my own
I have to seize the moment
Leave no stone unturned until I'm done

Until I'm gone
Until I'm gone
Until I'm gone
Leave no stone unturned
Dead and gone
Leave no stone unturned

I feel this pressure building
I've got to take control
I have to seize this moment
Leave no stone unturned
The past reveals the future
Can we embrace our fate?
The imprint has no boundary
Leave no stone unturned

Leave no stone unturned
Until I'm done
Leave no stone unturned

Leave no stone unturned
Until I'm done
Leave no stone unturned

Leave no stone unturned
'Til I'm dead and gone
