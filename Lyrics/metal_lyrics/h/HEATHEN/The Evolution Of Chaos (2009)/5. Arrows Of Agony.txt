[Music: Lee Altus]
[Lyrics: David White]

Black as the night, furious fight
Arrows are piercing the sky
Sharps as the blade, the cut has been made
Agony coming my way

Demon eyes are watching me
Preying on my pain and misery
Spreading hate, they plant the seeds
Deception is their only way to feed

Arrow of agony falling
Pierces my flesh 'til I bleed
This is the enemy haunting me
With arrows of agony

Chilled to the bone, drifting alone
This nightmare is haunting my soul
Peace I must find to ease my mind
Something to regain control

Demon eyes are watching me
Preying on my pain and misery
Spreading hate, they plant the seeds
Deception is their only way to feed

Arrow of agony falling
Pierces my flesh 'til I bleed
This is the enemy haunting me
With arrows of agony

Lost, lost inside my pain,
Time, to wash away the stain
Scars, still the scars remain
Agony is haunting me, draining the last drop of my sanity
Lost, lost inside my pain,
Time, to wash away the stain
Scars, still the scars remain
Arrows are falling as agony as agony pierces my soul

[Solo: Terry Lauderdale]
[Solo: Kragen]

Black as the night, furious fight
Arrows are piercing the sky
Sharp as the blade, the cut has been made
Agony coming my way

Demon eyes are watching me
Preying on my pain and misery
Spreading hate, they plant the seeds
Deception is their only way to feed

Arrow of agony falling
Pierces my flesh 'til I bleed
This is the enemy haunting me
With arrows of agony
