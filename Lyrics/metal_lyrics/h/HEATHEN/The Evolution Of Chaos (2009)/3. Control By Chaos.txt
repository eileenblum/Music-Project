[Lyrics: David White, Juan Urteaga]

[Solo: Kragen]

We are controlled by chaos in a world left for dead
The masses have been betrayed
Corrupt the innocent, and rape the poor
Replace the preordained
I've seen the good and the bad and the ugly man
And his faces are all the same

But no one knows what's in his soul
And all he has to gain

As far as the mind can see
Humanity has gone astray
Balance on a razorblade
Lost among the crowd
Sands of time will wash away
Insanity is calling me

[Solo: Kragen]

Eternal pages of history are set ablaze
The stench it fills the sky
Destroy the evidence, erase the past
And let the memory die
I've seen the cold dark shell of a man
His legacy etched in time
What remains unchanged is the ice in his veins
And the morals he left behind

As far as the mind can see
Humanity has gone astray
Balance on a razorblade
Lost among the crowd
Sands of time will wash away
Insanity is calling me

Even the blind can see
Can't you see?
Eternal heresy
This hypocrisy
Condemned to misery
There's no sympathy
Condemned to life

A life that's worth living is full of sacrifice
If death is the beginning,
Then it's well worth the price

[Solo: Kragen]

As far as the mind can see
Humanity has gone astray
Balance on a razorblade
Lost among the crowd
Sands of time will wash away
Insanity is calling me

Even the blind can see
Can't you see?
Eternal heresy
This hypocrisy
Condemned to misery
There's no sympathy
Condemned to life

A life that's worth living is full of sacrifice
If death is the beginning,
Then it's well worth the price

[Solo: Kragen]
