[Music: Lee Altus]
[Lyrics: David White]

There's a time for every season
With a cure comes new disease
Bloodshed and suppression, pain and suffering
There's a necessary evil
And the brave will heed the call
The bugler calls the line as the generals keep the score

In this world that we live in
There is war and tyranny
Chaos and confusion, divided: Who are we?
There is peace as well as freedom
But they both come with a price
Will we ever understand what it means to sacrifice?

They are not in it for the treasure
And not there for the fame
Their aim is for the glory
And the battle is the game
They proudly wear their badge of courage
A living tribute to the clash
Some of them come seeking vengeance
Some fight for the flag, for their God and the land

Victory fools us into thinking
About what we lost and what we've won
When death was upon us
Did we do the things that had to be done?

They travel by land, by air or by sea
Where ever the fight may be
Willingly lay down their lives to preserve
The land of the brave and the free
The home of the brave and the land of the free
The home of the soldiers who fought to keep us free

[Spoken dedication: Adam Harrington]

This song is dedicated to the fallen, wounded and the scarred
Their truth is neverending and sacrifice always hard
We honor and pay tribute to all who have served their country well
May you all find peace apart from this living hell
