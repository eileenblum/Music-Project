Well, raise 'em high and string 'em up
We've gotcha, now you're good as dead
From the gallows to your grave
It's gonna take your life away

Crime they say, does not pay
And you're the living proof
But not for long, cause you'll be hung
By your neck

Thirteen knots around your neck
Will really give you quite a stretch
From the gallows to your grave
It's gonna take your breath away

Death by hanging
Death from the gallows
Death by hanging around
Death by hanging
Death from the gallows
Death by hanging around

Raise the slime and string 'em up
We've gotcha, now you're good as gone
From the gallows to your grave
It's gonna take it all away

The crowd they cheer as you climb the stairs
Finally you're a star
But not for long, cause you'll be hung
By your neck

Death by hanging
Death from the gallows
Death by hanging around
Death by hanging
Death from the gallows
Death by hanging around

Crime they say, does not pay
And you're the living proof
But not for long, cause you'll be hung
By your neck

Death by hanging
Death from the gallows
Death by hanging around
Death by hanging
Death from the gallows
Death by hanging around
