Screaming for sanction with every breath
Break through the silence as you enter your quest
Misguided fortune, lost in your fear
When will you see what is so clear

Will we stand still and watch the blood spill
Until the blood is our own
The ones who deceive, lie that they are true
But where are they when you fall

We?re breaking the silence
So hear what I say
Just listen in silence, it?s the only way

Clinging transparent, your energy they?ll drain
They?ll help you down and pick your vein, yes they will
Unstable future, your face in the mirror
When will you face all that you fear

Will we stand still and watch the blood spill
Until the blood is our own
The ones who deceive, lie that they are true
But where are they when you fall

If you break the silence
There's a price to pay
You must take an alliance
It's the only way

Screaming for sanction with every breath
Break through the silence as you enter your quest
Misguided fortune, lost in your fear
When will you see what is so clear

Will we stand still and watch the blood spill
Until the blood is our own
The ones who deceive, lie that they are true
But where are they when you fall

If you break the silence
There's a price to pay
You must take an alliance
It's the only way

If you break the silence
There's a price to pay
You must take an alliance
It's the only way
Break the silence
Break the silence
