Walking the path of no return
Lurks the evil that lives within
Shattered dreams of many men
Who tried to cross the bridge of sin

I'm the one who lives to tell the tale
Of the mythical demon that once impaled
The murders of many brought fear to the land
This mythical menace, I will slay in the end

The Goblin would sit beneath the rocks
Waiting in the shadows as the bridge was blocked
As the men would try to break the barricade
They would witness the Goblins Blade

It was not a pretty sight to watch them die
But I was young and I feared for my life
Their throats were cut at the flick of his wrist
And as they fell he said with a hiss

"I'm the keeper of the bridge of souls
And underneath is where the blood river flows
So never try to cross my path, for if you do
I'll split you in half"

The Goblin sits beneath the rocks
Waiting in the shadows as the bridge was blocked
As the men would try to break the barricade
They would witness the Goblins Blade

Walking the path of no return
Lurks the evil that lives within
Shattered dreams of many men
Who tried to cross the bridge of sin

I'm the one who lives to tell the tale
Of the mystical demon that once impaled
The murders of many brought fear to the land
This mystical menace, I shall slay in the end

The power is great within his sword
And the only way to defeat him
Is to steal his source, leaving him weak
I shall show no remorse
I shall take his last breath, with his own sword
