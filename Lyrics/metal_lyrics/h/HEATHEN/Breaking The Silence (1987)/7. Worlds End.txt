Beyond in time the Astron glows
Tune into your inner past
The intervals of light
Between two successive nights
The mind predicts the maze

Cold and dense, but fast as light
Mercury, the messenger stands in flight
Sent by the gods to bring us the news

A methane blast, hard and fast
Speed through time, skating on glass
Time is well forgot

We are the ones of a race soon old
We are the ones who will witness the blow
Whose eyes will burn on whatever they behold
Whose flesh will bleed by the thorns of a rose
Whose lips shall whisper these words to be told
And you will scatter in the Earth's end

Step by step, we must fight
The war of our world is about to begin
Kill one another over the power of words
Cool and dense, but fast as light
Mercury, the messenger stands in flight
Sent by the gods to bring us the news

We are the race that was left for not
We are the ones that time forgot
In the Universe there is always constant change
Blinded by greed you fought over gold
Ready to take whatever you can hold
And you will pay in the Earth's end

A methane blast, hard and fast
Speed through time, skating on glass
Time is well forgot

Step by step, we must fight
The war of our world is about to begin
Kill one another over the power of words

We are the ones of a race soon old
We are the ones who will witness the blow
Whose eyes will burn on whatever they behold
Whose flesh will bleed by the thorns of a rose
Whose lips shall whisper these words to be told
And you will scatter in the Earth's end
