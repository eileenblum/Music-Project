Rack, ball and chain
Feel just the same
Hands on the wall
Maybe you?re just playing games
Set me free

Hung by a hound,
Ganging around
Is this for real
I don't know when
I'll be found
Set me free

Set me free
Set me free from you

Taken by force
By you of course
Far from my bed
Maybe I'll feel better dead
Set me free

Set me free
Set me free from you

Fire in my brain
Burn me insane
Making your mark
Don't leave me here in the dark
Set me free

Call me a saint
That's what I ain't
Inside my head
I know I'd rather dead
Set me free

Set me free
Set me free from you
