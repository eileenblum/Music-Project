Timeless shadow stalking the night
Search for a victim before the new light
Demented by shame, lost in his pain
When will his hunger stop
Carving the flesh from her succulent chest
Through the fog into the mist
His relentless murders are never fast
He always saves the skull for last

Save the skull for last
Cause the life it's lived has passed
Save the skull for last

Hot young flesh, freshly killed
It makes him feel better when
He sees the blood spill
He must be stopped - dead or alive
Or many people won't survive
He preys on whores, he lures them in
This is where the nightmare ends and begins
Torturing them slow, never fast
He always saves the skull for last

Save the skull for last
Cause the life it's live has passed
Save the skull for last
Save the skull for last
Cause the life it's live has passed
Save the skull for last

Polish your sword for vengeance is sweet
And keep this evil off the street
He must be stopped - dead or alive
Or many people won't survive
I'll cut him up into little cubes
And put him an a pot
And make a bloody stew
I'll throw it in the alley
And feed him to the rats
He'll never save a skull at last

Save the skull for last
Cause the life it's live has passed
Save the skull for last
Save the skull for last
Cause the life it's live has passed
Save the skull for last
