BeÂ 
Wary of thoseÂ 
That watch with malevolentÂ 
EyesÂ 
Your every moveÂ 
Locked inÂ 
TheirÂ 
SightsÂ 
Their gaze at yourÂ 
BackÂ 
IsÂ 
Never-endingÂ 

Do you feel itÂ 
They are watchingÂ 
Do you feel itÂ 
They are watchingÂ 

DoÂ 
You sense that theyÂ 
Are upon usÂ 
They are all-seeingÂ 
They are plottingÂ 

Do you feel itÂ 
They are watchingÂ 
Do you feel itÂ 
They are here with us nowÂ 

A figure standsÂ 
Tall aboveÂ 
The grain wavesÂ 
Piercing rays fromÂ 

Sun reach surfaceÂ 
Rips hopeÂ 
From fleshÂ 
And last lingerings of loveÂ 
From your bleak and empty heartÂ 

We shield our eyesÂ 
That we might seeÂ 
No features formÂ 
Only broken limbs and bloodÂ 

OurÂ 
ActionsÂ 
Beneath theÂ 
Weight of idle handsÂ 
Heavy like stonesÂ 
Immovable and denseÂ 
Unable to escapeÂ 
Thousands of eyes are observingÂ 

Do you feel itÂ 
They are here with us now
