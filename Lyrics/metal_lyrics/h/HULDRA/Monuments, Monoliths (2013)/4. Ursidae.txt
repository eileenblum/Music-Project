They weighed our hearts on sin aloneÂ 
A transformation that can never be undoneÂ 
Their soles will never again grace the wavesÂ 
The punishment borne by Callisto and her cubÂ 

You tookÂ 
The light from the starsÂ 
And soonÂ 
The sun will followÂ 

Water would douse the fireÂ 
In their heartsÂ 
But the first fire isÂ 
FlickeringÂ 
Tendrils of light from theÂ 
Sky reach downÂ 
Water to drown out theÂ 
Hope they hadÂ 
Clouds swept in to make theÂ 
Light recedeÂ 
Hurried off and kept at bayÂ 
Scorned and betrayed by those in whoÂ 
They placed their trustÂ 
A trust misplacedÂ 
Amber eyes and clawsÂ 
Then the hunterÂ 
Pierced a poison arrowÂ 
Through the coat of fur and fleshÂ 
They were scorned and left on their ownÂ 

Temet nosce, ursidae
