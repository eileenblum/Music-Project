The city in the skyÂ 
Is buried beneath a fogÂ 
If we could pierce a lightÂ 
Through the clouds we would seeÂ 
Its citizens weepÂ 
But as time wanesÂ 
Everything is lostÂ 
Within the wispy clutchesÂ 
And subtle sullied breathsÂ 
Of the world aboveÂ 

The city in the sky is left toÂ 
Degenerate decay divideÂ 
A plague of gods and menÂ 
Submit surrender succumbÂ 
Stars become a testament to their collapseÂ 
Accept acquiesce allowÂ 

Wraiths will writhe in the skyÂ 
As times of yore are writtenÂ 
Accented by gaseous light-bearing orbsÂ 
In the city in the sky
