Luminescent orbs had kept usÂ 
On course butÂ 
Gnarled roots then lead us astrayÂ 

Their wisdom filled us withÂ 
The strength to carry onÂ 

But twisted tongues spatÂ 
Poisonous words and the poisonÂ 

Took kindly to our veinsÂ 
A plague upon us allÂ 

Standing on the shoulders of titansÂ 
Lofty perch bears witness to travestyÂ 
Stoney eyes gaze onÂ 
Shadows encroach by the secondÂ 

Casting a dim light upon usÂ 
Quickly fading wavering and weakÂ 
Lay your weary head upon my handsÂ 

This sickness stakes its claimsÂ 
On the lives of lesser menÂ 
O dwindling light resurgeÂ 

Tired limbs begin to wither andÂ 
Begin to quiver under the weight ofÂ 
The push and pull and sway of the stormÂ 

Corrupted words had gotten the best of herÂ 
Betrayal committed amongst the roots and leavesÂ 
Once viewed as a savior, this man is but a ruseÂ 
Leaving behind too many traces of his infidelity
