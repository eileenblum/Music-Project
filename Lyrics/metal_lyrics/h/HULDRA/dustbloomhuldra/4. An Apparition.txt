[performed by Huldra]An apparition upon us now
Consorts with ghouls and the like
To bring us below the crest
And find hell beneath your delta waves

A man with a stone heart
Waits outside your door
Waiting to hear your
Last breath choking

With his attention turned on your lifesblood
Your breath is short and shallow
And he is flush with bliss
This is the end of you
