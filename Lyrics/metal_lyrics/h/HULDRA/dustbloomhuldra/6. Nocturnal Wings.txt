[performed by Huldra]On the hallowed backs
Of titan night birds
We ascend
Into black night
With no moon or stars
In sight
A crushing dark
You had never known
Consumes you

The winged creatures
They soar and screech
A piercing sound
Drowns everything
Else out
Higher and higher
Still we climb
Into this endless sky
The atmosphere is
Unkind and wild

Bulbous eyes
They exude
Wisdom greeted by
Ignorance in crowns
In crowns
In crowns
