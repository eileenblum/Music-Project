It is here that they
Will attempt to turn you
Espouse fictional tales
And claim them as evidence
Of a higher being's callings
They want you to see as they see
And they want you to give
Everything
A penance to pay a debt unknown
They want you to even forsake
Your own blood
To dry a river
And make it flow once more
With flesh upon tears
All for something intangible
One who claims perfection
When perfection's never to be had
They want you to kill
And be stark raving mad
In a place that needs not
Perfection of that of a
False architect

And in your mind
You will find
That all the answers
Lie inside yourself
How hard could it be
To see that
Our moral institutions
Rely not in false texts
But within our own veins
And one day
Perhaps we can accept
That these delusions
Are quite unnecessary
And the next step
May be the last
To transcendance

Release
Yourself
From these
Shackles
Be bound
No more
Release
Release
Release
Release
