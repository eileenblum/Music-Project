A piercing flash of light
The cloud unfurls
And scatters ash about
You are burning me away
With ashen lips
Time will stand still forever more

A cloud, a storm
What disastrous grace
Silhouettes burn into the city scape
A glaring contrast
As pendulous threads unfurled
Hands of time have ceased to move

The ground is sick
The sky is dull
Lest we forget it all
An indelible print is left
