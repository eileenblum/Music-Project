The strength of the signal is what brought us here, to you
Your sinewy fingers claw at the sky

You thought you were safe here in this hall of altered consciousness
As you cry out

"Why has this happened?"
"How did it take hold?"
"When will it all be restored?"

The signal it grows as time lengthens
It branches forth and converges onto your body

I will breathe life
Back into your prone body
I will tear the sky open
And flood light onto your face
I will breathe life
Into the mass that lies dormant
A flame will burst forth into you

You had noticed the pierced wings flailing about
But never gave a second thought to its meaning
Optimism fails to burst through
And it all carries on this way
