Wandering through centuries and cold forests I scream
To survive in such a bleak world that surely needs a new aim
I feel the wrath, I feel the shame
And I know it's time to build our fate
You breathe your lies just in my face
And you are but liars in wait...
I am the answer, I am the bringer of pain to those who put me down
I am eternal, I am yesterday and tomorrow, I am the only one who pays
I am the creator of this divine monument,
I am the fury of your loss, I am your passion and your... Salvation
A new millennium to conquer, a new epoch that gives birth
To everlasting sorrow and feed the rise of my empire
Turning man against his brother
Until man exists no more.
From the depths of  eternal seas
I shall rise for my victory
We declare our nation will be free
From all from of religion and heresy
I dominate this realm with blood and steel
Down on your knees and pray for me!
Destruction!
Of all that smells corruption
New beliefs
Arising from tyranny!
Rejoining me in my struggle
Erasing all from the past and lift your fist!
Blasting away in flames and burst
The ancient way, We rule supreme.
A new millennium to conquer, a new epoch with raging wars and slaughters
To everlasting sorrow and feed the rise of my empire
I see the future as a plague
A certainty of death
Nothing will ever be saved...
