Remembering the ancient times
When I was innocent
I realise how sad my life
Was because of bastard pigs.
As divine punishment
I fall on them
Like a beast of prey I am
I have no regret
Spreading terror and anarchy
In their wicked brain
I am the plague with no pity
For those who betrayed me.
Once they stabbed me in the back
And now they crawl
To avoid the endless wrath of mine
There is no glory for traitors!
I hate all those who betrayed me
And I promise I will have my revenge
I spite on such weak and feeble beings,
The ones who have no honour
Let me arise once last time
To persecute them all
And hear their endless cries...
Burning all the lies and all the pain
Eradication out of control
I feel the hatred in my heart
You will soon taste my rage so cold...
Let me arise once last time
To persecute them all
And hear their endless cries...
There is no glory for the traitors
There is no glory for treachery
