This is the dawning of the age
Of hypocrisy and contempt
Now time has come for us to rise
And sweep this old world so unsane
We bring in pain the new order
We're all out war, we keep the flame
Through forests and icy mountains
We struggle to recall our name.
From ancient lore and lost wisdom
We learned how to face adversaries.
And now we're back and we're ready
To unleash warfare.
Raise your swords and march to war
Final battle is here
Brave warriors we are divine
Defeat the fools that tried...
To laugh at our ancestral faith
And are bur useless...
Their punishment will be extreme
They'll never forget.
Legions are marching on the plains
They fight, they burn, they kill, they rape
I don't bear no more to see them,
The weak that think they rule supreme...
They're coming from unknown wastelands
And believe trend is not for them!
I have pleasure in blasting them,
My honour must be avenged!
My anger has last too long
And I know they're getting wrong
No more negociations
Now war is all we need.
Feel the blood on your steel
Ripping their flesh and lives
Crushing their armors and bones
Shields shining high on battlefields
Victory must be ours
Victory is ours!

Raise your swords and march to war
Final battle is here
Brave warriors we are divine
Defeat the fools that tried...
To laugh at our ancestral faith
And are bur useless...
Their punishment will be extreme
They'll never forget.
