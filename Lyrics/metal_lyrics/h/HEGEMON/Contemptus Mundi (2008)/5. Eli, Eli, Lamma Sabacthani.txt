And here we are, the sons of the sons...
Walking through the valley of the shadow of death
And here we are, the fathers of the fathers...
Ruling the world on the ashes and the ruins of the world we put on fire...

I made the entire realm explode, I desecrated the Lie
Telling us we come from light
Born, we are, from Great Divine
Why then we have all erased ? Destruction and pain we praised !
Melting blood with dust and tears, we are fucking born to kill !
We are god slayers,
No good, no evil in us
we just acted like puppets which all strings were held by us
Too blind to see such a truth
We create our destiny we built the world we live in
Burning, slaying, murdering...

We are, what we are ! Sons of war, bloody birds of pray.

Eli, Eli, Lamma Sabacthani We are no sons of god !

We are far above then both! We don't need a beholder
We're no bastard slaves

Free from all deities
We tame the land as tells our heart
We are deceit ! Violence is humanity !
To bring peace, mankind must perish !
But before the complete end,
Let the sons of the stars occupy the Supreme heavens

We have been abandoned by all and now we claim our throne
Swords in hands for the last time

We are the HEGEMON

Feel the astral wind blowing in our hearts coming from the furthest stars,
Through the void of ageless dimensions,
Travelling to bring us the ultimate vision,
The last step of humanity before its endless fall into oblivion.
The truth will soon be told, no one will survive to it.
But we will see...
Throughout our sins and acts
Our conquests and humble achievements
Because we know we are nothing here... WE know, we will be immortal !

Oh God why have you left us alone ? Or is it us that trampled you ?
You're not existing anymore for me
We are the demiurges. We are the fathers and sons !
We are one !
