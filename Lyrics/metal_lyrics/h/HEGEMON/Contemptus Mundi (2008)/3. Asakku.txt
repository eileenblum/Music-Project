Deep inside the fears of Men,
Grows the seed that will lead us all to the end,
Ignorance is a powerful weapon to hand,
That gives control on those who think they understand.

Everything seems so clear,
But you won't be so near,
Of your fear !
Open your eyes and feel the truth
Of The Asakku !
Once it is running in your veins,
There's no way for you to escape my hands.
Feel me !
I lead the war !
I'm the way you chose to die for !
No heresy : This is the demon of fear
That rules your mind
Face your destiny ! What a pity, to die without honor
I control thee ! I make you doing what I want.
Tasting the blood in my throat
I know there's no last resort
I am the fuel for your engine
The demon that breathes at your ears,
Inside your brain I play my game
That will make you going unsane
And seeing empty eyes behind the helmet
Control your fear or you will be destroyed.

My hand on your spine
I drain the courage you need to arise
You'll be paralysed and full of anguish,
No way to go back, you have to fight,
Of all wars, anywhere at anytimes,
I was there since the beginning.
To spread my wings over battlefields,
Spitting my venom at every faces.
Millions of braves and cowards died because of me.
And there will be many more, cause I'll never cease to live.

For fear is eternal !
For fear is eternal !
There exists no frontier to my kingdom,
I am, I was and I will be !
From the begining I am the spirit!
As long as men will be horrified,
forced to be scared by the ones just outside
They will kill each others for ages to come,
The sin of mankind is just to be born !
No pain will be relieved, no hope for a new dawn.
Humanity self armed destruction,
Men are the real demons !
Open your eyes...
