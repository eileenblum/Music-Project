Since the time the first men came
The quest for power has always been the same,
Slaughtering the Other to take his land,
It's in our veins, to war we are condemned!

Always willing to have what we don't own,
We are a disease put on a throne.
Striking the lightning, bringing hell and misery,
Can't we stop that curse? For we are born to kill!

From the ancient Assyria, to the Roman empire!
From the forest of Asia, to the mountains of the Mayas!
We have spilled the blood, covering the earth of a dark soil.
Black energies everywhere, from elder times until now.

War is such a treasure for those who hold the keys.
But the courage of the warriors is only remember by the dust!

Kill! Kill! Kill!
That's all we know!

Crushing the skulls of our enemies is our delight
As for holding our swords in our hands!
Blasting! Burning! Raping! Murdering! Are the lyrics
Of the songs mankind wrote when we took pleasure to kill!

Armies marching on! Sterilizing the bloody ground and the souls!
Ravaging the world. Drowning the light into nightmares!
With our conquests, we feel superior!
But inside, we all know we are but sinners!

I cast the first stone, for I am guilty
We dig our own graves, trying to destroy the most before our final breath,
But the sound of the horn, the clash of the blades
Is what we're made for, the sign that we deviate.

Is it a sign? To show us we've accomplished our time!
Are we so blind? The land of the dead, is this our empire?

Are we reduced to destroy all we hand?
Because of war? No, because of Men!
