Now everything is conquered, we have enslaved the earth.
No survivors, no surrender, we brought apocalypse!
We are the new Genesis! Through the Nemesis!

Crushing down all religions, raising up our new kingdom.
There's no God or no Satan but only one sign!
Humanity is what we breed.

Nothing's holy! Nothing's impure! We are but filth!

Pride and glory our destiny!
We could have been blinded by illusion of such a power
But we faced the enemy, the great one that's inside of us
And we defeated him so now we can rule all over the world

Now we are free! We have conquered...

Hell or heaven is just an idea for those who live in lie to understand what surrounds them.
Seeking the truth is the only quest that's worth to fight for
And crushing all principles is what we have done, for the old world is dead and gone!

There's no such free spirit than the one who breaks its chains itself...

Riding the land with horses of fire burning at stake for everything to putrify
Bringing the peace of steel! Stealing the will to the ones against us, making them crawl.
Annihilation of all resistance!

We fear nothing!
ITENOU PEDJET!

There are walls higher than those built by man.

Beware of knights that don't fear light.
They will bring you death if you hide behind your faith!

Water, wind, fire, and earth! These are the only true words that should command to all of us!
God and Satan are just a game to play if you look for fame!
But the only choice to get out is to search for light!

Now everything is conquered we have enslaved the earth.
No survivors, no surrender!
