AÃ® ibur ShapÃ» - No enemy will pass

My faith in myself is the wall against which
All enemies have crushed and died,
Just below my burning eyes
Now, a new world is soon to be born
With no one to spread death but us.
We are the last ones

We are the angels !
We are the angels of total destruction

Now that our axes have been destroying
Every single opponent to our Reign Supreme
And that no enemy shall pass again the gate of our might
And infinies realm of wisdom, this futurs is ours
We'll never give up...

Having fulfilled our quest for power
And spread our empire above the land
We lay our swords to rest and prepare
The last havens for our nation of mighty warriors,
We have achieved our destiny.

AÃ® ibur ShapÃ»
No enemy will pass
We built the future on the ashes of the past.
To set our strength

AÃ® ibur ShapÃ»
All enemy will die
This is the beginning of our last kingdom
Until the end of times

Our nation will rule for thousand years,
Then we'll disappear in the mist of ages,
Returning to dust where we come from,
The last humanity on earth

And then came the chose nones,
To bring peace of steel, eradication of all forms of resistance,
Unique possession of the souls, we control the law,
We are the tyrants

Bleeding !

No one enters the gates
No one broke through

You will all be annihilated if you try to come and fight with us.
You will only die in pain.
