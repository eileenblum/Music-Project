Now the world is at my hands
Now they're burnt, now they're slained
All this human scum reduced to nothingness
I am Iskandar, bow down and kiss my hand...

Proskynese...
Your domination has ended...
Proskynese...
Obey my ritual.
Proskynese...
Follow my orders
Proskynese...
I control your lives.

All my life, you tried to eradicate me ! But I've survived and now I control thee !
Feel my hatred ! I am Allmighty. For at last I am the Hegemon

Proskynese
Now I submit thee !
Proskynese
I will have no mercy
Proskynese
All bow down to me
Proskynese
This is how it will be !

My armies have vainquished Your Kingdoms
Of despostism and lies !
Now the true has come to rebuild,
This ruined land for our future...

Revenge now is mine and I taste it from the deepest core
Power on my side I have no fear, nor remorse
I hold the sword for no God nor demon
I have Faith only in my inner self !

Look into my eyes, see nothing
But your pityful destiny...
I behold my work
I feel no pain for your sacrifice.
We all deserve to die but you're gone first
We must now stand united, to face the coming birth

Of this new dawn
Blood now runs in growing rivers,
We shall stand right, never fall again.
I am the leader !

I'm the Lion
I'm the King
I'm Iskandar
