Blessed be those who know the truth behind the curtain
Of holy lies !

What to see is not real,
Just an ideal of life
We are meant to like.

The world we were taught
Has never been existing.
We are born of lie !

Nothing is so clear,
There's no Good and no Evil
Darkness need Light.

There is no shadows without sun !

To reduce the world in two opposites is wrong.
Everything is entwined, Goodness has never been so bad.

Here we are !
Standing high !
Foreseeing (behind the veil of) what we know.

Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas
Et pourtant, ils naissent innocents...

Digging underweath
Our pain and our grief
We know there's something else
Than the "dream" we share.

Behinf the stone, there's always a soul,
Long forgotten and that has been devoured.
The only good dogma is the one without law,
We want to take control !

Hear the sound of Horns burning into Heavens,
The cries of God weepinf His fate
There is no more faith in these sick puppets,
The books are fake and we make a new step !

Power in our brains, no need to create
A tale of fake we don't tolerate !!
Holyness and blasphemy are a wrong point of view,
To you, bastards preachers of the Black and the White, we just say Fuck you !

Free we are
For we know the secrets...
