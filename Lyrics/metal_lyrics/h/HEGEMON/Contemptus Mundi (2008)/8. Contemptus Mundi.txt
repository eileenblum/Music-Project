Setting on the throne, the highest upon others, reduced in ruins and pain
Violently encrowned, we are the last ones of our race
Remember all the battles we have won, think about all that we have done
We destroyed, we burnt, we slayed, but on the ashes a new light was born.

We made this light grown, despising the cries of our victims,
In this world of stone, we destroyed the first block and everything collapsed !!

And still we are marching on...
To purify the souls of the traitors !
We are what We want to be !
Ad Astra... Contemptus Mundi !

Through blood and bones, we achieved our aim, we rule supreme;
Fire brought to mankind out of our hands, we are claiming our world, we live in grace

We are kings of kings, of a realm that'll soon cease to be
With this milestone, we deliver our last legacy

YA - MLIKU ! YA - MLIKU !
He is king

Nunc dimittis servum tuum, domine,
We leave this world alone, free to chose the path for the next centuries

After all I've done, I'm ready to bear my last crown
Now we rebuild the long lost empire, the world before we cross the River.
All this will be yours, don't let ti go away,
Our final testimony, a life of misery.

Sword in hands, at the bloody fields of history
Steel rusted by sweat, we will disappear in the mist.
We marked the way with our strength to resist.
We are no gods, no demons, just humans... who once rised !

See the stars : here we are !
Don't look back : and never leave your path !
Shine !

The sky is mine, my tears are stars,
I hold the rules and I feel your life : time is nothing,
When you see the light.
I see though eyes that have never seen
We have succeed for we made no compromise !
Potius mori quam foedari

We are Divine
We have declined
We die on time,
Contemptus Mundi

And thus, we passed away, living forever in memories...
