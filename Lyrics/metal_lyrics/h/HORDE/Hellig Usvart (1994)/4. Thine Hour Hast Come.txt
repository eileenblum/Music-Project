at the dawning of time 
thine heart didst proclaim 
thy throne shall arise 
beyond the stars of God 
and be enthroned on the Northern sides 
of that Great Mountain 
far above the clouds 
didst thou aspire to 
but alas 
this was not to be 
so fallen thou art 
as lightening to earth 
having once angelic splendour 
now the vilest abomination 
an abode for maggots thou art 
a shame 
that once so beautiful 
all is lost to become nothing 
behold 
lucifer 
son of the morning 
thine hour hast come 
thou will be stripped of power 
and be lowered into the very depths of hell 
thy fate is worse than death 
eternal suffering and damnation
