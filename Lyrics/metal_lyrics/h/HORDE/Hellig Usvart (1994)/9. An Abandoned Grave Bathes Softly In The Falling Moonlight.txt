a soft 
glowing sphere rises within the darkened sky 
clouds move and shift around a glorious moon 
hanging far above the earth below 
beams fall from the huge night light in the sky 
far below 
the cemetrey gates gently creak 
as a cold breeze tickles the oak tree's leaves 
they dance and sway to the blowing wind 
an eerie fog descends upon the cemetery 
thick enough to catch the moon beams 
the graves are aglow with soft light 
the full moon growing brighter with time 
the breeze is no more 
the air is still 
a blankey of think fog is horizon bound 
an abandoned grave is bathing ever so softly 
in the fallen glowing full moon light 
the grave abandoned in the wake of rapture 
no longer the abode of a corpse 
but a cavity in the earth's crust 
the former occupant now far beyond the clouds 
to bid farewell to the moon 
the stars 
the past 
now but a faded memory 
soon to vanish 
the life beyond the flesh is yet to be discovered
