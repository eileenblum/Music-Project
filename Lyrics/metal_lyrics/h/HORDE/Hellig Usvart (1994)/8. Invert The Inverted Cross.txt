the cross of christ 
turned upside down 
symbol of his supposed defeat 
those in darkness 
rejoice in this 
but the truth is revealed to the chosen 
christ stormed the gates of hell 
to take the keys thereof 
now the keys of death and hades 
belong to the enternal one 
hell awaits the demonic forces 
who seek to prevert the cross 
flaming hellfire destruction 
is their final dwelling place 
so 
what remains to be said 
invert the inverted cross 
the inversion is but a lie 
upright it should stand 
no longer an inversion 
but a symbol of supreme victory
