crush the bloodied horns 
grind them into the dust 
spare nothing from the ferocious 
anger of the eternal one 
goat of blasphemy 
santanic symbology 
tear out the eyes 
leaving bloody holes total obliteration 
includes decapitation 
ritualistic goat killing 
skinned head used in ceremony 
symbolic representation of satan 
is crushed in dust 
forever 
eternal
