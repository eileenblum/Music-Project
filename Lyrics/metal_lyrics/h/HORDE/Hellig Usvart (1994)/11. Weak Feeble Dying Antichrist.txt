the end of thy reign will come 
as swift as it was established 
thy deceit is but temporary 
and therefore it cannot last 
in but a fleeting moment 
thy thone will crumble to dust 
nothing will remain 
at the hour of thy destruction 
who shall come to thine aid 
exposed for thy wrongdoings 
naked and vulnarable thou shall be 
weak 
feeble 
dying 
antichrist 
pathetic and without hope 
never to rise again 
thy skeletal remains shall become one 
with the earth
