the sun falls behind the shadowed mountains 
as darkness descends over the forest 
flames flicker in the distance 
unholy chants and footsteps can be heard 
hooded figures emerge from bushes 
flaming torches in hands 
prepare the knife and golden chalice 
for fresh blood that is to flow 
blackest hell envelopes the sight 
as the ritual commences 
a black figure comes forth 
robe drops to the ground 
a naked virgin stands within the circle 
ice winds freeze her flesh 
fear dominates her mind 
behold 
repentance is nigh 
no flesh will be pierced 
the chalice remains empty 
a virgin is spared a grim death 
as involvement is renounced 
angels assist her escape 
as she is clothed once more 
disappearing through thicket 
to a new life of freedom 
liberty
