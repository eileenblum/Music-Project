veins emptied of precious blood 
arteries dried of life source 
centuries before at skull 
time of remembrance is at hand 
consume the blood of jesus 
drink and remember the death 
of the holy majesty 
whosever believeth come and drink 
with fear and reverence do 
come bretheren 
partake 
consume the blood 
cast the mind back to that day 
when thunder shook the earth 
and the veil was rent 
come brother partake 
in the sacred remembrance
