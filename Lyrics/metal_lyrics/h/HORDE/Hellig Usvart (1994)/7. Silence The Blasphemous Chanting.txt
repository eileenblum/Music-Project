in the clearing 
a soft glow is seen 
burning embers amidst an evil gathering 
closer still 
a murmering drone echoes 
through the once tranquil forest 
chants of devilish blashphemy 
are heard from the gathering 
voices raised to the ancient serpent 
with delight and disgust he listens 
appalled by ignorant summoning 
he knows their fate if the 
evil deeds should remain 
therefore 
the chanting must cease 
their mouths must no longer 
bring forth profane utterance 
silence the blasphemous chanting 
diabolical summoning be still 
unholy chants 
terminated 
still the echoes 
nocturnal silence 
a blanket of peace covers the forest 
return to tranquility
