five pointed star of hell 
symbol of satanic goat 
appearance at the ritual site 
unholy amulet of the santanist 
sacred to the devil's child 
abomination to the mighty one 
every point 
evil stench 
every side almightly hates 
crush the star under foot 
tear the robe on which it lies 
accursed image it portays 
symbol of blasphemy will never rise 
now powerless against us 
it lay in pieces in the dust 
awaiting the fires of hell
