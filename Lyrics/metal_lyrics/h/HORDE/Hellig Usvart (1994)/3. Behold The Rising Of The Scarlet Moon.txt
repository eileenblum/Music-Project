yes 
the northern skies shall witness 
the rising of the scarlet moon 
from behind the blackened landscape 
of frozen Nordic wastes 
transformation of mountianous scenery 
to an eerie shade of crimson 
no longer a pale grey moon 
but one of fresh pure blood 
beams of luminescence fall no more to earth 
tears of mourning flow 
and weeping 
yes 
sadness envelopes the land 
soon 
eternity's gates open wide 
and time shall be no more 
generations await the sentence 
for passing though life of 
do what thou wilt 
alas 
a tragedy has befallen 
thus now reconsider 
or 
consume the wine of wrath
