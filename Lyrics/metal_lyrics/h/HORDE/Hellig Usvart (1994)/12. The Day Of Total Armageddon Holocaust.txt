at the end of time 
the moon will be as blood 
blackeed is the sun 
stars will fall to earth 
fire 
hail and blood 
rain upon the earth 
fallen star opens the abyss 
smoke released darkens the sky 
storms of thunder 
disastrous quakes 
hail pelts the earth 
plagues infest 
blood of a corpse 
becomes the sea 
assembly of kings 
gather for war 
fire descends 
devouring all 
complete destruction 
absolute annihilation 
the day of total armageddon holocaust
