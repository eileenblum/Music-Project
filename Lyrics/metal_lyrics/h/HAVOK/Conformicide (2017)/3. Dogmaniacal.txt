You don't need to have a conscience...
You're just following orders 
From the man upstairs 
The one who doesn't answer prayers 
It doesn't matter to you
That he's a power-tripping maniac
'Cause he's got you convinced 
People of other faiths should be attacked

God wants you you to obliterate your neighbor 
If he does not think like you
Take a look at any holy book
And it's crystal clear it's true 
You look with your eyes, but you fail to see 
Because you're blinded 
You're blinded 
Blinded by religious ideology 

The belief the creator will let you repent 
Is not justification to be a lunatic 
Corrupting souls, erasing minds 
It's the "light of god" that blinds 

Religious scripture calls for blood
Blood of the unbeliever 
Take a look at any holy book 
God: master deceiver 

You look with your eyes, but you fail to see
Because you're blinded 
You're blinded 
Blinded by religious ideology 

The belief the creator will let you repent 
Is not justification to be a lunatic 
Corrupting souls, erasing minds 
It's the "light of god" that blinds
