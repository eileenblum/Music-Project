[originally by Pantera]One's own Kingman, Christ person, Woman God
At battle with a mass astringent
The bond that blends the weak to the wise
It's a safe assumption
That you'd want to save me now
But I'll never face castration
For your sacred sow is left

Slaughtered [x2]

Brainwashed by me, myself influence I
Bird brained, world saver
A fake god rests dead inside you
It's a safe assumption
That you'd want to save me now
But I'll never face castration
For your sacred sow is left

Slaughtered [x2]

System destroyed, exposed and unployed, the fruit of intention
Cry for their dead, but turning their head to ignore reality's claw
Knife to your wrist, syringe in your arm is your ounce of prevention
Give what you made, and under your name on your grave is salvation

Slaughter the pig, the self righteous king for your own restoration
For your God is in your chest, and faith kills what is precious, for death is unanswered

Slaughtered [x2]

Do sin [x4]
