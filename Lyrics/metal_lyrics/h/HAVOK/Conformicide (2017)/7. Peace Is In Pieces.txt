Peace in pieces 

Never-ending war
Keeps the profits high 
Always wanting more
Millions of people die
Illegal bribery 
Keeps the money flowing 
Into the pockets of 
The frauds you vote in

War is a racket 
Paid for with your cooperation 
War is a racket 
Paid for because of misinformation 
The fighting will never cease 
As long as it is still profits over peace

Peace is in pieces 

Profiting from death 
Advancing weaponry 
Military industrial complex 
The people's enemy 
Slavery through debt 
Bleed the country dry 
Get away with murder 
Morality denied 

War is a racket 
Paid for with your cooperation 
War is a racket 
Paid for because of your exploitation 
The fighting will never cease 
As long as it is still profits over peace
