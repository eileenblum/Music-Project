I'll tell you what you need to hear 
I'll show you what I want you to see
Incapacitating you with fear
Repeat the lies until you agree
Never mind what the facts are 
I made a story that needs to sell
Journalism is an afterthought 
Keep you stupid, so you will not rebel

Opposing independent thought 
With the intention to deceive 
Misinformation is the plot 
With the intention to deceive 

[Solo - Scruggs]

Your mind was an open book 
Until I told you what to think
I'm gonna fill it to the brim 
With lies so your mind shrinks 
Submit to my train of thoughts
And I'll take you for a silly ride
Fit your mind into my mold
Constructed to misguide 

Opposing independent thought 
With the intention to deceive 
Misinformation is the plot 
With the intention to deceive 
Force feeding lies
Open your eyes

The formula: hysteria 
Followed by amnesia, gullibility, and phobia
The formula: hysteria 
Followed by amnesia, gullibility, and phobia

[Solo - Scruggs/Sanchez]

I'll tell you what you need to hear
I'll show you what I want you to see
To make you paralyzed with fear 
While I let you think your mind is free
Never mind what the facts are
I made a story that needs to sell
Journalism is an afterthought 
Keep you stupid, so you will not rebel

Opposing independent thought 
With the intention to deceive
Misinformation is the plot 
With the intention to deceive 
Force feeding lies 
Open your eyes
