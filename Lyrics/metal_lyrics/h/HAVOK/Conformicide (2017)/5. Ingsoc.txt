Ingsoc is forever 
It controls your every move 
Love and fear smashed together 
Double think to confuse 

War is peace 
Freedom is slavery 
Ignorance is strength 

Big Brother
Has total control
Founded on fear 
It's 1984

We are the priests of power
Control matter - Control mind
Thought police eternally vigilant 
Can't get away, don't even try 

War is peace 
Freedom is slavery 
Ignorance is strength 

Big Brother 
Has total control 
Founded on fear 
It's 1984

[Solo - Scruggs/Sanchez]

War is peace 
Freedom is slavery 
Ignorance is strength 

Big Brother 
Has total control 
Founded on fear 
It's 1984
