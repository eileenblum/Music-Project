They say that there's only one right way to live
They say their way's the only way 
They say that paradise is exclusive 
You don't get in if you disobey 

Claiming that they know what happens when you die 
Built up the afterlife myth last time they spoke with god
Claiming that they know what is best for me
Without a shred of doubt, claiming certainty 

They say that if you don't believe in the book
They say you're gonna burn in hell
Logic and reason altogether overlooked
Blind faith: a mental prison cell

Claiming that they know what happens when you die
Built up the afterlife myth last time they spoke with god
Claiming that they know what is best for me
Without a shred of doubt, claiming certainty

Claiming certainty 

[Solo - Scruggs]

They say that there's only one right way to live
They say their way's the only way 
Thinking for yourself is destructive 
How can you believe what they say?

Claiming that they know what happens when you die
Built up the afterlife myth last time they spoke with Allah 
Claiming that they know what is best for me
Without a shred of doubt, claiming certainty 

Claiming certainty
