People say the lord works 
In mysterious ways 
But there is no mystery 
All we see is...

War, famine, death, disease
Slavery, genocide, radioactive seas
War, famine, death, disease 
Giving the gift of suffering 
War, famine, death, disease 
Slavery genocide, radioactive seas
War, famine, death, disease 
It's all part of the masterplan

Masterplan
The masterplan

Why do people bother praying
If he's got a masterplan?
You don't get out what you put in
Otherwise we'd be free of...

War, famine, death, disease
Slavery, genocide, radioactive seas
War, famine, death, disease 
Giving the gift of suffering 
War, famine, death, disease 
Slavery genocide, radioactive seas
War, famine, death, disease 
It's all part of the masterplan

Two hands hard at work accomplish more than a million
Clasped in prayer, for a god who simply doesn't care
How does all the misery fit into the masterplan?
Could it be the idea of a loving god was created by man?

[Solo - Scruggs]

Think of all the time that's wasted
Letting religion fill
All the empty spaces
Some say is "God's will"

War, famine, death, disease
Slavery, genocide, radioactive seas
War, famine, death, disease 
Giving the gift of suffering 
War, famine, death, disease 
Slavery genocide, radioactive seas
War, famine, death, disease 
It's all part of the masterplan
