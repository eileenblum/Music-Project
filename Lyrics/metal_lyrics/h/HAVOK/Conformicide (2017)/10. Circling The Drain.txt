It's said that all great things eventually come to an end 
Equipped with this knowledge it's not hard to understand 

Humanity is at a vital point 
On the cusp of greatness
Unless we start to fix the problems of the world 
It could all be wasted (now)

We've got so many things 
That cause misery and pain
Unless we fight for change
We'll be circling the drain 

On the verge of total collapse, the whole world thrown into the fray 
Entering the final stages, but it doesn't have to be that way 
It doesn't have the be that way 

Humanity is at a vital point 
On the cusp of greatness 
Unless we start to fix the problems of the world 
It could all be wasted (now)

We've got so many things 
That cause misery and pain
Unless we fight for change 
We'll be circling the drain

Storm clouds are gathering 
The fight for humanity has just begun

[Solo - Scruggs]

Their system is shattering 
Their shackles of control are breaking off

[Solo - Scruggs]

Humanity is at a vital point 
On the cusp of greatness 
Unless we start to fix the problems of the world 
It could all be wasted (now)

We've got so many things 
That cause misery and pain
Unless we fight for change 
We are circling the drain
Circling the drain 
Circling the drain
We are
We are circling the drain
