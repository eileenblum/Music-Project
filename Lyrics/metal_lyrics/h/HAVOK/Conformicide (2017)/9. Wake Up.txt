Wake up
Wake up and think

Try thinking for yourself 
Instead of accepting what you're told 
Do you want to be stupid and controllable?
A mental revolution is just what we need
It's time to realize our strength and get angry 

Apathetic 
Why don't you get it? 
Can't you see that...
We're all are under attack? 
Soul assassin 
Mind control fashion 
Can't you see that...
They're not holding back? 

We're under attack 
We're under attack 

They don't want you to 
Wake up
Wake up and think

There is a way that we can beat this rigged game 
Look at the top of the food chain and realise who is the blame 
It's time to open your eyes and see the truth 
The greedy psychopaths running the world don't give a fuck about you

Apathetic 
Why don't you get it? 
Can't you see that...
We're all are under attack?
Soul assassin 
Mind control fashion 
Megalomaniacs 
They're not holding back 

We're under attack 
We're under attack 

They don't want you to
Wake up
Wake up and think

[Solo - Scruggs]

Wake up 
Wake up and think 
You better think for yourself 
Wake up 
Wake up and think
Snap out of it and wake up!
