Keep your distance from my lifeYou want to talk to me? You're gonna meet my fistMess with me I'll mess you upYou've never seen a temper quite like thisStay away from me right nowI got a pistol cocked and I'm pissedPull the trigger, yes I willSeeing you die would be total bliss Why am I smiling? You wonder whyCause it's time to kiss your ass goodbyeSaid it once, I'll say it twiceTonight's the night you're gonna die!Look in my eyes and you will seeTonight's your final destinyYou won't wake up again oh no!Final shot - to hell you go! Threaten my safety I'll threaten yoursAll I see now is an open doorOpening up to your thoughts of painFear is driving me insane! Getting to the boiling pointOne day soon you shall be joinedBy the dark lord in his homeVery soon it will be your own!
