OriginalityThey can't find their wayThey look up to meFor authenticityThey get no approvalFrom the pioneersAll the disappointmentBringing them to tears Identity theft!Who are you?Identity theft!Find something newYou think you're differentTo try to fit in Same pointless gameBringing them to shameI don't try to leadOthers just like to followmeSet the standards highSo their lives will occupyThe time it takes to getGet even close to it Identity theft!Who are you?Identity theft!Find something newYou think you're differentTo try to fit in
