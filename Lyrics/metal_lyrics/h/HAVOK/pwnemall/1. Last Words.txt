I feel so trapped in this building of hellWhy am I here? Nobody can tellTake me out from this big miseryPain and death is all that I see Where are my friends? They left me out hereGivers of death are closer than nearThey're taking me out to the end of my timeWhat I pay is my life as a fine Rescue me from the endless nightmaresSo few attempts and nobody caresDon't leave me here I don't want to dieThere is no chance I hate you, goodbye No remorseThey do what they pleaseCan't stand upThey severed my kneesTorn up insideThey've beaten me downNow I'm goneThe end I have found Rescue me from the endless nightmaresSo few attempts and nobody caresDon't leave me here I don't want to dieThere is no chance I hate you, goodbye
