Nuclear warfareCreate, desolateLives that are goneNo trust in fateHAVOK ariseDeath to us allThe end is hereAnswer death's sweet call FIRE!Disintegrate the fleshLeaving nothing leftNo one to save our planetNOW!It's time for us to dieLook up to the skyWatch our cities vanish Anarchist dreamExtinction of mankindLeaders are deadThere's no life to findChaos reignsDestruction mountsPeace is goneRaising body counts FIRE!Disintegrate the fleshLeaving nothing leftNo one to save our planetNOW!It's time for us to dieLook up to the skyWatch our cities vanish Nowhere to runNowhere to hideThere's no escapeSo swallow your prideFear is no moreCease to existLay your body to restYour life you shall miss FIRE!Disintegrate the fleshLeaving nothing leftNo one to save our planetNOW!It's time for us to dieLook up to the skyWatch our cities vanish
