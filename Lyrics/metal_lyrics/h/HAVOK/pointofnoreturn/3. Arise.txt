[originally by Sepultura]OBSCURED BY THE SUN
APOCALYPTIC CLASH
CITIES FALL IN RUIN
WHY MUST WE DIE?

OBLITERATION OF MANKIND
UNDER A PALE GREY SKY
WE SHALL ARISE...

I DID NOTHING, SAW NOTHING
TERRORIST CONFRONTATION
WAITING FOR THE END
WARTIME CONSPIRACY

I SEE THE WORLD - OLD
I SEE THE WORLD - DEAD

VICTIMS OF WAR, SEEKING SOME SALVATION
LAST WISH, FATALITY
I'VE NO LAND, I'M FROM NOWHERE
ASHES TO ASHES, DUST TO DUST

FACE THE ENEMY
MANIC THOUGHTS
RELIGIOUS INTERVENTION
PROBLEMS REMAIN
