Feel the noose tightening around my neck
Cannot breathe, choking on every breath

Distressed
Unrest

No end in sight
Bury me alive
Agonizing thoughts penetrate my mind
Nobody sees, nobody hears, nobody cares, nobody's there
Couldn't be any more aware that I'm living in a nightmare

This is when things go from bad to worse
But it isn't a dream, real life is more perverse

[Solo - Scruggs]

Every sound that I make just echoes back
Am I really awake?
