Are you searching for the real truth?
Every uncertainty withdrawn
I need to break it to you
The old way of thinking is dead and gone

We're not the center of the universe
Take a look and see
The contradiction pointed in reverse
I will be...

Chasing the edge
Chase the edge

Rethink the possibilities
Turn the whole world upside down
You've lost all credibility
Not a shred of honestly to be found

[Solo - Sanchez / Scruggs]

So, here we are staring into the void
The old way of thinking has been destroyed
You need to just accept the fact
That an open mind has the biggest impact
