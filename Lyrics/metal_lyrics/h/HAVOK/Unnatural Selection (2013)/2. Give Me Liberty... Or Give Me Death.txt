Cut the rotting branches of Government that stop the people from having meaning today
Stay out of my business and keep to yourself
Got to do things my own way
Minimizing freedom with your rules and regulations
A never-ending hunger to control
Choking out the life of your own population
Abusing the power you hold

Power
Control
For the Power
Control

Give me Liberty... or Give me Death
Give me Liberty... or Give me Death to our Independence
Death to those who fight
Death to our Constitution and the Bill of Rights
Showing no regard for the way things ought to be
Stripping away rights from you and me
The Founding Fathers would be rollling in their graves
If they could see what you are doing to this place
The next thing to go is our Freedom of Speech
So i'll speak up while i still can and maximize my reach

Power

Give me Liberty... or Give me Death
Give me Liberty... or Give me Death

I find it hard to believe
Some things are better left unsaid
Is this the land of the free?
Democracy is Dead

Cut the rotting branches of Government that stop the people from having meaning today
Stay out of my business and keep to yourself
Got to do things my own way
Minimizing freedom with your rules and regulations
A never-ending hunger to control

Abusing the power you hold

Give me liberty or Death

"When the people fear the government there is tyranny, when the government fears the people there is liberty"
