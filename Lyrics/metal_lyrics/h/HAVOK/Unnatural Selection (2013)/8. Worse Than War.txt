People die, but never at this rate
Genocide still happens to this day
Every time history repeats itself
The price goes up
Human life put on the shelf

Negated
Decimated
Worse than before
Worse than war

We turn a blind eye
The brutality of reality goes unseen
Dehumanize
Is becoming the routine
Every time history repeats itself
The prices goes up
And we pay too much to tell
