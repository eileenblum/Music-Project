See the gates are closing
Elimination waits
Deeming you unlift for the life just because I decide
To constantly remind you
That there's a reason why
This is where the strongest give and all the weakest die

Separate
Defective and unequal
Clean slate
But it's so unnatural

Showing indifference
Mocking perfection
Struggle for existence
Unnatural selection

Displayed above your head
Feeding you the lie
Putting you to work to profit off of your demise
Systematic servitude
Work will set you free
Arbitrary suffering, infinite misery
