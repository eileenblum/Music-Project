The very instant feelings flicker
from what's positive to what's not
that very time is when worlds collide

Let us imagine two of our worlds in tremendous velocity
collapsing from each route, swirling through
the black emptiness we refer to as the universe.
Until suddenly resorting to a crash of abnormal beauty,
Slinging pieces of dirt, ashes, and molecules of species,
dominate and subordinate, throughout the dark Eden.
A finite world finally reaching unventured thoughts
perceiving a new perspective of reality.

Reaching untouched destinations.
Revealing worlds unborn, scorched and lifeless
or so it seems...

Life once again loses its value, dipping into black,
only to sway back at that very instant.
But somewhere along the line pieces are lost,
Pieces of us.
Feelings, memories, experiences both past and present.
Even what would have come to pass in another time and place.
Lost forever in oblivion without ability and probability
to recall or recollect.
