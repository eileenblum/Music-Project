Cyrus son of Teispes
Born of great kings
Underneath the burning trees
From folded lion wings

Marching towards Median
To thwart the realm above
Legions materialize his will
For his grace and love

All hail the king of Anshan
Riding the lions wing
See the future's expansion
And what solemnity brings

Fall to his divine feet
Slaves of Astyages
Breathe your masters imminent defeat
Crawl for the king of Persia's bless

His legacy is bound to restore
Desolate faith and dreams
Through peace and hate and war
Tear down the astray regimes

Cambyses my relentless son
Mighty king and Achaemenian
We shall live to never come undone
Our fate beyond the death of men
