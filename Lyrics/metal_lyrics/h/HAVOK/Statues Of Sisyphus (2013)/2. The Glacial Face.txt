The snow and cold will reach our warmth
And follow its unique trajectory
Ice of a thousand years will mark its way
A new line of ideas will be reborn

Memories and visions are displayed before our eyes
Thoughts congealed will be replaced
Comprehensions of a dying breed convulsed
As rocks are ground from obstacle to grit

A massive catastrophe places
Its features before us
Before our very eyes
A wall of impossibilities, a glacial face
No signs - of rupture or decreasing speed
No lives - are set aside existence won't
Abide - conform, adjust to nothing
Of no avail - see the new dawn break

Mountains become hills till they become flatland
Till they become wasteland till they renew the
Surface of what was
Shape it into what will become, replenish life

When night reaches its darkest hour
The frail breed of us are naught
The new day will bring a flaming light
Reshaping the unknown

Move forward according - to the line
No deviance accepted - machinery assail
Grind the face of nature - unform the ball of clay
Relieve us the position - top of the food chain

An inner fear - of what we are capable of
Will diminish - as our ashes spread on top
We're indifferent - yet nothing stays the same
We invite ourselves - into adversity
