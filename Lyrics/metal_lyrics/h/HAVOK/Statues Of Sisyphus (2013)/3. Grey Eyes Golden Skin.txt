Raising his hand to the crucifix
Like a blade sinking through skin
Teeth are reddened, rising
Fractions ripple across the spheres
A hegemony contorted by this sickly upstart
Necrotic schisms raping paradigm

Perceive the masks, smiling
Perceive the truth, a sword
Scintillating, unsheathed in all its glory
All its kaleidoscopic fury
To strike
Cataclysm of insight
Dare the naked chasm
Yet truth is never unveiled
As if ravaged by spectres and rent asunder
Raped and beaten to the ground
The World Without End is falling to pieces
Monotonous hammer of the Gods is crushed
Against skin turned gold
The copper sun is setting at last,
Diving downwards, faster and faster
Come mirrors, distend these clouds

Trapped in the endless chain of sounds
As spoken by the uncreated mouth
Behind those cold grey eyes
A thousand smiles hide
And the new sun will never rise

This is the pit we deserve
This is the end we deserve
