The silence' oppressive waves
Awash with noise
Drowning insides
Cannot stand to compete
All lost between faces
Nothing will be regained from this

Like a shimmering cloud-carpet
Suffocating the holes of
Where blood used to flow
Insight is slowly depleted

Thoroughly and thoughtlessly
Anger never felt so right
Like some sort of veil
So strong, it will never fail

Congregations of wave-fronts
Standing in proud rows
Ready to leap into shadows
March into disintegration
With eyes sown shut and muted screams
Facets of the oblivious
It seemed like an empty street
Blood-red bricks came crashing down
A pandemonic surge of tumbling hate

Wander through gardens of spiritual afflictions
Facing through restless walls
The sweet scent of rotting apples and pyres of
decrepit leaves
With this blade
Pacing through grey labyrinths
Demon-clusterbombs and
The thick flesh of hydra-fog

Carve another path
Of snowflake identity
Never to look back
Never to realize

Carve another lie
In the face of lies
Solace is not in the Word
Nor for any to reach

Meekness inheritance
Complete irrelevance
Antagonism and enmity
The only sound solution
