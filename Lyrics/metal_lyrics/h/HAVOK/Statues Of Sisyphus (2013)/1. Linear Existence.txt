Define our species progression
Over time constitutes
An insignificant session and
A life without transgression

Futile attempts to define
Truths of space and time
From our enclosed perspective
Locked inside out trivial mind

A life along a line
Defines a present always left behind
An instant passed in seconds
Within time and space enshrined

They told me the present
Is a reflection on the future
An endless cycle of torment
Sown away in the clad universes suture
