A drowning man will always try to bring you down with him
In a sea of treachery you surely cannot swim
Not a leg to stand on, he's got deception inside of him
Picking at the scabs of trust: it will never heal

[CHORUS]
You are trapped in your web of lies
Can't break fee
Eternal despise

Cut your own throat and bleed on me watch the others run
There's no saving a man that sets himself up to be burned
No turning back now, you are already gone
Let us watch your body, as it crumbles into dust

[CHORUS]

[Solo - Sanchez]
[Solo - Chavez]

I'm so sorry for laughing at you when I saw you hit the ground
Always knew I's be the one on top, looking down
There are so many things you just could not wrap your mind around
Take a look at yourself...you'd see who's the fool

[CHORUS]
