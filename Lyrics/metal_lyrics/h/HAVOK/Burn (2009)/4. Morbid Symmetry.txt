What is done behind closed doors
Never seems to be what the audience adores
In the public eye but living a double life
What you thought was not a reason why

Fame and misfortune and it's all coming at its price
Misery is on the rise
You can disagree
But I guarantee
Morbid symmetry

[Solo - Sanchez]

Can't see straight, loosing focus
Ruining himself but doesn't even notice
Oblivious to the world around him keeping friends at bay
Self-contained death machine

Fame and misfortune and it's all coming at its price
Misery is on the rise
You can disagree
But I guarantee
Morbid symmetry

[Solo - Chavez]

Fueled by fascination
Hook, line, and sinker
Bitter and resentful, taking them down deeper
Half-crazed now rocking back and forth
Difficult to rebuild your house in the middle of a storm

Fame and misfortune and it's all coming at its price
Misery is on the rise
You can disagree
But I guarantee
Morbid symmetry
