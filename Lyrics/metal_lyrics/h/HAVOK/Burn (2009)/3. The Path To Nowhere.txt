Running short of breath,
Dwelling on my weaknesses
Turning inward to myself,
To find the strength that used to be

Looking back, it used to be,
All my problems, don't care for me
Pursuing, believing, no truth in sight, anxiety

Cannot count on others to live my life for me
Your games make me lose all dependency

It's the same old shit... just a different day
