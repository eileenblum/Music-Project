Struggling for your life
Nature the enemy
Disaster takes its coarse
Destroying everything

There's only one way out
To make it out alive
Once you're in this state
No one will survive

[Chorus:]
Kill, plague, infect

[Solo - Chavez]

Searching for your path
You've stumbled upon the dead
Frantic, searching for your peace
Finding you're who's bled

Infected with the disease
The carrier of death
Trapped in a world of emptiness
Value your last breath

[Chorus]

Put you body into a coma
Failure in your chest
Leave you weak and paralyzed
Headed for sudden death

[Solo - Chavez]
