Before Christ in a time of fear
Ideas and faith reinforce with a spear
With the crescent ruling
Flesh by flesh
Non-believers perished
Now you can see
It's ideology 
Creed is gone
It's their permanent reality

[Solo - Chavez]

Lie to the people
Those who speak see no evil
Loss of power is not an option
Surrender your spirits to us
Thirsty to reign
Everything to lose, but nothing to gain
It's ultimate supremacy
Control is maintained

[CHORUS]
Whipping, torture, killing, rotting
I have seen the abuse
Whipping, torture, killing, rotting
Rotten

Time to act
As I hear their screams
I've lost touch with reality
Killing is my specialty
Dark and hollow, I feel no sorrow
For the victims at my blade
I feel nothing as I piece their brains

[Solo - Chavez]

Lie to the people
Those who speak see no evil
Loss of power is not an option
Surrender your spirits to us
Thirsty to reign
Everything to lose, but nothing to gain
It's ultimate supremacy
Control is maintained

[CHORUS]

[Solo - Sanchez]
