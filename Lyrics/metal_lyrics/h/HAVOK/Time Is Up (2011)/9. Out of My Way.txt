[Lyrics by Sanchez]

Don't hold me back
I've got too much to lose
I'll cauterize the open wound

[Chorus:]
You obey
I said get out of my way
You obey
I said get out of my way

Pulling you out
Like a thorn in my side
Give yourself up
Like there's nothing to hide

[Chorus:]
You obey
I said get out of my way
You obey
I said get out of my way

Crash and burn
But you still never learn
Screams aren't heard
When you're crushed by the weight of the world

[Chorus:]
You obey
I said get out of my way
You obey
I said get out of my way
