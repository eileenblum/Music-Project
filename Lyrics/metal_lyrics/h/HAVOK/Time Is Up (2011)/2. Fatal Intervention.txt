Hostility means
Ready to ignite
On the offensive
Striking tonight

[Pre-Chorus:]
Like staring at the sun
The eyes begin to warp
Witnessing insane
now feel the pain

[Chorus:]
This is fatal intervention
violence rages throughout
Thrashing with the intention
Of never letting it stop

Leaving no trace
None left behind
Answer to a missing life
Psychopathic mind

[Pre-Chorus:]
Like staring at the sun
The eyes begin to warp
Witnessing insane
now feel the pain

[Chorus:]
This is fatal intervention
violence rages throughout
Thrashing with the intention
Of never letting it stop

This is Fatal Intervention
Violence rages Throughout
Thrashing with the intention
Of never letting it stop
Hostility means
Ready to ignite
On the Offensive Striking tonight

[Pre-Chorus:]
Like staring at the sun
The eyes begin to warp
Witnessing insane
now feel the pain

[Chorus: ]
This is fatal intervention
violence rages throughout
Thrashing with the intention
Of never letting it stop
