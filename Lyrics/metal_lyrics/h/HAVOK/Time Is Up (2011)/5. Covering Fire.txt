[Lyrics by Sanchez, De Los Santos]

Praying I'm not the next one at the front of the line
Ghastly voices telling me I have to stay alive
I cannot remember one day I didn't kill
Their weakening faces haunt me forever, still

[Chorus:]
Piercing through the flesh, tearing the wounds open more
Cutting them down, one by one
Consequences are for those who do not reign supreme
Killing for life I scream, "Covering fire!"

Victims lie dead, shot to the head, spitting blood back in their face
Gathering strength to make memories fade
Of the fabled master race
Peace: a part of the future
War: a thing of the past
Can this be reality...
Or just a favor no man can ask?

[Chorus:]
Piercing through the flesh, tearing the wounds open more
Cutting them down, one by one
Consequences are for those who do not reign supreme
Killing for life I scream, "Covering fire!"

Glad to be the last one at the back of the line
Ghastly voices telling me I had to stay alive
I cannot remember one day I didn't kill
Their weakening faces haunt me forever, still

[Chorus:]
Piercing through the flesh, tearing the wounds open more
Cutting them down, one by one
Consequences are for those who do not reign supreme
Killing for life I scream, "Covering fire!"
