Closing out the night
Too numb to feel
Fifteen too many, but still behind the wheel
Heeding no warning
Control denied
Reaching the end of the line

[Chorus:]
Living too fast
Throw it away
No second chance
D.O.A.

Smell the searing flesh, smell it too real
See the dead beneath the steel
A tragic sight brought from the road
No curtain call
No going home

[Chorus:]
Living too fast
Throw it away
No second chance
D.O.A.

Dead on arrival
Closing out the night
Too numb to feel
Fifteen too many, but still behind the wheel
Living too fast
Throw it away
No second chance
D.O.A.
Dead on arrival
