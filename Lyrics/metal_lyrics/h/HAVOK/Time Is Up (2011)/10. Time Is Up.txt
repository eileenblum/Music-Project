[Lyrics by Sanchez, De Los Santos, Webber]

Take a number and have a seat
We'll be with you shortly
Plead your case: appeal to me
I'll be judge and jury
On your feet for sentencing

[Chorus:]
Your time is up
Time is up
Your time is up
Time is up

Follow me into the void
Of emptiness that fills your mind
Think of all the bullshit
You will get to leave behind
On your feat for sentencing

[Chorus:]
Your time is up
Time is up
Your time is up
Time is up
[x2]
