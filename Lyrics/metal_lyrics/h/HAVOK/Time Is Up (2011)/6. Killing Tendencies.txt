[Lyrics by Sanchez]

Creeping in like rolling thunder
Can't stop yourself from going under
Seems like you don't even try
Don't care if you're dead or alive

[Chorus:]
Can you see everything
That you, once, were meant to be?
Bury the things that make you weak
Killing all your tendencies

Look out, this thing's about to explode
Cancerous choices make danger wherever you go
You don't even bat an eye...
Don't care if you live or die

[Chorus:]
Can you see everything
That you, once, were meant to be?
Bury the things that make you weak
Killing all your tendencies

It swept through like rolling thunder
Just one strike to take you under
Seems like you didn't even try
Doesn't matter now 'cause you're not alive

[Chorus:]
Can you see everything
That you, once, were meant to be?
Bury the things that make you weak
Killing all your tendencies
