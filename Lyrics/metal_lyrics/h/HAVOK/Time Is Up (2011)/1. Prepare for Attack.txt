Rise Up and take Control
Revolution, execution, the solution, can't let it go
Fighting, buting, taking over
Crusing the powers that be

[Chorus:]
Let them know
Let 'em know we're coming back
Lock and load
Prepare for Attack

Striking with deadly force
Taking the fascist dictator down with no remorse
Cutting of the head of state
Decapitated land: we infiltrate
Taking no shit from overseas
Stomp out the Infection
Prevent the disease
Fighting, biting taking over
Empire slows to a crawl

[Chorus:]
Let them know
Let 'em know we're coming back
Lock and load
Prepare for Attack
