[Lyrics by Sanchez]

Talkin' shit don't mean a thing
When you've got nothing else to bring
You criticize, you patronize; to me it's asinine
Shut it up
Who gives a fuck?
What you think
Or what you thought
Everything you have to say
Doesn't matter anyway

[Chorus:]
In this world of efficiency
There's no room for mediocrity
Jealousy runs deep in his eyes
Not hard to find a scumbag in disguise

Picking at another bone
You're entering the danger zone
Cutting heads with all the rest
With no skills to be the best
Knowing this, why do you try?
'Cause you need to justify
Making your opinions heard
Even though they're just absurd

[Chorus:]
In this world of efficiency
There's no room for mediocrity
Jealousy runs deep in his eyes
Not hard to find a scumbag in disguise

Talking out your ass again
It could be a mortal sin
Life will be all black and blue
When you get what's coming to you
Shut it up
Who gives a fuck?
What you think
Or what you thought
Everything you have to say
Doesn't matter anyway

[Chorus:]
In this world of efficiency
There's no room for mediocrity
Jealousy runs deep in his eyes
Not hard to find a scumbag in disguise
