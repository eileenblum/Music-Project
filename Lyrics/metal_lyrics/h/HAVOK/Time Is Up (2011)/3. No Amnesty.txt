Taking away all human rights
Terror is the plan
Sever ties of decency
Dagger in hand

[Pre-Chorus:]
Promise of an afterlife
If it feeds the appetite
Reeking of death and decay

[Chorus:]
Beating on the door of vengeance
You'll never get away
Not this time
No Amnesty

Stabbing at the liberties
Of people like you and I
Faith holds a special reason
Of telling why they die

[Pre-Chorus:]
Promise of an afterlife
If it feeds the appetite
Reeking of death and decay

[Chorus:]
Beating on the door of vengeance
You'll never get away
Not this time
No Amnesty

Promise of an afterlife
If it feeds the appetite
Promise of an afterlife
Can you feed the appetite?
Taking creed out of the picture
What do you see?
A lunatic with an altered sense
Of life's reality

[Pre-Chorus:]
Promise of an afterlife
If it feeds the appetite
Reeking of death and decay

[Chorus:]
Beating on the door of vengeance
You'll never get away
Not this time
No Amnesty
