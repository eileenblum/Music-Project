[Lyrics by Sanchez, Webber]

Can't make a living
Off of stronger minds
Prey on the weak ones
Poison their lives

[Pre-Chorus:]
A Cleric with a plot
To take it all and leave the poor ones to rot
Can't you read his persona? He's taking over

[Chorus:]
Corruption slips deep through the cracks
Tells you how to act
Sacrifice your minds
And then you die

Spread it out to new land
Setting the trap
Crossing all bounderies
To grow the money stack

[Pre-Chorus:]
A Cleric with a plot
To take it all and leave the poor ones to rot
Can't you read his persona? He's taking over

[Chorus:]
Corruption slips deep through the cracks
Tells you how to act
Sacrifice your minds
And then you die

The fourth circle of hell is reserved for the greedy bastards
Who can't make sense of their own teachings
Tied up with their face to the ground
The are the personified Averice
