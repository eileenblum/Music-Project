the eight plague roamed 

born within eastern wind 
from the dark prayers of Moses 
they came to obliterate sin 
as a swarm of locusts 

covering the skies and 
casting all into darkness 
consumed was the land 
annahilated was iniquity 

release them! 
release them all 
release them! 
release them all again! 

sounds of the swarm, the arousing alarm 
one tiny entity in thousands 
a whole anatomy built to consume 
the idea of the living 

exhume the thoughts of him 
in motion with us, within 
release the wrath of our dead prophet 
let him unleash again, a force 
from which we will never regain 

and as the heavens rain down 
we stand by watching 
the world in her final gown 
seeing her last sun setting 

so, as the silence arrive 
and there is morning again 
the last day of time dawns 
and humans shall never more reign
