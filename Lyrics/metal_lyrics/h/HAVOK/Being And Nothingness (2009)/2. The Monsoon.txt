the rains reached the the land
like a cold cleansing hand
amidst flaming fiery fields
surrounding the saints of sand

water revives the chasms
sparkling, cleansing, healing
enables the human phantasm
seeing, touching, feeling

the invigorating air
reanimates, recreates, energizes
ocean floors and mountain lairs
fuels our human devices

gaze far above the clouds
beyond your static animation
seek answers in the soil and shrouds
practice powerless meditation

whenever wisdom may enter
the obvious will suffice
behold the trees as your mentor
solitude is the price

rewards of isolation seems
the vast beauty of the elements
the fundamental constituent dreams
