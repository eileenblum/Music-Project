i'm evolving upwards, forwards 
running, seeing, feeling 
i shift from dust to water to dust 
in all my grace i'm kneeling 

the peace of danger left behind 
easliy, willingly, passionately 
i comprehend the weakness of my kind 
and embrace all the ways i'm confined 

i'm awaken by sudden realization 
of my pyrrhic victory 
can anyone vindicate my creation 
or am i nothing but this contradictory 

i'm a boulder in a world of water 
a petrified statue in rush hour 
paralyzed, numb, cold 
a king of gravel released from his power 

flickering vivid colour schemes 
changing from black to white to black 
amongst the side-scenes screams 
of cold bodies aching to attack 

the great prize of life 
to vanquish and to be vanquished 
a gold medallion in chains 
weighing a hundred tons
