walking flesh, routing bodies 
mindless food for the lions 
harvest the men from the fields 
kill the flame that keeps us burning 

the vanguard of excessive humanity 
let me feel free 
juggernauts of all that is rotten 
let me feel ease 

the time of torment is here 
exiled from life, we turn to death 
for all we know he is all and 
the one to never turn away 

open yourselves to the coming storm 
feel the torrent rip and pull 
the excessive surge of pain 
no water but flesh and blood will rain 

you are the neverborn 
you, the walking vermin 
you, the torn 
you are the perpetual plague 

we are humanity 
we are the world 
and when we die 
you die with us 

floating cyanide souls we are 
trapped in a lingering existence 
consuming ourselves with fear 
burning with anguish 

a part of you aching to die 
another struggling to live 
this relentless inner war 
will keep the plague walking 

force fed with grime and pride 
he walks this way, this earth 
and when he turns to sand 
another golem is summoned 

delay my path to grace 
void the concept of this now 
hold my time to prove myself 
and bring forth my executioner 

the fierce creator of life will set 
and when he sets he shall shroud the world 
encrypt the universe 
kill us, the plague 

and when this sequence is complete 
another awaits, another dream 
wake up 
so you may sleep again 

far in the distance 
another Utopia's rising 
the future is recovering 
from its passed fall from grace
