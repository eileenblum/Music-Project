vapors rising from the ground 
from all around me towards the sky 
forming shapes and clouds 
creating illusions miles up high 

outlining beasts from stars 
by drawing lines from venus to mars 
i see unicorns and dwarfs 
gazing pitiful upon our human wars 

on my knees beneath i fall 
staring back upon it all 
remembering my omniscient god 
myself and my will to enthrall 

grasping the soothing soil around me 
with all of my strength 
all alone beneath the stars marquee 
keeping the world at arms length 

and as the night crawl closer 
the darkness gets beneath my skin 
thick floating liquid black 
soaks my hair and satiates my within 

grasping the soothing soil around me 
with all of my strength 
all alone beneath the stars marquee 
keeping the world at arms length 

vapors rising from the ground 
from all around me towards the sky 
forming shapes and clouds 
creating illusions miles up high 

outlining beasts from stars 
by drawing lines from venus to mars 
i see unicorns and dwarfs 
gazing pitiful upon our human wars 

filled with frantic regard for the skies 
my new black blood excites me 
benighted and enclosed in disguise 
i set out to find the key 

far across the planes i see the sun rise 
releasing my shivers, illuminates my mind 
i raise my palms to the skies 
and receive visions of mankind 

on my knees beneath i fall 
staring back upon it all 
remembering my omniscient god 
myself and my will to enthrall 

grasping the soothing soil around me 
with all of my strength 
all alone beneath the stars marquee 
keeping the world at arms length 

and as the night crawl closer 
the darkness gets beneath my skin 
thick floating liquid black 
soaks my hair and satiates my within 

grasping the soothing soil around me 
with all of my strength 
all alone beneath the stars marquee 
keeping the world at arms length 

now it has been unraveled 
from the symphony of the dark 
i can see myself and the road i've traveled 
the future and my voyages yet to embark
