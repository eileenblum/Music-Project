A covered sky where clouds disperse
Their fading bodies unveil a starlit sky
And as eons of infinity gaze upon me
My body ascends into orbit

I observe humility and inhumanity
On acres of dying life
Dried up lands split apart
Facing an inevitable end

As larvas grew we eroded
In constant evolve, in fear dissolve
I detest our entire existence
We embrace the calamity

Shears cut the words from an open mouth
That assent the coming storm
We omit the oblivious 
And nurture the frenzy taking form

Tear through the veil
Free whats hiding
Disintegrate from flesh and ascend
Relent and then amend
A post human organism
Without the ability to think

Your I, Your instinct
A conscious corrosion

Define the boundaries of your mind
And transcend
Far from the misaligning
Burrowed larvas crawl

An overwhelming choking anathema
Contained in flesh embraced in fear
Sleep, wake up, feed, sleep
Close your eyes and sleep

A covered sky where clouds disperse
Their fading bodies unveal a starlit sky
And as eons of infinity gaze upon me
My body ascends into orbit
And I observe the humility
A covered sky where clouds disperse
Their fading bodies unveal a starlit sky
And as eons of infinity gaze upon me
My body ascends into orbit
And I observe the inhumanity

Your I, Your instinct
A conscious corrosion

We are drifting, drifting further away
Further away from what's been so close
And as life comes to stop
We will know we've been wrong
