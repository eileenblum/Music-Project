for centuries pushed aside 
the abominations of man 
with hands and feet tied 
they were forced from this land 

the boiling blood of the mob 
fierce as wolves, hunting 
feel your left-hand heart throb 
as the path of man you are shunting 

rest now in the black 
find shelter in the void 
let them fear you're coming back 
a rampageous attack 

dwelling silent in the dark 
watching them from afar 
awaiting their grand arrival 
preparing the coming war 

sharpen your teeth, your mind 
hone the illusion of godspeed 
it all we shall amend 
when into oblivion we are sent 

wake up your young 
make them see forth, see light 
the song of gods sung 
minds clean, limbs alert 

they day came soon 
a fortnight from home 
digging their tomb 
soon we will hear the humans moan 

with mind and intellect 
they meet flying stones 
with torches of words 
they scorched their bones 

we, the deviants 
the educated, the cultivated 
are here now, in the bone 
on the blue blood throne 

condemned to the stake 
you idiot savants 
your blood shall fill the river lake 

your race enslaved servants 
grand coming visions 
the light of day, here 

we have made the evasions, equations 
abolished the ecliptic 

whore
