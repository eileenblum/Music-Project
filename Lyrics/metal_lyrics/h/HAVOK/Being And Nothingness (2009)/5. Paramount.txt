as i gaze upon the world 
i see the throne curled 
around all of the centuries 
as times' penitentiaries 

piercing the black sky, the 
glowing worlds from afar 
upon the quiet crest high 
the spirit of the perpetual star 

with perspectives wide, the 
flowing well of sapience 
soon enter wisdom and pride 
to offer you guidance 

provide us the paramount 
a premonitory note 
of what to derive 

across the ocean floor 
from a simple organisms perspective 
none but the one struggle 
our worlds future prospective 

the jurisdiction of life 
nothing but the requirement to die 
for this perpetual strife 
only one may deny 

the wise walks with the horizon 
passes mountains and oceans 
floats past quakes and rifts 
grasping the world with invisible motions 

he who sleeps with the clouds 
and cries with the rain 
hides within the shrouds 
of the rare and the arcane 

the instinct of self-preservation 
thoughts with eyes on the sun 
is lost with human depravation 
and shall soon be undone
