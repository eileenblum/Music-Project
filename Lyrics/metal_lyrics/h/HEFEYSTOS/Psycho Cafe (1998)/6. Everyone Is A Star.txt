I am the harloth that shaketh death.
This shaking giveth the peace of satiate lust
Immorality jetteth from my skull and music from my vulva
Immorality jetteth from my vulva also,
For my whoredom is a sweet scent like a seven - stringed instrument,
Played into god the invisible,
The all ruller,

That goeth along giving the shrill scream of orgasm.
[Aleister Crowley from the cry of the 2nd Aethyr, which is called Arn, "The vision and the voice".]
