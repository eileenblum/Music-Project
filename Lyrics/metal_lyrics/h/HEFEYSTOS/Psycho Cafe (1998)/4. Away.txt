You lie
You drift shaded
Deeper and deeper
Further and further away
Into my hands
I pour your body
I dance, I tread, i run
You flare up

Leaves of eyelids
Rustle of lips
And a song
In the wind
Everything glitters
Trembles
And  explodes

Then
Silently
Less silent
Blind world
Still further
Like a sunrise
Gets pale

The tint of summer melted in wax
