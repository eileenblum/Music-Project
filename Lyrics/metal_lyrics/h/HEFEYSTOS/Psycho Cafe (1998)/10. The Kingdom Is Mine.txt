Vassal of truth
Liegman of life
On seven thrones
Earthly King
I'm coming back
To take my revenge

Thousand army stands behind me
Ravage and hunger
Fire behind me
Stench of sulphur
Armageddon!

Vexilla Regis Predeunt Inferni!

Seven swords
Into heaven's eye
Seven wild birds
Of storm's heart
Seven sins
And seven virtues of life
For the seven years of Egypt
For the seven daughters of Babalon
For the seven fires
For the seven hills of Rome

Hundred times
Bury the dagger!

Let the crosses bloom again
From Normandy to Nile
Blessed are who hear
'Cause blood is theirs
And the kingdom is mine
