'For your hair was full of roses,
and my flesh was full of thorns,
And the midnight came upon us
worth a million crazy morns.'
[Aleister Crowley]

I opened the abyss
I, child of Saturn
Brother of my resoluteness
In amatory gratification
I touch the bitch's of passion

I opened the Third eye
The blazing one, put on the
Scarlet woman's bosom
In crimson submerged
'The first blood in the cup of our lady, Babalon!'
Sages whisper...and my tear

I open the heart
Of Psychonaut - traveller in eternity
Looking for home, I don't own
Paralysing bliss of the light I found
Carezza!
