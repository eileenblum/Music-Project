Come
Come to me
The rats of mine
Kids of boards
Of drunk suburbs
From the city of the world
A maggoty flower

Forther
Further do swim
In unconscious gutter
Of your crimes

But when
'Do crawl'
I shall order
From shit to shit
From Dirt to dirt
And on your knees
Get fuckin' out
Out of moral dens

Because
It's my who does
Break, trample and cross over
So come
Come with me
To meet your fine slaughter

It's high time
The end's feast celebration
Remains!
