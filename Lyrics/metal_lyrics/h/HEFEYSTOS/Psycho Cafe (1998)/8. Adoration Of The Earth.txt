In sacrament of life
I drink off your lips
My communion
Fire of your womb
I thrust with ice

Faster
Deeper
Higher up
Apple - tree
Creeps and blooms

Unexpired spring of life
And crimson
Which inflames
Waters
And turns the cross round

Take
Take this fruit
Choose!
Be the suffering for him
Be his cross
Be the wormwood, the spear, the stone
And stand up!

Bearing a burde of sin
Blazing with sin
Immortal in sin
Naked, beautiful, nameless
And innocent
Like a bird
Which longs for flying
Soar into bliss pleasure

Be my way, my truth, my life!
Be the gratification of my desire!
