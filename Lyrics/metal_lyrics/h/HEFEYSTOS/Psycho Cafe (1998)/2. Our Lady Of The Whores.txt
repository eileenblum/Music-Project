I have married prostitution
When I'd killed of Seraph
She came to me
Naked and delightful
And grateful for my choice
Soughin' the body
Like an ocean the skin

She squatted down
Ripped up her tights
And fell in my lips
Not profaned by the god's body
And when she stood up
I went down
In front of the temple of her lust

She gave me an eternity - a moment in my lips
I gave her a while - an eternity in her bowls

"Yes, my love
And when I have to

Stand up and go out
to live or from your womb
I'd rather enter Death
And rot or alternately between your lips'
