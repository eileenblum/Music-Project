I am the fear that lives inside you
I am the fear that walks behind you
I am the lust that kills you
I am the pain that fills you up

I am your blood that flows
I am your god who dies
I am your fading life
I am your wounded love

Drowning in the wine
I am falling to hell
No more forgiveness
No more creation
The road of per-version
Is the way to salvation
So you gonna bleed for me
Right now!

Come closer honey
You'll enjoy it
You gonna love it
I know you want it
