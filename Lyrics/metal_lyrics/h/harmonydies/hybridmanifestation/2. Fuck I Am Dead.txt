In The Veins No Throbbing Blood
Pulse Beat Going On Zero Line
Open Mouth And Fixed Look
Hold One`s Breath Forever

Fuck I Am Dead
Fuck I Am Dead
Fuck I Am Dead
Fuck I Am Dead

Visions Passing Off
Enter To Mortuary
Now It's Time To Decide
To Mend One's Way

Body Going Back To Origin
Curious Look Of Coroner
Complete Body Searching
Transported On A Stretcher

Fuckin' Layed Out In Stage
Wrapped In A Shroud
Zipper Closed Over The Face
Before The Amusing Crowd

Dead Full Capacity

Last Part Of My Destiny
