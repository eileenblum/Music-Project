[Queiroz/Carlo]

I want to know what is behind your lonely soul
To understand all of the secrets of your life
Forbidden dreams lived only inside my head
But time has come to say 'is now or never'
Open up your eyes
[Brigde:]
Darkened skies above us turn the days into the long nigths
Crashing my lonely heart, you came into my life
Walking around, to nowhere, every night I search for someone
But I will search forever, can you realize?
I still don't know what is behind your lonely soul
But time has come to say 'is now or never'
Don't tell me another lie
[Bridge:]
Darkened skies above us turn the days into the long nigths
Crashing my lonely heart, you came into my life
Walking around, to nowhere, every night I search for someone
But I will search forever, can you realize?
[Chorus:]
We can make it happen ,and we can change the story
When we find the reasons no one will turn us apart
With some courage and feelling we'll break all the walls
And this feelling is growing stronger
Conquesting all around.
