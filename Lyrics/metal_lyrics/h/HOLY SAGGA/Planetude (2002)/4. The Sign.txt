[Queiroz/Carlo]

Walking down the park
Cold wind blows against the faces
Living all alone
Every day a broken heart
Feels the fire and crumbles down
And tomorrow I'll never know...

You may find in the streets what you want
So take care, now your life is in my hands
Crime and violence (are) in every place where I go
The city cries for souls and people die without a chance
[Bridge:]
You must fight another day and try to stay away from here
Passion and pride I never had, you need to set me free
[Chorus:]
Can you see the sign of end of times, my friend...?
