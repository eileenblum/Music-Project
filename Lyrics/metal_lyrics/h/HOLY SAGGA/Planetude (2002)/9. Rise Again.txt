[Queiroz/Carlo]

Stand! Look around today
By your hands, it's time to make them free
Beyond the sun, crying for the sky
Nothing must keep you alive
The firing sun, a blinding gun
Watches while you die
[Bridge:]
Always livin' in pain
My fight (will) last forever
Now, hear the sound, feel the flame
The soldiers of sky are falling together
Taking lives...
[Chorus:]
Someday I'll find someone to blame
The blaze of the glory will rise again
[Bridge:]
Always lives in pain
My fight lasts forever
Now, hear the sound, feel the flame
The soldiers of sky are falling together
Taking lives...
[Chorus:]
Someday
I'll find someone to blame
The blaze of the glory will rise again.
