[Queiroz/Carlo]

I never will betray
I never will be lost or down
I ever will be fighting for our cause
I won't be the last unfair
I don't want you close your eyes for all around you
[Bridge:]
Soldiers of dawn (we'll) never have rest in this place
The battle keeps march on
I never will betray
I never will be lost or down
I ever will be fighting for our cause
I won't be the last unfair
I don't want you close your eyes for all around you
[Bridge:]
Soldiers of dawn (we'll) never have rest in this place
The battle keeps march on
[Chorus:]
Soldiers keep (on) fighting, someday our treasure,
It must be found
And this inner flame keeps lighted and
Burning inside our hearts.
