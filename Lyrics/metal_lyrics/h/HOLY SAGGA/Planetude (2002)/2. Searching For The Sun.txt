[Queiroz/Carlo]

All of the actions
Become reactions
Don't give up, cos' hard aims
Are jewels of hard ways
[Bridge:]
Someday I will
Start up my final run
While the bad guys are crawling
And this new golden time
Will shine, yes, forevermore
[Chorus:]
To get power and glory I knew
I had to leave unconcrete some desires
But just for a while
Cause my great morning is near
I'm searching for the sun.
