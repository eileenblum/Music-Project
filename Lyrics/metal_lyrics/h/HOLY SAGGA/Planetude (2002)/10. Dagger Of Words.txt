[Queiroz/Carlo]

Dusky visions posses my body
A craving for blood seduces my soul
My tongue is like a dagger
Claiming for justice, I must hold it.
This is part of the night
When graveyard gates are open
And awaiting for every soul
That walks between Heaven and Hell
[Bridge:]
How far can a man go to restore his name?
How far can a man go?
Yes, I could realize
Terrible actions that could cloud a bright dawn
And the sun would not shine
To see the fields full of blood
[Bridge:]
How far can a man go to restore his name?
How far can a man go?
[Chorus:]
I will silent my savage soul
And lay down the peace deep in my heart
Cause I'm condemned by filial love
For sure I'll be cruel.
