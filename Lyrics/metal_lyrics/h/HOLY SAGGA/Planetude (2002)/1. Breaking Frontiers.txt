[Queiroz/Carlo]

When I look at the fire
And see the flame
It's burning all souls of mankind
No thrills, no desires (but)
My feelings today
I know it's getting stronger than before
[Brigde:]
Look all the fire
Mind gets inspired
You must fight to concrete your desires
Determination
Flies from dimensions
No one finds but still we go
[Chorus:]
I pray (for) so long and I know
The night comes and brings
The gleams of the fire
My quest starts and the time is near
But wishing and marching we can go
Breaking frontiers.
