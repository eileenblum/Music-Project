[Queiroz/Carlo/Duarte]

A changing horizon
The future starts another day
That's falling in the silence
I am awaiting the moment, the time to be free again
And my vengeance is calling
[Bridge:]
Dust in the night covers all things that I can see
To the souls I pray
Now I'm back again
Can you try look back at the things that you made someday?
Another horizon
Is coming so fast and I will see
Your face in the mirror
I'm still awaiting
I have no more time than I can live
I want the revenge for the time that I lost
[Chorus:]
Fly away
Every place where believes flow
Find a way to the stars
Overtaking the limits
To find my world, my desires
Fly until the dawn.
