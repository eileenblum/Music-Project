[Based on âPrelude in D Minorâ by Johann Sebastian Bach]

We were born to fly
Leaving our minds
Born to rise
We were born to fly

I am the truth
I am king
I am image of men
So I'm the creator here and then

I am the force
I am brute
I am everything
There is not one legend I'm not in

Blood upon the battlefields
Our time has come
Faith will be our riot shield until this threat is gone
We will stand as one

We were born to fly
Leaving all behind
Born to rise
We are passing by
Born to fly
Leaving our minds
Born to rise
We're born to fly

Then from the dark
The abyss
From the evil within armies of the dead will rise again
But with a heart
With a soul and with everything that we have
We'll fight them back

Blood upon the battlefields
Our time has come
Faith will be our riot shield
Until this threat is gone
We will stand as one

We were born to fly
Leaving all behind
Born to rise
We are passing by
Born to fly
Leaving our minds
Born to rise
We were born to fly

Take a chance
rearrange
Mesmerize
We were born to fly
Leaving our minds
Born to rise and born to fly

A journey before
Just a light-year away
All that we know ending today
Starting to fade into light

A darker shade of this tale that we all know
But we dare not to tell where we go

This is where we belong

We were born to fly
Leaving all behind
Born to rise
We are passing by
Born to fly
Leaving our minds
Born to rise
We were born to fly

Take a chance
Rearrange
Mesmerize

We were born to fly
Leaving our minds
Born to rise
We were born to fly
