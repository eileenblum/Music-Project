[Based on âMondscheinsonate (Piano Sonata No. 14 in C Sharp Minor)â by Ludwig van Beethoven]

Eyes wide open to the black
And into night shades I go
Down to earth and back again
Into the void I roam
Black winds blowing
Fate is showing
That this will never end
Fear is growing
All men knowing
That they will come again

No sleep
I see sunsets lasting
Feeding my insomnia

You will enlighten me!
Luna! Luna! Into the night
Your light will find me
Luna! Luna! Into the night
Then I will call you
Luna! Luna! Into the night
And I will live through you

So I am
Still I cannot understand
I am allowed to see
All these peaceful lands
Shine bright for me
Never I will sleep

No rest
I see endless nightfalls
Painting my utopia

You will enlighten me!
Luna! Luna! Into the night
Your light will find me
Luna! Luna! Into the night
Then I will call you
Luna! Luna! Into the night
And I will live through you

When days are passing by
Will I be dead by night?
When clouds roll by
I see you, Luna
Light your light
I reach out for the night
This time I will survive
Black rain and red moon light
Luna, I'm alive

No sleep
I see endless nightfalls
Painting my utopia

Luna! Luna! Into the night
Your light will find me
Luna! Luna! Into the night
Then I will call you
Luna! Luna! Into the night
And I will live through you

When days are passing by
Will I be dead by night?
When clouds roll by
I see you, Luna
Light your light
I reach out for the night
This time I will survive
Black rain and red moon light
Luna, I'm alive
