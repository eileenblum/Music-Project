[Based on âDas wohltemperierte Klavierâ Prelude in C Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach]

I never meant what I've become
But still it feels so right
You'll never know where I am from
And how I feel inside

I remember every heartbeat blown for you
Compared to you I am so much more than true

Holier than thou
Let all my kingdoms come
All my kingdoms wait for you
So I'll do

Let all my kingdoms come
From neon black to darker blue
I curse you
And all my kingdoms come

Still I'm on this path
And what have you done?
Judging blindly
Blaming me
Still I'm here and never, ever, never
I'll run away

One song killed is birthing three
I remember every heartbeat blown for you
Predetermined is what I've to do
Holier than thou

Let all my kingdoms come
All my kingdoms wait for you so Iâll do
Let all my kingdoms come
From neon black to darker blue
I curse you
And all my kingdoms come

In fear you cower to sneer at me in times you turn away
You have no power
You'll never see
What songs and words can say

I remember every heartbeat blown for you
Every bother you have put me through
Holier than thou

Let all my kingdoms come
All my kingdoms wait for you so Iâll do
Let all my kingdoms come
From neon black to darker blue
I curse you
And all my kingdoms come
