[Based on âLâArlÃ©sienneâ by Georges Bizet]

It is a long way home
I know
I have been told
Still it is hard to fulfill
The prophecy unfolds

I have been floating on a raft of clouds
Foreshadowing evolution
But all this years there has been this doubt
I am part of revolutions

Carry on
And suddenly a whole new world for us to see
"Believe in thee" was hammered into me
Overcoming every night in me

From these lands it is a long way home
Through the unknown I ride
From the end to where it all began
A long way home

Through the gates of doom
Where fires burn
Endless cave of gloom
The wheel still turns

Thinking of somewhere of something beyond these lies
From the end of time it's a long way home
I am part of evolution
So I will return to where all began

Revolution never ends
Hold on and suddenly a whole new world for us to see
âBelieve in theeâ was hammered into me
Overcoming every night in me

What weâll go through is agony
Side by side we are fighting eternally
Glorious our victory
And faith within is company

From these lands it is a long way home
Through the unknown I ride
From the end to where it all began
A last battle I fight for me
For the truth and for a moment beyond
From the end it is a long way home
A long way home

What we'll go through is agony
Side by side
We are fighting eternally
Glorious our victory
And faith within is company

From these lands it is a long way home
Through the unknown I ride
From the end to where it all began
A last battle
I fight for me
For the truth and for a moment beyond
From the end
It is a long way home
A long way home
