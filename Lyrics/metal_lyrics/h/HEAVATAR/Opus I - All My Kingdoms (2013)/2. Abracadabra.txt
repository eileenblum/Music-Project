[Based on âCaprices No. 24â by NicolÃ² Paganini]

I've been crucified
About a 1000 times
I've been sacrificed
Over and over again
I've been faulted for
600 sins and way more
I will overcome everyone

You point at me, you accuse me
I don't give a fuck
Why should I wait for
Your permission to end?

I will proceed
I will go on
And I will show you
I am the sorcerer
Magic in hands

Abracadabra!
Banned you are
Abracadabra!
Leave and go away
Abracadabra!
So I scream my
Abracadabra!
Turning night to day
There a sun will rise
I'll never go astray

"Somehow oversized"
Is what you realized
You've been terrorized
Over and over again
By my self-esteem
And what you once did to me
Will never happen again

You point at me, you accuse me
I don't give a fuck
Why should I wait for
Your permission to end?
I will proceed
I will go on
And I will show you I am the sorcerer, magic in hands

Abracadabra!
Banned you are
Abracadabra!
Leave and go away
Abracadabra!
So I scream my
Abracadabra!
Turning night to day
There a sun will rise
I'll never go astray

And calm I'll be
Calm I'll stay
Never I'll contradict
I'll carry out my duty
Right to the end

But you will not tell me
You won't even ask
Why I call myself a sorcerer
Magic in hands
I will not bend!

Abracadabra!
Banned you are
Abracadabra!
Leave and go away
Abracadabra!
So I scream my
Abracadabra!
Turning night to day
There a sun will rise
I'll never go astray
