Behind the mask you hide yourself
Behind the mask you invent yourself
Your thirst for power is immense
Your only repellent object!

You camouflage yourself between the people
The rest of the world for you doesn't matter
Because, of course, you are the better
Your existence is fucking ridiculous!

With your fucking gall you decide for the other
The stupids and the burks follow your voice
Nobody will pull away your mask
Nobody will know your real fucking face

I will search for you! And I will find you!
Behind the mask! I will slay you!
In front of my eyes your fucking existence is fucking useless
Full of disgrace your unsound mind is fruit of pure madness
I will search for you! And I will find you!
Behind the mask! I will slay you!
