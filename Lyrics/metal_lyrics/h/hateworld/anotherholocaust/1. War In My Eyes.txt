I am so happy this day is very pretty because I am going to die
Because today, I can say I have destroyed the U.S.A!
War in my eyes war in my eyes only war in my eyes!

I am having breakfast I must dress me more fast because I am going to die
Because today, I can say I have destroyed the U.S.A!
War in my eyes war in my eyes only war in my eyes!

I am preparing the bomb I am preparing our tomb!
I am just a kamikaze I am not James Bond!
War in my eyes war in my eyes only war in my eyes!
