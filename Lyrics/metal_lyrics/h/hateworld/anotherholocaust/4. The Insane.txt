The insane is among us he looks at you with slimy eyes
He talks to you about fraternity and love fucking sermons about false mercy
In his church the insane become powerful he submits his servants hypnotized
Promising them the eternal life requiring obedience since he will die
Interfering in your thoughts he has been able to manipulate you
To show you the way you cannot live now without him

He sails in a sea of gold but remains a poor servant of god
Nobody will know his fucking nature
If I will go to hell you are a demon so pure!
Never allow him to drive you into darkness
Because it is a trap it is always forthcoming
Your fucking reasons are now too much evident
You do not deserve to live in this world!

Crucify the insane so he will can redeem his sin
Crucify the insane bring it back from where it came
Crucify the insane so he will can redeem his sin
Crucify the insane bring it back from where it came
