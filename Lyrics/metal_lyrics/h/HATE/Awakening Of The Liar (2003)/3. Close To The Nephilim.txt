Where the blood forever rains,
They speak within my soul,
Where time devours the stars,
Spread your wings and let them go,
This everlastingness traverseth time for million years,

Rule my mind!

Behold, I'll show you a mystery,
We shan't sleep but shall be changed,
At the last sound of the trumpet,
The dead will be raised speaking my name,
This everlastingness traverseth time for endless sacrifice,

Rule my mind!

Fathers! Your enemies are blind in the depth of Sheol,
Future! Belongs to your minds that control this world,
You are back! Once upon a time from the grace you fell,
The Nephilim! Your voices echo in the eternal sea of mayhem!

Enemies! They'll be trodden down as the mire on the streets,
Suffering! They'll be as nothing as the thing of nought,
Spirits! Your spirits soar to the land where they're kings,
Hatred! With Satan at your side you rule this fucking world!

Rule my mind!

The pain of god makes us strong,
His suffering makes us fly,
Killed god, where's his glory?
Killed god so where's the light?
This everlastingness traverseth time for million fucking years!

Enemies! They'll be trodden down as the mire on the streets,
Suffering! They'll be as nothing as the thing of nought,
Spirits! Your spirits soar to the land where they're kings,
Hatred! With Satan at your side you rule this fucking world!
