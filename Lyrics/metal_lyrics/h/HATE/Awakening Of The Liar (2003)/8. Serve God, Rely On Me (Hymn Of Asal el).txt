Don't run away form the spiritual pain,
Always exalt me down in your heart,
You will breathe my war and join my hordes,
Where spirits hold the ancient force,
The ones who cherish are the ones who will go,
Into the ashes of a tortured world,
Your heart is beating for the last time,
Your sins against god I justify,

Serve! Serve god, rely on me!
Serve! Serve god, rely on me!

When the Evil crash your innocent mind,
Your every sin is justified,
Worship me to the end of your days,
Your only way is to go my way,

Serve! Serve god, rely on me!
Serve! Serve god, rely on me!

Be warned against your god's insidious mind,
That has not won over death and sin,
I am the essenxe of the underworld,
I am the first and the last I am!

Don't run away form the spiritual pain,
Always exalt me down in your heart,
You will breathe my war and join my hordes,
Where spirits hold the ancient force,

Serve! Serve god, rely on me!
Serve! Serve god, rely on me!
