No endless torment, no punishment for the evil life,
No ritual, no name of god, no sacrifice,
There'll be no next life, no heaven's bliss, no prize you'll see,
What you worship is madness born from your fantasy,

Obey the Serpent his truth is the light of wilderness,
Obey the wicked in their everlasting blasphemy,
You taste the filth and blood of your god of agony,
Once you are dead your eyes are shut forever,
And your soul dies free!

Having ten crowns upon your head you are dead,
Choosing the cross you sacrifice your flesh-ness,
Having great wrath you give power unto beast,
Loosing yourself for the icons of you madness,

You are dying free!

Having ten crowns upon your head you are dead,
Choosing the cross you sacrifice your flesh-ness,
Having great wrath you give power unto beast,
Loosing yourself for the icons of you madness,

Only the mindless will obey your god of agony,
He won't be there to help you die of your sick fantasy,
In the sea of writhing flesh you understand my spells,
You'll embrace your lifeless corpse and fade away,

You are dying free!
