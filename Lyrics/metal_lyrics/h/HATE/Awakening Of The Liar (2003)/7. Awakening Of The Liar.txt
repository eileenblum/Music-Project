I am Satan's blood and you're Satan's blood,
We're on uor way down to hell,
We're the worst enemies of god,
War will speak through us forever,
Arise Satan Lord lay your hands on me,
Let me drink the doctrine in,
Your future is just like mine,
The ancient force we share will rise!

Resurrect me in hell or make me die,
Fill my soul with mercilessness,
Take me from among the unborn ones,
Let me cross the fields of flames,
I'm the evil one, you're the evil one,
We carry Hate for the living god,
We're a pain he tastes each day,
Black Sun Horde is our name,

We are Satan's blood together we fall down straight to hell,
With purest Hate we spit on the holy cross and feed on ancient spells,
We have no flesh but our mighty souls can take every life,
When the Liar awakes our ruling is restored we bring eternal night,

Darkness speaks through us for eternity we stare down into the depths,
War is our prize, forever we destroy Christ by the stars condemned,
The feeble sun is no longer shining we stare down into the depths,
In my afterlife I will kill again Christ by the stars condemned,
Darkness speaks through us for eternity we stare down into the depths,
War is our prize, forever we destroy Christ by the stars condemned,

We are Satan's blood together we fall down straight to hell,
With purest Hate we spit on the holy cross and feed on ancient spells,
We have no flesh but our mighty souls can take every life,
When the Liar awakes our ruling is restored we bring eternal night,
