Plucked out my eyes but I still hold the force you can't contain,
Sucked out my blood but darkness is still throbbing in my veins,

Cut out my tongue but my words still hold eternal might,
Fed me with lies but the Serpent has taught me how to read the signs,

Oblivion &amp; death to the gods!
I'm the emptiness, I'll break your soul and give you mine,
Embodiment of the fire!
The Nephilim's wrath comes back to life when the sun turns black,
Oblivion &amp; death to the gods!
Take last breath before you see your lord in hell terrorrized,
Oblivion &amp; death to the gods!

I change the times, yea through your suffering I exist,
I instigate every war and madness you may ever taste,

Oblivion &amp; death to the gods!
I'm the emptiness, I'll break your soul and give you mine,
Embodiment of the fire!
The Nephilim's wrath comes back to life when the sun turns black,
Oblivion &amp; death to the gods!
Take last breath before you see your lord in hell terrorrized,

Burning souls is what I smell,
Defrabax Rexulon Habrak Mercim,
Zippreus Ukkazal Xelobran Styx!
