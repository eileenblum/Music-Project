Smell your flesh burning down at blazing stake,
Watch your kingdom dies as my hell is rising down there,
You will deny the cross when we finally reach the end,
You will take my side and be like me in my realm of flames,

Yea, I am the one you (...)

I am divine rival and darkness speaks through me,
My time, my time has come, my legions march as heavens bleed,
Yea, I execute, I punish, I take revenge,
Upon the freaks of god, minds of weakness melting in my flames,

I am the one you kneel before!

I'm entertained with your torment,
Dragging you through thousand years of Hate
I'll never bow down before your god,
We rejoice as your kingdom dies!

I twist your mind with my spells of hate beyond the nothingness,
You die a death each day, through your death you live, for your death you ever pray,
To heaven or to hell, to the grave or stars, your mind is torn apart
From the crypt you rise, eyes that mesmerize, take your sacrifice,

I'm entertained with your torment,
Dragging you through thousand years of Hate
I'll never bow down before your god,
We rejoice as your kingdom dies!

I am divine rival and darkness speaks through me,
My time, my time has come, my legions march as heavens bleed,

I twist your mind with my spells of hate beyond the nothingness,
You die a death each day, through your death you live, for your death you ever pray,
To heaven or to hell, to the grave or stars, your mind is torn apart
Beyond the nothingness!
