Tortured, drained and betrayed
Tonight I'm descending from deepest Sheol
Father, set me free from this grave
Dig me up to the floors above
I swear allegiance to the night

Vengeance! Great revival Vengeance
Slay your prophets in this cold neurotic night

Ghostforce! Soul constrictor
Ghostforce! The living temple
Love your martyrs
Those whom you have tortured to death

Hellbound! Breaking the chains
Ghostofrce! Crusader!
Worship none or be destroyed
Blood must be spilled

Father! Let me rage into this world
Let minds be my battlefields
Let me rage this war

Inquisition revived
Breed in me great nothingness
Incarantion of vices
Let merciless hatred reign

Ravenous blood to conquer the world
Ravenous blood
