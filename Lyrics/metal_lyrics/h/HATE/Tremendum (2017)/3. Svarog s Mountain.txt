Graveless soul
Arise from mountain Svar
The Seprent's nest where lava resides
It meltsâ¦ feel the tremor

The galaxy pregnant with force at its heart warping time and space
Gravitational grip in the black hole swelling the power of stars
Betrayed by god of light

Restless miasma awakened from slumber
As I die I shall release all the wrath of melting sun
Cause the fruit of Bethlehem child is venomous

Uranium breath
There is nothing to fill this void to appease the almighty beast
From stardust it came to ignite all the poisons of the earth...
Of its wastelands

Reclaim the world that's lost!
Remembrence of a spirit invincible
Of a sacred might
It opens horizon a bit more
For Arcona shining on the firmament

The melt of fire and frost
It's where it all came from
Delirium, monstrous impurity, temptation
Uranium breath

Wastelands
Wastelands

Reclaim the world that's lost
Remembrence of a spirit invincible
Of a sacred might
It opens horizon a bit more
For Arcona shining on the firmament
On the firmament
On the firmament
