Trapped in eternal recurrence
On this road to perdition where all things belong to dust
I raise the flame

Praise the fire! Life-devouring god on ruins of the world
I praise the blaze! Watch the bleeding sun's rebirth

Es muss sein!

On this arduous way to burning gehenna
Every fall is a step into the wild holiness
The temple of the blackest flame
Standing in the sea of blood
A rite that has no end, a pyre that always burns

Embrace the flame
Praise the fire! Life-devouring god on ruins of the world
I praise the blaze! Watch the glorious time returns

Praise the fire! The tree of Sephiroth burns

Praise the blaze! A funeral void remains

Ours is the glorious nightfall
Through aeons it burns under silent stars
No force in the world can take the torch from us
Lucifer's blessing
Embrace the entire brightness
Witness the coal-black stardust design
Revelation of death that lives in every flesh
A witness to the fall of the blind

Es muss sein!
In the blazing eyes of righteous anger
Walk the road to perdition where all men belong to dust
Embrace the flame

Praise the fire! Life-destroying god on ruins of faith

Now praise the blaze! Watch the bleeding sun's rebirth
