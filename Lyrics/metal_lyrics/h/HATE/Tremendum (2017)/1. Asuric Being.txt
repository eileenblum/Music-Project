Asuric spirit of twilight
Luminous stellar disgrace
With mind as weapon
The ultimate death conclusion
Devourer of life and light

The essence of Saturn
Thrives in obsession and filth
The night is great and glowing
Bringing torrents of death and despair
Hailing thy grotesque fate

Light the flame on every level of existence
Feasting on Atma
Sprouting from the seed of hate

Depression and triumph
Boundless void, it is fed to grow
In the temple of twilight
All is devoted to nought

Scars of fire
Revealed in destruction
Would we mourn or remember you
Down the road to the core?

Embrace extinction
Feasting on the Self
In the temple of twilight
All is devoted to nought

Light a flame that infests in the spirit
In conflagration, it burns it all down
Blood harvest
Forsaken life

Everyone becomes dust
Everything turns to nought
Everyone becomes dust
Everyoneâ¦
