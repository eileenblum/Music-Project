Blood, pain... No matter what it takes,
You remain the last divine!
Because each cry brings me closer to your realms,
Where the night is gone I see the final dawn,
Come forth the monarch of our minds!
From grave to reach the crown...
Because I'm rising!

Imprisoned minds!
The judgement day is here,
A kiss worth dying for...
Break chains! Soon everything shall fall,
Existence fades away...

I hold a dark side - A part you'll never see,
Where chaos reigns my soul, where shadows lurk...

Blood red skies give rain to the heroes,
When the time of death approached kingdom of the heroes!

The fires burning outside,
Zenith has been reached - Emperors die in horror,
The borders of afterlife are marked by death,
Of this world of sodomy...
Behold the eyes of the dead,
Ablaze, insane, eyes of the forlorn,
And then each soul is denied to enter the gate,
Of the kingdom of all joy!

Ya strive and fail, ya stumble and you fall,
In this world of hurt...
Thy ink be still and slowly fade away,
Beyond the borders of the afterlife!

Death do us part! But life inside of thee lasts beyond the grave,
Once more you're reborn!

Death do us part! Life inside of thee last beyond the grave,
Once more you're reborn!

[Solo: Destroyer]

Streams of chaos ring within the deafened ears,
One by one each shall fall!
No one can stop, can stop the hands of time,
And time will stalk you throughout eternity...

Blood red skies give rain to the heroes,
When the time of death approached kingdom of the heroes!

Death do us part! But life inside of thee lasts beyond the grave,
Once more you're reborn!
