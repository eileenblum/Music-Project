I got the memory of every grief,
I got a war to fight...
Never found our way,
In this maze of torment!
No more can I say,
Frozen to myself...

We are the war accelerators,
Let it all burn! Let it all die!
In the search of enlightenment of our souls!

If I were to numb my pain, I'd rather fade away
'Cause my soul has been dead for so long...

My voice is so unclean,
My intention so unclean,
My spirit is so unclean,
My tongue is so unclean,
My blood is so unclean,
My thoughts are so fucking unclean!!!

I propagate the darkest Hate!
To the world of Man,
That's so fucking insane,
I can't hear your whisper,
When my heart wants to scream,
I can't hear your scream,
When the world burns around so loud!
Why should I forgive you
After all that I have seen?
Should I let you go,
After all that you have done?
I feel sheer Hate, no more can I say,
Machine gun is the only remedy...

Wow! I swear to God... I am in pain!
Horror shall rain, I feel like hell,
I swear to God... I am not me!
I cut you up and it set me free...
I sealed you up inside of me,
I swear to God, that's what I did,
I can't hear your whisper,
When my heart wants to scream,
I can't hear your scream,
When the world burns around so loud!

In need of victims,
In need of war,
In need of destruction,
I'll kill until I fall!

I'd rather fade away!

In need of victims,
In need of war,
In need of destruction,
I'll kill until I fall!

If I were to numb my pain I'd rather fade away
'Cause my soul has been dead for so long...

[Solo: Destroyer]

I swear to God... I am in pain!
Horror shall rain, I feel like hell,
I swear to God... I am not me!
I cut you up and it set me free...
I sealed you up inside of me,
I swear to God, that's what I did,
I can't hear your whisper,
When my heart wants to scream,
I can't hear your scream,
When the world burns around so loud!
