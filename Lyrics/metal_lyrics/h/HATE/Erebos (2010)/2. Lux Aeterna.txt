Lux aeterna! Here comes the light shining bright,
Like mighty Phoenix in His final moment,
Create and destroy galaxies,
Between veils of ash,
Spewed from a billion dying suns,

Shine on! Through pestilence! Through infant light of worlds!
Shine on! Through mighty chaos! Through sultry eyes of God!

[Solo: Destroyer]

Here comes the sun unconquered!
In wombs with the infant light of worlds,
Here comes the sun, eternal might!
Ya birth the cells and eat them out:
The death apostle - The one that is all,
The one! That is all! The one!
In sultry eyes of God!

We are but dream within a dream,
We seem so sane yet doomed from the start,
Feed on misery, anticipate death to come,
Forced to live until we see the eternal light,

Shine on! Through pestilence! Through infant light of worlds!
Shine on! Through mighty chaos! Through sultry eyes of God!

In the blackness of this world I crave for a single beam of light,
The blackness of my stare as I fake the game of life,
You breathe within my chest, gaze outwords through my eyes!
