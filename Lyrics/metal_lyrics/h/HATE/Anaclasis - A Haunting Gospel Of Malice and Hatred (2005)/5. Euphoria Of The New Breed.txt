No grave can hold our bodies down, we crave for ecstasy,
Beyond time we stand stand as phantoms go one by one,
Follow me right through the skies totalitarian minds,
In death we take our pride, in flames we drown the flesh of Christ,

Mad warrior, let the war begin!

God is nothing more than me! I challenge doctrines of all time,
No rest but of a mortal sleep, no god but in a prophet's lie,
I'm the way into the dark, the twisted universe,
Sneaking up the spine of the world to spill its guts across the skies,

Let's kill like no tomorrow, let the crosses burn..

Disguised in a human skin in this world devoid of free choice,
I was the first to take your pain, yes I let it in,
To make futile your death on the cross,
I've the coldest eyes the world has ever seen,
Blood's the life that revived my soul,
I've locked myself deep inside, let madness in,
To survive in the void..

Breeding lust, cruelty and greed
We have taken lead upon your heed,
Burning souls like tumble weed and bones,
You're on the way towards deepest void and darkness,
Locked in chains lusting after hellish games,
We survived the cold and fire to take revenge,
Sneaking up the spine of the world
to spill its guts across the sky,
We are on the way into eternal sorrow,
In death we take our pride, desecrate the bible of fools,
Let's begin the war against your gods,
Hey Messiah! How many have you betrayed?
How many have given you their lives?

Let the war begin!

Follow me right through the skies totalitarian minds,
In death we take our pride, in flames we drown the flesh of Christ,
God is nothing more than me, I challenge doctrines of all time,
No rest but a mortal sleep, no god but in a prophet's lie,
I'm way into the dark, the twisted universe,
Let's kill like no tomorrow, let the crosses burn.
