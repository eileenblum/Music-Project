Angels with their eyes dripping blood,
Writhing in pain bleeding for ecstasy,
Myriad of times bringing misery,
Sons of war, hexed, unleash thy fury!

Be my lords! Reach out and rule!
Be my lords! Defeat the skies!
Destroy humanity - the vermine of Christ,
Tiger Sirens, rise from your shrines,
Consume this world with your leprosy,
Make my bliss complete!

My hatred blazes eternal light,
Sacred flesh drenched in my suffering,
Empire of tears thrives on sacrifice,
Sheep-minded herds plod into bottomless pit,

Resurrect your vanished hearts,
Consume this world with your leprosy,
We rule like risen morning stars!

We're invoking a new order in your minds,
Shattered are the icons of the worthless,
We, the bornless ones are taking the blame,
The sin is tied in the veins of our bloodkline,

Be my lords! Defeat the skies!
Destroy humanity - the vermine of Christ,
Tiger Sirens, rise from your shrines,
Consume this world with with your leprosy,
You slaughter dolls, queens of the damned,
I'm spreading your disease to the bitter end,

Resurrect your vanished hearts,
Consume this world with your leprosy.
