Here comes the night of challenge my razorblade,
The night my life's about to end,
I shed blood and tears my razorblade,
My heart full of hell's about to be torn,

I'm leaving the dirt behind me,
Yea, I'm indifferent to cold,
Your blade, your blade kisses me deeply,

Cut my flesh, my skin, my razorblade,
Got the light unclean shines on me,
All alone in my misery I'm trapped here,
The bridge ahead is torn and shattered..

Peel my skin, make me scream,
You've taken my blood, taken my soul, invoked my ecstasy,
Cut is my flesh, I see the eyes of death, world full of hell,
Devoted to agony. My eyes go black!

Was it my scream in torment my razorblade?
I just can't feel the wounds you've done to me,
You've sunk so deep, got my soul, my razorblade,
Taken my life to the bottom of the unknown!

I'm leaving the dirt behind me,
And I'm indifferent to cold,
Your blade, your blade kisses me deeply,
Take me to the bottom of the unknown!
