We've no creed in the realms of fire where our mystic souls
Have no limit of a mortal life in the world of filth where we exist,
Arise and come I'll take you safe across the river Styx.

Back to the filth, back to the light of Assyrian gods,
Praise them alive and praise them dead,
Risen Morning Stars!

Come and taste the blood of the Serpent just underneath my skin,
Here the tongues of fire whisper about your destiny million times,

Lost words behind those wounded-doe eyes,
I bow before the queen of lies, my hiding malice is getting bolder,
Someday you'll receive our pain,
You caused us to cry tears of utter nothingness,
Sliding through a tunnel, destination unknown,
Lost words in eternity, a forbidden delight,

Come and taste the blood of the Serpent just underneath my skin,
Here the tongues of fire whisper about your destiny million times,

[solo: Adam the First Sinner]

Remove your blindfolds, now you want to breathe my words,
Our eyes are dust, we share the blame,
Our pain is a doorway, we believe in nothing else,
In the shroud of my madness I'm freed and destroyed.
I'm ending the torment I stare upon the open skies,
Put me out of my misery, just slit my fucking throat!

Back to the filth, back to the light of Assyrian gods
Praise them alive and praise them dead
Risen Morning Stars!
