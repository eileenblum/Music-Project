Dancing upon your graves we desecrate this world divine,
Suck on the remains of your serenity, devour your lives,
New breed is born of our ectoplasmic witchery,
In minds possessed it grows to tear your wretched souls,
Paralysed with wonder and delight,

We are drinking blood from God's brow,
We shall surrender to eternal darkness,
As moonlight intensify,
A morbid hunger for blood appears in your eyes,

I watch you drown in the sea of hatred ,
Cast in irons, your flesh of white of snow,
You go where your don't exist any more,
Where the devil has no wings,

We stare at a thousand dark eyes, a stare that brings you torture,
Chanting a sick lullaby, a song of the damned in the night,
We are the strongest of minds, with pain as feed we're waiting,
Inside your silent cries ripping apart the old and new,

I'm falling when the abyss calls me,
At night when the corpses rise,

Your voices cry my words of malediction,
You become the slaves paralysed with the death divine,
Now you can see there's glory in destruction,
Mass religious suicide to become!

Dancing upon your graves we desecrate this world divine,
Suck on the remains of your serenity, devour your lives,
New breed is born of our ectoplasmic witchery,
In minds possessed it grows to tear your wretched souls,
I watch you drown in the sea of hatred ,
Cast in irons, your flesh of white of snow,
You go where your don't exist any more,
Where the devil has no wings,

We are drinking blood from God's brow,
We shall surrender to eternal darkness,
As moonlight intensify
With the guise of innocence we're burning bright,

When our hell is open wide,
We'll sacrifice a thousand of your lives,
We are a shadow among the lights,
A morbid hunger for blood appears in your eyes,
