(chant of the Nephilim)

Find the darkness in yourself!
Yea! Try taste the blood from a thousand cuts,
Bless your enemies with your razor's kiss,
Bring 'em blinding shattering silver tears,
See the world behind you dead and gone,,
Where no one lives but the beasts alone,

Rise and see, rise and see, rise and see,
When the moon will share the pre-dawn sky,
Rise and see, rise and see, rise and see,
There's more to darkness than meets your eye,

Hear the eternal swallowing cosmic cries,
See my anger rising from its core,
Putrid piles of fucking human waste,
Wandering from king to king in hell,
Burning crystalline devil's flame,
Apocalyptic haunted futures seen,

Rise and see, rise and see, rise and see,
A bloodshed in the flight of dawn,
Rise and see, rise and see, rise and see,
When the moon will share the pre-dawn sky,
Rise and see, rise and see, rise and see,
There's more to darkness than meets your eye,

[solo: Adam the First Sinner]

With wanton ecstasy,
We smile and the world spins around,
You're churning me, twisting, sucking on the life,
In chaotic bliss,
See us in the world where sanity is just a fiery myth.
Toxic blood flows from our veins, in chaotic bliss,
Like skin falling off a bone,
You're churning me, sucking on the life,
With wanton ecstasy,
We smile and the world spins around,
We'd rather crawl from king to king in hell.
Than give your god a single bow!
