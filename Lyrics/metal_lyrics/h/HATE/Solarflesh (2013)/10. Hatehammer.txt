[Limited Edition Bonus Track]Black cold sea is all we can feel
Wound of fire is a burning torch
Wound of fire!

In the realm of pain we live
Razor's edge has no remorse
Razor's edge - The warmaker
Shifting channels of perception
We found holy grail of insanity

Flames that rise devour flesh of God
Black cold river flows through this
All life is bound - Interconnected chain of death
For everyone is born in grave
Born in grave!

Inhale! Pain! Divine!
Hatehammer! Let the darkness grow!
Hatehammer! Black starlight!

The idol crusher - Perverted blood
Yeah, we exist in thy glory
Kings of pain, kings of sadness
We have come to this...

Annihilation of all life
Death is so pervert and bright
Silent and calm the faceless queen of chance

[Solo: Destroyer]

Flames that rise devour the flesh of God
Black cold river flows through this
All life is bound - Interconnected chain of death
For everyone is born in grave
Born in grave!

Inhale! Pain! Divine!
Hatehammer! Let the darkness grow!
Hatehammer! Black starlight!
Hatehammer! The warmaker!
Hatehammer! Black starlight!
