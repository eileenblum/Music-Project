(eli baltuti ima idu mituti)

We have faith in poison!
Suicide! Suicide! Please make it today!
A wound from a perfect blade
Oh, that is what I crave!
Suicide! Suicide! Just come and release
A stream of blood from my wrists...

Slave cult for the worm-face
Like a dreak in darkest of corners
Saviors and martyrs of a deadly disease
Darkness and time will hide
Will destroy every trace of mine
LIFE IS NOTHING BUT BLINDFOLD!

Slave cult race!
Slave cult race!
Insanity devouring what is left of this reality
Murderous shining lust!

Oh, set me ablaze!

Have no voice. Have no pride! My self is denied
I am a slave and a martyr
Genocide! Genocide! The dawn of new world
Pain is only a weakness
Genocide! Genocide! Is what we designed
Death is just an escape!

Slave cult race!
Slave cult race!
It is nothing but blindfold - Life
Will destroy every trace of mine
Devouring what is left...

Insanity devouring what is left of this reality
Murderous shining lust!

Slave cult for the worm-race
Like a dream in darkest of corners
Saviors and martyrs of a deadly disease
Darkness and time will hide
Will destroy every trace of mine
Life is nothing but blindfold
... Is nothing but blindfold!
