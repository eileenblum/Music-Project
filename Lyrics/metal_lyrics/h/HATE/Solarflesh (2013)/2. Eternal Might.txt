(the air we breathe and ground we stand on)

Black fucking disdain!
Regenerate! Get it back to life!
Torrents of infernal blasphemy euphrates!
Let the fire grow in me!
When sky is still and venom works its way
Now we exist in perfect beauty of this plague
Reanimated blessed new earth!
There is a world to win
There is a world to win
and be restored!

There you stand!
Humane or humiliated by your inner ugliness
Humane or humiliated by your true inner holiness!
HATE IS THE CALL FROM BEYOND THE AIR THAT WE BREATHE...

Illuminated as the serpent in the night
as radiant disease!

Infinite power of Eternal Might is the key
the shining star, the (only) reason I like to bleed
I drink this wine - The deadlist poison from this mouth
Immense hatred I breed!

We are exchanging eternities!
We exist in thy glory
a God is born and others die
the purpose revealed!

Illuminated as the serpent in the night
as radiant disease!

There you stand!
Humane or humiliated by your inner ugliness
Humane or humiliated by your true inner holiness!

[Solo: Destroyer]

Mighty Shamash illuminate!
Mighty Shamash eliminate!
Reach out and clash!
