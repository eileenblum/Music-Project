Endless purity - The last direction
Of this wander through void and cold ways
Purity of life
Embracing the sadness

The night and fall
Unhealing wounds
As I reach the soil
With my last breath

In this weak shape I beg
To follow the journey
Through life of salvation
Through blood from my veins
I opened for thee...

Purity of light
Under the storm of regression

The night and fall
Unhealing wounds
As I reach the soil
With my last breath

There is no cleaner shine
Than your rays
There is no deeper void
Than I life behind for you

[Solo: Destroyer]

There is no higher pleasure
comparing to your caress
There is no greater love
Than thy embrace

Endless purity - The last direction
Of this wander through void and cold ways
Purity of life
Embracing the sadness

The night and fall
Unhealing wounds
As I reach the soil
With my last breath...
