(usella mituti ikkalub altuti)

Praise the dwellers in ethereal realm of dust
From timeless void comes all existence
They still walk through countless years to come
They still march with shining blade reflect the sun

Seeking solace crimsom death - The shifting sky
Swallow dust of a thousand years to come
Infectious star - thou art terror incarnate
Infectious star from black heavens!

Giant maze - The seed of mortality
Giant star devouring all galaxies
Kingdom of dust - Revelation of the end
Kingdom of dust to set the world in flames!

The sun is fire that burns the soul
The sun is a virus that slowly kills
It brings you closer and closer to hell
Takes its toll. Do not spare a single soul

Shamash illuminate! Caught me in trance in your spell
Clash with the underworld!
Shamash illuminate! Caught me in trance in your spell
Clash with the underworld!

Praise the dwellers in ethereal realm of dust
Frim timeless void comes all existence!
They still walk through countless years of chaos
They still march with shining blade reflect the sun

Seeking solace crimsom death - The shifting sky
Swallow dust of a thousand years to come
Infectious star - thou art terror incarnate
Infectious star from black heavens!

Giant maze - The seed of mortality
Giant star devouring all galaxies
Kingdom of dust - Revelation of the end
Kingdom of dust to set the world in flames!
