(Harsag zalazalag)

Bring me solarflesh!

The gospel of filth eternal source of the dawn
The dazzling shine of a hidden earth
THE BURNING ESSENCE OF THE CORE
fuel for the flame, if it is good or evil
It crashes down from the skies!

Cosmic descent!

I follow death chasing infinity
I destroy all shadows with silence
I can see through your fake reality

I wish and pray for the world to collapse
For destruction to prevail
I wish and pray for death of millions
For thy hopes to be wasted
I wish and pray for genocide
For breasts to feed on thy flesh
Burn all the Icons, wipe up their names
May my fire feast on them!

[Solo: ATF Sinner]

Chaos and bloodshed in the eye of disdain
In the hour of penance millions in pain
Everlasting malice - Devourer of life
Perfectly obscured from a hundred stares

Raise the hidden flame
Lucipher destroying the divine
Elevate me to death - New existence
In the final rebirth!

I follow death chasing infinity
I destroy all shadows with silence
I can see through your fake reality!
I repossess the power of darkness

Cosmic descent!
