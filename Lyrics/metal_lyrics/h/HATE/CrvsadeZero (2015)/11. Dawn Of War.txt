I am war! Watch me rise! Confrontation is a must!
Empty of life, drunk with death, I feed the flame of Mars
Turn your heart to stone, turn your blood to fire

Where evil dwells
Spare this flesh for burning Karma
Chaos forming
Reach out and touch the darkest void

Lifeless is the earth, toxic rain hits the ground
Watch the oceans burn
See the rivers die of poisoned blood!

Where evil dwells, spare your flesh for burning Karma
Chaos forming, reach out and touch the darkest void
In total rapture of a sight of burning sanctuaries
Rise above and rise within the evil force

Death is pervert and bright, silent and calm
The eyeless queen of oblivion
In each of your failures I see my victory
Mother is rotting - On her flesh we feast

Bullets ripping through the air
There is beauty in death.

[Lead: Destroyer]

See the rise of Warmageddon Generation
See the hordes marching on, sacrifice all things
Walk this earth! Revelation of doom!

In total rapture a sight of burning sanctuaries
Rise above and rise within the evil force!
