Born and die as slaves in your prostration
In machine-like strife you gain another mile
No matter the outcome, no matter the cost
God of cyanide leads you straight to your agony

You follow a death cult caravan through the valley of darkness
So complete and so endless in your slavery, devoured by fear
Fueled with Hate you are creations of self-deception
Lost souls swallowed into yourselves in the valley of death

I bring fire! I have come to light your way through the night!

[Lead: ATF Sinner]

There is no escape from the scanning eyes of death
Vague illusions you dwell
Destination - Nothingness

I bring fire, I bring salvation! I bring fire, I bring salvation! I bring fire, I bring salvation!

Thrive in your confidence with your eyes fixed on (earthly) nought
Drink from the fountain of thy poisoned dreams
No! You cannot change your fear into reign
So complete and so endless in your slavery

[Lead: Destroyer]

Set fire to icons! Set fire to icons! Set fire to icons!
