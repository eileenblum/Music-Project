Abyss born leviathan [9x]

In the absence of sun
In the black waters of the underworld
I fuel destruction
In my realm of hate

In the oceans of grey
So vast of no return
I am a scourge of fire
Offending thy god

I am a restless survivor
A relentless soldier of hate
A display of power
A flame that burns in emptiness

Cradle of malice
The law from below
God offenders, I give you my blood
We fuel destruction

Darkness is a symphony of doom
Forget yourself, leave all behind
Become as one in the eye of perdition

Leave your flesh melt into nothingness
Gladly embrace all torments of hell
And unfold starless aeon

Heavens lie at your feet [7x]
In our sacred domain where darkness prevails

Abyss born leviathan [3x]

In a crash that submerged the universe
I bring hymns of chaos in the space
Without a whisper of light in emptiness

Surging darkness coils to strike
It wallows in your blood and despair
Our rage is chaste and eternal
We breed all violence

Abyss born leviathan [6x]

Darkness is a symphony of doom
Forget yourself, leave all behind
Become as one in the eye of perdition

Leave your flesh melt into nothingness
Gladly embrace all torments of hell
And unfold starless aeon

[4x]
Darkness will prevail
Darkness must prevail

Cradle of malice
The law from below
God offenders, I give you my blood
We fuel destruction
