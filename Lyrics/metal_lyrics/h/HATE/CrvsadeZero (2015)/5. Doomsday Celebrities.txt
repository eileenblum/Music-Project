Doomsday sunrise, mushroom shroud, skies burn
Misguided mortals! Are you certain you want to burn with me?
In blasphemy!

Why have you eyes when you choose not to see?
When will you unblind the world? Imitation of life
No god shall damn you, who have damned yourselves
Standing on the event horizon of existence

Fear is the shepherd, fear is the flock, the death of all hope
Demons will creep, humans will weep in blasphemy
I have witnessed it all - Atrocities
I have lost the concept of regret

You watched it with your eyes until you could watch no more
The miracle of your own inception
You call yourselves humans waiting for an illusive saviour
You worship illusion.

Now embrace the silence! Now embrace the silence! Now embrace the silence!
Now embrace the silence! Now embrace the silence! Now embrace the silence!
Haunted by planets we are just remains of exploding stars
