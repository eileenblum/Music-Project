I see the world shrivel and crack, centuries reduced in seconds
Silence was never so loud, the inner voice is screaming
Now you have reached the end
The rivers run red and bloodbath is everywhere

My reign has come, my kingdom is here
Lucipher's dagger is covered in sangre.

I rise from the ashes and see the world up in flames
Towers that once scraped the sky now lie breathless

My reign has come, my kingdom is here
Lucipher's dagger is covered in sangre.

Behold! I am the fire, the plague consuming thy world
Light of every star and every planet perish in darkness
Now I am your shrine, your womb! You rest inside of me!

[Lead: Destroyer]

Behold! I am the fire, the plague consuming thy world
Light of every star and every planet perish in darkness
Now I am your shrine, your womb, you rest inside of me
My flesh, my soul shall be your tomb

Dancing upon your graves as the monster consumes the earth
Carcass of thy hopes lies dead beneath the fabric of thy dreams

Behold! I am the fire, the plague consuming thy world
Light of every star and every planet perish in darkness
Now I am your shrine, your womb, you rest inside of me
My flesh, my soul shall be your tomb.

I am Death no one can excel
This very air come and go with me
Open the door to heaven or hell.
