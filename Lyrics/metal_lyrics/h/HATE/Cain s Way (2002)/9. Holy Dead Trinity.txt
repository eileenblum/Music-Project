Hail Evil Gods! Remember me, I am your destiny!
To glorify your majesty I summon you to see
The sacrifice of human-mice trembling there between
Heaven and hell - trapped in spell, where Satan lord has dwelt

There is nothing to reieve the pain of human sacrifice
Now their salvation drowns in doubbts, they will never see the prize
For the wicked is this world, open up your eyes
Forever under will, you will die, you will have to be despised

Prize never received, Holy Trinity will be brought to grief!!!

There is nothing to reieve the pain of human sacrifice
Now their salvation drowns in doubbts, they will never see the prize
For the wicked is this world, open up your eyes
Forever under will, you will die, you will have to be despised

Burn holy cross as like it was when the Evil Gods
Reigned the world with naked sword killing those who were worth
To be sacrifice, made for Him, broken, trapped in sin
Parricide in the final fight, until false gods will die!!!

There is nothing to reieve the pain of human sacrifice
Now their salvation drowns in doubbts, they will never see the prize
For the wicked is this world, open up your eyes
Forever under will, you will die, you will have to be despised...
