Look at the Tree of Wisdom - clever trap for human kind
Its fruits are holding poison and its branches suffocate
Its beauty is so tempting while its secret is deadly sin
Death and suffering is the name of the tree of divine kindness

Giving you a gift, bribing your soul
Deceiving your sensesm watching you from above

Sorrow, death, wickedness, fear, uncertainty, pain
Falling stars never shine, you are betrayed...

Tempted by dog-serpent lurking quietly upon the Tree
You are not aware of consequences, of breaking God's holy interdict
Counting only on your senses with livid instincts fighting inside
Under a burden of earthly suffering you would finally understand...

That wasa trap, divinity took off the mask and what you
See is a creep, nothing is divine, just composition of
Fear and deceit, craving for greatness - even
At the expanse of suffering of millions, harm of millions
With no mercy!!!

Sorrow, death, wickedness, fear, uncertainty, pain
Falling stars never shine, you are betrayed

Giving you a gift, bribing your soul
Deceiving your sensesm watching you from above

Look at the Tree of Wisdom - clever trap for human kind
Its fruits are holding poison and its branches suffocate
Its beauty is so tempting while its secret is deadly sin
Death and suffering is the name of the tree of divine kindness

Giving you a gift, bribing your soul...
