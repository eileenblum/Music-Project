Two men as one, the same blood they shared
Born from one mother and divided by hate
One other chose the dark side - its torture and bliss
In the underland

Homicide - no human ever crossed the line
Rebirth - when deepest rage is Cain's right
Thirst of blood - one taste means millions lives
Heredity - like his you conscience growing numb

Distant whispers drilling your mind
Blood hunger staring through your eyes
Freezing scent permcating your spine
Black rain's sounding intensified

Full of pride his name, unbending his will
He left behind the impassable to challenge the son
Of the universe

Holy men the prophets, deceptive Christ's dogs
Reject all empty words they ever spoke
Die in hate, experience suffering of the damned
Live inside bloody circle in the Sheol

Distant whispers drilling your mind
Blood hunger staring through your eyes
Freezing scent permcating your spine
Black rain's sounding intensified...
