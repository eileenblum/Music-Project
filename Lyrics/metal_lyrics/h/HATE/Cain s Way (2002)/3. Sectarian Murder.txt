They're only scared of their god's reprimand
Brave nights the purest among the pure
Exterminate those who don't trust the cross
Repeople lands that were conquered...

Deceitful is their religious plan
The deadliest trap ever laid
Fast spreading are the promises - lies
So great is the stubborn ones' pain

Eagerly sacrificing their lives
They kill being conscious of the prize
After death they will be equal to god
Live in glory with purity in their hearts

They are convinced that the world can be their overnight
The light of the saint has faded away

Deceitful is their religious plan
The deadliest trap ever laid
Fast spreading are the promises - lies
So great is the stubborn ones' pain

Eagerly sacrificing their lives
They kill being conscious of the prize
After death they will be equal to god
Live in glory with purity in their hearts

Deceitful is their religious plan
The deadliest trap ever laid
Fast spreading are the promises - lies
So great is the stubborn ones' pain

They are convinced that the world can be their overnight
The light of the saint has faded away...

Sectarian murder - display of pride
No extreme action before they die
When the unfaithful men extinet
There will be only Satan's will
