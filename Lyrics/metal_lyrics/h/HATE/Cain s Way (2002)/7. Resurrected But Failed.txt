Hanging on the cross with pecked eyes
Monstrously deformed, feeling breath of demise
Wearing a crown of disgrace
Dying line common thief, divoid of respect

Son of god not recognized
Sentenced to death for usurping god
Went through the unguish of the world
Died in vain like everyone

Died of himself
Forever dead

Considering his life on the cross
Christ, you cannot defeat death!

Screaming at the skies in despair
Begging for his father's mercyful hand
Mourning over world drowned in tears
This resurrection feels like dying in vain

Son of god not recognized
Sentenced to death for usurping god
Went through the unguish of the world
Died in vain like everyone...
