Son of the dawn i say to thee
The fountains of blood reach the skies
All the dead will worship thee
Hungry brains and thirsty knives

Join the trance of Everlasting Hate
The march on the forsaken path
Let the flame grow higher
Up to the garden of heaven's delight

The evangelistic pain
The evangelistic pain

So where is your god of disbelief?
The fire that burns through the night
Nations drowning in my tears
My thought has cracked their minds

Our way's so illusive it's so hard to trace
The end is failing, no need to remain
The world's a disease that can't be cured
Warm rivers of blood will flow...
The truth is a voice that can't be heard
The end is failing, no need to remain
You don't know what's to come when the night is through
No messiah to teach the word

The evangelistic
The evangelistic
Pain!

Our way's so illusive it's so hard to trace
The end is failing, no need to remain
The world's a disease that can't be cured
Warm rivers of blood will flow...
The truth is a voice that can't be heard
The end is failing, no need to remain
You don't know what's to come when the night is through
No messiah to teach the word!
