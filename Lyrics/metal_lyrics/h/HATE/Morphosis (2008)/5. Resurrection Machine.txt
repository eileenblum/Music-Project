In this sadness we rot
In the graveyard of immortals
We're reborn, we've seen the light
Of the mourning sun-rise!
Hold the curse of mortality
Death comes down on the flesh
Once we used to be tyrants
Now we're icons of pain and regret

Tired faded words that once held identity
Embrace now your destiny
Lift your wings!

Let the drums play louder
To the silence beyond our fate
There's bloodshed up there
On the cross to celebrate, yea!
Our bodies lie cold
Inside coffins of gold and silk
Once we used to be tyrants
Now we're icons of pain to be burned...

Tired faded souls come embrace now your destiny
Cast down mortality, lift your wings and be free
No death to come, wash away the agony
Restore thy identity...

Awaken from mortality
Let me be your crucified god
Million souls to steal
By the resurrection machine

We hail downfall! we hail the pain!
We serve the rain of black tears
And blood of the innocent spilled
Without us you'll fade
You'll not remain
Cause we're one blood and soul
Of the same machine
Let me be your crucified god...

We hail downfall! we hail the pain!
We serve the rain of black tears
And blood of the innocent spilled
Without us you'll fade
You'll not remain
Cause we're one blood and soul
Of the same machine
Let me be your crucified god...
