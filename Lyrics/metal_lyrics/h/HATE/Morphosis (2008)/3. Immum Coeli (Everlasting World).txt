Wickedness within those words you told
Death watches us of every second of the day
It makes us suffer!
Thy beautiful disease is what they envy
You know what lies ahead
But not a single man ever cares!

Decades of decadence
Fill the abyss with our Hate divine
Lost within a piercing trance of eternal masquerade

Your ice never shatters, dead and dreaming
Why did you leave us on this fucking earth?

We got rid of our lives to live in everlasting world
Got rid of our lives to live in everlasting world

God speaks in serpent's tongue, you listen
You feel the fucking flow...

We got rid of our lives to live in everlasting world
Got rid of our lives to live in everlasting world

Trapped and broken bled to death
A hypnotizing suicide
The domain seeks to tear your life
Into a million shards of strife

Everlasting world...

Decades of decadence
Fill the abyss with our Hate divine
Lost within a piercing trance of eternal masquerade
Same today, same tomorrow, same when the world ends!

Call me foe as you enter my domain
This is not the perfect end...
The shining ones, the keepers of fire
We were exiled and disgraced
You took our world and bled it dry
Into the heart of all space

Call me foe as you enter my domain
This is not the perfect end...
The shining ones, the keepers of fire
We were exiled and disgraced
You took our world and bled it dry
Into the heart of all space

Trapped and broken bled to death
A hypnotizing suicide
The domain seeks to tear your life
Into a million shards of strife

Everlasting world...
Everlasting world...
