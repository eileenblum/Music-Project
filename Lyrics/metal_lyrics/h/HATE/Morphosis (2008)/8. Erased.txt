One more thing before you leave this secret path
One more word before you vanish from this sacred place
I'll make you remember all you know is a lie
All you see's the replica o'paradise

Erased from your minds
Erased from your minds

You're too blind to see the light that permates the air
You're too deaf to the manifests from the other side
Too shallow to see how profound is death
Too human to notice the astral oceans around

Erased from your minds
Erased from your minds

One step closer to the graves
One breath closer to the living Hate
Erased forever from your minds
The ancient birth of tragedy

One step closer to the graves
One breath closer to the living Hate
Erased forever from your minds
The ancient birth of tragedy
The hell of your eyes
The empty shell of lifeless skin and bone
One step closer to the cold of your breath

[Lead: Destroyer]

One step closer to the graves
One breath closer to the living Hate
Erased forever from your minds
The ancient birth of tragedy
The hell of your eyes...
