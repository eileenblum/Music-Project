Behold!
Tears of blood I shed start to open up the skies
On headless cross ask yourself if you remember
Who destroyed your fucking world divine?
The time is slowing down in their dirty little hearts
Hypnotic sound of sirens hasten bloody rivers
They won't let you leave this world divine

We're walking down the forsaken path
To starless skies, to one horizon
With malediction in our minds
We shape the future
Destroy this fucking world divine

Let's spill the water made to wine!

The light is the answer forsaken for a million years
Hidden flash behind the rivers of creation
The eye of center, dawn of our race...

Why have you waited for the world below?
Life's poison, it's addiction to gore
Let's spill the water made to wine...

Let's spill the water made to wine!

The time is slowing down in their dirty little hearts
Hypnotic sound of sirens hasten bloody rivers
They won't let you leave this world divine
The light is the answer forsaken for a million years
Hidden flash behind the rivers of creation
The eye of center, dawn of our race...

I'm your lord crucified
Come taste the blood from my wounds before I die
I'm your lord crucified
Come taste some blood from my wounds before I die...
