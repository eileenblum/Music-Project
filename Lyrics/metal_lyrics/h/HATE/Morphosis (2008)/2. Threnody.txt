[Lead: Destroyer]

Cling to truths unknown
They flow like sweet wine
You follow them down
One voice of two breaths
Destroys his perfect design

Reality transforms
It changes all what lies behind
I can see all this now
Cause I'm finally awake

Remain faithful to the core of the obsessed mind!

Come and watch the blackest sea
It runs deeper than you dare to dream it could be
Come and watch the blackest sea
It runs deeper than you dare to dream it could be

We remain faithful to the core
Free from our confines
Awaken the light, chaos and fury
Irresistible force
Come salvation!
Come and revive us in the graves
We pay with our blood, flesh and regret

Aeons of suffering to find there's no life
We're all dead from the start
Future's nothing, it's pure deception to taste
Each second by your blind minds
Save yourself from thyself
If you ever really fucking cared
To know why we came
Come bloody judgement
In heaven as on earth

Where pain bounds our souls
Where darkness never fails
Come across the Styx
And find my Emptiness
And secrets remain untold
We're spinning round and round
On our way to hell
Would you die for my sins?
In the end to find
There's no life, we're all dead
From the start...

Come and watch the blackest sea
It runs deeper than you dare to dream it could be

Aeons of suffering to find there's no life
We're all dead from the start
Future's nothing - it's pure deception to taste
Each second by your blind minds
Save yourself from thyself
If you ever really fucking cared
To know why we came
Come bloody judgement
In heaven as on earth...

Where pain bounds our souls
Where darkness never fails
Come across the Styx
And find my Emptiness
And secrets remain untold
We're spinning round and round
On our way to hell
Would you die for my sins?
In the end to find
There's no life, we're all dead
From the start...
