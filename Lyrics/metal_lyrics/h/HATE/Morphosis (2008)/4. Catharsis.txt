Look at my wounds, with fresh blood they cry
It's so much bliss to bear the holy thorns inside
I'm your messiah, god re-rising from the flames
Above the masses overmesmerised
Instant salvation through this self-defile

This pig will never fall! yeah!

My eyes have seen the madness
Now they're breeding blind
I'm falling into the abyss to suicide-end my life
Warm river of my blood will flow over the crucifix
This is where I die...

We are the prophets of a New Disease
Come and worship in our church of blasphemy
We bring you torment, death and madness you adore
We spit your bowels in the face of the greatest whore
Aeons of evil mean eternal bliss...

The coldest death embrace stare of darkness smile of flames
Come listen to your god his words are childishly insane
And when you come to leave all this fucking flesh behind
See my reflection in your wide open eyes...

Cease to oppose us!
Cease to oppose us!
Each second in torment together we bleed

Cease to oppose us!
Cease to oppose us!
Now that you can see the truth behind the deceit

Count down to the end
Rise above your pain, death desires
Rise above your god, sucking on thy heart, destroying your soul
Free the abyss that lives deep inside of you
Breathe me in!
Get back to where you belong
Slowly leave for the place a million miles away

[Lead: Destroyer]

The coldest death embrace stare of darkness smile of flames
Come listen to your god his words are childishly insane
And when you come to leave all this fucking flesh behind
See my reflection in your wide open eyes

Cease to oppose us!
Cease to oppose us!
Each second in torment together we bleed

Cease to oppose us!
Cease to oppose us!
Now that you can see the truth behind the deceit...
