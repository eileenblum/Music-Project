There was time one Nazerene disguised himself as god
And led all human astray-that selfish holy slut!
Every day Christ's servents making use of your fear
Try to make your mind submissive and believe in hell so real

Wrong ways of disgrace forget all lies god told you
Burnt once, no chance to threaten with firehell

Book of deciet! Raised to the ground Edin -the prize is fake
God has not told you clearly what waits for you after death
Paradise-you will find a big suprize
The place where you are is the earth god dispize
Book of deciet!

Devil's force infernal forever stay with me
With aim to unite with satanwith master rule and bleed
Christians have no vague chance of salvation  from all pain
When stuck to decietful bible, when swallows lies in vein

Wrong ways of disgrace forget all lies god told you
Burnt once, no chance to threaten with firehell
