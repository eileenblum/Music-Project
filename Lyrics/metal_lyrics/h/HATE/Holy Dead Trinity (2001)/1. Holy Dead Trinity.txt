Hail evil gods! Remember me, I am your destiny!
To glorify your majesty I summon you to see
The sacrifice of human mice trembling there between
Heaven and hell trapped in spell
Where Satan lord has dwelt

There is nothing to relieve the pain of human sacrifice
Now thier salvation drown in doubt they will never see the prize
For the wicked is this world open up your mind
Foreevr underwill you will die, you will have to be dispized

burn holy cross as it was when the evil gods
Reign the world with naked sword killing those who were worth
to be a sacrifice made for him broken trapped in sin
perricide in the final fight untill the false gods die

There is nothing to relieve the pain of human sacrifice
Now thier salvation drown in doubt they will never see the prize
For the wicked is this world open up your mind
Forever underwill you will die, you will have to be dispized
