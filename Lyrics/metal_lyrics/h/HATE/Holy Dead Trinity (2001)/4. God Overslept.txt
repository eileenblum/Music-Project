Seven churches of deception
Burning world reflects in daemon's glare
Now you can see your mind infection
Divinity dies and god has overslept

Open the gates forever be the evil son
Untie your soul-throw away the holy cross
Burning in the world of evil masters-ancient gods
Delight thier force wich is flowing though your soul

God has overslept
God has overslept - left bhind

Open the gates forever be the evil son
Untie your soul-throw away the holy cross
Burning in the world of evil masters-ancient gods
Delight thier force wich is flowing though your soul

God has overslept - left bhind

Open the gates forever be the evil son
Untie your soul-throw away the holy cross
Burning in the world of evil masters-ancient gods
Delight thier force wich is flowing though your soul

God has overslept
God has overslept - left behind
