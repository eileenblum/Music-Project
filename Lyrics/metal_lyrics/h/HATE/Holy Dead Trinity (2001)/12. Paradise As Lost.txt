Angelus is dead god is scared
Your faith is broken, your hope is left behind
The barrel you feel stuck to your head
Reminds you, that its now your turn to go and die

You will see bleeding cross again
You will see the sacrifices face
Your god is the evil banners slave
You should have put down paradise as lost
His body is cuth through with nails
His dead is wearing a crown of thorns
His suffering permates his bones
You should have put down paradise as lost
down paradise as lost
down paradise as lost
down paradise as lost

Disgraceful is you life full of deciet
There is no way out you know you must bleed
Do not try to bribe your destiny
Regretful cry does not save your life indeed
