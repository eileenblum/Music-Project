Close youre eyes, imagine sumarian ancient times
The wicked world devotion to the devilish arts
To the demonic arts!
Purple dusk, mad wisards talking to the ghosts
The alters drain silver cups filled with human pain

I am dead and mystified!
Dead and mystified!

Never you have dreamt it in your dreams
Never you have seen it in your eyes
Never you have heard the deamons scream
Never you have thought they could be back

Dead and Mystified ones
Evil gods make the sun so dim it is world of sin
Hell on earth, it is the culture of death, forever death

Evil hymns, pentagrams drawn on deadly ground
Mad sorceres desire daemon to be found
Daemon to be found
Satan lord his presence makes the sun so dim
Prepares the book pages made of human skin

I am dead and mystified!
Dead and mystified!

Dead and Mystified ones
