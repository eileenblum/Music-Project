Waiting and waiting until it was done
It shined like a star and burned like the sun
Nowhere to hide and there's nowhere to run
Trust in one's lies now damage is done
After the fact there'll be no turning back
I stayed to fight, now there's screams in the night

Meet in the canyon and miss not a word
Know what you know - never trust that you heard
Don't turn your back or the wolves will attack
I stayed to fight, now there's screams in the night

What can you do?
What can you do?

What can you do?
What can we do?

Meet in the canyon and miss not a word
Know what you know - never trust that you heard
After the fact there'll be no turning back
I stayed to fight, now there's screams in the night
Screams in the night
Screams in the night
Night!
