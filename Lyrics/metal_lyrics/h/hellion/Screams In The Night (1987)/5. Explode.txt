Riding with the boys tonight
Cranking up the tunes
Got the stuff to make me feel alright
Don't want to lose it
Looking for a victim
Spot the way it moves
Once I got him cornered
Don't want to lose it

I know it's hard for you
To realize I'm lighted
Can you see the passion in me
Is rising high
Can you feel the heat?

Explode
Got to do it now
Explode

Shifting into overdrive
Let the lightning strike
Got the neon magic and we
Don't want to lose it
Racing with the moment
Winning at the game
Don't you try to stop me
Cuz we don't want to lose it

I know it's hard for you
To realize I'm lighted
Can you see the passion in me
Is rising high
Can you feel the heat?

Explode
Got to do it now
Explode

Can you feel it?
Feel it now
Can you feel it?
Feel it now
Explode
Explode
