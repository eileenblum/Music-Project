Morning comes much too soon
I'm lying in a heap
My head is pounding, my body's aching
I want to go back to sleep
Don't tell me how to live my life
It never worked for you
Cuz if you practiced what you said
You wouldn't be here too

I'm going crazy, I get excited
Out of my mind and out of control
Don't you try to tell me what to do or say
I'm right on time - late every day

I got a bad attitude
Stubborn as a mule
Ain't nobody's fool
I got a bad attitude
That's what they say, yeah
I got a bad attitude

I got a dream
One day I'm gonna make it real
Don't want to work from nine to five
That's just a losing deal

I'm going crazy, I get excited
Out of my mind and out of control
Don't you try to tell me what to do or say
I'm right on time - late every day

I got a bad attitude
Stubborn as a mule
Ain't nobody's fool
I got a bad attitude
That's what they say, yeah
I got a bad attitude

Stubborn as a mule
Ain't nobody's fool
I got a bad attitude
That's what they say
That's what they say
I got a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad attitude
I got a bad, yeah, I got a bad, yeah
