You've been out the whole night long
Putting on a show
I'm waiting alone
You haven't come home
My head is gonna blow
It's been hours since you've been gone
But you're never satisfied
I know where you were last night
I know that you lied

You'd better learn
But you don't even hear one word I've said
You'd better learn or you'll find out
That you'd be better off dead

Better off dead
Don't you see
You ain't fooling me
Better off dead
Better off dead
If you mess around with me
You'd be better off dead

I think you should know by now
But you're never satisfied
I know where you were last night
I know that you lied
Some things never seem to change
You alway leave a clue
See the magick disappear
What are you gonna do

You'd better learn
But you don't even hear one word I've said
You'd better learn or you'll find out
That you'd be better off dead

Better off dead
Don't you see
You ain't fooling me
Better off dead
Better off dead
If you mess around with me
You'd be better off dead

Better off dead
You ain't fooling me
Better off dead
Better off dead
If you mess around with me

Better off, better of dead
Don't mess with me
If you mess around with me
You'd be better off dead
