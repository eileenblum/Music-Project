Long ago the story starts
You knew it all too well
Trust the fools with secrets
And the world is theirs to tell
You've got one thing left to do
You'd better do it right
Take a breath, prepare yourself
Get ready for a fight

To put the hammer down
You put the hammer down
You put the hammer down, down

Sick and tired of being told
Exactly what to do
I've had enough of hearing lies
They're coming all from you
You've got one thing left to do
You'd better do it right
Take a breath, prepare yourself
Get ready for a fight, fight

To put the hammer down
You put the hammer down
You put the hammer down, down

You've got to, got to, got to put it down

Best keep your eyes open
Someone's coming from behind
Even creeping shadows
Weigh heavy on your mind
You've got one thing left to do
You'd better do it right
Take a breath, prepare yourself
Get ready for a fight

To put the hammer down
You put the hammer down
You put the hammer down
You put the hammer down
Where you gonna put it?
Down
Where you gonna put it?
Down

Down
