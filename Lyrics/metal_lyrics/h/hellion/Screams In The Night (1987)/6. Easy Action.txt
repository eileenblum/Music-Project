Here he comes walking in
Looking good tonight
He's got someone on his arm
To the left and to the right
Oh, he's got his licks down
When he plays it drives them wild
Oh yeah, I ain't lying
Oh, he ain't trying
What's it gonna be tonight?

Give him one more night
He's got easy action
Give him one more night
He's got easy action

Here she comes walking tall
She's got her eyes on you
She ain't got no axe to grind
But she's got the moves
Oh, she's got your number
And she'd really like to play
Oh yeah, I ain't lying
Oh, she ain't trying
She knows how to get her way

Give her one more night
She's got easy action
Give her one more night
She's got easy action

Here we go one more time
You want to see us play
We like to be rocking
Anywhere or time of day

You want it now
You want to get it hot
You like the feeling  cuz
It makes you rock
You're playing hard-rocking through the night
We'll be rocking in the morning light

Give us one more night
We've got easy action
Give us one more night
We've got easy action
He's got easy
She's got easy
We've got easy action
He's got easy
She's got easy
We've got easy action
