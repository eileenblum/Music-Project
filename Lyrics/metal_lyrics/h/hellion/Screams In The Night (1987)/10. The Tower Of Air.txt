Lessons learned
He knew them well
Trap the fools
With threats of spells
Eyes of fire long ago
To the Lady secrets told

Oh, don't you know
That your magick can trap you?
Oh, won't you see
When time's standing still

In the forrest
Through the night
His screams are heard
To her delight
But no one knows or seems to care
When you are trapped in a tower of air

Oh, don't you know
Your magick can trap you?
Oh, don't you see
There ain't nothing you can do!

For the love you could not share
Now you're trapped in a tower of air

Oh, don't you know
That your magick can trap you?
Oh, won't you see
When time's standing still

By the power vested in me
I turn your nightmares to reality!
See the tower, it's rising high
There's no escape
Now that you're trapped inside

Oh, don't you know
Your magick can trap you?
Oh, don't you see
There ain't nothing you can do!

For the love you would not share
And the times you could not care
Now you're trapped in a tower of air
