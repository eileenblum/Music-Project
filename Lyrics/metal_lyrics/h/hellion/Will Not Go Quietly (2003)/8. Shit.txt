So you had a couple of heart breaks
Dude! That was your mistake!
Is this how, how you treat your good friend?
Your lies are coming to an end!

You're a legend, a legend in your own mind!
Such a legend, a legend in the lunch line!
I'm tired of hearin' stories
About all the things you're gonna do
Mr Opportunity!

Shit is gonna hit the fan --- let if fly
Shit is gonna hit the fan --- all night long you know
Shit is gonna hit the fan --- you got to make it fly now
Shit is gonna hit the fan --- all night long

Joe spectator, Mr. Masturbator
Tired of hearin' stories
Hell it's getting thick in here!
Rowing round with one oar
Who the hell the stories for?
Your lies are coming to an end
You're a dog without a bone
Barking up the wrong tree
Lights are on, but nobody's at home
Rowing round with one oar
Now who the hell's your story for?
Mr. Opportunity

Shit is gonna hit the fan --- let if fly
Shit is gonna hit the fan --- all night long you know
Shit is gonna hit the fan --- you gotta believe that
Shit is gonna hit the fan --- all night long

Too much talkin' and not enough action
Gotta make yourself available
You wonder why you get a bad reaction
Gotta be relia-BULL!

Shit is gonna hit the fan --- let if fly
Shit is gonna hit the fan --- all night long you know
Shit is gonna hit the fan --- you got to make it fly now
Shit is gonna hit the fan --- all night long
