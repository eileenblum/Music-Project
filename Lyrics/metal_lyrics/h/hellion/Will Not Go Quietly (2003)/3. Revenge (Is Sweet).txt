I tried to tell you long ago
That my feelings weren't
A toy to play with
You did not listen very well
I've had enough!
I'm taking you to Hell!
This is your last mistake
See you in Hell!

They tell me that revenge is sweet
I know that sweet's not something
People call me
They've always told me that revenge is sweet
I know that sweet's not something
People call me... people call me oh...
My guns and bombs can be so loud
Automatic weapons draw a crowd
Choose weapons carefully!
How much do I have to take?
This is your last mistake!
See you in Hell!

They tell me that revenge is sweet
I know that sweet's not somethin'
People call me
They've always told me that revenge is sweet
I know that sweet's not somethin'
People call me
They tell me revenge is sweet
I know that sweet's not somethin'

[Solo]

And I know your name
And I --- I got your number
I know where you go
Who you know
Where you're now
Don't even ask me how!

How much do I have to take?
This is your last mistake!
See you in Hell!

They tell me that revenge is sweet
I know that sweet's not somethin'
People call me
They've always told me that revenge is sweet
I know that sweet's not somethin'
They always tell me...
