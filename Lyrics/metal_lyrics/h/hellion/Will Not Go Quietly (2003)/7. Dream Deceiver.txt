It was sometime in the morning
I realised I had no warning
All of the tales were only propaganda and lies
A way to hide and disguise all the alibis

Do not believe what you see
Don't believe what you read
Don't believe what mommy says
It's only make believe
You are just a number
Nothing more and nothing less
An example, a statistic
You will die like all the rest

Don't give your soul to the dream deceiver
He'll only steal your soul away
Don't give your soul to the dream deceiver
He'll only steal your soul away

Pledge allegiance to the flag
The police are your friends
You get what you pay for there's
No free lunch at the end
You are just a number
Nothing more and nothing less
An example, a statistic
You will die like all the rest

Don't give your soul to the dream deceiver
He'll only steal your soul away
Don't give your soul to the dream deceiver
He'll only steal your soul away

[Solo]

Cops are killing victims
Lovers cheating on each other
Creepy preachers lusting for a prepubescent lover
Vacant eyes are staring at this
Pool of blood and pain
Proud to be outcast I don't want to play this game
Start indoctrination of the children
While they're young
Take away our freedoms slowly one by one

Don't give your soul to the dream deceiver
He'll only steal your soul away
Don't give your soul to the dream deceiver
He'll only steal your soul away
