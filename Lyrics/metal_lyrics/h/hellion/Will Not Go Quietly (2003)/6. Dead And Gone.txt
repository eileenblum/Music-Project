What would you do if I needed a friend?
Would you turn away?
Unplug the phone?
Act like no one is home?
No interruptions today!
If I called out your name
If I cried in pain
Oh won't you tell me what would you do?
Your delusions of power
Could be tested this hour
When a friend needs a friend
Does it make you feel strong!?

Dead and Gone! Dead and Gone!

He was there with a knife
No respect for life!
Baby! It could have been you!
She was a mother of four
Went screaming to the door
She screamed, "Help me!"
Oh, she cried
No one came to her side
The neighbours stood there
Watching 'till she died
Your delusions of power
Could be tested this hour
When a friend needs a friend
Does it make you feel strong!?

Dead and Gone! Dead and Gone!
