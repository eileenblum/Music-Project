I raise up my hands to the night sky
Invoking the powers that be
Oh, lead me to my destiny
I summon the ghosts of the Elders
Recalling the old memories
Oh, lead me to destiny!

United together a heartbeat
The power is growing as one
Feel it rising
Growing leading us on
Round and around...

Give me the strength
So I may chose my fight
Judge my courage by my opponent's might
Let me be the best that I can be
I will never go quietly

[Resurrection:]

Feel the power stronger louder
We all stand as one
All together now forever
We have just begun!
Stand as one!

We are stronger!
We are wiser!
We won't be defeated!
Power growing doing all that's needed!
Power growing doing all that's needed!
Power growing doing all that's needed!
Feel the power!
Feel the power!
Feel the power!
Stronger! Louder!
Feel the power!
Feel...
