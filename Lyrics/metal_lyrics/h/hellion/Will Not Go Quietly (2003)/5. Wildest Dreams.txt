The only time I visit you is in my dreams
That's the only time we share or so it seems
Lately it occurred to me my life is passing me by
I tell myself your memory is a lie

Every night I used to say a little prayer
That I'd wake up and I'd see you lying there
Lately it occurred to me that you were not the way you seemed

Now you wouldn't want to see my wildest dreams!

Lately I look forward 'til I got to bed
That's when all my wildest dreams
Are floating through my head
Trying to remember
What I'm doing to you in my wildest dreams
Plotting to dismember
Well 'cause things ain't always like the way they seem!

Ice pick! Arsenic!
Anything that's really sick!
To put you in your grave!
Shot gun! Better run!
Think I'm gonna have some fun!

You wouldn't believe what
I'm doin' to you in my wildest dreams...

Trying to remember
What' I'm doin' to you in my wildest dreams
Plotting to dismember
Well 'cause things ain't always like the way they seem
Trying to remember every little dirty detail
That I was dreaming about last night
Plotting to dismember 'cause since you've been gone
There ain't nothing goin' right!
