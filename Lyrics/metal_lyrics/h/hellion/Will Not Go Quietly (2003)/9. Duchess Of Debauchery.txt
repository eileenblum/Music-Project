Living in a small town ain't all it's cracked up to be
When I was a teenager I could not wait to leave
I counted most every day until I turned 18
On that day I took the name Duchess of Debauchery

I was born of royal blood
Now what good did it do me
Raised among the rednecks in the USA

Duchess of Debauchery
Well, I'm going down in history
Duchess of Debauchery
Oh, I'm going down
Duchess of Debauchery

The neighbour boys, they said I sucked
The problem was I wouldn't fuck them
Local ladies said that I was strange
I've had enough of lumberjacks
And rednecks with their riffle racks
Hollywood was calling out my name

I was born of royal blood
Now what good did it do me
Raised among the rednecks in the USA
I was born of royal blood
In the USA

Duchess of Debauchery
I'm going down in history
Duchess of Debauchery
What do you expect from me?
Duchess of Debauchery
Shouldn't be a mystery
Duchess of Debauchery
Going down in history

Duchess of Debauchery
What the hell do you think of me
Duchess of Debauchery
Shouldn't be a mystery
Duchess of Debauchery
I'm going down in history
Duchess of Debauchery
I'm going down
