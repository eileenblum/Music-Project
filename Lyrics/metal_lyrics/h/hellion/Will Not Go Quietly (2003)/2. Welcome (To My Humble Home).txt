How long do you think it took
Before somebody came to look?!

Never was like all the rest
Wasn't too appealing
People talked behind my back
Even freaks... they have feelings!

How long do you think it took
Before they sent somebody
To come and look for me?
I waited for you here all alone
I waited by the phone
You know the all that's left
Is a bag of bones!

Welcome to my humble home!
Now did you come alone
And would you like something to drink?
I've been here for years alone
Nobody ever phoned
It's given me some time to think!

I waited by the telephone
For days and weeks and hours
First my hair turned grey then white
Now I'm pushing up the flowers!

How long do you think it took
Before they sent somebody
To come and look for me?
I waited for you here all alone
I waited by the phone
You know the all that's left
Is a bag of bones!

Welcome to my humble home!
Now did you come alone
And would you like something to drink?
I've been here for years alone
Nobody ever phoned
It's given me some time to think!

Pity all the sober folks
Who never drank and did not smoke
They think they'll end up on a cloud
AT LEAST IN HELL THE MUSIC'S LOUD

Welcome to my humble home!
Now did you come alone
And would you like something to drink?
I've been here for years alone
Nobody ever phoned
It's given me some time to think!

Welcome to my home
Welcome to my humble home!
Welcome to my home
Welcome to my humble home!
Welcome to my home...
