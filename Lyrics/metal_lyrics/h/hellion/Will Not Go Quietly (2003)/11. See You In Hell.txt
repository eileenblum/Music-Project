There's a place in my heart
Where you'll always be
No matter how hard I try
So I come to this place
On this night like before
This time to say good-bye

Now is the time we must bury the dead
I should have long before
Shovel by shovel I take out the earth
I'll visit you no more
Comes a time when the dead start to smell
They're no fun when they're rotten as Hell

See you in Hell, if you're lucky, yeah I'll
See you in Hell one cold night
See you in Hell, if you're lucky, yeah I'll
See you in Hell one cold, cold night

Here is the place where I'm leaving your bones
My ritual of the end
Let me forget that first night that we met
So now my heart can mend
Comes a time when the dead start to smell
They're no fun when they're rotten as Hell

See you in Hell, if you're lucky, yeah I'll
See you in Hell one cold night
See you in Hell, if you're lucky, yeah I'll
See you in Hell one cold night
See you in Hell, if you're lucky, yeah I'll
See you in Hell one cold night
See you in Hell, if you're lucky, yeah I'll
See you in Hell one cold, cold night

Comes a time when the dead start to smell
They're no fun when they're rotten as Hell
See you in Hell, if you're lucky, yeah I'll
See you in Hell one cold night
See you in Hell, if you're lucky, yeah I'll
See you in Hell one cold night
See you in Hell, if you're lucky, yeah I'll
See you in Hell one cold night
See you in Hell

See you in Hell
See you in Hell
See you in Hell
See you in Hell
