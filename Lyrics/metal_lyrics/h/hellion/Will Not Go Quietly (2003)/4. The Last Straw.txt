One straw broke the camel's back
One step forward, two steps back
The last straw the pressure's comin' down on you
What did you do to you?
The last straw there's nothing - ain't nothin'
Nothing left that I can do!

It's been a long time
And I should've known better
Than to trust you
It's the last straw!
It's been a long time and I should have been wiser
Where you ever as you seemed?
It's the last straw!

How much longer until I crack?
Working towards a heart attack!
There's little that's left to do

When hope alone won't see you through
The last straw the pressure's coming down on you
What did you do to you?
The last straw there's nothing - ain't nothin'
Nothing left that I can do!

It's been a long time
And I should've known better
Than to trust you
It's the last straw!
It's been a long time and I should have been wiser
Where you ever as you seemed?
It's been a long time
It's the last straw!
And I should've known better
Than to trust you with my dreams
It's the last straw!

[Solos: Schenck &amp; Thompson]

The last straw
The last straw the pressure's coming down on you
What did you do to you?
The last straw there's nothing - ain't nothin'
Nothing left that I can do!
It's been a long time and I should've known better
Than to trust you with my dreams
It's the last straw!
It's been a long time and I should have been wiser
Where you ever as you seemed?
It's the last straw!
It's been a long time and I should've known better
Than to trust you with my dreams
It's the last straw!
It's been a long time, oh yeah
And I should have known better
It's the last straw!

Should've known better
Should've known better
Should've known better
It's the last straw!
