Trapped into the silence
Is where you'll never be
A rebel with a cause
Opposing forced conformity

Oh, they'll try to stop you
But dreams are in your sight
Don't you let them break you
You're children of the night
Children of the night

Forced into a schedule
And formed into a mold
They tried to make a robot
But they're losing all control

Oh, they'll try to put you down
But you'll stand up and fight
Don't you let them stop you
You're children of the night
Children of the night

Mix with fire and anger
The beast within comes out
He's burning up inside you
He's clawing to get out

Oh, they'll try to put you down
But dreams are in your sight
Don't you le them stop you
You're children of the night
Children of the night
