Long ago and far away they met upon a holiday
To thank the gods for nature's gifts bestowed
Secrets past from mouth to ear
The evil ones would always fear
Unless they could destroy beliefs of old

Stand in a circle and reach to the sky

Far away crusaders met
Calling horsemen to conquest
And plot the death of heathens in their path
They tortured men a hundred ways
Till they'd bow their heads and pray
You closed your mind but can't forget the past

Stand in a circle and reach to the sky
Don't be afraid when you're learning to fly

Stand in a circle and reach to the sky
Don't be a fool whose been caught in the lie
Be not afraid 'cuz we all have the power
There's no need to fear come the witching hour
Oh no

Fly high

Join together hand in hand
The Challenger awaits command
The moon is rising for the world to see
We'll meet upon a moonlit shore
Make magic real just like before
Take my hand, Oh, won't you come with me

Don't be afraid when you're learning to fly
Laugh at the fools who arent willing to try
Be not afraid 'cuz we all have the power
There's no need to fear come the witching hour
