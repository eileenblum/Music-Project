Here I am like the gypsy said
Several years before
Inside my hand lies my destiny
It lead me to your door

Don't ask me why
I do not know
I'm finding it hard to believe
The lines in my hand's where my future lies
But Lord am I being decieved

The secret pact the leaders kept
Hath brought war to the land
Just like the words that the gypsy spoke
This is where I stand

Don't ask me why
I do not know
I'm finding it hard to believe
The lines in my hand's where my future lies
But Lord am I being decieved

What can you do when your life's on the line
Like the gypsy had planned
You've got to make it your way
No matter what they say
Don't be a slave to the hand
You've got to understand the hand
