Running faster than I can
Pieces fit together I can understand
All predictions, time has come
Hiding 'cuz I know that I'm the chosen one

Can you see it clear
Time is coming near

Hear the warning
The time has come, don't you know
Hear the warning
The time has come, don't you know

In the castle I did break
As I crept into the room he hid in wait
Something grows inside my mind
Feeling all the power of an ancient time

Can you feel it clear
There's no need to fear

Hear the warning
The time has come, don't you know
Hear the warning
The time has come, don't you know

You'd better listen to the warning
You'd better hear the words I say
If you know what's good for you
You'd better go, go, go

Hear the warning
The time has come, don't you know
Hear the warning
The time has come, don't you know
Hear the warning
You've got to go
