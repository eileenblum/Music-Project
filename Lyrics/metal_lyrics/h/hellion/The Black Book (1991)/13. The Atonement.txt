I can see it coming clear
Trapped inside four walls as strong as steel
Bound and tied, locked inside
No-one knows the power I can feel

Looking for a cause without a reason
Tragedy is just another word
Looking for a cause without a reason
Tragedy is just a word

Save your tears for the living
They cry out loud
Save your tears for the living
They feel pain

I can see it coming clear
Reasons for a false reality
Trapped inside, no way to hide
From visions that I have come to see

Looking for a cause without a reason
Tragedy is just a word

At the end of the hall there's an old wooden door
The answer's laying there for all to see
I was bound and I was tied
'Cauz I knew what lay insisde
They were waiting for the power to be free

As the words they were said
Felt them real inside my head
They were ancient but they spoke reality
All the visions I could see
Feel it building up in me
Feel the power building
Set the power free

Looking for a cause without a reason
Tragedy is just a word
Looking for a cure without a reason
Tragedy is just....
