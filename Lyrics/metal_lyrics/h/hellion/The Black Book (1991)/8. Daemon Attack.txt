What can you do when the reasons
All seem to point in your face
The others lay sleeping and quiet
Unaware of the plans I had made
Sometimes you just can't remember
What happened the evening before
You turn to an absolute stranger
You know that you've known him before

Can you see it clear?
Hiding, standing near
Attack

One morning at dawn I awakened
The doctor he stood by the door
The hospital's where I was taken
'Till I could stand it no more

Can you see it clear?
Hiding, standing near
Attack
Attack

Can you feel it?
He's there, waiting just to take you down
You'd best believe it
He's there, waiting just to spin you around

[Solo: Alan Barlam]

What can you do when the reasons
All seem to point in your face
The others lay sleeping and quiet
Unaware of the plans I had made
Sometime I just can't remember
What happened the evening before
You turn to an absolute stranger
You know that you've seen him before

Can you see it clear?
Hiding, standing near
Attack
Attack
