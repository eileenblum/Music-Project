There's a place in your mind
Where the absence of logic makes reason
Can you see by the look in my eyes
That there's something not right
What can you do when the absence of logic means dager
Nobody knows where I go in the heat of the night
Going around in a circle will only lead nowhere
Around in a spiral, around and you're just going down, no, no

Logic: Gone
Reason: Gone
Have I lost my mind?
Anger: Gone
Passion: Gone
Search but you won't find

The moon it was high in the sky and the house it was empty
Alone in my room I escaped with a bottle of wine
Raising my glass to the stars while the music was playing
Dance in a spiral and wait for the coming of time
Going around in a circle will only lead nowhere
Around in a spiral, around and you're just going down, no, no

We are losing control
We are losing control
We are losing control
We are losing control

Down, down, down, down
Will you tie me down?
No, no, no, no
Don't you even try
Victim of society and acting out the role
No, no, no, no, no

[Solo: Ray Schenck]

We are losing control
We are losing control
We are losing control
We are losing control
