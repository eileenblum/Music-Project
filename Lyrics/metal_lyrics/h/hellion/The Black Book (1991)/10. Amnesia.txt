Hell, it is where I live
Life, it is what you give and take
Your mind started to unwind
All that you left behind forgotten after all the pain
Drive you insane, oh forever
Amnesia

Here, I am locked away
Shock taking all my dreams away
My mind's started to unwind
All that you left behind forgotten after all the pain
Drive you insane, oh forever
Amnesia

Hell, it is where I live
Life, it is what you give and take
Your mind started to unwind
All that you left behind forgotten after all the pain
Drive you insane, oh forever
Amnesia
Amnesia
