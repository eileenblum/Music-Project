Stormrider, high flyer
Live on the edge and hide in the dark
Black liar, cold fire
Wait 'till the night to escape what you are

Stormrider, shadowhider
Taunting the senses and tempting the soul
Trap the madness, jail the sadness
The future has come and the past has been told

Don't you think I'm gonna find a way
To break through all your secrets
I grow strong with power of the fire

Liar
Stormrider
Stormrider
Black Liar

In the morning I'll be calling
Words through the candles, like music on air
Black Liar, face the fire
Tables have turned, it's your time to beware

Don't you think I'm gonna find a way
To break through all your secrets
I grow strong with power of the fire

Liar
Stormrider
Stormrider
Black Liar
