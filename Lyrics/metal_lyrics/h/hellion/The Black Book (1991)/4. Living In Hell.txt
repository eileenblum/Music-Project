Look into the future, there ain't nothing I can see
Everyone is trapped inside a false reality
Only thinking of yourself is leading you nowhere
Do you call that free?
Everyone around is falling down on me

Sick minds always winning at the game
I make my own rules and take the blame
Living, living in Hell
Living, living in Hell

Bills are stacked up two feet high
The landlord's on the phone
Got no transportation, no place to go
Something's going wrong
I don't like all that I'm seeing
Nothing I can do
Everything around is falling down on you

Sick minds always win the game
I make my own rules and take the blame
Living, living in Hell
Living, living in Hell
Living, living in Hell
Living, living in Hell
Living in Hell

[Solos: Kenny Andrews / Chet Thompson]

This house is smelling rotten
The sink is turning green
The halls are filled with garbage
There ain't nothing here that's clean
Only thinking of yourself is leading you nowhere
Do you call that free?
Everyone around is falling down on me

Sick minds always win the game
I make my own rules and take the blame
Living, living in Hell
Living, living in Hell
Living, living in Hell
Living, living in Hell
