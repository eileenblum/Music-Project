There came a time I'd had all I could take
Life on the edge, my mind about to break
Parents said they'd warned me and my friends said
It's a shame
Doctor said the stress was playing tricks upon my brain

Doctor he told me I had to get away
Climbed a jet liner, bound for the UK
Resting in the countryside, L.A. far behind
Something deep inside was playing tricks in side my mind
Tricks inside my mind

There in the wall it lay throughout the years
Pages of secrets, the source of all their fears
Hidden reasons, flashing eyes, something isn't right
What can you do when you're running out of sight
Hiding from the light

Nightmares waken me at night
Shadows hiding from the night

[Solos: Kenny Andrews / Chet Thompson / Kenny Andrews / Chet Thompson]

Old parchment pages that crack when opened wide
There in the Black Book the magic came alive
Hidden reasons, flashing eyes, something isn't right
What can you do when you're hiding out  of sight
Welcoming the night

Shadows waken me at night
See the Black Book come alive
