Drunken bloody mess, to this I must confess
Beaten like a bitch, defeated in the ditch
Pummeled to the ground, no help to be found
Blood stains cover my shirt and a mouthful of dirt

Screaming from across the tracks, loser in the ditch
Courage from my drinking, didn't save me from my beating
Now I start to rise, with missing teeth and blackened eyes
I now admit my loss, my pride is what it cost

Fighting in the ditch
Bleeding in the ditch
Pummeled in the ditch
You'll die in the ditch

Looking for a friend to save my ass again
He's running for his life, got his ass kicked from behind
I don't even make a sound, knocked out from the beat down
I now admit the loss, all this shit from the sauce

In the ditch you will die
