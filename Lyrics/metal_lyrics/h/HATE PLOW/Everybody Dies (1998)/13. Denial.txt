Lying to myself and you
Deny - no one has a clue
Using - I do drugs everyday
Keeping the pain away

They will never know
I have lost my sense
I have it under control
That's what I tell my friends

What have I done to me
To my friends and family
This is pure fucking hell
I must kill myself

Soon they all will say
I need to be put away
I'm getting fucking close
Dying by an overdose

No one knows
I do coke
I do smack
I do smoke
I do dust
I do pills
For myself
No one else

Addiction [x5]

Denial
