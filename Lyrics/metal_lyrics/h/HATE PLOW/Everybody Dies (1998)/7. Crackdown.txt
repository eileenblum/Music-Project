Searching through these downtown streets
To find the losers high on crack
It is time to exterminate
Now's the time to attack

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You will not live, no chance to survive
This is your last time to hit the pipe

Crack Addiction

In a dumpster, there you will hide
I smell the smoke coming from the pipe
It's time to pay, a crackdown will happen
This is the time it will happen today

You'll pay the price
With your fucked pathetic life
My jobs not through
If you're a crack head I'll find you

Crackdown [x8]

A shotgun blast is how you will die
The addict trys pleading, he begins to cry

There is no escaping - you're all alone
You see now, your time has come
Your life is over - your life is done

Crackdown [x8]

You've paid the price
With your fucked pathetic life
My jobs not through
If you're a crack head, I'll find you
