When I first saw her, I knew she was mine
All my life, it was only a matter of time
Looking through her window from her neighbor's tree
Watching her undress begins to excite me

When I'm lonely I start stalking, she will be mine
Our love will be forever, she will learn in time

Yes will be your decision, or I will make an incision
You'll start to bleed, don't try crying to me
You had your chance, but my feelings never last

Where to find a love that understands me
They say I am an abnormalcy
Now it's time for me to find a bride
It shall be or it's the end of her life

Stalker

Stalking my prey, through the night and through the day
A sickness you can't control, no matter what you do or say

Now that it's over, now that you are done
I must find another, and tell her that I love her
I no longer care what people think
If I am a pervert, or sick psychotic

Yes will be your decision, or I will make an incision
You'll start to bleed, don't try crying to me
You had your chance, but my feelings never last
