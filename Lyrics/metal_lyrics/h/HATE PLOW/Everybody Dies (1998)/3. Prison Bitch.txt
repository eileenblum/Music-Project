You were sent in for life to pay for all your crimes
No chance to get out, you will do your time
You think that you are tough, no one will fuck with you
To them you are fresh meat, you don't have a clue

Horror, what you will see
A bitch, is what you will be
Doing whatever they want
Because you were caught

The Kool-Aid on your face
You look just like a cunt
Now you know your just
A worthless prison slut

You are the victim now, you get it up the ass
You get what you deserve, you worthless piece of trash
You suck all their dicks, for a small bag of chips
A fag is what you are, you worthless piece of shit
