Hatred for you
Sealing your fate
Craving your pain
Extinguish the human race

If you live and if you breath your already against me
No remorse for who I kill, I love the psychotic thrill
Can't control the feeling inside, I want everyone to die
If you see me run away or you're the next to die today

There are none who understand, how could this be a man
No emotions or reasoning towards any living thing

Through my vision everybody dies

It doesn't matter your sex religion or your race
Don't try reading, that shit doesn't work on me

Who will be the next, there are many targets left
No one will survive, pray to god that you're alive
You won't be for long, I'll be sure to prove you wrong
Soon everyone will die
