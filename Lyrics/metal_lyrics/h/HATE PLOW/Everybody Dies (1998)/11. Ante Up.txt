It's 9 o'clock, time to go
Ante up for some blow
Shit time is here, throw in some cash
Shit time is now, time for the crash

Pale white face, nose is bleeding
One line to go
Roll the bill, snort your thrill
Soon your life unfolds
Pale white face, nose is bleeding
One line to go
Roll the bill, snort your thrill
Soon your life unfolds

Ante up, Ante up, Ante up, momma
Ante up, Ante up, Ante up, addict

It's 4a.m.
I'm naked and sweaty
Another eight ball, fuck I'm ready
My nose is running, I think its time
Bust out the packie, lay out the lines
My heart can't stand it, I think I'm through
Dying in an alley, naked and blue

Ante up, Ante up, Ante up, you fucking freak
Ante up, Ante up, Ante up

Ante up motherfucker
