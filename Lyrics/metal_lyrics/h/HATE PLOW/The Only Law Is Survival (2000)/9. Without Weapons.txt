I don't need a knife or a gun to take your life
Just my bare hands to kill you where you stand
I am the last person you will ever see
Don't try to run, you won't get away from me
This is a pain like you never felt before
I will hit you then you will hit the ground
Blood will be shed from my kicks to your face
You were a man, now you are a disgrace
Human tornado of fists and feet
Violence to a certain degree
Of rage and destruction
You can't comprehend
Of what I've done before
To claim my victory
Or what I will do right now
Look out your next
Beaten just like all the rest
Kiss your ass goodbye
You won't make it home tonight
You don't know me
And your never fucking will
Without weapons
Is the way I choose to kill
WITHOUT, WITHOUT, WITHOUT WEAPONS
