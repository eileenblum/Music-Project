Ridicule is punishment that no one forgets
Through the years of time, consuming their minds
Talks begin to rise about destroying lives
Then one day they snapped
And made plans for the attack
Who are you...to judge me...society's OUTCAST
"Where are all the ones we fucked with for fun?"
They are on their way, destined to devastate
Both are fully armed with intent to harm
There's no turning back
Right now is the time to attack!!
Who are you...to judge me...society's OUTCAST
Guns are aimed at the targets for termination
Pipe bombs now explode as they take control
Resentment turns to fear, their demise drawn near
Victims try to plead as they choose who is next
Ridicule is punishment that no one forgets
Through the years of time, consuming their minds
Now they know they've learned
Received what they deserve
Revenge is now complete
Now they have one thing left to do
Who are you...to judge me...society's OUTCAST
