So you thought that all the shit...
Would go down
False alarm there was no...
World war three
No terrorist strike, no ending of crime
This world is still a wreck
FUCK THE MILLENNIUM
Useless wars will never cease
FUCK THE MILLENNIUM
So much for your world of peace
FUCK THE MILLENNIUM
The problems have not gone away
Global unrest here to stay
Diseases kill all
Kill a modern day plague
The hungry still starve
While we all get to eat
You thought that it would be time
Time for a change
It seems to everything is still the same
FUCK THE MILLENNIUM
Useless wars will never cease
FUCK THE MILLENNIUM
So much for your world of peace
FUCK THE MILLENNIUM
The problems have not gone away
Global unrest here to stay
