What the fuck has happened to me?
I'm not right, an anti-social freak
Sick of life and society
Hated by all from what I've become
Worthless loser, my life is done
Why has this happened to me
EMOTIONAL CATASTROPHE
What the fuck is wrong with me?
EMOTIONAL CATASTROPHE
I can't stop screaming at myself
I am the one I despise
It won't stop this mental demise
I am scarred, scarred for life
Why has this happened to me
EMOTIONAL CATASTROPHE
What the fuck is wrong with me?
EMOTIONAL CATASTROPHE
Now's the time for me to take full control
I realize this life was not meant to be
I believe I've held on for far too long
I will now end this catastrophe
Now's the time for me to take full control
I realize this life was not meant to be
I believe I've held on for far too long
I will now end this CATASTROPHE
