You can run, but you can't hide
I want back what is mine
Now's my time to attack
To teach the lesson called payback
Broken arms and broken legs
It's too late for you to beg
Nothing can set you free
Now you have to deal with me
Now you're lying in a pool
Of your own piss and blood
Thinking that I will stop
I have only just begun
This is your fucking fault
I'm not the one to blame
Now you have realized
I won't play your fucking games!!!
When I ever think of you, it makes me fucking sick
What I will put your through you deserve, you fucking prick
You will see your mistake is when you will cross my path
You no good scumbag bum, now it's time to feel my wrath
You can run, but you can't hide
I want back what is mine
Now's my time to attack
To teach the lesson called PAYBACK!!!
