Hopes and dreams, shattered by disease
The rage his plan, infect all that he can
Symptoms not seen
Not yet, looks clean
He will fuck her and will not fucking tell her
She will not know
Until too late
Her life will cease in time from his disease
Hopes and dreams, shattered by disease
The rage his plan, infect all that he can
Now she's fucking someone else and
Giving that person AIDS
Unknown to her what she's done
The domino effect has now begun
One right after another
It will never fucking stop
Many people will suffer and this
Is what he fucking wants
There is no hope
There is no goddamn cure
Since he's going to die
He will be taking people with him
He now starts to decompose and
Knows death is soon to be
Countless victims will soon die
From his demented killing spree
Hopes and dreams, shattered by disease
The rage his plan, infect all that he can
