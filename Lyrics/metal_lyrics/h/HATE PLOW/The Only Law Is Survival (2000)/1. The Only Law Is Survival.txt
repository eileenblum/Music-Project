No longer blind, I've opened my eyes
I now see wrong from right
What I've lost, I now reclaim
The time is now before it's too late
Prepare for the war, prepare for death
Killing to live until my last breath
Weapons are loaded, the traps now set
Don't try something you will fucking regret
The key to life...eliminate all
THE ONLY LAW IS SURVIVAL
Some will say I'm insane
I need to be locked away
It's one for one and none for all
When do you obey these laws
Look around, it makes me sick
What once was now is this
Our cities have fallen through
Who's to blame, I blame you
The key to life...eliminate all
THE ONLY LAW IS SURVIVAL
You are all against me
You are all my rivals
I trust no one in this war of survival
No longer blind, I've opened my eyes
I now see wrong from right
What I've lost, I now reclaim
The time is now before it's too late
Prepare for the war, prepare for death
Killing to live until my last breath
Weapons are loaded, the traps now set
Don't try something you will fucking regret
The key to life...eliminate all
THE ONLY LAW IS SURVIVAL
SURVIVE...SURVIVE...SURVIVE!!!
