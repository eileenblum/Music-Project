Pulled over
They searched on RV
What was found was
2 ounces of weed
No excuses "You're under arrest,
Put your hands above your head"
Jail is now our home for
Crimes that one committed
Now we spend our time...
INCARCERATED
Thrown inside a holding cell
With the charge (intent to sell)
Fingerprinted, mug shots taken
Led to the cell that we're to stay in
Now inside, with killers and thieves
Most infected with disease
Disillusioned, we can't believe
We're in jail because of weed
Jail is now our home for
Crimes that one committed
Now we spend our time...
INCARCERATED
WE'RE INCARCERATED
WE'RE INCARCERATED
WE'RE INCARCERATED
(WITH INTENT TO SELL)
The days go by too damn slow
In a cage with nowhere to go
Play some cards, watch TV
Eat your slop and go to sleep
We call for help
"They took our cash"
"They thought we were dealing grass"
Now we're free, released on bail
FUCK LONOKE AND ITS JAIL!!!
