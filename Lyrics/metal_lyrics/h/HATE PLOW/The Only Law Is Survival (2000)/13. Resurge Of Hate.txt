Years and years have gone by
I thought my urge was defeated
It's returning stronger than ever
I know I have no control
There's no reason, only anger
Only hatred for you now
You are all victims of fate to
My resurgence of hate...
No compassion, no remorse
For the torment I will cause
There's just one way to stop this
Put an end to my existence
I would never try to explain
Why I act and think this way
The impulse takes over to
Kill and destroy
I challenge all to try at will
To hunt me down for the kill
You all wish for my demise
Because
I've ruined people's lives
Now that you
Have caused my death
Your urge to kill
Hasn't stopped
Now my plan
Is working great to
Introduce you all to hate...
Now that my life has ended
Your anger hasn't left you yet
You are still enraged
And don't know
How to release it
Remember the pain
I caused and
Take it out of someone else
You are still victims of fate to
My resurgence of HATE!!!
