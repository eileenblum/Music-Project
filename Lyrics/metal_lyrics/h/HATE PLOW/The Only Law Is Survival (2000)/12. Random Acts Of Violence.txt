It may strike anytime
Blood boils, tempers rise
The beatings now commence
RANDOM ACTS OF VIOLENCE
People come to show rage
Uncontrolled, not contained
The riots now commence
RANDOM ACTS OF VIOLENCE
A killer grabs a knife
Stabs you twice, takes your life
The murders now commence
RANDOM ACTS OF VIOLENCE
These are the ways people
Do act in this world today
I won't tell you if it's wrong or right
It's up to you all to fucking decide
People go in a rage
Cause you're not the same race
The race wars not commence
RANDOM ACTS OF VIOLENCE
Some are poor, out of work
Rob a store, kill the clerk
Robberies now commence
RANDOM ACTS OF VIOLENCE
Predators go to school
Look for kids to molest
Abuses are some of the things
That take place everyday
Violent acts now commence
RANDOM ACTS OF VIOLENCE
