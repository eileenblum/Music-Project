I'm a disaster waiting to happen
your next step may trigger your fate
I can give your life a bad end
I'm a device devised by hate
I am hungry for some limbs
but I might as well take your life
Better yet if you're a kid
who never heard about landmines...
For some time now
The world's been aware of our deeds
But no one seems to care
At least for now we're in for the kill
Meet my friend the Mustard Gas
Smell his scent and feel his rage
I see he burns your skin real fast
Is that pain I see in your face?
Let me introduce Sarin
I'm sure he wants to make you bleed
He'll make you suffocate in pain
Give you a brand new blackened skin!
For some time now
The world's been aware of our deeds
But no one seems to care
At least for now we're in for the kill
In the rave of High Technology
Death may come in shocking ways
