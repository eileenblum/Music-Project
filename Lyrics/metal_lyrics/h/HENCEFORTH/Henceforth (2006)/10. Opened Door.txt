So you always longed for this moment
Chances are it will change your life
Don't try to fool yourself
By pretending that the dream is gone
Not long ago you made a choice
and now you're looking back
You're wondering:
âwas the path I took the right one to be taken?â
Father Time then reopened a door
That you thought was locked and
now your time has finally come
To be free...
So now throw away your fears
The waiting is over, can't you see?
You're finally free to ride
In a blue sky that was so far away
And now you're able to see
How unpredictable life can be
You thought that things were all defined
Now change is coming straight in
A new direction to your life
And now it's right before your eyes
It's all because you've sowed the seeds
And waited so long for the outcome...
And now you're able to see
How unpredictable life can be
You thought that things were all defined
Now change is coming straight in
A new direction to your life
And now it's right before your eyes
It's all because you've sowed the seeds
And waited so long for the outcome...
