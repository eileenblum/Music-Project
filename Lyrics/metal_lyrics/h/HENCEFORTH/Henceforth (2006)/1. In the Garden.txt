I keep calling you
But you cannot hear me
I smell your perfume
I see you walking in the garden
But it's too late
Yesterday was your last day...
I see the children playing
I feel your house empty
I see your shade around
I stand waiting for the next day
But it's too late
Yesterday was your last day...
