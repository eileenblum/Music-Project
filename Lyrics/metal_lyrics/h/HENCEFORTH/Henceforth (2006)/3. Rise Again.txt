Just standing by southern shores
Gaze at a wide, wide horizon
Shared by both storms and blue skies
Enjoying long awaited peace of mind
That took so long to come
I feel the cool sea breeze
But then it makes me think
Of whom I shouldn't think
Certain times are to be left behind
But this is easier said than done
âcause when heartache takes me over
It's no use denying pain...
So I just head for the water
I'll dive deep once more
I will let things flow out of my mind
I'll smile again...
When I look inside myself I see
I'm still the child I used to be
I'm only grown up on the outside
and that leaves a giant void inside
Now it's time, I have to find the one
That will take me out of the abyss
But living life the way I do
There's no chance that things will change
When emotional disasters come
I know they always last for so long,
âtil that star shines on once more
and it's time for me to Rise Again
So I just head for the water
I'll dive deep once more
I will let things flow out of my mind
I'll smile again
And again I will wonder
Will that star shine someday?
Someday I'll remember that it made me
that it made me Rise Again
