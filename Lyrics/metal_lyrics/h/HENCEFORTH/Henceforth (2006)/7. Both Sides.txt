This is a strange place...
So beautiful yet so sad
Wooden huts over steep ravines
The desperate clown begs for charity
A shock as clear as day
Modern buildings selling dreams
A man sleeps in the street
While fancy cars are passing by
He'll start craving the pipe
As his mind gets clear again
In a place that's blessed by God
Politicians let it be this way
Mostly anywhere
It would seem it's not for real
It's too great a gap
Between both sides of the story
Senses go numb
It's so insane...
I won't mind, I'll just go on
It doesn't feel like I belong
I'm just a passing stranger
I don't have an obligation
I believe the ones who rule
Are doing their best to fix it all
If not, what can I do?
As I said I don't belong...
Mostly anywhere
It would seem it's not for real
It's too great a gap
Between both sides of the story
Senses go numb
It's so insane...
