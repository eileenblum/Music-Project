Raise your head - You're in from a bumpy ride
Catch your breath - Fill your lungs with fresh air
It will take some time until you feel alright up here...
You'll be quite fine, you've been good...
The ones you left are doing well, you feel their power as they pray
Nevermind if they cry sometimes, it's all part of the game
They know you're much better now, they know your mission was over
And after all you'll meet again, for no one ever dies...
Into Higher Ground
We all want to be
Taken to Higher Ground
Now you know you are
Climbin'up new steps
But each step at a time
Into Higher Ground
The story goes on
There'll be a time when you'll have to go back
You'll be playing a different part in the play
To learn the things you missed last time
You won't remember what you saw here
You'll meet new people
You won't realize it, but you already know them all
Into Higher Ground
We all want to be
Taken to Higher Ground
Now you know you are
Climbin'up new steps
But each step at a time
Into Higher Ground
The story goes on
It feels so good in this warm wet place
Seems like I'm waiting to go up on stage again
It feels so good in this warm wet place
Seems like I'm waiting to go up on stage again

[Chorus]
