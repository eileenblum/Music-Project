You must have been through this before
Everything turns out so wrong
You feel helpless, in despair
You try so hard, but never succeed
Someone said âdon't waste your timeâ
Discouraged you to dare
People tend to be afraid
If only I had a crystal ball...
I wanna break the chains that keep me
Tied to this boring reality
I wanna live the dreams I dreamed
Then one day I'll die in a dreamer's way
It hurts inside
When dreams subside
Making way to bitter days
It hurts inside
I lose my pride
To think of dreams that were left behind
I don't regret the things I did
But I regret those left undone
I try to live one dream at a time
So that I'm sure to lose no one
It hurts inside
When dreams subside
Making way to bitter days
It hurts inside
I lose my pride
To think of dreams that were left behind
