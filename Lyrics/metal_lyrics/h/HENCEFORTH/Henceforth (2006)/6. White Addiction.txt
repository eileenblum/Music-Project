The needle always finds its way
To help me swallow my pride
When there's nothing left to say
When there's nothing left to do
And I'm the one to spread the news
I know I shouldn't do it
I am killing myself
When I'm supposed to heal
I'am out of my mind
But that's when the feeling fades away
And I stop feeling useless...
For how long can I go on like this?
How long before something goes wrong?
I can kill making mistakes
It's time for me to stop
It's time for me to stop...
But I can't let it go away
It takes me so high I can't give it up
You can lay down beside me
Let's watch the ceiling spin...
How can it all be
So close, within his reach?
It shouldn't be that easy...
No one could tell what was happening
But how can one trust him now?
I don't know, was it always like this?
Please tell me...
I know it hurts, but I want my share
I'm so glad it's within grasp
When I need to find the strength
To keep trying it right
I think I need just one more shot...
How can it all be
So close, within his reach?
It shouldn't be that easy...
No one could tell what was happening
His White Addiction
I don't know, was it always like this?
Please tell me...
