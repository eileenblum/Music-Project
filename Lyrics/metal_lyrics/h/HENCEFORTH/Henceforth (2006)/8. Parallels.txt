We had it all in our hands
But we let it slip away
I never felt so weak
How could it be?
Our need for privacy
Got over our will to share
We were left alone
With the bitter taste of sorrow
It felt like it would heal
yet time proved us wrong
Our innocence made us blind
And made us go astray...
Many years have passed
We grew old along the way
It wasn't meant to last
But memories are here to stay
Those long lost promises
Couldn't stand our changing minds
We wanted assurance
But couldn't stand the wait
Our lives, in parallel lines
Somehow have changed their courses
The crossing point, a single dot
To punctuate the lines we draw
I wonder if they'll cross again
Like dancing sine waves
Let's just get on with life
We cannot wait forever
We were never meant to cross
Torn apart by simmetry
Our lives, in parallel lines
Somehow have changed their courses
The crossing point, a single dot
To punctuate the lines we draw
I wonder if they'll cross again
Like dancing sine waves
Let's just get on with life
We cannot wait forever
We were never meant to cross
Torn apart by simmetry
We were never meant to cross
Torn apart by simmetry
