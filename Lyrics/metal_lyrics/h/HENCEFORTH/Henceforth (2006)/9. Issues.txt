There are things in life
That are better left alone
Ashes from other times
That if blown may show hot coal
In a secret place
We all hide our secret feelings
In this secret place
Lies a graveyard of memories
Have you ever stopped to think
How would life be without so many turns
Have you ever wished you could
Turn back and make a change
And solve issues left unsolved
And straighten the lines along the way
Maybe do a few things that were left undone â and far behind
Wake up, or in the end our lives will pass us by...
Have you ever stopped to think
How would life be without so many turns
Have you ever wished you could
Turn back and make a change
And solve issues left unsolved
And straighten the lines along the way
Maybe learn a few things that were left unlearned â and far behind
Wake up, or in the end our lives will pass us by...
