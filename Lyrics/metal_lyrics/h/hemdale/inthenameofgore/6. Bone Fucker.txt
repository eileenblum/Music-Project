[musick &amp; lyrixxx - Matt Harvey, 1995]

The mouldy earth crumbles under my pick-axe, The hardened turf gives up its
morbid harvest, Cracking the earthen crypt with my rusted spade, Disinterrment
of the pieces from where they lay to rest... The arduous task reveals my
unhealthy reward, A long dead stiff is the fruit of my labours, Fracturing the
brittle wooden coffin, To reveal the skeletonized remains that I savour... The
horrendous stench only serves , To heighten my anticipation, Rotted prizes
bring with them , The prospect of gratification... Fellating the femur as my
anus quivers anxiously, I tongue the mandibles as I work myself into a frenzy,
My sphincter twitching uncontrollably in expectation, With a firm grip on the
fibula I commence my anal penetration... My buttocks clenched tightly around
the bone, A wave of sensual pleasure washes over me as I groan, Again an again
I fill myself, squirming in ecstacy, My prostate is tormented by the
splintered bones abrupt entry... This tortured anus is stretched by the
entry of the tibia, I grimace in an amalgam of pleasure and pain, My fetish
for osseus necro-perversion I lustily pursue, My erection engorged with blood
as my anus is strained... My crudely fashioned ossified dildo, An instrument
of supreme titilation, Bizarre necro-sodomy my only end, And I pursue it with
fervent dedication... I gnaw on chalky metatarsals, Grinding my anus on the
musty bones, Me penis lodged in the rib cage, In this grave, I climax alone...
