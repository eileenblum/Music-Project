Nothing can be with me
I'm racked with grief
Stained with blood
Marked by death
Embraced by my own cold darkness
My face is a mask of insanity
My soul is a lake of suffering
Wounded heart is bleeding
This burden is too hard for me

[Chorus:]
Ruined hopes, lost consolation
Beneath the remains of truth
I sense the waves of loath, streams of wrath

Sharp claws tear my flesh
Trying to crack my haggard mind
Storms bring me to silent emptiness
Where I could find my liberation
Of all that I am oppressed
The sullen land where i exist
Abandoned and forlorn forever

[Chorus x3]
