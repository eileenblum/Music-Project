Look into their eyes
What can you see??
Dark desires or light intentions?
Touch their hearts
What do you feel??
Burning hatred or endless love?

[Pre-Chorus:]
Look into their minds
Can they show mercy
Or kill with no regrets?
Come in their souls
Are there any angels
Or only evil reigns?

[Chorus:]
Locked in chaos of daily being
Generation of obscenities
(And) [singing 'We have lost'] our faith, we have lost all our hopes

I considered myself
Not as others - better man
How foolish i was
I am as all rest
And has always been
Contradictory creature
Full of passion
Lust and anger

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Pity human race
We are condemned [x2]
To kill, to hate,
To suffer (and) to be buried in graves

[Chorus x2]
