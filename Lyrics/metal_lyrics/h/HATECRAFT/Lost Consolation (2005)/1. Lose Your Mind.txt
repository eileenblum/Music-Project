Concrete cradle rocks
Tucking us to comatose
Eggshells with dead embryos
Human being-knots

Womb conveyor on the go
Shitting out the populace
Breast-led cynicism and loath
Value of devalued peace

[Chorus:]
Try my bitter pain
Taste the suffering on mine
Dress the scars of bleeding skin
Loose your mind and break the line
Claim yourself a demigod
Fly above that mortal dirt
Dress the scars of bleeding skin
Loose your mind

Vomited into this world
Brainwashed from the start
We - creation's bogus crown
Baptized in our own blood

Like a tumor procreates
We infect the universe
Maggot souls of maggot race
Hatched in the planet's corpse

[Chorus x2]
