I've lost in curled chaos
Crucified with own sins
In this rein of desperation,
Kingdom of woe, grief and fear

[Chorus:]
New day won't bring new hope
Sullen land menaces with
New pain that burns our nerves
Devastated dwelling of deserted souls

This dirty and disgusting place in my essence
No path leads out from this hellish space
Tormented creatures cry for ages
Throes of despair heave our hearts

Breathing the gas that sear our lungs
Bleeding eyes, ears and noses
Screaming to pale senseless sky
That's falling acid tears on us

[Chorus x2]
