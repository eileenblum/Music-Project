This voice inside my head
Beckoning and sweet
Razor wards on a silver plate
Sowing cursed seeds

Like a puppet on a string spinning in a crazy jig
Whirlwind of dementia building up inside of me
I behold the dead face on the padded walls
Mouths torn with silent screams at the madness grows

Disassembled and suppressed
Left in an empty shell
I see them, hear them, fear them, kill them!
Hatred burns through my skin
Leaving acid bitten sores
I'm bleeding, screaming, crying, dying!!!

Daymares wrapping me in blanket of my fears
Scared of my own shadow looming over me
Psychotic fantasy becomes so dangerously real
I'm in a world of pain and in a hell of bliss

Demon of mine, right through my eye
Sticking his forked tongue
Demon of mine, right through my eye
Sticking his forked tongue

He is cheering, he is sneering, he is jeering
Laughing his tail off!
He is cheering, he is sneering, he is jeering
Laughing his tail off!

Demon of mine, Demon of mine
I'm under his control
Demon of mine, Demon of mine
I'm under his control

I can feel him, I can hear him, I can't kill him
Fear holds down my chest
I can feel him, I can hear him, I can't kill him
Fear holds down my chest...
