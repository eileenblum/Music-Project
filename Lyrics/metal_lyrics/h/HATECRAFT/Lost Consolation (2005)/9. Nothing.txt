Am I among those who flee?
So damn meek creature
Resigned, quiet born weak
Thus safer hare than thou...
Long grey, pale day
Its decay's my prey
You can't go their way
Thus thou shalt suffer...

[Chorus:]
Billions of stars pouring light
On my face...
Taste of this life
You are not,
You are not aware of that!

You are nonentity
Life's a fistful of blood
A curse of your cruel god
Watching his faithful scum
They creep away
The infested clay
No matter what they obey
And thus shaft remain in numbers

[Chorus]

Billions of hearts pouring sighs
On my trace... Taste of this life...
Are you all,
Are you all aware of that?
