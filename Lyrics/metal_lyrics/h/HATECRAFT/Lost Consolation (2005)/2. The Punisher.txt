Loosing all control I have no mercy
No doubts, no remorse and no regrets
Bleeding rag of heart is strongly clenched
Rage possesses my body and my mind

[Spoken:]
No reliance in happy end
Future will be so dramatic
Armageddon will come very soon
Just as you see my face

Restless reek for something sacred
Endless sick of human race
Ruthless steel is in my hands
Archangel of revenge

[Chorus:]
I am the punisher that goes to chastise this world
World of Chaos, Greed and Sins
Greed and Sins

Mask of madness disguises my face
I'll set the earth in inferno flames
Nothing will survive, just turn in ashes
You are sentenced, say your prayer!

No reliance in happy end
Future will be so dramatic
Armageddon will come very soon
Just as you see my face

[Chorus]

[Spoken:]
[...]

[Chorus]

Greed and Sins
