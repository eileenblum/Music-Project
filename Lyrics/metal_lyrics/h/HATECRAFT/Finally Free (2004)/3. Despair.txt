Brand new day - brand new death
Everything is fading inside me
Something filthy holds my breath
A creep speed bomb is in my cells

Now I'm like a wounded beast
Exhausted by fight and run
Fit of weakness is unclenching my fists
Laying me down to the ground

[Chorus:]
Give way to despair
Like sink into the grave
And torture the soul
No way out!
Fatal stigma 's burnt
In the bottom of heart
I'm cursed with existence
No way out!
No way out!!!

There is no liquid just blood
There is no taste just sweat
There is no feeling just pain
There is no earth just mud

This endless torment is called life
What for should I live?
What for should I fight?
Where will end my twisted path?

[Chorus]
