Many people love destruction
And violence rules the world
It's a bad and mad construction
Everything is bought and sold

[Chorus (x2):]
Fate of mankind - perennial fight
Fear of life - cold of night
Born to be wild
Born to be might

Most people are like victims
Just trying to survive
Some predators are fighting for them
Wishing to take their lives

They are doomed to bite the dust
Their veins are full of pain
Happiness is running so fast
Sorrow's cruel like a bane

[Chorus x4]
