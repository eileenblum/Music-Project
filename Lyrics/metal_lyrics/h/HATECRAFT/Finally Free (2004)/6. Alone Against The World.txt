My life is like a burning dream,
But there's no awake with a scream.
I have the only hope -
Wish an "airdance" with the rope.

There's no color in my soul,
My universe has faded years ago,
My (season) [singing 'flesh(?)'] is the endless fall,
I'm alone against this world!

[Chorus:]
Darkness is inside my brain,
All that I can feel is pain,
Maybe I become insane,
Fire's running through my vein.
Never see the light again,
All of my attempts are vain,
'Cause my spirit's tied with chain.
Where is an exit out of me?

What will be my final step?
I can't forgive the sins of yours,
The outward things are sticky web
That suppresses fair force.

There's no future, no past,
My last seconds are running so fast.
What for I wait? The freedom so near
My mind is held with primal fear.

I'm an epicenter of silence
My soul's an epicenter of void
No hate, no love, no evil, no violence
Just emptiness &amp; nothing else:

I'll go away with deadly grin
You hear no groan from my mouth
I know I have no chance to win
But soul-spark will rush above.

[Chorus]

My life is like a burning dream,
But there's no awake with a scream.
I have the only hope -
Wish an "airdance" with the rope.

There's no color in my soul,
My universe has faded years ago,
My (season) [singing 'flesh(?)'] is the endless fall,
I'm alone against this world!

[Chorus]
