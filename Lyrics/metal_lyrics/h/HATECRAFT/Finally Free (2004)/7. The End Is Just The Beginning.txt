Have you ever been distressed by endless pain,
So tight embraced by obscure wings of night,
Situated between life and death
Heart is clenched by fear so tight

Shadows whisper calling my name
I jump into abyss of dark
Finding serenity from the flame
That sizzles me

[Chorus:]
Take my heart, sip my blood
Destroy my flesh, scatter my breath
My dream comes true
I'm passing through the heaven's gate
To real life after death

Such fits of depression are torturing me
I'm on the road from nowhere to nowhere
The travel of the damned forgotten outcast
From creature to eternal dust

Thousands of sins are burden my soul
No words can describe my state
I'm not a martyr just lost in time renegade
that fooled by fate

[Chorus]

The end is the beginning
I go away, so far away
The end is the beginning
I go away, so far away

Have you ever been distressed by endless pain,
So tight embraced by obscure wings of night,
Situated between life and death
Heart is clenched by fear so tight

Shadows whisper calling my name
I jump into abyss of dark
Finding serenity from the flame
That sizzles me

[Chorus]

The end is the beginning
I go away, so far away
The end is the beginning
I go away, so far away

The end is the beginning - I go away
The end is the beginning - So far away
The end is the beginning - I go away
The end is the beginning - So far away
