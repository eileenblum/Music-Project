Dropped, fucked and sunk, every shred of evidence covered up. Baptized and drowned, not a witness to be found. confessing at mass and they'll never fucking find me. They're so gullible, vacant gaze to hide my glee. Ingest fluids for illusions of peace. Spurting seed to paint their cheeks.

Faceless mocking aegis, faithless wretched scourge [2x]
Fuck

Slowed down. Slowed down.
Words too deep and the children drowned.
They drowned. They drowned.
Sunken sleep, they're never found.

Spewing soulless stagnate shit. Open wide and swallow it. Always so convinced, intentions all but missed. Dead set intentions a fork tongue between a jagged smile slip.

Twisted scriptures at your feet, ever warping stairway to the doorway of a priest. Opening to the balcony of lies from which you preach.

The false shepards flock, at the blackened altar gathering like sheep. (Like sheep) Braced and waiting on their mindless knees.

Swept away with time, dissolving, eating at the bones like lime. Buried with decades of hushed tongues. what the flies couldn't finish the worms found as home.

Faceless mocking, aegis, faithless wretched scourge. [2x]

Guarded by the hollow words, disguising foulest needs.
Reeking on your breath every time that you speak.
Vacant vernacular, empty like a dry heave

Gagging on your verse
The first time always hurts
[2x]

Slowed down. Slowed down.
Words too deep and the children drowned.
They drowned. They drowned.
Sunken sleep, they're never found.
