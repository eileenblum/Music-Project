You'll be nothing.
Bow down to your own imbecility. No man above you, but this self proclaimed divinity
caution to the wind, turn the other cheek. Iris turning blind to the scars above your knees. Head over heels, lungs under siege. A hand of matrimony sank his love to the deep.

A heart beats black and blue. Choking on the lies , gagging on the truth. [2x]

Dying to know whats left to be felt, a ring to name a promise for every fucking welt. Submission of will. Submersion of hope. A thousand friendly hands begging you to stay afloat.

Submission of will, submersion of hope
A thousand friendly hands begging you to stay afloat.

So I'm pathetic? So I'm wrong? Does the crutch of ignorance keep your will strong?

Your heart beats black as blue, choking on lies. Gagging on the truth.
Submission of will, submersion of hope
A thousand friendly hands begging you to stay afloat.

A heart beating black and blue. How can you fucking sleep when every night you're gagging on the truth.
So pathetic. So wrong
Does the crutch of ignorance keep your will strong.

Timelessly, thoughtless expectant, living in a laughable hypocrisy. Another night grudge fucking fantasy. Drowning in a false sense of sanity
