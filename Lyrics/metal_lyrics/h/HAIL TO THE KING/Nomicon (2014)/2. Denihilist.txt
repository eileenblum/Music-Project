My gaze. the world of reflection blending into haze. Hours turn to minutes and seconds melt into days. Time is but a concept such a meaningless maze.

The only thing that exists is nothing but this pain. [2x]

Body a temple, in his image is made
Penetrated will, nothing but a slave

The devils inside.
The devils inside

Sensory induced, gate to hell.
Overdosed on thought, chemical brain swell.
A copper auroma already on my mind.
inside out, tasting on the inside. [2x]

Death and life reduced to a blurred line
The spaces in between the grave where you reside
Notions of torture eternity plagiurized
Kicking and screaming begging to die

twisted, compacted your will is mine. illusions of this pain, synapses react and align. Unaware, but conscious, wretched patterns rise. The only way to keep the body is safe is to fester in the mind.

Lest not a being, but a vessel, a ship of bone cartilage and rotting muscle.

I am the nihilist.
[2x]
