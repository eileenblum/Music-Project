The night is calling,
the moon illuminating the most favoredhunting ground
Submerged by intoxication, every scream isdrowned
Wadding through these chemical dependents, You catch myeye
So fucking perfect, you're neck is mine!
The smell of yourfresh life teasing this carnivorous palate.
A creature of thenight stirring with unrefined excitement.
A nocturnal feast, suchtemptation awakens the beast
Such temptation awakens thebeast.
Consumption of virgin flesh, has always been my favoritekind of mess
The night is calling. Calling
The blood coursingthrough your veins, my prize inside your chest.
Mortality such adying trend, through this wound you are blessed.
Charmed by mywords, in the wind escapes all worry and care.
The bite littlemore than a kiss, I'm playing the part stroking your hair.
Anocturnal feast, Such temptation awakens the beast
The night iscalling
The blood coursing through your veins, my prize insideyour chest.
Mortality such a dying trend, through this wound youare blessed.
A nocturnal feast, such temptation awakens the beastx [2x]
