I am the only one, I make my destiny. I chose the path I walk andno one's chains can fucking stop me.
Fear is but a reflex
Courageis a choice
Never will it change the man I've become.
Now isthe time to satisfy, the crave to be more than you'll ever be.
Nowis the time to testify, let the world bleed blasphemy.
Fleeingfrom what's expected.
Time forever racing towards you
nevergive up you'll never fail.
Stand your fucking ground, yeah
Standyour fucking ground.
I just want you out of my head
Wordspounding, speaker of the dead.
Too much to swallow, choke on yourfeeble words
my will excised, I'll break your fuckingneck.
Something so comical.
Something so preposterous
Devotionalmost like it's animalistic
Undying, desire,
To controldependence of wretched heartbeat.
Fleeing from what'sexpected.
Time forever racing towards you
never give up you'llnever fail.
Stand your fucking ground, yeah
And whores don'tget, second chances. [2x]
I am the only one, I make my destiny. Ichose the path I walk and no one's chains can fucking stop me.
