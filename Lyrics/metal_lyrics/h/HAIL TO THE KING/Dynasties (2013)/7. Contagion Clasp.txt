What kind of hell is this? [2x]
Lips locked as tight as myfingers to this porcelain.
Love made in pure disgust
There's noescaping my own mind
Circulation a thing of distant memory
Tomy feeble failing extremities
My gaze grudge fucking refractedimage
Thoughts evading my very existence
The only thingreturning glances, the pile of shit I called a man
What kind ofhell is this?
God sharing kin, with the monster's under mybed
This instance, the only monster's reside in my head
Askeleton, making residence in a closet
Refusing to rot away, stillit kicks and screams [2x]
Motherfucker, you don't want to see whatI've seen
Repeating, incoherent, mindless echoes.
I've felldown my own endless rabbit hole
What kind of hell is this, is itall in my head or does it really exist?
What kind of hell is this [2x]
What kind of hell is this, is it all in my head or does itreally exist?
Refusing to rot away, still it kicks and screams [2x]
Motherfucker, you don't wanna see what I've seen
