This is regret?
This is judgment?
When the whole world knowshis fucking name
Escaping lesson, lethal injection
What have wetaught when the villain gets the fame
A coward to die when wehaven't even seen the victims face
A diet of bleeding heartsrelate, rather than mourn this day.
Fuck the statistic thatthey've made you.
To your hearts content, a mind of shit fullynumb.
A tragedy all the same
Yet the villain gets the fame
Aworld numb to sensation
We are the media nation
You've beenabsorbed into the fabric of the everyday life
Clock it in clock itout
Punch out.
Only to be left in a cheap pine box to figurewhat life's all about
You drive a fancy ass car to a fancy ass jobto pay for a house you can't
Afford the dream, it's a viciousscheme.
Time and money is this bullshit scene.
I bet with eachone of those âlikesâ the world just fucking mends
Supportingcause like it's the latest fashion trend
Commercial sympathy,endorse the latest killing spree
A tragedy all the same
Yet thevillain gets the fame
A world numb to sensation
We are themedia nation
This is regret?
This is judgment?
When thewhole world knows his fucking name.
Escaping lesson, lethalinjection.
What have we taught when the villain gets thefame.
Commercial sympathy, endorse the latest killing spree.
Atragedy all the same
yet the villain gets the fame.
A worldnumb to sensation.
We are the media nation
