Deceptive angel, horns bursting through the wings.
a sirenserenades sweet nothings
Mal intent hosts sincere eyes anddeceiving smile
Rest assured, Iâm no longer held in thisbeguile
BOUNCE
The waters broke for that fragile story you nowcarry
The lie youâve held dear bursting From your verywomb.
Born into nothing
Nausea induced sickeningbetrayal
Coincided with self respect derailed
Degrade yourself,spread the lies
poison everything weâve ever felt.
Impregnatinga wretched desire To be a man, and a father
This vile truthUttered from your throne of fallacy
A selfish bitch crowned inshit and heresy
Conduct yourself with pride?
instead inflatewith emptiness
A parasite living only to consume my vitalflesh
This vile truth uttered from your throne of fallacy
Iâvespilt my heart among your filthy collection
Recollected sacrificethat will never again be taken
For once, claim your lies,andstillborn halo
take your foul âI love youâ and âmiscarryâthat too
Miscarry that too [2x]
A vile truth uttered from yourthrone of fallacy
Go for the Throat
A selfish bitch crowned inshit and heresy
Go for the throat
A vile truth uttered fromyour throne of fallacy
Go for the throat
A selfish bitchcrowned in shit and heresy
Go for the fucking throat
