I'll tear you limb from limb
All hail the hypocrite
The kingof compensation, Show some fucking backbone
Fuck
Decent nowcast aside to negligence and pervasive truths
Cry baby bitch âCrybaby bitchâ
I'll bathe in your faithless blood
Why do youfear your instincts
With my finger the iris dilates
So clearthe stigma with vision erased
Clearly mocking your cowardicepast
Stand as if your spine still intact [2x]
Malice evoking avicious decree
Bitch
Thoughts and pious collected
Pompousclaims to this empty room
I shall parade your inanefiction
Harlequin exposed as the hypocrite looms
Coward standbefore me, so you can die on your feet [2x]
Fuck yourantamantium
The king of compensation show some backbone
Theking of compensation show some fucking backbone
