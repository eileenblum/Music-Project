I'll slice that shitting grin from your face
Caught between aknife and a hard place
Fashioned rope of double standard
Tochoke away all hopes and dreams
Has your crutch grown rusted andfeeble?
Do those wounds still refuse to heal?
Excuse, pardonmalevolence
Spread your legs like it's the only justice
Foronce kneel to what has made you
Your pride not the only thingswallowed
Daddy's little girl mutilated into father's whore
Oncemore you shall kneel to what has made you
This rape the crown of afuture
Perversion of parental ordinance
On your knees mouthagape with prayer
Prepped for worship, to ingest
Clothing tothe floor
Hanging yourself with your own fucking pride
Withyour own pride
You're not a fucking princess
Just the queen ofcarnal indulgence
Still you submit, to the will of the king
Hail,to your [3x]
Hail to your king
Bleck
Hail to king [2x]
Oh howI've waited for this moment no lyrics could do justice for thisloathing get on your fucking knees and hail to your king.
