I will prevail.
Leave the chains of a past life wrapped aroundthe neck of that bitch that I called a wife.
I'm the one whosestooped so low
Here's to our future, And another dick you'llblow.
(fuck you)
I've wasted all this life
Obeying laws, andwalking on the edge of a knife.
Now finally, I have control
Andyou're too busy screwing and sucking for a payroll
Need your fix?Over here just follow me
This product is of the highest ofquality
eat up that crystal commodity
Addiction, my favoritemonstrosity.
Who is it that you think you see
This âdangerâis not a threat to me
Death follows the path I lead.
At thedoor to hell, you shall believe.
I am the one who knocks. [3x]

Chemistry, binding the very spaces betweenexistence
playing god if only for an instant. The study andfabrication
You call this betrayal?
You call this deceit?
Onlyselfish between your legs?
Screaming till my lungs crack dry
Ina state of cancerous decay
Shambling, towards certainty
Is thisthe danger you fear of me?
You better fear what you fucking see.
Iam the one who knocks.
