Ave! I am the bringer of storms
Charge! Legions of the dead
Ave! I am the bringer of scorn
Charge! Order of the abyss

Avenge me now
With forces of a thousand dead
O mighty winds of death
Great masters of earth now rise

Adversary of darkness
Thus he was thus he peished
Thus he carries the torch in infamy

Ave! I am the bringer of storms
Charge! Legions of the dead
Ave! I am the bringer of scorn
Charge! Order of the abyss

Swarm to the flock
By hordes of vengeance you shall be slain
Amongst the shadows of death
Powerful prophets of doom now rise

Priests of eternal wrath
I demand to seek my revenge
Emerging from the abysmal consumption
Cleanse this earth scourge the world

Once again the blood shall spill
And forever more
Cleanse this earth, scourge the world
Once again birth of a new era

And forever more
Absolution shall be mine
Upon the eyes of fire
I shed my fears
Amidst the presence of thee

Hail! Hail! Hail!
I am the bringer of scorn
Hail! Hail! Hail!
retribution shall be mine

Upon the accursed shores
I have no fears
Consumed by the presence of thee
May I burn upon the pyre of Styx

Floating amongst the rivers of blood
I have no fears
I am the vestibule into extinction

Hail! Hail! Hail!
Hail! Hail! Hail!
I am the bringer of scorn
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!
