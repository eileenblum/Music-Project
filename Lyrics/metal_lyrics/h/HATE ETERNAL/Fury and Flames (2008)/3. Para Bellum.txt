May thy kingdom of the accused ones now rise
para Bellum! Para Bellum!
March upon the gates of death
For those who walk among us must follow

Ira Deorum

We shall ravage the earth and destroy the ominous skies
Bring forth the end of days
Where the darkness of time shall once again consume us all
Come forth the end of time

May thy kingdom of the accursed ones now rise
Para Bellum! Para Bellum!
March upon the gates of death
For those who walk among us must follow

May thy sovereign of the imperial ones now rise
Para Belllum! Para Bellum!
For we shall now conquer death
For those who walk among us are lords of war

We must darken and enlighten the world upon the mountainous shrine
Cometh forth the end of days
Hence the frenzy of brutality rules us all
Cometh forth the end of time

Madness shall become the demise of man
Yet we shall never vanquish
Nor shall we relinquish our command
Progenitors, speak thy cruel words!

Prepare for war!

The time is at hand for the slaughter
For we know not what we shall become
Sovast is my armies in numbers
So massive my legions of strength

The time is at hand for our vengeance
Hence versed in the purest art of fury
For our stand will be spoken in legend
For we serve no masters!
For we shall serve no masters!
For we serve no masters!
For we shall serve no masters!

May thy kingdom of the accursed ones now rise
Para Bellum! Para Bellum!
March upon the gates of death
For those who walk among us must fight

May thy sovereign of the imperial ones now rise
Para Bellum! Para Bellum!
For we shall now conquer death
For those who walk among us are lords of war
