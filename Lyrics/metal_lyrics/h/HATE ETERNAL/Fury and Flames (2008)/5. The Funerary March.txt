Salute! The funerary march of flames
In commemoration of the glorious dead
Salute! The funerary march of flames
May the funeral dirge commence

Honor him

Deify him
Do you know thy name, rejoice!

Value him
Protect him
Adorn him
Do you hear thy name, rejoice!

Salute! The funerary march of flames
In commemoration of the glorious dead
Salute! The funerary march of flames
May the funeral dirge commence

Exalt him!
Revere him!
Glorify him!
Do you know thy name, rejoice!

Enshrine him!
Preserve him!
Consecrate him!
Do you hear thy n ame rejoice!

I bid you well
I bid you well

In ode to the deceased
Give praise to the prestige of immortality
Hence salvation and a true transcendant path

In ode to the deceased
Give praise to the prestige of immortality
Hence the journey of peril into the afterlife

Release thee, so he may finally see
Through the haze of eternal darkness
Therefore unto him, grant him wisdom

In honor of the deceased
We chant the hymns in his own memory
For he shall vanish and be no more

In honor of the deceased
May you be laid to rest amongst gods and men
May you set the world aflame

Salute! The funerary march of flames
In commemoration of the glorious dead
