Pray for salvation, pray for absolution
Pray for salvation, pray for absolution

These are the days of great lamentation
So we may be again as one
We are cursed by this plague
We are cursed by this travesty
Yet we shall rise above the depravity of man
Thus salvation!

Pray for salvation, pray for absolution
Speak to thee and renounce thy master
We shall thrive in his glory
Embellish this glorified burden

Pray for salvation, pray for absolution
Consumed with this power so profound
I reside enveloped in loathing
Pariah!

You shall endure suffering of days past
You will tremble before thine eyes
Inevitable is our path of destiny

Thy will be done
Thy will be done

Reveal thyself, dare not to deceive me
See what I see through these eyes of flame
You must believe in thy ways
Divulge to me, confessor of all that is holly

Prepare thyself, for you know not what I am
See what I see through these eyes of flame
You must choose your path wisely
Inevitable your descent into black

Pray for salvation, pray for absolution
Pray for salvation, pray for absolution
