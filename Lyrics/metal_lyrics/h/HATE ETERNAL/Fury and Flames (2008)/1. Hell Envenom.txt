Hell Envenom

Hell Envenom, as I enter the portal of flames
I descend upon the lord of chaos
Onward I now transcend
Upon thou art my master
My time has come to perish
I summon thee, redeemer of pain and despair
Thy infernal ways
I call upon you all

Hell Envenom
Hell Envenom

As I bow down and revere the beast
The vast inferno now reveals thy path
Onward I now transcend
Cometh forth thy master
I fear not what lies before me
Forever black, the skies upon us are
Here no nether more
For behind him I shall follow

I covet and embrace
The flood of the eternal sea
Here nor nether more
For behind him I shall perish
Here nor nether more

Thus we cascade into the chasm
Thus we fall into the abyss
Thus we pass across the shadows
Thus we cometh before thy kingdom
I shall fall before you
And kneel before thy throne
I present my self amongst the departed
All mighty one, may the flame burn through the ages
May thy flame burn!

Hell Envenom, as I enter the portal of flames
I descend upon the lord of chaos
Onward now I transcend
Upon thou art thy master
