Proclamation of the damned
I beseech thee
May I leave thy mark of the beast

Shall my cries fall upon deaf ears
Whilst I graze upon the eternal sea
Must we atone for our sins in death
I have seen death

Therefore I share not in your fears
Yet must we confront our judgement
Thus the eternal damnation of thee
I have no fears

Proclamation of the damned
I beckon thee
May I flourish in darkness

Proclamation of the damned
I beseech thee
May I leave thy mark of the beast

Am I destined to ashes bound to dust
Whilst I pass through the corridor of death
Shall I disburden the ones left behind
I now know death

Brazen in my calling, my descent
Banished for all of eternity
Thus the eternal damnation of thee
I know no fears

I will deify the gods
Arisen from the depths unknown
Upon my descent into bliss

I must now shed my kin
Escape from this moral shell
Into the passage way of death

I summon thee, pray for the winds
I beckon thee, pray for the storms
I call upon thee
I am the heretic of the ages

I summon thee
I am the heretic of the ages
I summon thee, pray for the winds
I beckon thee, pray for the storms

I call upon thee
I am the second coming for the ages
May I flourish in the darkness

Proclamation of the damned
I beseech thee
May I leave thy mark of the beast
