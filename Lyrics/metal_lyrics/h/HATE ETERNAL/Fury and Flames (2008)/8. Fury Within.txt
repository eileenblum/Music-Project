I curse you all!

I, in the kingdom of wrath
Upon the ashes of cities burned
I shall make the world the bloodiest of ages

Your days are numbered
Your world is finished
Your life is over, extinct
To fight is futile!

I curse you all!

Fury within
I deplore you all
Fury within

I, upon the day of wrath
Amidst the smoke and flames of ruin
I shall make you burn upon the stakes

Usesless your attempt to overthrow me
Spineless, you cower with lack of loyalty
I shall not grant you resolve for your wrongs

Plead for mercy, you shall be denied
You beg for empathy, so pathetic your deceit, your lies
I thrive in your weakness, confessor of heresy
Never again shall I believe in your lies!

Hate! Hate!
Hate! Hate!
Hate! Hate!
Hate! Hate!

Hate! Hate! I demand my vengeance
Hate! Hate! I shall never retreat
Hate! Hate! Suffer through unsurmountable pain
Hate! Hate! You coward, you Judas

I denounce your ideology
I will overrule your ways
As I thrust myself upon thee

You shall suffer the fate of dis
Dissolve in the ashes of earth
You must face the day of reckoning!

I curse you all!
Fury Within!
I deplore you all!
Fury Within!
