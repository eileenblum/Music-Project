It is our will!
It is our will!
To conquer formidable foes, we will not concede, we shall not concede,

To call upon all of our strengths,
You will not halt us, you will not halt us,
It is our destiny, it is ever so powerful,
This mass that haunts us, We shall overcome all,
Rise above we shall, rise above we shall,
Rise above on our road of descent,
It is our will!

To embrace the whole of our power, we will not concede,
We shall not concede,
To overcome hordes of the blind, you will not halt us,
You will not halt us,
To thrust ourselves in destiny, we will not concede,
To avenge the fallen spirits, you will not halt us,
You will not halt us,

We are the rulers of the unknown rulers,
We are the rulers of the unknown world,

It is our will it is!
It is our will it is!
It is our will it is!

Come forth and suffer your consequences,
The inevitability, of your life and death
Menace to whom we consider frail, hierarchy of this planet,

It is our will it is!
It is our will!
