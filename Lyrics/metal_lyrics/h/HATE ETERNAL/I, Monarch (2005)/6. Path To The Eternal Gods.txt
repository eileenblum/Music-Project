On this journey into death, I am beside myself in tremendous bliss,
For this allegiance has been made, Shall my sins be absolved,
Washed away by the blood of the sacred lambs, yet I am not amongst the flock.

The remnants of my life, now become my vast illusions,
Whilst exiled from your grace, with fortitude, with courage,
I face all my fears, on my path to the eternal gods

With my wrath, with my disdain,
I face all my fears, on my path to the eternal gods,
As I cross over into my final place,
I face all my fears, on my path to the eternal gods,

As I bear trials in my final resting place,
I face all my fears, on my path to the eternal gods
