In this being, in flesh, There can be no absolution,
Therefor I must shed my skin, in a world so fabled, so false.

I, Monarch
Master of what shall be,
I, Monarch,
I, Monarch,
Captor of what I seek,
I, Monarch,

In this shell, in flesh, There can be no solitude,
I will not live in this facade, In a world of contradiction.

I, Monarch
Master of what shall be,
I, Monarch
Captor of what I seek,
I, Monarch,
I, Monarch,
Victor of all battles,
I, Monarch,
I, Monarch,
Sovereign of this domain,
I, Monarch,
To those who oppose me, death! Thou shalt die!
I, Monarch!
