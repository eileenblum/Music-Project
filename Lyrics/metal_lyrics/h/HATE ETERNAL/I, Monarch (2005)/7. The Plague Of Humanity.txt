How is it that you find, such discontent for our people,
Such disrespect of our kind, You are the plague of humanity!
You are the plague of humanity!

Why is it that you deny the realization of truth while creating an actualization of lies?
Your intolerance for loyalty, in acceptance of the indignity,
The irony of the civilized world, You are the plague of humanity!

It was not always so, this insolence so insipid,
For where there is truth, there are only lies,
Is there in truth no pride, or dignity of the highest nature?
For where there is fact, deception only lies,
I will say it once, I will say it again,
Our nemesis is humanity, you are the plague of humanity!
You are the plague of humanity!

I see only weakness in you, the epitome of deceit,
You truly are the enemy of our existence!
