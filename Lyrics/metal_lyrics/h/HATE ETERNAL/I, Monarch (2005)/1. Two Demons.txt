I am duality, a being so consumed with the darkness inside of me,
Through this pain I must endure, These beings that still haunt me

I am adversity, within the sunder of the essence of my very soul
In this rage I shall remain, these creatures that become me

Come forth and purge yourself for what you are,
Reveal thyself and become what you will

I am diversity, so weary of the angst,
So weary of what I have become
Through this dread I will retain, this penance that still haunts me

I am complexity,
Within these walls that hold me, my past and my present collide
In this state I must sustain,
This morphing that becomes me

Come forth and purge yourself from whom you are
Reveal thyself and become whom you will

Writhing in my pain of a thousands years,
I fear not my rival, I fear not my maker

I shall ravage the world in vein,
Writing in my pain of a thousand years
I fear not my rival, I fear not my maker
I shall scourge the world in vein
