Mask incarnate, is it the face of a lost soul
Burial act what has existed for the ages
Effigy of the deceased, enamelled with respect
Momento of the dead, tradition of the funerary rites

Deathveil protector of all spirits
The guardian of all souls
Deathveil enrichen spirits with strength
Thy will that must be done

Masquerade, centuries of infernal pain
Ceremonial interment of the dead
Cloaks amongst men, may the long gowns flow
Disguise of the once forgotten, now only to be remembered

Deathveil protector of all spirits
The guardian of all souls
Deathveil enrichen spirits with strength
Thy will that must be done

Deathveil protector of all spirits
The guardian of all souls
Deathveil enrichen spirits with strength
Thy will that must be done

A reflection of a life they once knew
A cast bound for immortality
Did he meet his demise in exile
Abandoned with no sense of hope

[Solo]

Decades of a life they once knew
True portrait of the genius that is man
Deathveil protector of all spirits
The guardian of all souls
Deathveil enrichen spirits with strength
The face of all things to come
