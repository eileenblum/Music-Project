Hatesworn, Hatesworn, Hatesworn, Hatesworn
Hatesworn, Hatesworn, Hatesworn, Hate!

I have journeyed through anguish and pain
Tragedies etched upon my soul
Upon my voyage I've endured adversity
Boils the blood that runneth through my veins

May the blood flow free
Like rivers amidst the great storms
Awaken the calm of still waters
With malice and spite, I am reborn

Of loathsome calling, I now am hatesworn
My disdain, it now engulfs me, I now have become hatesworn

Hatesworn, Hatesworn, Hatesworn, Hatesworn
Hatesworn, Hatesworn, Hatesworn, Hate!

I have travelled through angst and despair
Within the realm of lands condemned
May I embrace sights forseen unknown
Whilst tormented by the wraths of dis

May the blood flow free
Like rivers amidst great storms
Awaken the calm of still waters
With malice and spite I am reborn

Of loathsome calling, I now am hatesworn
My disdain, it now engulfs me, I now have become hatesworn

[Solo]

I shall seek my retribution
Sanctified by the blood of black
By the blood of the heretical son
You shall weep upon your untimely deaths
