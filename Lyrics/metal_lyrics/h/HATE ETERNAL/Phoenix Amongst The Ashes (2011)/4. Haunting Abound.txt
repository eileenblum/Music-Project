Haunting abound

Messenger of the word
With vengeance shall you striketh down
Bring forth the world to your knees
Tempter of all that is sacred
Curse and shake the ground upon you
Return from exile, reclaim what once was yours

Haunting abound - From the everlasting flame
Haunting abound - For I shall be known

Ravager of the abyss
Legend of unequalled power
Cast out tribulations amongst mankind
O' engulfing flame
Betrayer of all that is pure
Make all bathe in the blood of atonement

All shall worship him
All shall honour him
All shall praise him
The personification of evil
All shall worship him
All shall honour him
All shall praise him
The beast now has arisen

Emerging out of shadows and the mire
The ghost of the past now awakens
Sound the trumpets of death, signifying rebirth
Unveil the prophetic curse

[Solo]

Haunting abound
Adversary to all that appose
The fallen now has risen
Haunting abound

Haunting abound
You shall attempt to strike me down
Yet I shall bring the arrival of the end
Haunting abound

Haunting abound
Your ominous presence so profound
For the shadow of death shall rise
Haunting abound
