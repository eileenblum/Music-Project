Rise! Open up the skies
Striketh down upon a thousand suns

Rise! By the hand of our maker
Riseth from the ashes of our sins

Fire spirit, once reduced to ashes
Now reborn anew to thrive again
Immortalised, a resurrected spirit
Reveal thyself at the apex of destiny

Benevolent, fierce in its wake
Once consumed in flames, only now to rise again
Extravagant, imperial shape
Essence of divine power
O' mighty scavenger of woe
Brilliant and majestic
With illuminated shine

Mythical one, the dream that never dies
Manifestation of whom now are gone
Legendary, thy bird of prey
Symbolic one, akin to the sun god

Benevolent, fierce in its wake
Once consumed in flames, only now to rise again
Extravagant, imperial shape
Essence of divine power
O' mighty scavenger of woe
Brilliant and majestic
With illuminated shine

[Solo]

Rise! Rise! Rise!
Phoenix amongst the ashes
Rise! Rise! Rise!

Rise! Rise! Rise!
Phoenix amongst the ashes
Rise! Rise! Rise!
