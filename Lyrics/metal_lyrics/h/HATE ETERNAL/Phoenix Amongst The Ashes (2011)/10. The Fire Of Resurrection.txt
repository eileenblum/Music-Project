May thy flame burn strong
May thy flame scorch the skies

I am the winds that blow
Earth shattering waves that ever flow
I am the sun that sets
Upon the vast horizon

May the skies open upon your command
Transfixed, I say unto you
May thy sparrows carry you away
Into the eclipse
Into the eclipse

I am the moon that ever so shines
In death comes rebirth, now granted in time
I am now floating amongst dream woven clouds
Upon the path of the righteous shrouds

Glory be to your memory
May you fear no longer
All shall bow down in awe
Honor bestowed upon your legacy

The fire of resurrection
Void of burden, no regrets
The fire of resurrection

[Solo]

May you decend upon eternal winds
May the birds speak thy name
