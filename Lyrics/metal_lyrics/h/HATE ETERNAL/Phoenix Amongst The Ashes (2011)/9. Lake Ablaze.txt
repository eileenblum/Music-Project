Almighty winds
Carry us away
Away into the new dawn
Into oblivion

Almighty winds
Sweep us away
Away into a new era
Into oblivion

Lake ablaze, the lake of burning fire
Cast alive into dusk
Deceived by the lie of eternal life
Hence burneth in the lake of flames

Almighty winds
Carry us away
Away into the new dawn
Into oblivion

Almighty winds
Sweep us away
Away into a new era
Into oblivion

Lake ablaze, arose the flames from the furnace
Burning desire of sin
Shall no man cometh before thy throne
Hence burneth in the lake ablaze

Lake ablaze, o' great sea of fire
That dwelleth beneath the Earth
Shall burning embers rise amidst the flames
Rise upon the great clouds of smoke

[Solo]

Cast out asunder into the dark waters
Upon the sect of false prophets
Perished, unto the sea of fire
Transgressions of whom amongst the flesh

Hear my prayers
King of the majestic crown
Grant them eternal rest
Cometh forth
In the name of the dark lord
As the abyss shall swallow them whole

From the sea shall riseth
The titan of all so bold
At the behest of the heavens
In the face of the creator of all
Shall you tremble with fear
While the skies fall upon us
Are you striken with fear
While you burn in complete unrest

Burn!
Burn!
Burn!
Burn!
