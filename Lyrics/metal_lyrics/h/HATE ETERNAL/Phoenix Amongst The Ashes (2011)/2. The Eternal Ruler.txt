Born out of exile
Must I save thee from abolishment
Hence utter chaos must ensue

Nominated Czar
Must I revive what hath dormant lies
Hence your empire now shall fall

[Chorus]
Now among us, he is
Now one of us, he is
The bane of our existence

The eternal ruler
From the dust shall rise
Rise up and destroy (eradicate) us all

Manifestation
O'Mighty wicked serpent of the deep
The betrayer of all
Are we the flock of sheep led to extinction
Or a swarm of locusts who shall prevail

Archetype of foul
Cataclysmic beast of the abyss
Unto thee now shall all you fall

Is it the beacon of hope as deemed to some
Or the coming of apocalyptic scorn

[Chorus x2]

[Solo]

May the stars drop from the heavens
The sun shall transform to black
I shall make the moon cry blood
Usher in the new age of man

[Solo]

[Chorus]

Born out of exile
Must I save thee from abolishment
Hence utter chaos must ensue

Nominated Czar
Must I revive what hath dormant lies
Hence your empire now shall fall

The eternal ruler
