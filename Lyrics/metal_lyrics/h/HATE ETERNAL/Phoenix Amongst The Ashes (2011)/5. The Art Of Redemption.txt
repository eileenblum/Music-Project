Conquer thy rebellion, destroy thy pristine

Bold, I must revel in the obliteration of the monotheist, so called mighty lord
Crush all man, burn down the temple of hope
Persecution of all your saint's ideals

Behold, the end of days awaits
Whilst redemption now is at hand

The art of redemption
The final battle is at hand
Avenge me legions and hordes of abandon
Triumphant in our stand

Confront me tyrant, absolve me messiah
Defy, I shall defy all those whom choose the path of lies
Lies, you cannot hide from nor deny
I cast thee out, out amongst slaves
Slaves amongst thieves, thieves amongst the fray
Amongst the fray may vengeance destroy you all
For victory now is within our grasp

The art of redemption
The final battle is at hand
Avenge me legions and hordes abandon
Triumphant in our stand

The art of redemption
With vengeance we shall command
In discipline we revolt against the tyranny
Defiant in our stand

Path of fury, wrath of many
Insipid and insolent in our ways
Destroy all with pure ferocity
Vindication through annihilation

[Solo]

Redemption, retaliate
Redemption, obliterate
Redemption, annihilate
Redemption, we rule this world
