Carved out of human flesh
It shall be written with our tainted blood
The gospel of elite reform

Onward to the realm of immortality
The passage from this mortal coil
In death salvation exists

Thorns of Acacia
The threshold that unites the plane of life and death
Merging the paths of the dark and the light

Thorns of Acacia
From the lions mouth shall they depart
Or shall they be enshrined in darkness
Thorns of Acacia

Shall I be forsaken upon the day of judgement
Therefore guard the sacred yew
For death is the path to wonder

Shall I burn in the everlasting fire
Now desolate in black
Growing fears of the end of mankind

Unimaginable horror
Unspeakable suffering
Or just the quiet after the storm

Unparalleled evil
Unification of purity
Or canonised at the end of days

Thorns of Acacia
The threshold that unites the plane of life and death
Merging the paths of the dark and the light

Thorns of Acacia
From the lions mouth shall they depart
Or shall they be enshrined in darkness
Thorns of Acacia

The beast of four heads and ten horns awaits
Is this the insurrection of virtue and man

[Solo]

Carved out of human flesh
It shall be written with our tainted blood
The gospel of elite reform

Onward to the realm of immortality
The passage from this mortal coil
In death salvation exists

Unimaginable horror
Unspeakable suffering
Or just the quiet after the storm

Unparalleled evil
Unification of purity
Or canonised at the end of days

Thorns of Acacia
