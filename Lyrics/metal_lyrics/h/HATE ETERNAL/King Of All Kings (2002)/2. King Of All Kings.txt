As I am I reclaim the throne of all creation
As I shall be annointed king
For thy strength I must sustain
For thy dominion I shall proclaim

I my communion, I reign supreme
I am the king of all kings
I my dominion, my own affliction
I am the king of all kings

Bring forth your master
Kneel before thy king
Reflect upon your sinful acts
Repent, repent to me
Endure, through countless years of pain
Rejoice through the blood of your martyrs

I my communion, I reign supreme
I am the king of all kings
I my dominion, my own affliction
I am the king of all kings

King of all kings
King of all kings

I abomination, evil supreme
I am the king of all kings
I am religion, I am dominion
I am the king of all kings!
