We are the obscure terror

We are your enemies, sworn to secrecy
Mentors of all that is profane
We are betrayers, devoid of your worth
We thrive in all that is stained
We poison all that is pure
We endanger all that be

Strength through adversity
Death with nobility
Instruments of insurgency
We are the obscure terror

Why hinder thou from escaping obscurity
Thus dominating your race
You will not stop us, you can not stop us
For we shall never falter
We are extraordinary in our design
We flourish in your pain
In your blindness, your very blindness
We attack with ferocity

Strength through adversity
Death with nobility
Instruments of insurgency
We are the obscure terror

In your god whom you cherish
We defy his very existence
It is time to relinquish your throne
You must perish!
