O, gods of fire, volcanic lava
O, gods of flame, of this molten mass, ave!

O, gods of fire, bringer of darkness
O, gods of flame, harbringer of hate
O, gods of fury, we are of the coven
O, gods of rage, lords of the serpent
We pray for your emergency

Chants in declaration
For the gods of demise
Chants in declaration

Awaken beasts of the deep
Through the rites of passage
I invoke thee to appear
I summon forth your power

Chants in declaration
For the gods of demise
Chants in declaration
For the almighty gods of demise

Arise, o things of the abyss
Through the rites of passage
I implore thee to appear
I summon worth your knowledge

O, gods of fire, volcanic lava
O, gods of flame, of this molten mass, ave!
