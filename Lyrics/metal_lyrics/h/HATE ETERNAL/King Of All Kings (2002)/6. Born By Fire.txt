Born by fire now force thy ways
I am the entity
I hold the chalice
The praise of demi-gods my oath to thee
Behold majestic strengths
Amongst the chosen ones
To desecrate, dominate
All enemies that dare to rise

We are the coming of the scorned messiah
Apocalyptic seeds
The loathing of your arrogance ordained
In absence of the souls in withered lies
Defeating all that stand
Conceration of the frails demise

Impending visions of prophecies
Await the dormancy
To seek our path
The path of righteousness, eternal bliss
Possess the rites of time
To thee of virgin blood
Now desecrate, dominate
The ones that shall be left behind

Born by fire!

We are the coming of the scorned messiah
Apocalyptic seeds
The loathing of your arrogance ordained
In absence of the souls in withered lies
Defeating all that stand
Conceration of the frails demise
You'll submit to our immortal ways
To only realize that we command
The armies of the dark shall form in flame
Destroying forgery
You cannot fool the eyes of the gods

Born by fire!
