Is it a theory of pure scepticism
Belief of the end of a civilization
The never ending mystery of their demise
Millions of lives that cease to exist

Powers that be
Claimed the lives of a ruling dynasty
Powers that be
Anciest apocalypse of this dunasty

Collapse of a culture
They could not resist
The unrelenting questions of
Their evolution
Carving of chaos and rulers so bold
Forged in stone and so it was written

Powers that be
Claimed the lives of a ruling dynasty
Powers that be
Anciest apocalypse of this dunasty
Powers that be
Freezing winds that caused this travesty
Powers that be
The confusing riddle of the end of this
Dynasty

They lived for their temple
They lived for their palace
They lived for their deities
They mastered mathematics
They mastered astology
In manuscripts of hieroglyphics
So it was told!

Powers that be
Claimed the lives of a ruling dynasty
Powers that be
The confusing riddle of
The end of this dynasty
