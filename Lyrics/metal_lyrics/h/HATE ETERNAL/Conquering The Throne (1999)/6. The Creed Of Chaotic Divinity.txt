[Music &amp; lyrics: Rutan]

Awakened
By this ancient creed
Evoked
The ancestry of thee
Forsaken
For centuries of times
Exiled
All their kind
Foretold
The inheriting of the earth
Forewarned
Of this predestined rebirth
Engaged
The rising from below
Fear all mortals for what they shall
Bestow

The creed of chaotic divinity
Command thee
To wreak havoc upon the earth
The creed of chaotic divinity
The creed of chaotic divinity
Rise and defeat
The flock of this feeble kind
The creed of chaotic divinity

Conjure all
So they may sustain
Their race
Of what they must retain
Spew forth
Incantations in vain
Invocate
All that they try to negate
Enchant all of their wonderful splendour
Recant
All of the texts that are sacred
Recreate
All that has been begotten
Revive
All that has been forgotten
