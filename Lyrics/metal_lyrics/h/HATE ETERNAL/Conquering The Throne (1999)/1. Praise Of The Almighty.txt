[Music &amp; lyrics: Rutan]

Praise this massive force of hate
Praise the strength of thee
Worship all they have become
I am one with thee

I await the powerful entities
To enact my destiny
I anticipate to obliviate
I must summon thee

Praise the almighty ones
Praise the strength of thee
Worship all they have become
Become one with thee
Praise the old darkest ones
Thy mighty force of thee
Worship all they have become
Succumb all to thee!
Succumb all to thee!

In awe I gaze
At absolution
Staring through the haze
Of the blackened skies

[Solo - Erik]

Praise of the almighty
Praise of the almighty

In awe I gaze
At pure perfection
Wandering through the haze of
The blackened skies

[Solo - Doug]

Praise of the almighty
Praise of the almighty
