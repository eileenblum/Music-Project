[Music &amp; lyrics: Rutan]

Scriptures
Written for faith
By the power it exists
Pages
Formulated by faith
In these pages exists the

Dogma condemned
Dogma condemned

Encaptured
The souls of many
Mindless minions
Praising lies
Enraptured
The hearts of many
Stricken with pitiful lies
Engulfed in pathetic preaching
Taught by the blind
The weak, the foul
Trapped in so-called pure beliefs
In these pages exists the

Dogma condemned
Dogma condemned
Dogma condemned
Dogma condemned

Have you been forsaken
By your so-called deity
Exiled from the land of purity

[Solo - Erik]

Have you been forsaken
By your so-called deity
Exiled from the land of sanctity
I deify no one
I deify no one
