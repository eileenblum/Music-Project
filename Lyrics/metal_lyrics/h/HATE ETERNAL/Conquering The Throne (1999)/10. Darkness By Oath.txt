[Music &amp; lyrics: Rutan]

Welcome to my realm of hate
So pure
Revel in my disgust so obscure
Writhe in my rage
This relentless stage
Of my existence in this state

I swore by oath of darkness
Of legion
Of one
I swore by the truth

I swore my alliance to darkness
Of legion

Of many
I swore by my faith
By my strength I await the
Ever present overboding entities
Initiate my path of deceit
Initiate my reign of disdain

Bring forth decades of misery
Return thyself to the throne
Emancipate thee from binding
Restraint

Bring forth centuries of pain
Return thyself to the eternal
Reign
Emancipate thee from binding
Restraint
