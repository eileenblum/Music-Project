[Music &amp; lyrics: Rutan]

I proclaim thee
To hear my demands
I invoke thee
Grant my commands
Self indulgence
Self fulfillment
The very essence

By his own decree
He grants thy wisdom and thy strength
By his own decree
Denounce the self-righteous hypocrites
By his own decree
We defy your sanctimonious beliefs
By his own decree
We indulge ourselves in glorious freedom

I proclaim thee
Reveal thy master
I invoke thee
Reveal thy eternal flame
Bearer of fire
Bearer of truth
The very essence

[Solo - Erik]

He shall arise
And gratify thee
He shall devise
A scheme of enlightenment
He shall retain
His strength beside him
He shall sustain
His power of the earth
