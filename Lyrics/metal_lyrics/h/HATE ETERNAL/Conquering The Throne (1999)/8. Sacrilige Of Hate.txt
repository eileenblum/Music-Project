[Music &amp; lyrics: Rutan]

My rage
Intensifies
The weak
Purifies
The meek crucifies
My total hate

Struggling with conflict
Over my deep seeded hate
Striving with constant angst
Breed all of my pain
Bleed all of my pain

Fighting with anger
Overcoming all that is sane
Writhing to be ordained

Feeding on grief
Needing pain
Ever so deep
Reasoning through rational
Breed all of my pain
Bleed all of my pain

Seeking my vengeance
Feeding on pity and empathy
Searching for infamy
Blessed with blasphemy

I live off all of the meek
Your feebleness so weak
With greed I solidify your
Fate
I'll bleed you of your hate

[Solo - Erik]
