[Music &amp; lyrics: Rutan]

O ye of eternal fire
O ye of the endless rain
O lord, reveal thyself to me

O ye of eternal fire
Reveal thy sun to me
O, I beckon thee
Bring upon the dawn
Reveal thyself to me

Rise up from the ancient tombs
Grant us all your infinite wisdom
Endure
As you arise from the catacombs

Lord of Mictlan
Land of the dead
Deity of death and darkness
That which lies upon the graves

They the ancestors said, that it is
Through,
The sacred spirits, that all live!

He who makes the day
Recreate the sun
He who makes the night
Recreate the moon
He who makes the storms
Supplicate us with rain
He who makes the wind
Supplicate us with force

[Solo - Erik]

I cast myself unto flames
Reveal thy sun to me
In order that the dawn may break
