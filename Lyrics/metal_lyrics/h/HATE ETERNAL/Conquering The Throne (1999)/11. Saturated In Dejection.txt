[Music &amp; lyrics: Rutan]

A passion for my rage
With my sights of darkness
The atrocities at hand
I must bare
Entangled in a state
So cold
So dormant
My sickened rageful state
My hateful lair

Saturated in dejection
Saturated in dejection

Hardened by this reality
Sights of vengeance
Ever so clear
Compelled to rejuvenate
This world of hate
Into a mass of chaos and fear

Saturated in dejection
Saturated in dejection

The sickening things that I witness
I derive distinct visions from
The sickening thoughts
That they confess
Hatred at its purest form

I now become my saving grace
Viciously repelling my disgrace
My reasoning is out of control
Constituting reformed laws

So compelled to what I've witnessed
Mesmerizing so enticing
I revel in their grief
I confess
My vision is my religion

I now become my saving grace
Exiling all this human waste
I deny your emotions
You perjurers
Deny your falsifications
You perjurers
You perjurers
You perjurers
