[Music &amp; lyrics: Cerrito]

Wiped away, my dismay
Misery
Beckons me
I besiege
Hate I preach
I am the one who will conquer and master all

Penetrate
Violate
Desecrate
Terminate
Tear away
Disarray
Kneel before he who has killed
And will kill again

Mesmerize
Ostracize
I despise
Pulverize
Tragedy
Blasphemy
Crucify all those who refuse my monarchy

Scorn - enthrone thee
Let me reign in lunacy
Plague - befall all
Cleanse - baptize thee
Grant me strength through blasphemy
Plague - befall all

God - exalt me
Your world bathes in misery
It has begun
