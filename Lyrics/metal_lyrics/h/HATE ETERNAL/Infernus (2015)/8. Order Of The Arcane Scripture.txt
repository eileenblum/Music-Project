[Music: Rutan / Hrubovcak]
[Lyrics: Hrubovcak]

Like fathers bowed to me
(Looked) upon infernal majesty
Constructing empires on graves

(Your) being, depends on me
Concede to utter blasphemy
Thy will is weak, accursed progeny

Relinquish existence
Forefathers forsake you
Call out to them not
As they exalt my very shroud

By stealth enslavement of the will
Subordinate identity
Phantom profane at thy behest...

Antediluvian orders
To subjugate the proletariat
Upon my brow is written the fiat of death
Born only to serve our master,
The mighty destroyer

...Kneel

My craft is simple
Thou victims of the id
My reign is infinite profanity

Thy will is freedom
Thy heart is bondage
Indiscretions fall upon the children

Thy mothers bear homage
Thy fathers renounce thee
Phantom profane deliver them

Antediluvian orders
To subjugate the proletariat
Upon my brow is written the fiat of death
Born only to serve our master,
The mighty destroyer

I devalue
I dilute thee
Reproduction by relativism
Complacency is my weapon
(You're) prostrate before me

Hunger - Feed thy baseness, indulge
Thy will is mine
Sycophant - Herd thy family, entrapping
Thy heirs are mine

Deception intrinsic
Detection derision
Illusion defined

Aspiration discomfited
The earth is mine

Thou wilt fulfill
The orders of the arcane scripture
Begot by the beast,
Mankind's torment decreed
