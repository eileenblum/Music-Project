[Music &amp; lyrics: Rutan]

Lord of duality
Son of our supreme almighty lord
Cometh forth upon us mere mortals
Grace us with your power divine
Bless us with your power infernal
Abhor us with your disdain

Upon this netherworld of flame
The abode of death
It welcomes me with open arms
As it is so
Emerging from the darkest shadows
Lies truth beyond life
Eternal fire envisaged
As it must be... ave infernus

He who now must enter
Bow down before your maker
And to what end
Shall you prey
For we know not what is to come
Kneel down, gaze upon your master
Amidst the smoke of uprising host
For all that has befallen you
May your penance pave thy way

Shall I descend into darkness
Torn asunder til' death
What occupies me is everblack
For it hath overcome my soul
Afloat upon the seas of void
In bleak depths of tide
Washed ashore upon the Styx
Ave infernus

He who now must enter
Bow down before your maker
And to what end
Shall you pray
For we know not what is to come
Kneel down, gaze upon your master
Amidst the smoke of uprising host
For all that has befallen you
May your penance pave thy way

Time to say farewell to our father of mankind
Lamentation of a life once known
Time to say farewell
Time to say farewell
To all you hold sacred
Time to say farewell to our father of mankind
