[Music &amp; lyrics: Rutan]

Darkened regions of the sea
Engulfed in blackness of the ancient sky
I must travel through the realm
Of tenebrous depths
Amidst the darksome empire

Lost of all illuminated sight
Aloft amongst the waves of torrid fray
Wandering undaunted, thousands fathom deep
Amidst tumultuous clouds of flame

The stygian deep
Thus his curse has now fallen
As you ascend into glorified lands
Whilst I descend into ominous black
The stygian deep
Entrenched in overwhelming ire
Enameled by fury and destructive rage
Whilst I drown in absolute madness

Rise, infernal serpent of the sea
Embrace me as I fall into
The darkest of the dark
Transport me, hand in hand, on my path
Into my dreamlike state
Of my outer body being

Drowning waters of the 'mare
Blinded in the shadows of the dim abyss
I must venture through the somber
Caliginous depths amongst
The sullen empire

Lost within the arms of endless dark
Afloat upon the swell of heaving surge
Sweeping undulating drift
Amidst tumultuous waves of flame

The stygian deep
Thus his curse has now fallen
As you ascend into glorified lands
Whilst I descend into ominous black
The stygian deep
Entrenched in overwhelming ire
Enameled by fury and destructive rage
Whilst I drown in absolute madness

As I look into the distance from afar
With a broad view
I sweep the void of influx
Treading waters upon
My inevitable death
May I once again be at one
With my predestined death (fate...)

My last breath...
My final call...
My dying omen...
My endless pain...
