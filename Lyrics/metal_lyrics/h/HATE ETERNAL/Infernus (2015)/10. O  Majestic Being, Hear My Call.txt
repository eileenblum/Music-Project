[Music &amp; lyrics: Rutan]

O' how I beckon thee
To hear my calling
As I stretch forth to the inevitable void
Take me away from this darkness
Release me from my pain of this endless cycle

Aeons of suffering endured
As I fade into oblivion
Into the cavern of cold dark shadows
Slowly I submerge into the abyss
The abyss of bliss

O' dark lord cometh forth
For I know not your name
Yet I have no fear for thee
Purveyor of all that is wicked

O' majestic being, hear my call

O' how I summon thee
To hear my calling
On my journey into eternal damnation
Must I endure your wrath
Bound by the oath I swore
What hath now befallen me
I swear to burn the eternal flame

Yet my sorrow you shall feed upon
Though I shall be among the dead
Through martyrdom of flame
My affliction will cause no shame
Am I not the one who shall receiveth
The mark of the befallen

O' dark lord cometh forth
For I know not your name
Yet I have no fear for thee
Purveyor of all that is wicked

O' majestic being, hear my call

Listen to the sound of my chant
Spirits from the beyond
Listen to the sound of my chant
Those whom lurk in the shadows
Of the corners of bleak

As the dust settles
Grant me eternal life by your masterful design
May your ominous presence shake the earth
May your power define the end of my travels
