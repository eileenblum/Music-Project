[Music: Rutan / Hrubovcak]
[Lyrics: Rutan]

The dark cloud is now among us
Churning forth the black plague,
Engulfing all being
Such hope is now abandoned
The full force is now against us
For we are stricken down...
Stricken down by strength of skyward call
All aspirations are now deceased

La tempestad
Scouring the world of all filth and ill
The storms of cleansing
La tempestad
Slaughtering the earth
Like foul to eradication
The storms of purification

The destructive force has fallen on us
Showering us with flame
Fire is entrenched within our soil
All hope is now abandoned
Extend your hand of wrath out to the sky
As such the darkness spreads,
Darkness spreads across the land of being
Such aspirations are now deceased

La tempestad
Scouring the world of all filth and ill
The storms of cleansing
La tempestad
Slaughtering the earth
Like foul to eradication
The storms of purification

The scourge of the masses
The affliction of the world
La tempestad
Cleansing the planet of all false prophets
La tempestad

Annihilating storms of flame
Eradicate us from the earth of the wicked
Annihilating storms of flame
La tempestad de fuego y llamas

The plane of our existence now torn apart
Burned of recognition, scorched by fire
Fire of outer darkness
Lost amongst the everlasting smoke
Disintegration almost now complete
Destruction of all beings
Being of the anointed enlightened kind
Punishment ensues for the wicked

La tempestad
Cleansing the planet of all false prophets
La tempestad
