[Music: Hrubovcak / Rutan]
[Lyrics: Hrubovcak]

Inconsequential
A sea of foul invertebrates
I beseech the providence
To infuse the essence of the beast

Create my army
From withered vine and spineless mollusk
Rise up deliver!
Bring forth the evil pervading

I visualize thy core
Beast creates reality
With each slothful act
A string is bored into thy skin

Why would thou innovate
When all is naught
The end complete
Call to me
For deliverance

Now behold thee,
Resurgence of the mendicants
Accursed worms of the earth befall thy fate
Subtle, insidious,
Slaves by sloth and bled by writ
Infecting the populace
By chains of resentment

Now behold thee, prophetic visions awaken
Army through infiltration
No intervention by the beast
The blood split in triumph
Turned to ashes of devastation
No sorrow lost as the beast again arises

Call upon thy savior
I will take responsibly
Thy burdens laid upon me
Just trade resolve for apathy

Join the infantry of servants
Beholden to archaic intention

Modus operandi
With perverse aspirations
I peddle my poison
Under shroud of apocalyptic knowledge
Leviathan of arrogance,
Bear strings into the peasant skin

Now behold thee
Resurgences of the mendicants
Accursed worms of the earth befall thy fate
Subtle, insidious,
Slaves by sloth and bled by writ
Infecting the populace
By chains of resentment

Now behold thee, prophetic visions awaken
Army through infiltration,
No intervention by the beast
The blood spilt in triumph
Turned to ashes of devastation
No sorrow lost as the beast again arises

Why would thou - Sacrifice thy kingdom?
No gain can cometh
When offer spirit to the winds
Relinquish empires for momentary nothings
Swallow thyself into the depths of my snares

Worthless servant, specter of the crown
Crown of thorns, the one whom shall destroy
Slave of worthless pursuits
Aloft upon the throne of lies

Born, again
Born again from foulness defined
Deliverance from the empire
You once left behind

O woe to generations come
Behold thyselves as victims

Sloth, the deadliest of sins
As the ancients decreed, shall be
Consecration of external masters
Shell remains, as beast anointed
