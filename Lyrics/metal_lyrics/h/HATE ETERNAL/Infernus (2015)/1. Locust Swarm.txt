[Music: Rutan / Hrubovcak]
[Lyrics: Rutan]

We are a million strong
Agglomeration of the
Impending darkened plague
Congregate, conglomerate, destroy

The assemblage, subversive from within
Insidious in their nature
All-consuming everlasting void

Locust swarm
Descending upon the masses
Plagues afflicting
With dire consequences
Locust swarm

Locust swarm
Devouring all the living
Stricken by the pestilence
Of a hundred thousand years
Locust swarm

We are vast in numbers
Accumulation of
The engulfing blackened plague
Concentrate, dissipate, destroy

Convocation, invoked by the masters
Heinous in their nature
Enslaved humanity to endless toil

Locust swarm
Descending upon the masses
Plagues afflicting
With dire consequences
Locust swarm

Locust swarm
Devouring all the living
Stricken by the pestilence
Of a hundred thousand years
Locust swarm

Locust swarm
Locust swarm
Stricken by the pestilence
Of a hundred thousand years

Clouds of tribulation
It spreads across the land
Wrath of the ancients

Skies of condemnation
Haze of all illumination
Blotting out the face of the sun

Why have you forsaken us?
Why must all now come to an end?
Cursed I beseech thee
May thy abolishment
Come to an abrupt end!
