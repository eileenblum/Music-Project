Operation clean-sweep from dawn 'till death
Obliterating everything
No life is spared from last no chance to get away
Nothing is left but charred remains
Endless sight of plain destruction
Inhuman mass slaughter draining you of life

Pain and suffering are as one
As you slowly descend for dead
Reign of terror has begun
Infernal darkness and pestilence

Let the dead bury the dead
Sickness on this eve of doomsday
In this, hellhole of raging fire spreading death
Suffering to survive lying in a human tomb
Not to get shot by a sniper killing the remains of life

Into the ashes of neverending death under blood red skies
Blind lead the blind through bestial evil exterminated fast
Deadzone in the land of the living ground becomes eternally sour
Revenge hear the cries of creatures who are yet to come
