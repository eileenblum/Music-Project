Chapter one deals with the pain of pleasure
A circle committing themselves to pain
Gathered in a distance place far away
Ancestral darkness born
Acts divine of blasphemy
Release your fears of sources unknown
Scalpel cut into the flesh
Bring forth thy screams

Chapter two enters physical mortality
The release of pure black energy
Surface of age old evil
Growning darkness taking form
Wound is deep and never to heal
Eternal circle of the flesh
Ritual dedicated to morbid lust
No one ever returns...

Once they were almost human
Beneath the living, beyond the dead
From the depths of hell's dungeons
The gates are open to the circle of the flesh

Chapter three brings forth a vault of dreams
Of unimaginable pleasures
On the edge of pure damnation
The secret of pain's revealed
Depravation and mortality
Equals a life threatening sickness
Once you've tasted it
Prepare to suffer eternally

"Piercing screams inside of me
This was never meant to be
Stop this act of horror
Please, let me die..."

Chapter four ends a morbid circle
A circle condemned to die
Sick minds trying to
Master the art of flesh
Exit of life, enter the grave
Pray you'll meet your maker
Forever be bound to eternal death
The reaper wields his scythe

They were never human
Beneath the living, beyond the dead
From the depths of hell's dungeon
The gates are closed to the circle of the flesh
