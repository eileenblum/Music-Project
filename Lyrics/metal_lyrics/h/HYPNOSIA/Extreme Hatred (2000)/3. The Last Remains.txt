Scorn of the earth
Imprisoned for life
Sepulchral cities
Mental affliction
Open your eyes
See through the lies
Dreams of obscurity
Source of all life

The last remains

Screams from the past
Erased with time
Secret horrors
Dwelling in your mind
Beyond the cemetery
Centuries blackened again

The last remains

Horrid nightmares taking control
From birth until my death
A grim insane spectre
Of a freedom torn in chains

Morbid condition
Buried in the sand
Eternal darkness
Submerged in cries
Premonition of death
The final hour
The last remains
Rest in peace

...Of the world the last remains
