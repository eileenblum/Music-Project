Terrorized by savage brains
Steal away the right to breathe
Controlling every move
It's the past, it's the present, it's the future
Locked in invisible chains
Kept restrained and dead calm
Each day is worse than the last
Perseverance breakdown of the psyche

Mental terror - dreadful monument of man's defeat
Insane disaster - you cannot kill what does not live

Blackened forces of fear
Sadistical and manical
Depriving thoughts of the cure
Never heal, never live, always tortured
Mental alteration of pain
Abolish every chance to heal
Branded by terror's light
Perseverance breakdown of the psyche

Faster than before - a world thrust to the end!!!
