Sanity decaying piece by piece - the walls around are closing in
Sky is falling to the ground - all in the shades of black
Intoxicated state of being - paralyzed numb by fear
Darkness surrounds the being - after formations of the mind
Grip of the "self" is torn apart - rhe winds of death blows
Fundament begin to crumble - increasing darkness rise

Haunting death
Nightmares come alive in a life of desolation
Horror reign
Mind obscured by the dawn of depravity

Through the ashes of subconscious maze - circle of illusions arise
Casting forth most cruel dreams - that turn from nothing to flesh
Horrible creatures of waste and despair - clutching at your very soul
Erasing time and the spark for life - pushed forward to damnation
Searching the brain for possible faults - the object which causes the pain
Death seems to be the inevitable way to stop this madness reign

Insane - the nightmares that bring the demise
Torture - emotions dragged to the edge
