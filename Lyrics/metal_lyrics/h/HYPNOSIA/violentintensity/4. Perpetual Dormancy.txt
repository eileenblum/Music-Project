Images of the past comes back again, the age of persecution and torture
Will of the mind declines to dismay, impossible to stand for much longer
Forced to be hidden inside walls of hate, in fear of becoming enslaved
The all seeing eye of menace &amp; terror, mankind is heading for its downfall

Ruler of depravity
Disturbing the structure of man
Creating bizzare insanity
Dealer of submissive hate

Into the depths of nothingness, a wasteland of deep desperation
The fires of hope has turned to dust, left only falseness and suspicion
The reign in pain for all eternity, intolerable suppression of the weak
Slowly disintegrate beyond premonition, infernal torture of the brain

Ending life's insanity
Descending into obscurity
Ruin man's perplexity
Perpetual darmancy

In the night of the dead
See visions of dark passing through the mind
Perpetual death is so near...
No reason to try to survive these storms from Hell
