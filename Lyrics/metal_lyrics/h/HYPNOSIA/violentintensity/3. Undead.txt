Time for the final sacrifice
The last in a conquest of death
Blood has been shed to the grave
Striving to gain control

Malignant obedience
An act of obscene
Torture beyond imagination
Living through incarnation

Disturbed beyond the other side
A collapsed state of mind
Trying to awake the dead
Again blood must be shed

Ripping the heart out
As the body rot
No life in sight
Shivering from cold
Never to return
Depart the world of mortals

Die
There is no hope for cure
Once you've been dead
There's no return
Die
Nothing can help you now
Lying in a pool of blood
Decomposing slowly
