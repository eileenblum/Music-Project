All my life I've been defined by hiding the scars on my soul.
But given time, I'd be fine, if I could learn to let go.

And I'm sorry, but I'm closer to fixing those mistakes I've made.

Take me into your arms, breathe me into your heart, as I'm swimming my way through your veins.
Can't erase what I've done, or the man I've become.
But I swear that I'm ready to change.
I'm ready to change.

All my life I've been confined-
Consumed by the secrets I hold.
But I never tried to set it right, so maybe it's best I'm alone.

And I'm sorry, but I'm closer to fixing those mistakes I've made.

Take me into your arms, breathe me into your heart, as I'm swimming my way through your veins.
Can't erase what I've done, or the man I've become.
But I swear that I'm ready to change.
I'm ready to change.

I don't wanna live without you.
I don't wanna live without you.

Take me into your arms, breathe me into your heart, as I'm swimming my way through your veins.
Can't erase what I've done, or the man I've become.
But I swear that I'm ready to change.
I'm ready to change.

(I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready) I'm ready to change.
(I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready) Oh, I'm ready to change.

I don't wanna live without you (I'm ready to change).
I'm ready to change.
