This is our moment.
This is our moment- we're unbreakable.

I can see I'm at the end of my rope
It's a terrible feeling to lose control
I've seen the sign, here, at the end of the road
It says there's no turning back,
But I swear I'm never letting go

This is our moment, our line in the sand
Bring on the riot; we'll fight âtil the end
We're stronger than fire that's burning within
You should have known we're unbreakable

Uh-uh-oh. Unbreakable. Uh-uh-oh. Unbreakable.

I can see the fight has taken its toll,
But they can't drag us away from what we're owed
I've looked inside and there's a spark in us all
I know your spirit is fading,
But I swear I'm never letting go

This is our moment, our line in the sand
Bring on the riot; we'll fight âtil the end
We're stronger than fire that's burning within
You should have known we're unbreakable

Uh-uh-oh. Unbreakable. Uh-uh-oh. Unbreakable.

Stand with me if you're ready to give everything
We're at war; fight for your dreams
Stand with me at the end of everything
You're the key- set us free

This is our moment... this is our moment...

This is our moment, our line in the sand
Bring on the riot; we'll fight âtil the end
We're stronger than fire that's burning within
You should have known we're unbreakable

Uh-uh-oh. Unbreakable. Uh-uh-oh. Unbreakable.

This is our moment
