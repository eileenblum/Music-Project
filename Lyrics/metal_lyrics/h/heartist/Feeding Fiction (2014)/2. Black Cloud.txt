You are the black cloud in my life
I try to walk away, but you follow me
You're the sun that blinds my eyes
I try to turn away but you're burning me

How are we meant to be when we just fell apart? We fell apart
Let's go ahead and play this game you've made,

'Cause I don't know who I used to be, but I think I see it now.
I let it go, but I won't forget everything you said.

So step back, and let it sink into your head.

You are the black cloud in my life
I try to walk away, but you follow me.
You're the sun that blinds my eyes
I try to turn away, but you're burning me.

For so long, for so long I felt the rain on my head.
For so long, for so long I felt the sun burn my skin.

Why are we so naive with all the lies today- the lies today?
So go ahead, cling to the prayers you say,

'Cause now I know what you mean to me, yeah, I think I see it now.
I let you go 'cause I won't forget everything you said.

You are the black cloud in my life- I try to walk away, but you follow me.
You're the sun that blinds my eyes.
I try to turn away, but you're burning me.

For so long, for so long I felt the rain on my head.
For so long, for so long I felt the sun burn my skin.

Is it sinking in? Is it sinking in yet?

Is it sinking in? Is it sinking in your head?

You are the black cloud in my life- I try to walk away, but you follow me.
You're the sun that blinds my eyes.
I try to turn away, but you're burning me.
For so long, for so long I felt the rain on my head.
For so long, for so long I felt the sun burn my skin.

Is it sinking in? Is it sinking in yet?
