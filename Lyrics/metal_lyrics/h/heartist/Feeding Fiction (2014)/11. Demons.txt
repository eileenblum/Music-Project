Pick up the pieces from the game I've lost.
I should have known that I was losing from the start.
When I look back and see the pain that I've caused,
Will I regret all the awful things I've done?

They'll haunt my dreams âtil it's over.
Could my heart be any colder?

Demons, I know my demons-
They stood by me watching everything.
Demons, I know my demons-
They stood by me while I destroyed everything.
Demons, my demons are me.

It's time I paid the price for what I've been.
But if my voice would carry, I would make amends.
Tear back the covers on the lies that I've spread.
Rewind and start again.
Rewind and start again.

They'll haunt my dreams âtil it's over.
Could my heart be any colder?

Demons, I know my demons-
They stood by me watching everything.
Demons, I know my demons-
They stood by me while I destroyed everything.
Demons, my demons are me.

Tears for my family: a prayer for lovers and the son they laid to rest.
Was my pride the end of me?
Rewind and start again.
Rewind and start again.

I never cried for sympathy and when it came, I just turned and walked away.
I wish you'd known what it meant to me.
I should have let you in-
Rewind and start again.
