Light gives way to darkness: comfort for the blind.
Make your bed with ignorance, a fractured state of mind.
Truth won't break the silence unless it's from inside,
So free yourself from innocence.
Illuminate the night.

Let yourself ignite.

Sometimes life is gonna hurt.
Sometimes there's a reason you've gotta let it burn.
Leave it all behind as ashes come to life.
Let the flames burn bright.
Let yourself ignite.

Something to remember: wisdom holds the key.
Lost inside, you soon will find what you're meant to be,
So dream like an inferno, turn them into gold.
Radiate the hope you've found, and never let it go.
Never let it go.

Sometimes life is gonna hurt.
Sometimes there's a reason you've gotta let it burn.
Leave it all behind as ashes come to life.
Let the flames burn bright.
Let yourself ignite. 'Nite!

'Cause truth won't break the silence, unless it's from inside.
Illuminate the night.
Illuminate the night.

Light gives way to darkness unless we come alive,
So be the change you need to see.
Let yourself ignite.

Sometimes life is gonna hurt.
Sometimes there's a reason you've gotta let it burn.
Leave it all behind as ashes come to life.
Let the flames burn bright.
Let the flames burn bright.
Let the flames burn bright.
Let yourself ignite. 'Nite!
Let yourself ignite. 'Nite!
Let yourself ignite!
