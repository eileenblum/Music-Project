I've been biting my tongue-
The line has been crossed and now there is hell to pay.
Enough is enough-
The truth's coming out if you like it or not.

Manipulate: it's the way you paint yourself into a saint.
(You're so consumed) in your righteousness, but I can see through.

I'll never be the one wasting life on futures I can't see.
I can do this on my own.
Don't take- don't take- don't take this personal.
You'll never see your shallow vision of the one you hoped I'd be.
What's it like to feel alone?
Donât take- don't take- don't take this personal.

You've lost your dignity-
You've ruined your chances, so wipe that smirk off your face.
âCause it's already too late
You've already found a new friend of mine to...

Manipulate: it's the way you paint yourself into a saint.
You're so consumed in your righteousness, but I can see through.

I'll never be the one wasting life on futures I can't see.
I can do this on my own.
Don't take- don't take- don't take this personal.
You'll never see your shallow vision of the one you hoped I'd be.
What's it like to feel alone?
Donât take- don't take- don't take this personal. Don't take this personal.

[Spoken:]
I've wasted so much of my life on you
And I'm sick of fixing parts of myself that I have never found fault in
Do you have any idea what it's like to watch the person you love become everything you hate?

I've seen that you're senseless, pathetic, and wretched.
Remorse is a lesson, so sit down; I'll teach you regret

So when he's all that's left.
I hope you give him your best, before he leaves you a wreck.
You have my blessing to fuck who you want- a fuck I give not.

I'll never be the one wasting life on futures I can't see.
I can do this on my own.
Don't take- don't take- don't take this personal.
You'll never see your shallow vision of the one you hoped I'd be.
What's it like to feel alone?
Donât take- don't take- don't take this personal. Don't take this personal.

Don't take this personal.
