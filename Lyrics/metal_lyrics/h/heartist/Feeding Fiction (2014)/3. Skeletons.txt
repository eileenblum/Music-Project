I've forgotten how to feel
These nights, they chill me
Light the way to something real
And save me from myself

You chase the cold from me
With you
I'm learning to see
I just need you to know

I tried to find a way
To bury all the pain
But these skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons won't sleep

You gave me clarity
And showed me how to free
These skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons in me,
These skeletons in me

How can I forget the past,
If it still haunts me?
Your ghost never fades away
When I gave up everything
You took a hold of me
And proved I'm more than a broken wing
I just need you to know

I tried to find a way
To bury all the pain
But these skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons won't sleep
You gave me clarity
And showed me how to free
These skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons in me,
These skeletons in me

Sympathy is hard to find,
So maybe life should be defined
By all the pain we left behind;
It rots inside our minds
You make me believe

I tried to find a way
To bury all the pain
But these skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons won't sleep

You gave me clarity
And showed me how to free
These skeletons, these skeletons
These skeletons in me,
These skeletons in me
These skeletons in me
These skeletons in me

These skeletons in me
