One more day.
I never thought you'd leave, but I packed up all your things.
Never had a clue you lied to me, but now it's plain to see.
We both had doubts, but we still had each other,
And that's all gone--yeah itâs all gone can't you see?

I'm not gonna live this way; you're never gonna change.
No, I don't want to die this way, and it's such a shame, âcause..

I think our days are numbered, and you're the one to blame.
If I could find a way, I'd make you fade away.
I'd break the ties that bind us. I'd make my great escape.
If I could find a way, I'd make you fade away.

It's like they say: nothing comes for free.
And you used me carelessly.
So stay true or set me free
And leave room for better things.
Well, I've broken down, and I've fought to recover,
But I stay strong, 'cause I found my clarity.

(No!) I'm not gonna live this way; you're never gonna change (you're never gonna change).
(No!) No, I don't want to die this way, and it's such a shame, âcause..

I think our days are numbered, and you're the one to blame.
If I could find a way, I'd make you fade away.
I'd break the ties that bind us. I'd make my great escape.
If I could find a way, I'd make you fade away.

Everybody's looking down on me, down on me, down on me... when I gave you everything.

I think our days are numbered, and you're the one to blame.
If I could find a way, I'd make you fade away.
I'd break the ties that bind us. I'd make my great escape.
If I could find a way, I'd make you fade away.

Sometimes love just isn't what it seems.
You threw me away.
Now that you're gone I think it's time I found the best in me.
I think I've found a way.
