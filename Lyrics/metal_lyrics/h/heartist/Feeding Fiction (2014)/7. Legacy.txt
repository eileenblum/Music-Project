I've decided that today is the day.
To make a stand against the weak who resist the change.
So speak your mind, or take your tongue to the grave,
And give the young a chance to wash away the stains.

What if all we are is the worst of what we've done?

All we are is strength in numbers fighting for a change.
And when we're gone, we live forever through our legacy-
We stand as one and carry on.

I've decided that it's all that you know to bow your head
While you wait for the light to show.
But would the sun speak if you called out its name,
Or would it set, the same way you have in your ways?

What if all we are is the worst of what we've done?

All we are is strength in numbers fighting for a change.
And when we're gone, we live forever through our legacy-
We stand as one and carry on.

Ooh, oh. Ooh, oh.

All we are is strength in numbers (fighting for a change).
And when we're gone, we live forever (through our legacy).
We are one (all we are is strength in numbers, fighting for a change)
We are one
We will live forever (and when we're gone, we live forever through our legacy).
We will live forever

We stand as one and carry on.
