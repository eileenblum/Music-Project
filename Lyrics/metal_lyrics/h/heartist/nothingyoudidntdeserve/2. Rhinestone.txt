Iâm sick of running myself in the ground
I need to try to find my way out
But all of the lights, bright as they are, lead back to you
How could I bring myself to be used?
I should have learned from the things that I told myself Iâd never do
All along the liar was you
Show your true colors, let them see

On the surface you shine
Like the diamond pressed to your cheek
But beneath your tricks
Youâre just another weakling after me
Like a rhinestone you shine
But your beauty remains skin deep
And I know just what you are
Youâre a liar, a fake, a cheat

And I tried not to forget this
But I choke on the words that spill from my throat
And spit back in your face
The life Iâve wasted on you
They may follow you in blindness
Oh, how Iâd love to watch your insides curl
At the thought of being alone

On the surface you shine
Like the diamond pressed to your cheek
But beneath your tricks
Youâre just another weakling after me
Like a rhinestone you shine
But your beauty remains skin deep
And I know just what you are
Youâre a liar, a fake, a cheat

When they see you for what you are
Iâll light the spark that will burn this place to the ground

(On the surface you shine
Like a rhinestone you shine)
On the surface you shine
Like the diamond pressed to your cheek
But beneath your tricks
Youâre just another weakling after me
Like a rhinestone you shine
But your beauty remains skin deep
And I know just what you are
Youâre a liar, a fake, a cheat

Like the diamond pressed to your cheek
But beneath your tricks
Youâre just another weakling after me
