She spins a tale of love so bittersweet that it stains my lips
I wonder how you got so lonely with a grace so poisonous
But she melts away in the light
I could never stay away, but I could sure fucking try

I donât deserve this, Iâm lost looking for purpose
No, Iâm not worthless, Iâm just looking for answers
Youâre not the answer

This is not what I want
I just keep running away from the pain
I swear (I swear), I swear (I swear)
Iâll never make it out of here
The answer stays the same

Sheâs misery, but when she leaves I find Iâm wondering
How many times have I tried?
Why canât I just get this right?
She slips away from me again
Force me away, force me to hide my heart
When Iâd give anything to lie with you

This is not what I want
I just keep running away from the pain
I swear (I swear), I swear (I swear)
Iâll never make it out of here
The answer stays the same

Thereâs something growing inside me
My heartâs not yours to break
Iâve let you go

I found the answer, it was hiding inside me
Donât fucking judge me
I command respect

Who wouldâve thought my life could fall right in front of me?
I watched you burn out of reality
You found me trivial, I found you a tragedy
The night you burned, I found whatâs left of me (I found whatâs left of me)

This is not what I want
I just keep running away from the pain
I swear (I swear), I swear (I swear)
Iâll never make it out of here
The answer stays the same

I swear, I swear
Iâm just looking for answers, youâre not the answer
I swear, I swear
I found the answer, youâre not the answer!
Itâs not something I could wish upon myself
