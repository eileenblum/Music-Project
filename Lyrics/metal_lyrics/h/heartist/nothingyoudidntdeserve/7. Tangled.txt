[Bonus Track]Iâm not broken, but my mind is wearing down
And Iâm not broken, but your love canât save me now

String me out a foot above the ground
Watching from above the clouds while I wait for you to cut me down
You swore with no fires in your eyes that youâd never give me up
Well all bets are off, all promises are lost
The sound of silence could not pull me away
Iâll trade these memories of shame
In hopes that youâll still let me breathe

Here I stand, an arm's reach from the end
Lost in the sound of empty words you never meant
And things you wish you never said
I found my home, and it was in me all along
The words you spoke have made me strong
But hope was in me all along

Feel me out, like footsteps in the crowd
Tangled up, canât make a sound
If I begged you would you let me out?
Slipping in, slowly, in my skin
I wonât let you pull me down
'Cause when the flood waters reach
Iâll turn my back while you drown

The sound of silence could not pull me away
Iâll trade these memories of shame
In hopes that youâll still let me breathe

Here I stand, an arm's reach from the end
Lost in the sound of empty words you never meant
And things you wish you never said
I found my home, and it was in me all along
The words you spoke have made me strong
But hope was in me all along (in me all along)

Whereâs the sense in fighting what we know?
Girl, you never loved me
So wrap your arms around someone who gives you what you want
Iâve never been enough
So bite your fucking tongue!

So donât hold your breath, hold your breath

Here I stand, an arm's reach from the end
Lost in the sound of empty words you never meant
And things you wish you never said
Here I stand, an arm's reach from the end
Lost in the sound of empty words you never meant
And things you wish you never said
I found my home, and it was in me all along
The words you spoke have made me strong
But hope was in me all along
