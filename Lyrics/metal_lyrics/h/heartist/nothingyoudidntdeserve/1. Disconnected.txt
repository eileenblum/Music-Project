My feet have carried me
Beyond your memories
To places you cannot be

Breathe in the oxygen where I am
I know you can feel me
The hair stands on your neck
Can you remember what brought us here?
Or are you just as lost as I am?

When will we find our way back home?
Iâm disconnected from the ones above (ones above)
Iâm disconnected from the ones who fell in between
And I stray from this pathway
Though thereâs still nothing left of me

But now theyâve buried me
How could you let me be
Sucked in by the ones who dwell beneath

Can you remember what brought us here?
Or are you just as lost as I am?
Iâm disconnected from the ones above (ones above)
Iâm disconnected from the ones who fell in between
And I stray from this pathway
Though thereâs still nothing left of me
Though thereâs still nothing left of me

So Iâll wave goodbye to my past
As I stray on my own

So now Iâll wave goodbye
To my past
So now Iâll wave goodbye
To my past
Now I walk alone

Iâm disconnected from the ones above (ones above)
Iâm disconnected from the ones who fell in between
And I stray from this pathway
Though thereâs still nothing left of me
Iâm disconnected from the ones above (ones above)
Iâm disconnected from the ones who fell in between
And I stray from this pathway
Though thereâs still nothing left of me

Fall from grace so I can earn my place
Leave no trace so I can finally say...
Goodbye!
