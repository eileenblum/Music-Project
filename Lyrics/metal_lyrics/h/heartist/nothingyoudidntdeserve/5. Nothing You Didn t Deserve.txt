Iâm tired of this shit
The consequence of your actions will leave you scarred
You are eyes are telling a lie
Why couldnât you just be mine?

Trust me
Whatâs the worst that can happen to you?

What is it about you
That keeps me going when Iâm on my own
This could never last
Forget the future, Iâm dwelling on my past
I cannot let you go
And I need to let you know

My thoughts are taking over and my hand is on the blade
My vision turned to red as she screamed,
"What the fuck have I done?"
I canât escape this
I canât escape this
What the fuck have I done?
I canât escape this
I canât escape this

Out of time
Thereâs nowhere to run
Thereâs nowhere to hide from me
My mind is slipping away
My morals are shades of grey

Trust me
Whatâs the worst that can happen to you?

What is it about you
That keeps me going when Iâm on my own
This could never last
Forget the future Iâm dwelling on my past
Itâs you and I forever now
You loved me, now thereâs no way out
I canât make this last
I cannot let you go
And I need to let you know

What have I done?
What have I done to you?
Nothing you didnât deserve
Nothing you didnât deserve
