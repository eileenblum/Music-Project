Hold me in your arms and donât let go
Iâve been waiting for this moment
Teach me everything I need to see
I close my eyes, in fear, for safety
I look away, but I am left with this feeling (this feeling)
I look away, but I am forced to see

When I look into your eyes I canât help but see a part of me
When I go to kiss your lips I canât tell if this is real or just a dream
And if I try to tell you what I believe
Well, when you look into my eyes, youâll see that nothingâs quite as it seems

Can you tear a hole and look inside?
Count the demons as they leave my body
With a heart of gold, Iâm turning water into wine
Itâs getting better all the time
I look away, but I am forced to see

When I look into your eyes I canât help but see a part of me
When I go to kiss your lips I canât tell if this is real or just a dream
And if I try to tell you what I believe
Well, when you look into my eyes, youâll see that nothingâs quite as it seems

So put your hands in mine
I promise youâll sleep safely
I look away, but I am left with this feeling
I look away, but I am forced to see

When I look into your eyes, I canât help but see a part of me
When I go to kiss your lips, I canât tell if this is real or just a dream
And if I try to tell you what I believe
Well, when you look into my eyes, youâll see that nothingâs quite as it seems
When I look into your eyes, I canât help but see a part of me
When I go to kiss your lips, I canât tell if this is real or just a dream
And if I try to tell you what I believe
Well, when you look into my eyes, youâll see that nothingâs quite as it seems
Well, when you look into my eyes, youâll see that nothingâs quite as it seems
