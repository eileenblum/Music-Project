Give me time, give me time to prove that I'm worth the life that you risked to lose
'Cause your eyes were as lost as my time on you
The mistakes you made were yours to choose
Give me words to say
If the choice were yours where would we be?
All that's left of me is the love you gave and took away

We tried to make our lives along the way
But the bitter taste of love is all we made

Tell me, tell me, where did I go wrong?
I've been here all along
But if tomorrow brings a better way then why is there today?

I used to leave you weak laying next to me, falling into your deception
Cuz you played your games like you had nothing to lose
Oh girl, won't you tell me something?
Did my thoughts and my words mean nothing?
'Cause the one thing that's left to face is the selfish way you walked away

We tried to make our lives along the way
But the bitter taste of love is all we made

Tell me, tell me, where did I go wrong?
I've been here all along
But if tomorrow brings a better way then why is there today?
Tell me, have we taken this too far?
Stop faking, breaking us apart
But if tomorrow brings a better way then why is there today?

I wasn't lying when I said you were a part of me
All I wanted was a chance to change your mind
I didn't hesitate to choose the life in front of me
I never stopped to think our chance would pass us by
But I've been running in circles after you
Pray my heart will find the answer for me, 'cause you're all that's left to lose

Tell me, tell me, where did I go wrong?
I've been here all along
But if tomorrow brings a better way (a better way, a better way)

Tell me, tell me, where did I go wrong?
I've been here all along
But if tomorrow brings a better way then why is there today?
Tell me, have we taken this too far?
Stop faking, breaking us apart
But if tomorrow brings a better way then why is there today?
(I wasn't lying when I said you were a part of me
All I wanted was a chance to change your mind)
Why is there today?
Why is there today?
(I didn't hesitate to choose the life in front of me
I never stopped to think our chance would pass us by)
Why is there today?
