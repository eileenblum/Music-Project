[Words: Rettke/ Music: Rettke, Paeth]

Is there anyone when we're dead and gone
Who is leading us up to the light
Taking care for a love to share
Will be dissappear like a flash in the night

Do we go and leave back our souls
Do we leave and darkness is all we see?
So we're all defenders of destiny
And we're just a sign of the times
Lost in dreams and we enter eternity
Beyond the walls of an eternal light

All the candlelights play all games of life
Like a vision we've lost in our minds
No more frust and pain, poison in our veins
No more lost souls of all diferent kinds

Do we go and leave back our souls
Do we leave and darkness is all we see?
So we're all defenders of destiny
And we're just a sign of the times
Lost in dreams and we enter eternity
Beyond the walls of an eternal light
