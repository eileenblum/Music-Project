[Words: Rettke/ Music: Paeth, Rettke]

Face the truth 'cause there's something deep inside of you
Sad but true there's nothing you can do
Sacrifice a victim of pollution now it's time
Roll the dice but noone bets on you

You feel alive, don't  realize the powerdive inside your head
The facts revealed and now is sealed

All the years they're dealing with your hunger and your pain
Now the tears are drying in the sand
Innocence and violence are melting inside your brain
Feel the trigger burning in your hand

You feel alive, don't realize the powerdive in your head
The facts revealed and now it's sealed

Now you have to face it and nobody breaks it
And you can feel the burning fuse
Like an open fire burning your desire
Now the disease is breakin' loose

Paralized you're waiting for salvation all the time
All alone there's noone to rely
Termination, violation stickin' in your brain
In the end you know the reason why
