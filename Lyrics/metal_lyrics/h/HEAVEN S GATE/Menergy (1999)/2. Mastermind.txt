[Words: Rettke/ Music: Paeth, Rettke]

Who is turning out the light when night comes
Feel the focus in your sight
He keeps you warm and tender
Who is connecting all the world together and
Who is taking care of time
The pulse of every heartbeat under control

Like a dream in your dreams
He's the mastermind
Watch your life on the screen of the mastermind

Bits are cloning human race without a touch
Computer interface to satisfy your pleasures
You are lost in cyberspace pretending life
Leaving back no trace
Your mind is penetrated under control

Like a dream in your dreams
He's the mastermind
Watch your life on the screen of the mastermind

Love, a terminal disease is healed by force
A digital release so don't you run for cover
You will be safe

Like a dream in your dreams
He's the mastermind
Watch your life on the screen of the mastermind
