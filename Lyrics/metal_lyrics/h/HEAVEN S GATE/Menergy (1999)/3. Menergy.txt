[Words: Rettke/ Music: Rettke, Paeth, Hunecke-Rizzo]

The bits are cruising like a warrior in time
They're beating your defending senses
A mind is drifting through all the seas of Rhye

Your eyes connected to imaginary signs
Your eyes protected by electric fences all the time

Invader technology, crusader we call it Menergy
Invader technology, crusader we call it Menergy

The integrated chip has turned to overload
A unit packed with information
The force of Menergy is ready to explode

Your eyes connected to imaginary signs
Your eyes protected by electric fences all the time

Invader technology, crusader we call it Menergy
Invader technology, crusader we call it Menergy
