[Words: Rettke/ Music: Hunecke-Rizzo, Rettke, Paeth]

When darkness changes into light
The sense of dream and day unite
A skin of steel, a focus view
Cold eyes are zooming into you

Lost horizons, planet earth
A different paralizing world

Beyond the world and machines
A dream is not what it seems
They are protectors of time - lost in time

They are watching every single step
Beware the electronic traps
Spinning nets with rapes of souls
They kill your mind with just one goal

Lost horizons, planet earth
A different paralizing world

Beyond the world and machines
A dream is not what it seems
They are protectors of time - lost in time
