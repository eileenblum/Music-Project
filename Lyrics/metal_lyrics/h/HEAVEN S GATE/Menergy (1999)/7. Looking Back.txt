[Words: Paeth/ Music: Paeth, Hunecke-Rizzo]

Did you ever know that I was dreaming
Someone elses dream now it's too late
No matter what I do now there's no healing
'cause I suffer, suffer anyway

Do you know the feeling when you're falling
Do you know the cold in hearts that lie
Do you know the sense when you are trusting
And you suffer, suffer anytime

I'm never gonna win -
Time was taking all my pride and broke my heart in two
I'm never gonna win

I'm looking back and I find
Something I thought that's already gone
In my dreams there's a sign
Did you ever try to turn back time

Did you ever know that I was dreaming
Someone elses dream now it's too late
No matter what I do now there's no healing
'cause I suffer, suffer anyway

Do you know the feeling when you're falling
Do you know the cold in hearts that lie
Do you know the sense when you are trusting
And you suffer, suffer anyway

I'm never gonna win -
Time was taking all my pride and broke my heart in two
I'm never gonna win

I'm looking back and I find
Something I thought that's already gone
In my dreams there's a sign
Did you ever try to turn back time
