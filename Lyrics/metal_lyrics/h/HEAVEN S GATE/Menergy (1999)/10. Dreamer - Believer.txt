[Words: Rettke/ Music: Rettke, Paeth, Hunecke-Rizzo]

Back in time, lost emotions
All your memories fade to grey and dissappear
Fading life full of oceans
Lost in paradise and now the end is near

Future is over it feels like a thorn in your eyes
Damage is done
Your fairy has gone forever
Try to believe you're the passionate one

Dreamer you're wasting your time
Believer but you're the last in line

In your mind full of devotions
You're hiding close behind a wall of lies
All your moves goin' through the motions
In a coloured dream within a dream that dies

Future is over it feels like a thorn in your eyes
Damage is done
Your fairy has gone forever
Try to believe you're the passionate one

Dreamer you're wasting your time
Believer but you're the last in line
Dreamer you're wasting your time
Believer but you're the last in line
