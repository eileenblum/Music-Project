[Words: Rettke/ Music: Rettke, Paeth, Hunecke-Rizzo]

Black horizon, fading light
Organic poison, electric sights
Jerky movements, a clockwork toy
Tempting plug-ins for eternal joy

No pain no fears no blood, and no tears
Empty covers when love dissappears
Wings of time they're connected in a line

In cyberia where the glass people live
No request for life no affection, no reply
In cyberia where the glass people live

A sound of silence no single word
Could break the darkness in cyberworld
Suspicious kindness with x-ray eyes
Is penetrating into every kind

No pain no fears no blood, and no tears
Empty covers when love dissappears
Wings of time they're connected in a line
In cyberia where the glass people live
No request for life no affection, no reply
In cyberia where the glass people live.
