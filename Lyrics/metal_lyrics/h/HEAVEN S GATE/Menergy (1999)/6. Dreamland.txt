[Words: Rettke/ Music: Hunecke-Rizzo, Rettke, Paeth]

No time for illusion, no time for desire
In tears of frustration time's passing by
I try to resist all the demons in me
But life's not constructed for eternity

I feel the night from deep inside, a siren to my head
No attitude, no point of view
I'm going slightly mad

In deepest devotion I creep here and pray
To someone in dreamland to make my day
A million of voices are calling my name
I' m drifting away like a spark of a flame
I'm paralized, I'm hypnotized, I'm deaf, I'm dumb and blind
A fiction in a dream for every world that I could find

Times running out in my mind
And I fade to grey
Into a room out of time
And I fade to grey

I sit here in silence without any doubt
Reflecting the things I have done
Thinking it over what's life all about
But heaven on earth I had none

I feel the night from deep inside, a siren in my head
No attitude, no point of view,
I'm going slightly mad.
