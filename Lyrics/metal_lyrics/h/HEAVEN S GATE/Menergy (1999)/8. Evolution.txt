[Words: Rettke/ Music: Rettke, Paeth]

The whole world is tangled in reins
The horse's running fast, you can't tame it
Vision attack and the devil is hung on it's back
Lifestyle, a multiple choice
Captured by millions of voices
Dreams and illusions are forming the key to your soul

Don't give a damm to it all
Jump the train, hear the call
You're gonna fight this evolution, a revolution

Get ready to enter the race
Spread out your arms to embrace it
Wasting no time, reach out for the finishing line

Don't give a damm to it all
Jump the train, hear the call
You're gonna fight this evolution, a revolution

Don't you think you're out your mind
Life is too short to rewind it
If you're hiding your face
You're lost in the haze of a dream

Don't give a damm to it all
Jump the train, hear the call
You're gonna fight this evolution, a revolution
