[Monty Python cover, Japan release only]

Some things in life are bad
they can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
don't grumble, give a whistle
And this will help things turn out for the best
and...

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing

When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
and...

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow

Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

Always look on the bright side of death
Just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true

You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you
and...

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
[repeat till end]

I mean, what have you got to lose?
You know, you've come from nothing,
you're going back to nothing!
What have you lost?
Nothing!
