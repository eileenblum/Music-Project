[Lyrics: Rettke]
[Music: Rettke, Paeth, Bilski]

He is the king of our land
with golden heart and iron hand
he rules
he's the saviour

He's taking care of our lives
his black eyes know to hypnotize
he leads
through his behaviour

[PRE-CHORUS:]
With golden wings on glory ride
he rose the iron sword
we all are here to pay tribute
and celebrate the lord

[CHORUS:]
He's the man
he fights for law and order
he's the man
and standing one for all
he's riding for our liberty
beyond the fear and agony
he will be the saviour of us all
He's the man

The scepter's rising for a sign
the chalice full of bloody wine
beloved king,
we salute ya'!

The jester does exhilarate
there is no time to hesitate
we know
we 'll ride forever

The path of glory never ends
we keep the faith of fame
the iron sword is riding on
Hallowed be thy name

[CHORUS]

Marching in the darkness
standing side by side
all the gods of thunder
blinded by the light

[SOLO: Sascha / CHORUS]
