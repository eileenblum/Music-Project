Every time the show is over, party starts again
Need another booze shower, bleed the night my friend
Are you ready guys?
All I see are turning stars, I'm falling down the floor
In the end I'll get a kick from the bouncers at the door

All we need is action
All we need is spinnin' round and round
We are the attraction
All we need is dynamite unbound

We are dancin' side by side
It's going up and down
We are f'n' dynamite
We blow you up and out

Next day in the morning, I'm pukin' like a beast
Got another headache, and no bucks at least
Where's my money gone?
Over twenty condoms on the bedroom wall
Stickin' on the carpet, waitin' for a nine month call
