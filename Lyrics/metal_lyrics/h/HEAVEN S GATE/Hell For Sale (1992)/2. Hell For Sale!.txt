[Lyrics: Rettke]
[Music: Rettke, Paeth, Bilski]

Hey, you little fool, come down to me and see
show you my world of things you never meant to be
don't fear, just crave for all things for you to come
if you won't be the same before the night is done

So, look all through my place, say, isn't it nice ?

[PRE-CHORUS:]
Got sick and tired, my job is done
I guit this life and go to start another one

[CHORUS:]
Hell for sale!
come down you won't believe it
Hell for sale!
you can buy it
Hell for sale!
I know you won't leave it
Hell for sale!

So as you're here I think you feel its special charm
it's dirty cheap and weather proof
forever keeps you warm

[PRE-CHORUS / CHORUS]

[Public Sale]
OK, we start with the first offer at 10 quid
who bids more?
12 quid!
12? For Hell? You gonna be jokin'!
No!
OK, you got it!!!

[SOLO: Sascha / Bonny]

[REPEAT FIRST VERSE / CHORUS]
