No matter what I say, no matter what I do
Never got any compliments, no respect from you
With frozen feelings, that's the way I had to live
You really like to take, but you don't give

So what's the reason to live a life in hell
You better listen now to the words I say
No more broken hearts, I can't stand the pain
It's all over, my life starts again
No more broken hearts, I can't stand the pain

And I'm free forever
Free forever

But sometimes in my heart, when I feel alone
Doubts going through my mind, am I right or am I wrong?
No more broken hearts, I can't stand the pain
It's all over, my life starts again
No more broken hearts, I can't stand the pain
