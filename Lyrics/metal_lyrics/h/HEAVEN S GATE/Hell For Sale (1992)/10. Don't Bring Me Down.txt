I've never been the man I meant to be
There's a shadow on my face
Always telling me the better things of life
It's time for me to leave this empty place
Never knew what I was waiting for
Time has come, no need to wait for the answer

Don't bring me down
No more fools can show the right way of livin'
Don't bring me down
I say you're never gonna bring me down

Always tried to be the one you need
You never noticed I felt sad
Now I know you didn't care about my life
Never thought that you could be so bad
Never knew what I was waiting for
Time has come, no need to wait for the answer
