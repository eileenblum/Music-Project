Never could resist my own temptations
Much too young to know these dangerous toys
First of all I felt the good vibrations
Never listened to the warning voice
Addicted to a blind imagination
Always thinking that I have no choice
In my eyes the fear of revelation
For all the years I have to pay the price

Wasted time, and I've lost my mind
takin' all as donations in kind

White evil
Why can't you hear the cries
White evil
No fear is in my eyes
Help me if you can

Livin' in a dream ain't no solution
When you're clean the world is still the same
Always on the run from prosecution
Kill for dimes and no one you can blame

Memories are fading in the snow
Springtime's far away in veins that grow
Shadows twistin' in my acid brain
Crystal dust is drivin' me insane
