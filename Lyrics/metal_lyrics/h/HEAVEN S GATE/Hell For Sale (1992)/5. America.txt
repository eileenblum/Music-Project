[Words: Rettke]
[Music: Rettke, Paeth, Bilski]

From West L.A. to New York City
cleaning dishes in the wallstreet hype
miss liberty and golden gate so pretty
and Uncle Sam is cleaning stars and stripes

We're all stickin' together
in the fields where we don't belong
but we gonna win now or never
so proud
fightin' the streets for a trashcan-dinner

[CHORUS:]
America, the promised land
forever free and never dying
America, a dream comes true
a helping hand needs no denying

From New Orleans to "old" Milwaukee
streets still not clean from colored men
the heartland of your heart is where your heart is
can you afford to pay for not to die?

We all have to face it forever
we all have to dance with wolves
can't you dig it, white nigger?
take this
to live and let die is not the meaning of life

[CHORUS / SOLO: Sascha / CHORUS]
