[Words: Rettke]
[Music: Rettke, Paeth, Bilski]

The night awakes, there's nitro in the air
we're human dynamite, exploding everywhere
for a twilight generation gettin' wild and loud
like burning fire, believin' there's no doubt

[BRIDGE:]
We rock, we roll, we're taking control
the time is right now, we want it all

[CHORUS:]
Gives all the size, can you feel it
it's breaking the ice, breaking the ice
comes out to heal burning fever
it's breaking the seal
THE FLASHES, THE FLASHES OF STEEL

From here to eternity the stronger will survive
a human dynamo, kickin' and alive
turning up the power 'till the sky is breaking up
believe in metal gods, they will never stop

[BRIDGE / CHORUS]

Bodies are revvin' like wheels in the night
the mind gets delirious from power and light
a face fearing up all your senses to feel
if you don't believe in the flashes of steel

From here to eternity the stronger will survive
a human dynamo, kickin' and alive

[BRIDGE / CHORUS]
