[Words: Rettke]
[Music: Rettke, Paeth, Bilski]

Don't believe in the lies you told
you will never die with a heart of gold
stop pretending to be so brave
there'll be no diamonds within your grave

[BRIDGE:]
Here we are and stand to attention
here we are together again
here we are it's time to be mentioned
roaring like thunder
appears like a wonder
without any move
gonna get closer to you

[CHORUS:]
we're all waiting for the HEAVENS GATE
you know your time will come but don't be late
the key of love is always waiting for a smile
until the day I 'll die

Stop pretending to be a star
with a pretty face you won't get too far
watch the hills growing in your eyes
for a wasteful life you'll pay the price

[BRIDGE / CHORUS]

Dark light reactions is full life reflections
HEAVENS GATE wonder with lightning and thunder
it's got the power to trap and devour
searching for more we slip through that door

We're standing all together in paradise
when night comes down ready to paralyse
feel the heat
thunder and lightning is taking us up to the sky

[CHORUS]
