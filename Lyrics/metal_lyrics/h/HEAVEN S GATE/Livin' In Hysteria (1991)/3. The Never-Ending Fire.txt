In the begining of the medieval centuries
ten warriors of steel had been on
the path of glory to safe the ruined land
from an evil beast...

On their way back home, after a dreadful
fight, they 're chanting for the victims
they 're lost in the war...

But the fire still burns...

Forever they're fighting
on their way for the "HOLY SWORD"
together they're crying
for the victims they've lost in the war

[BRIDGE:]
For justice they had to die
and in their heart it burns
this feeling they got from a
never ending fire

There's thunder and lightning
on their way back home from that war
such glory so inviting
feeling sorrow in all of their hearts

[BRIDGE]
Together it makes them cry
and in their heart it burns
this feeling they got from a
never ending fire

There's thunder and lightning
in trust and hope they are riding
and in their hearts it burns
this feeling they got from a song

[CHOIR:]
We 're fighting here in this glory ride
for HOLY SWORD again
a proudly soul in a crying heart
we never have to shame

As the years pass by you can live and try
to forget about the past
for justice we call
we stand one for all
the HOLY SWORD is riding again
