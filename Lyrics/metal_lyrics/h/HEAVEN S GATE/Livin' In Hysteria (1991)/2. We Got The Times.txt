[Words: Rettke]
[Music: Rettke, Paeth, Bilski]

You wasted every day in those years before
only broken dreams you 're looking for
there will never be life guaranteed
if you don't believe you 're down on your knees

I could never understand
the way you live your life and take it all
but now you better realize you have to fall

[BRIDGE:]
But you will find a way
you had time enough to worry
watch out for the future
it has something to say :

[CHORUS]
we got the time
there's nothing left to talk about
we got the time
we're standing here forever more
we got the time
believin' we can work it out
listen there's no doubt about

Watch the time it's running down the drain
if you only live in sorrow and pain ????
now your time has come to break away

remember all those early days
you always struggled for a piece of truth
it's your responsibility for your misspent youth

[BRIDGE / CHORUS]
