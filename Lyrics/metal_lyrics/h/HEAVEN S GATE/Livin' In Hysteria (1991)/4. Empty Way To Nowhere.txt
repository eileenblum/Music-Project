[Words: Rettke]
[Music: Rettke, Paeth, Bilski]

The time is moving senses
the lights are dimming down
we set this town on fire
it's time to leave it now

[BRIDGE:]
The night is black, the wheels keep turnin'
we're driving down deserted roads
you must believing in this hard times' life
and we're standing here
and it sounds so clear

[CHORUS:]
We're on this empty way to nowhere
we live our life, we love that rock
we 're standing in the certain glory
watchin' the night wastin' and fadin' away

1.000 miles an hour
like with the speed of light
another place of power
is coming into sight

You say our life is bad and evil
but we just live it to the full
we're feelin' reckless as we hear you roar
and we're standin' here
and it sounds so clear

[CHORUS]

85 days on the road
nothing's been left and we're feelin' so cold
there is new power to charge
most every night we are taking it all,
taking it all

[BRIDGE / CHORUS]
