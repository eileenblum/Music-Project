[Words: Rettke]
[Music: Rettke, Paeth, Bilski]

You call us dirty, wild and evil
behind a dead end wall there's nothing left to see
we just need a chance to stop and break away
if you're blind and deaf you'll never realize what life could be

[BRIDGE]
Back's against the wall
standing one for all
fighting tooth and nail
there's no way we can fail
breaking all the rules
made for all the fools
can you hear a voice is calling you:

[CHORUS:]
WE WANT IT ALL
we take control
we do our best
reaching for the rest
WE WANT IT ALL
we rise, you fall
there's no way out
and there's no doubt about

We're always living in the shadow
ready for a deal, don't think about tomorrow
in a rebel's heart there is no place for love
crawling in the night we're waiting for a sign to start it up

Just one thing remains
poison in our veins
need a helping hand
I hope you understand
breaking all the rules
made for all the fools
can you hear a voice is calling you...

[CHORUS / BRIDGE / CHORUS]
