[Music:Rettke/Paeth - Words: Rettke]

The story of our lives
Fades away in memories
The spirits of all times
Living in our fantasies

Dreams are growing wild
In an innocent child

A world built up in sand
Without a broken lie
The future in their hands
And they don't know the reason why

They are playing their game
And no one is to blame

Within a world of dreams
They're keeping their own way
They don't know what it seems
When skies are always gray

Dreams are growing wild
In an innocent child

They are joyful
live their lives in happiness
They are faithful
and we are responsible for their fairy tales

And when the time has come
They are the only ones
There's just one thing to say
Come watch the children play
