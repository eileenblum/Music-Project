[music: Rettke/Paeth/Bilski - Words:Rettke]

Times running short for a deal
take your chances
make up your mind, time to heal
no romances

You're creeping in a desert valley
and waiting for the midas touch

[BRIDGE:]
Now your disgrace, you 're not
within a world of circumstances
you're locked up in an empty room
behind the door of a million chances
you're living in a world of doom

[CHORUS:]
Why live and die in a
terminated world
take your time
waitin' for tomorrow
the chains are breaking free

Born with the faith in your heart
you'll be leading

[BRIDGE / CHORUS]

Why, why we live and die
we live and die in a terminated world

[BRIDGE / CHORUS]
