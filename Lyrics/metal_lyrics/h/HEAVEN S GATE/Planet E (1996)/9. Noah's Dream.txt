[Music:Rettke/Paeth/Hunecke - Words: Rettke]

[Vocal intro:]
A lonely room
A covered world
The sun is drifting slowly
A dead end street
Behind the walls
Outside the rain keeps falling

The candlelight resists the storm
Dancing pictures on the wall
Close your eyes, make a wish
And then the sky begins to fall

In Noah's dream, in Noah's dream

Caught in a dream
No power and no choice
He rides with the wind
And feels his master's voice

I'm gonna drop this world
I'm tired and I'm blamed
Only a few will survive
Escaping from the rain
Build up a ship on a hill
Three will be on your side
Pick up a pair of all kinds
And then you'll start the ride of hope
Blistering winds tell no fairy tales

[BRIDGE:]
Screaming, howling, calling your name

[CHORUS:]
The power of your life is here to carry on
The toughness and ability
The faith is keeping strong
And we will carry on

Push by his faith
Heading for that deal
In spite of all disdain
He's making it for real

High in the skies
the ark built in blood
Insanity's ruling the world
Drowning in the flood

Who will be who on this trip
Love is a sip of simply privation
Over the land, sea and skies
He's searching and tries
to save every creature in the world
Blistering winds tell no fairy tales

[BRIDGE / CHORUS]

Deep in the night he's standing at the rail
Awaiting the light that leads him to a trail
A million voices rent the silent air
And in the dawn they're marching for their care

The animals went in two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The animals went in two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The animals went in two by two,
the wasp, the ant, and the kangaroo
And they all went into the ark
For to get out of the rain

The animals went in two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The animals went in two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The animals went in two by two,
the wasp, the ant, and the kangaroo
And they all went into the ark
For to get out of the rain

Deep in the jungle nobody cares
Easy to fight, nothing to share
Always abused and struggling for life
But here in this place there's nothing to hide

Rain, rain, rain
Lost soul in a lost horizon
Rain, rain, rain
Set me free
Rain, rain, rain
The fear of the darkness
Rain, rain, rain
Show us the way

Suddenly a place appears behind the walls of water
The wind calms down, the curtain of all fears is falling
White dove is flying around the sky, Is this a heavenly sign?
And now all are safe
Do they commit a crime?

The sun breaks his eyes
His mind is looking for clues
What happened in the night?
Who made the nightmare rules?

He walks down the lane
Heading for places he's been
Is this reality
or a dream within a dream?

Dreams have been tricking your soul
You play a role
That somebody's taking to your mind
Don't look behind
You slam the door
And keep out the sandman in your brain
Blistering winds tell no fairytales

[BRIDGE / CHORUS]
