[Music &amp; Words: Lisa C. Dalbello]

Tight security
Inside this zone
Crude obscenities
Sticks and stones
Friend or enemy

You and I are the same flesh and blood
We are animal

Drunk with savagery
Sweet to the taste
Brutalizing heat
Pick up the pace
Lay your hands on me

You and I are the same flesh and blood
We are animal

Dance with me, dance with me, forget my name
You don't speak my tongue, mais vous compremez
When we're skin to skin maybe we might say
We are flesh and blood

We are animal

Man hunt animal
Thrill of the chase
Trophy on the wall
Imperial race
Eloquent and powerful
All are one, we are all flesh and blood

We are animal

Dance with me, dance with me, Forget my name
You don't speak my tongue, but I know you understand me
When we're skin to skin maybe we might say
We are flesh and blood

We are animal
