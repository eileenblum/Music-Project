[Music:Rettke/Paeth/Hunecke - Words: Rettke]

Standing at the shore, the wind is blowing
fast with power
like a fortress wall the rain is smashing
pouring down
feelin' all alone and noone there to keep
me warm

Sun has turned into a black and frozen
peace of coal
in this poison gas no creature even can
survive
feeling all alone 'cause I'm the one who's
staying alive

[BRIDGE:]
I hear a voice from the dark, it says:
Dirty fools, look what we have done
frozen tears in a black hole sun

My heart is dying, my soul's gettin' cold
I never listened to warnings they told

[CHORUS:]
Planet Earth
please, forgive me
I'm mistaken
this heavens on earth is a crying shame
we have the choice to proclaim

Every day I watch the news, they say the
world is bleeding
we're responsible for every little peace of ground
hand in hand we have the chance to say it loud

[BRIDGE / CHORUS]
