[Music:Rettke/Paeth/Hunecke - Words: Rettke]

It's a long time ago when you had the feelin' to adore her
Did you know, did you know that it's a lie?
She was spreading into your life and tellin' she would love ya
Did you know it's cuttin' like a knife?

[BRIDGE:]
Every single touch, every word of mouth
now you know that she's been fakin'
All the dirty lies turned you inside out
Now it's up to you for breaking away

[CHORUS:]
Breaking the chain
Get away, she's back from the dawn
You're feeling the pain
Watch out!  Now she's back from the dawn

In a world of shattered dreams
You're trying to protect
Did you know she utilized your care?

[BRIDGE / CHORUS]

Foolish behavior is piercing my brain
Don't know the difference of pleasure and pain

There's no bed of roses
Just a bed of nails
No sense of security
in a love that never fails

[Repeat 1st verse / BRIDGE / CHORUS]
