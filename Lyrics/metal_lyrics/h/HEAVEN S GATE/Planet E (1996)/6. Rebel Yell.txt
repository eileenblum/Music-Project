[Music:Rettke/Paeth/Bilski - Words: Rettke]

Born into darkness
Never seen the sun that's shining on my head
Walking courageous
Never been the one who's feeling it's a shame

There's no barrier, there's no border
that could stop me, can you hear that
Rebel Yell

Black day surrounds me
There's no colored dream and story I could tell
Feels like a fortune
There's no color statement I could ever sell

Sounds of silence, need the distance
for the balance, can you hear that
Rebel Yell

Every single step of mine
Brings a shining glance into my eyes
Don't you know that it's a crime
If you gonna try to hypnotize

[Repeat 1st verse]
