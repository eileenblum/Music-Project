[Rettke/Bilski]

Drivin' down the avenue
and you hear that downtown melody
standing in that city heat
and you know that's your destiny

Feel the sound, watch the blood red lights
now your veins feel power, and you're hypnotized

[CHORUS:]
HOT FEVER
you've got that downtown love
HOT FEVER
it's burning inside out
HOT FEVER

Sound is firing up your blood
and your body makes a powerdive
you believe in metal gods
if you feel that mental overdive

for your mind it's a losing game
and your eyes are hot like a burning flame
