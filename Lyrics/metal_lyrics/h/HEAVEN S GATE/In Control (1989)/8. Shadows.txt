[Rettke]

As you were down again, you told me all those lies
and you know I've to pray
you're life is still a game, I waited for the price
and I know I've to pay

You've been a runaway, feeling as cold as ice
asked me if you could stay, I felt like been hypnotized
heaven will know, know the reason why
you never showed that sorrow in your eyes

You told me those lies that you'd make a turn
but I could see in your eyes that you never would learn

[CHORUS:]
IN THE SHADOW, shadow of your life
IN THE SHADOW, you could not deny
when you're drunk you were lost, and you're having no way
something is even to say
IN THE SHADOW
of your life

Now that you've gone away I look at the morning sun
all night long I move and stray thinking of things we've done
heaven will know, know the reason why
you had to go on broken wings up the sky
