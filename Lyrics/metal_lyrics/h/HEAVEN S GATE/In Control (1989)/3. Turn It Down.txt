[Rettke/Bilski]

We're gonna rock you if your metal hunger burns
drive into your heads with a 100.000 turns
if you are made for metal, so raise your fist and yell

Can't you hear, it sounds so clear
in my ears there's a voice
WE'LL NEVER GIVE IT UP!

Come here and stay, we'll blow the night away
there's magic in the air
you're strong enough, you've got it, don't be tough
and you scream

[CHORUS:]
TURN IT DOWN
bang your head
TURN IT DOWN
straight ahead

You love that power and you know it's no disgrace
metal is the best we've invented for the human race
you're rising up to heaven and never come back to
the ground

We wanna hear your calling
when our sound fills the air
and when the night is falling
we are together, forever
we are together and we
TURN IT DOWN
