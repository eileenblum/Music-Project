[Rettke]

You think you have the right suspicion
each move you make is in control
you won't believe it's like a vision

what do you feel? Is this the price you'll pay?
Some say they heal, they guide your steps
in other ways

[CHORUS:]
In Control
See that it's real
In Control
It's a dirty nightmare
In Control

The world is changing face and body
corrupted minds are gaining ground
if you won't change, they'll have the glory

Try to beware from now to eternity
wake up and watch those cold blue eyes and died
blond hair

You're waiting for the last command
to destroy your promised land
the mighty will be satisfied
when you've killed your fellows right
don't make no stranger of body and soul
feel all the danger, you're under control
breakin' the grip, makes no difference at all
fight for the rights of all colors you call
