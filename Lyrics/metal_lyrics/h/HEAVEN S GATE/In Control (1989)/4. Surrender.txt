[Rettke/Bilski]

Face to face, an eye for an eye
guess I'm leaving this town forever
want to break free from all those old lies
we're living too long together

Just can't stand it or face more of the same
I've got the choice to stay or to leave
watching our dreams go down the drain
saying goodbye to what I believed

defences were down, you're willing to go anywhere
but now the future is over, say you never cared

[CHORUS:]
I SURRENDER
never coming back
I SURRENDER
never looking back

I'm not down, I'm breaking these chains
taking some time to watch the sunrise
life will never be the same again
now I know it's been a matter of lies

It's taking me high
I'm leaving this town, yes I'm free now,
I'm leaving, I'm watching the sky
