[Rettke/Bilski/Muller/Jordan]

I tell a story of a man, his name is IRON SWORD
he wants to safe the ruined land,
he's a courageous lord
he's on his way, when he will lose his life he cannot say

he's escorted by a crowd of men, ten warriors of steel
they're breaking through the ice and wind, like a burning wheel
they wanna fight, ride on a flash of light

[CHORUS:]
They sit all alone and they can watch the iron tower
they all strive for fame and they are riding on the
PATH OF GLORY

Now they attack the fortress and they're looking 'round in fright
no king is sitting on the throne, a beast they have to fight
they wanna go, knowing that they're standing all alone

The evil force is on attack, they hear the devil's bell
there is no way to turn back, it's coming out of hell
taking their minds, hell and fire makes them blind

[CHORUS:]
They sit all alone and they can feel the flash and thunder
no way to escape, they have to cry

From the back there comes a light
the holy sword is entering the fight
iron fist breaks the evil's soul
iron sword is leading on the
PATH OF GLORY
