in the darkenss
i awaken
as once again
beneath the cover of the night sky
we indulge
in aliance of sathanas
the infinity
pounding at dawn
where shadows fear tread
as dark envokes me
i vow to thee
for my enemies shalt suffer
for we are the brave
i have eternity
in which we shalt dwell
dying ****"

deep in the forest...

deep in the spell...

drink deep in the promise of the midnight

To dream of secrets, and desires in witch craft

Immortal, Salvation, I bleed the sky, for he rythes upon the cross, bleeding the Jewish lies
