Within the bells of eternity chiming, darkness takes us still
We partake now each others indulgence, according to our will

The tears are the same as they struggle to blame
Congregation shall be burnt to the ground
For the fictions of insanity are holiest hypocrisy
Suffocating now without a sound

I hear you now from a thousand voids
Removed from time and timelessness
Where incarnations of simple nouns
Are beings each with golden crowns
Out beneath the open night
A wanderer lies weeping
In some unspoken sadness
While her dream is oversleeping
Her dreams ablazed with accursed fire
Of regret and eternal vigils
Hallowing nights, temptations lust
Compiled of satanic sigils

Death will come as sudden
By the magik of our Coven
The ultimate horror is told
I stand alone and solemn
In the presence of Amon
I am sacrifice slowly going cold

Dreams ablazed with accursed fire
Of regret and eternal vigils
Hallowing nights, temptations lust
Compiled of satanic sigils

Out beneath the open night
A wanderer lies weeping
In some unspoken sadness
While her dream is oversleeping

Demand the dreams macabre
The danse macabre
