From the darkest kaos from beyond this time 
I shall free my wings as our souls align 
Mortal barriers are falling in crippling time 
In the moonlighting darkness, the garden divine 

For invoking the dark, and the blood of its Lord 
It shall punish the weak with its bestial sword 
The innocent blood sacrificed in the night 
Within darkness comes rapture in beautiful sight 

Feel the midnight's pull 
The answers to darkness and dreams in full 
For only as eternity unfolds 
Lie the secrets within a funeral toll 

Slain by the hand too close to see 
Prism in their eyes for eternity 
Blessedly fading for all to see 
Painting a picture of hypocrisy 

Fraying at the edges of sanity 
Beneath its surface a part of me 
Unleash the tyrant from within 
For no face can see beneath this opaque mask of deadened time 
Image that emerges through the wrath and pain combined 
Silken dreams of Avalon where shadows dwell for all time 

As a demon I roar 
Within the fabric of thoughts 
My purpose an anchor 
And exhale my spirit into the night air 
Stained as I fall beneath my shroud 
And my flesh anointing tribute to the proud 
In a breath from an everless nightfall enshadowed thee 
Fore I am forever as eternity chants its chivalry 
As a silhouette in the night 
Not of this world of within sunlight 
Fore only as eternity unfolds 
Lie the secret within a funeral toll
