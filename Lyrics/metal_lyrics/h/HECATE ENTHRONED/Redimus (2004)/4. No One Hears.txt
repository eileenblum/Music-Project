Night draws near - I appear
For his life you now fear
Cloaked by the dark, taking form - hidden
In the shadows I do dwell - hidden
As the holy son rests peacefully
Totally unaware of my being
His life now in my hands
His life is worthless
The time to alter the future is almost upon me
Altering
Now you die - how you cry
Worthless life now destroyed
Day appears - no more fears
Nazarene - no one hears
