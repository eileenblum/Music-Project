Years of holdbacks, years of strife
Some wasted time, some wasted life
A look to the future for all positive thoughts
The past is exactly that
Right here - right now
A coiled spring
Against the odds, against the grain
Like the worm, halved but alive
Immortal thoughts
We are here to stay
Now and forever
The truth is revealed, encased for all to see
The shining delight
A monument to longevity
