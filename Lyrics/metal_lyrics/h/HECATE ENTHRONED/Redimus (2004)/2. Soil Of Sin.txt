I awaken
Apprehension and excitement engulf me
For today is the day
The expedition of indulgence
How long have I waited
My voyage to be the soil of sin
Knowing of delights untold
Thoughts are racing, mind reflecting
Time becomes non-existent
To the soil of sin I long to be
Where my black heart can now lie
Lost, lost, I struggle to find my way
Roaming the land I seek the unholy ground
Panic, panic, lost, lost
Lost in a place I know not of - Limbo
I see the light
Attracted I venture closer
Knowing of my earthly delights
Home is the soil of sin
