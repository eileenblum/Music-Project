Torn from the shadows drawn into my head
The powers I seek have been stolen from the dead
From being watched I take control
The temple of perversion shall be my home
I see them - the demons
That grimace just for me
The powers they bestow upon me I embrace
Watching over my sacred soul all my life
Saved by the evil that controls all my life
Perversity - blasphemy - atrocity - humanity
Sacrifice human life
Slaying all in my sight
Now as I see I can be what I am
Blasphemy in my eyes, blasphemy in my life
Now as I see I can be what I am
Angels cry, demons rise for my soul
Take control
