See them run from this place
Through the dark, no escape
I am here, and I rule now
Lives are perished, life is cherished
Beautiful sights
I am here and I rule now
Join me my brothers in my dark ways
The future is bright and gone are the gray days
The last of the sheep are finally hunted
No more remaining and no more wanted
The earth now finally cleansed of the scum
No more the weak, the afraid and the dumb
The planet of Satan my work now done
The cross is inverted, believe holy son
The earth now finally as it should be
No more the reign of hypocrisy
The planet of Satan now rebuilt by me
The cross is inverted - eternally
You cannot deny an eternal belief
