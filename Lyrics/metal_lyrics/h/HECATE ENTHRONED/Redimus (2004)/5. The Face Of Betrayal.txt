As you hang upon the cross
The lies are already there
More of an unholy cult
The face of betrayal
No real truths, just more lies
Millions sucked in
How could a man of love let this happen?
How could a man of love be this deceitful?
How could a man of love not giveth?
And how could a man of love taketh away?
You are not my lord - pathetic illusion
Preaching self-deceit, not a fiber of truth
I see your face - I vision the true evil
I see a waste of what life is
Fuck you Jesus Christ
You are no lord of mine
