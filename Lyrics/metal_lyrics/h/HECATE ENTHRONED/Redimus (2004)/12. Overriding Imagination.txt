Perishing, withering
Mind unable to comprehend
A temporary state or euphoria
Brought on by all the mentally wrong
The last brick in the window
All light is shunned
A new consciousness now born
One of warm content
Grinning with glee, all that I see
No pain, no misery
Pathways exposed, mind explored
For what cost?
Sanity escaped
Brain malfunction
Overriding imagination
Nothing is right, all is wrong
I feel like hell itself
For every good deed there is an evil
Will I remember tomorrow?
Or is this another life?
The invaders come for me
Foretold in revelations
Untruly lost for words
And caught somewhere in time
The prophecy that I have seen
Is the silent assassin
Brain malfunction
