Lies,
In the end you can't disguise
What awaits you all and I
The truth is before your eyes
The gates open wide
Sinners, lost souls, bastards, join us now
Why?
Lead on by your faith, you're blind
The secrets you've kept will blind
You with the horde riding high
Your fate lies with me
Stand tall
Slaughter, kill them all, blood on my hands
Have no fear, as your death is nigh
The waves of hate reigning down
Man's wrath, as old as time
Relish in blood of me
No more Christian, no more Muslim
Kill religion - Judaism
Kill the mother and the father
Kill the priest - holy man
If you believe, that we are all sinners and going to hell
As fire, raging, burning, hate runs through me
Release thy demons
