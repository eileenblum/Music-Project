The mind war rages
Truthful thoughts deemed inappropriate
Silence is golden
The path to a peaceful world
The way of the weak
Incompetence is all I see
As much use as your dead god
It's no wonder I fucking hate
Like a cyst you grow, soon to be cut off
Cut off from your mortal coil
I understand how the mind war rages
I choose misanthropy - this is my name
I choose misanthropy - this is my peace
Without solitude a real war would rage
However mortal laws in power
The beast must be tamed for now
But soon enough I will unleash my grand finale
My visions of what soon shall be are dark and sinister
My visions of what soon shall be are devastating in effect
