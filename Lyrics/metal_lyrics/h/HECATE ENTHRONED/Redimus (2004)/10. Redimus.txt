Within my mist filled eyes, utopia lies
Look through my vacant stare
I yearn to wonder there
I shall now rise above you all
Passion inside to destroy
Yet through these years I have stayed (too long?)
I hate today again
You won't break me
Through these eyes, I won't cry
With these hands, I must fight
All I'll give is the hurt that you gave to me
It's but only time
Hold unto me what's mine
Fuck you and your kind - evermore
It is coming
Your venom won't stop us
Our onslaught relentless
They have tried, they won't win
The passion is too deep
Redimus - We return
