How the time
Has worn on
Reflecting life
And future
Decisions made
Past and present
Where I stand
Is at the peak

And here I am ruler
And here I stand King
The right things done
Satan guides me

A life's worth more than life's worth to
You, king of the Jews

I learned your lies and I learned the truth
I learned your creed and I learned your noose
I learned your lies and I learned your ways
I saw your blood and I saw your death

I taught your lies and I taught my ways
I taught my kin and I taught him sin
I taught about hate and about intolerance
I spoke of honesty, I spoke of truth

A life more than, than your life
A life's more than a life's worth to
You, king of the Jews
