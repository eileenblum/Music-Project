Blind to the wisdom that hides within
The face of the baleful azure sky
Mysteries bound beyond counting
Within infernal sanctuaries

I reach out to grasp the shackles and 
tear them from my withered skin

Awake now from this slavery
Taste of this infinity
To destroy the bloody chains
To deny the pillars of being

Primordial chaos incarnate
I wander through the heavens' vastness
All before me shall I lay waste
Unto the end of all

All before me shall I lay waste

As I apporach the heavens' gate,
slaked in the blood of christ,
I embrace this damnation,
flood my body with divine scorn

Paths wrought from the skin of angels
Alone shall I walk
Through the empyrean
And so I descend to
The silent watchers
Beyond the gates of dawn
