Screams of the goddess
Echo through me, my soul torn
Unending, deathless
The memory of illusionary thorns

Awakening beneath the cursed ground
Rising through the depths of lifeless stone
Ancient cruelty, forgotten beauty
Intertwined through satanic litany

Monarchs of destructions
Shall blot out the barren stars
Reigning for untold aeons
Upon thrones of shadow

A new age dawns above
The blackened earth
The weak shall tremble
All shall fall before our wrath

Death to the tribes of Judah
I shall exalt in their demise

Awakening beneath the cursed ground
Final voice of prophecy
Ancient cruelty, forgotten beauty
Resurrected eternally
I shall fear no enemy
Before your malign faces three
Dark mother of witchcraft
At the crossroads shall we meet
