Auguries of disease have
finally come to pass over this world
In clouds rampant pestilerous death
raining down from the skies
Crowds gasping for air as 
the abhorrence takes hold
I am as one with the pestilence,
bestowing this final gift

Sewing contagion amongst
the helpless flock
Mercilessly I am scourge
to man and beast alike
Their feeble shepherd writhes,
his skin blistered and cold
I am the death of God,
plageous black salvation

The earth I defile
Extinction of the human race
Satan's will unfurled

Plagued by black death

Poison seeps through the veil,
the absence between the worlds
Plunging doomed the
lands into eternal night
Power unrivalled,
anticosmic darkness unbridled
Purification through all
pervading nightfall's vines

Plagued by black death

As the seraphim cease their song
With the heavens collapsing around them
Behold, the emptiness of the lightless sky
Behold, the majesty of pestilential death

Behold the emptiness of the lightless sky
A vast unmoving expanse
Behold the majesty of pestilential death
And the contamination of all life
