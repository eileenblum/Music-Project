A sickness is breeding here
Within the soils of this world
Creation reduced to tarnished silver,
Accumulation's hollow child
Following greed sullied parables
They build on works of corruption
Raising the towers of Babel
On the backs of mindless men

Cleansing flame shall descend
The burning tongues of Phlegethon
In the name of our dark lord
Shall their blood feed the river's flow

Staring into their eyes
Nothing but emptiness
My blade shall be answer
As it falls through their flesh

Your gold and silver is tainted
And their rust shall bear witness
Your lives and deeds wasted
And your legacy is dust
The blood of billions stains the earth
None shall escape the fires
Of the infernal goddess' kiss
Humanity scattered,
they march into the abyss
