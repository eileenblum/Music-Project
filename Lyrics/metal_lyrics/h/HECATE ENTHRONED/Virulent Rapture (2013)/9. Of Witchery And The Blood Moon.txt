As the sun sets I cast off
My waking flesh as it dissolves
Into ether the bonds that
Chain me here

Hear my call and guide my hand,
Hear these words of adoration
Blood of the witch awakens
Ever seeking promethean light
Illumination
Darkness' promise revealed
The eyes of Hecate
Tearing through the veil

Manifold are the mysterious
Blessings of the sevenfold curse
The key to immortality
Her insidious harvest

Down the generations I can feel her presence
Encircling my body claim my soul for your own

From the black, come forth
And light the roads to the underworld

Tea rmy skin and drink of my blood
Reduce me to nothingness

To know sheer antinomian will
To dare to lose yourself in it's depth

From the black, come forth
Cloak me and light the roads to the underworld
