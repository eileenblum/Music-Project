I see behind the screams
Bore into their stricken minds
Labyrinthine passages of smoke
Consumed by madness divine

Ecstasy from misery, unholy sorcery
Chance to recapture
Monarchy and cruelty, transcendent blasphemy
My virulent rapture

Mundane human suffering
Will not sustain me long
Inflicting my own terrors
Upon banquet shall I gorge

Ecstasy from misery, unholy sorcery
Chance to recapture
Monarchy and cruelty, transcendent blasphemy
My virulent rapture

Feeding on torturous horrors
My pain bloated face smiles
Parasite and the victim
Living is their only crime

Condemned to their tepid world
But on their pain I thrive
Infinite the moment for me
So old ravaged by time

Born and ruled as king
Now ermine swapped for rags
Dethroned and cast out
Their pain my pathway back

Condemned to their tepid world
But on their pain I thrive
Infinite the moment for me
So old ravaged by time

Ecstasy from misery, unholy sorcery
Chance to recapture
Monarchy and cruelty, transcendent blasphemy
My virulent rapture

Condemned to their tepid world
But on their pain I thrive

Born and ruled as king,
their screams my pathway back
