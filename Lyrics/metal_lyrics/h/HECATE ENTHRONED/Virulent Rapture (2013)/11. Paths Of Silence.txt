Lost is the straight path
To the edges of consciousness
Gates of horn and ivory
Crown a lake of bitterness

Wraiths line the fields of this hell
Consumed with vain regret
Blind worms ignorant
Of knowledge in the self

These madmen and lepers
Do themselves condemn
In dreams of abberration
Drowning insipid vermin
Is there nothing beyond?

Is there nothing before me?
Radiance of the void
Dis staring back at me

Purify the vessel
In darkness pain no more
Open my weary eyes
Smash the gates to the abyss

The only apotheosis is bloody tears
And the wretched laughter of the gods

Flame surrounds me
Raging columns burn
Circles of the dead
By the light of the seven pointed star

Hidden in secret ciphers and edicts of fire
Spectres reappear and fade
As I rend the branches
of the tree of death
Lost in sorrow and
forgotten desire

Sacred night enshroud my soul as
offering to the who
dwells beyond
I am become timeless amongst
you, as I embrace the silence
