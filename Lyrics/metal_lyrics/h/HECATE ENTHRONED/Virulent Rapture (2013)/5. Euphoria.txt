As the visions burn...
As my skin turns cold...
I clench my bloodied fist
And the knife carves my wrist

Wracking my body
In ecstasy
Liberation in extremis

Reflected in mirrors
Despair's divine image

Crystal tained
Crimson flows
Liberation in extremis

Lost in the grip of euphoria
As my life's blood is shed
As the knife
Tastes flesh
Exalted broken wretch

Lost in the grip of euphoria
As my life's blood is shed

My will turned to hate
My malice turned to bliss
Nausea flooding my senses as
My wounds quiver and beg for more

'Ere the sun rises
I will breathe no more

Suicide sacrifice
Abhorred truth of demise
No journey into the
Reachless skies
