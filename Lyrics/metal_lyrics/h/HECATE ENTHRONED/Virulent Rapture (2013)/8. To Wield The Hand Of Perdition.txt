Here in the dark of the godless depths
Eternally I dwell
Long ago forsaken to
Lie and burn in fire
Castigation my soul binds
To the demonic winds
I am born as the planets align
At long last unconfined

Subterranean swarm
Sulphurous hordes
Satanic carrion calls
Slouching towards War

Grant me their pain, grant me their unending suffering
As my legions carve through them in howling torment
Grasping for their skulls I kill, bodies fall before my will
I denounce their master as I walk over their corpses

I shall drink the messiah's blood and lay his arrogance low
His broken body pitiful sacrament to maggots
His effigies crushed to dust ,from this day abandoned
I shall destroy these mortal lands, razing them to the ground

And so I cast my arm to the North, and hell roams close behind
Raising high my throne adorned with entrails, flame and bone
Rejecting divine falsehood, I shall become the sun's bane
Through communion with the dark lord I shall rule this dominion

Grant me their pain.
