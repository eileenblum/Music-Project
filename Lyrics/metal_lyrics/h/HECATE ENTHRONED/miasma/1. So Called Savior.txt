From such early days on
I always knew there was a difference
Unlike so many others
Their bigoted minds
Discriminated constantly
But we'll eventually see
What the future holds
I am ready to die

So called Savior
Watch my ascension
So called Savior
See my elation

The seeds were planted
During the formative years
But I saw the truth
I saw the lies for what they were
Its just a dying pity
You couldn't do the same
You irrelevant life
Has no meaning at all

So called Savior
See my elation
So called Savior
Watch my ascension

Now your falling
Now your falling

How your falling
How your falling

You stand silent
You stand silent

You keep silent
You keep silent
