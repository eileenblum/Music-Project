...and angels wither and die
Death raining from the sky
The sheep are now with warning
Miasma all around

Air thickens with fear
Death grows near
All blanketing me
All I see

The flock they are restless
They lead to the way
The way of the doomed
Leading them all astray
Into the miasma
One my one they'll slay
Destroying deceivers
Starting a new day

New day emerges
Dark new era
Dark new era
New day emerges
New day emerges

Feel the power
Feel the power

Dark new era
Dark new era
New day emerges
Dark new era
Dark new era
New day emerges
New day emerges

Aura filling all around
One by one without a sound
Beckoning towards their death
Holy flock one final breath

And it destroys all the deceivers and betrayers without mercy
The evil inside is the ultimate power
A new day emerges

The morning mist beckons
It calls out my name
The morning miasma
Leaving all slain
It raped all their virtues
It raped all their hopes
Destroyed all their dream
Destroyed all that false
