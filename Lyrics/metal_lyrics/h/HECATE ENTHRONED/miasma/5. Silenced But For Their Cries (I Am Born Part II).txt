The clouds gather
The dark skies loom
The thunder claps
A life filled tomb

Life filled tomb

The earth that we once knew
Defunct, desolate in view
Disease and death abound
This era I am crowned

The mortals run in fear
Their lives soon disappear
Saved from a life of lies
Silenced but for their cries

But for their cries
But for their cries

Now I'm crowned
Now I'm crowned

Now I'm crowned
Now I'm crowned

Just as I saw, by his Majesty's law
Now I'm crowned
Now I'm crowned

Lifeless / extinct
