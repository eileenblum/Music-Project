Behold after silent prayers
Changing the souls direction
By praising those of the dark
A new strength emerges
A strength designed with hate
Controlled to destroy all enemies
And now your time has come
Your futures non existent

And the voice says..
Do it - do it - do it - do it

Raging
Seething
Waiting
Should I?

Waiting
Seething
Raging

Before the dark paved the way
A darkened heart shaded grey
As time elapsed transformed jet black
Now's the time ready for attack

Ready for attack
Ready for attack

Feel the nails - tearing through flesh
Gasp for air - ribs collapsing
Wear the crown - unworthy holy
Feel the pain - all unholy

Your pain is my pleasure
You suffering is my delight

Wear the crown - unworthy holy
Feel the pain - all unholy

Thank you dark lords my soul I shall give
My strength from you, my will to live
My path is chosen I've seen the way
The hatred inside that wont go away
Thank you dark lords my soul I shall give
My strength from you, my will to live
My path is chosen I've seen the way
The hatred inside that wont go away
