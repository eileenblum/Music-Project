Find your place in punishment to stay
With the fires of ills to light your way
Without faith you are not to be sparred
Of what's to be endured when there

Sentenced to the wrath of God
Stripped of holy staff and divine rod
Without grace now sent naked as a child
None are to be left here undefiled

Haunted by the visions that I've found
Preyed upon with every shadow's sound
Lurking in fear behind the smoke
I've entered to a kingdom without hope

Your curse as little say as never bending
Yet still the hunger be without ever ending

And so once are you fed with long spoons
Now starving as awaiting your doom
And so once are you fed with long spoons
Now starving as awaiting your doom

I thought I'd found my way
But still I'm lost
Damned here as now I stay
Denied the cross

Without belief in God
I've found myself at odds
Now I must pay the price
...no paradise
