After the spirit of the living ghosts
And all the treasures that their bodies host
Their bloodless vessel it will never die
Still it screams when it is skinned alive

Make them diamonds, bring me gold
And all the treasures that their bodies hold

I've come to take away your lucky bones
Worth far more than any precious stones

Make them diamonds, bring me gold...

Invisible spirit thinner than air
I still seek to find you there
Limbless inhuman you know my name
And all the reasons for which I have came

And when given to the land
Ashes ground into the sand
Splinters piercing through the crust
Spreading thinly to the dust

I am blinded in the dead of night
Yet with your eyes I'm given second sight
With just a portion of a curing limb
I'll find the fortune hidden in your skin

Just like previous stones... are your lucky bones...
