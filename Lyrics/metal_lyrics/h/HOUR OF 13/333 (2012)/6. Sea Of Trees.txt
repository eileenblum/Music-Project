Risen from the ice and caverns
The swim among the sea of trees
Alone before yet now of many
Hear them whisper in the breeze

Ignore the signs
And soon you'll find
A presence of those left to die

They're waiting here just for you...

In the forest walls and the volcanic stone
You have found your way never to be alone
