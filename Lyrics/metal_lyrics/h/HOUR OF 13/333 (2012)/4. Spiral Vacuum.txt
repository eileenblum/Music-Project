I grow tired of the mainstream
Need to walk a different path
By left hand I sojourn my dreams
Between the future and the past

Circling downward in a spiral
Like a vacuum to a hole
The other side a new dimension
Where I can see into my soul

Beyond the darkness that awaits here
I am familiar to the dusk
A pleasure is released with my fear
Only pain to feed the lust
