Across the path beyond the misty oak
A shape of evil shrouded in black cloak
The chant of rites invoke a spell of gain...
Rites of samhain

The fires raise my burnt scent of plight
As my soul is reborn on this samhain night
Master of hades join us in our praise
As we vow in league with the dead we raise

Beckons me to follow
Into the black hollow

The death knell tolls a glorious sound
As figures from hell writhe among the ground
The sacred blood is spilled once again...
Rites of samhain

Call on the night to bring the sulphur souls
And call the ways the nostalgic old
A flash of light the master rears its head
And from the ground arise his mass undead

Beckons me to follow
Into the black hollow

Sinners one with the cloven sire
Raise up the flames of samhain fire
