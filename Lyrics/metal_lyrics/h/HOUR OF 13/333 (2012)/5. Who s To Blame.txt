Led into temptation by the disobedient son
I can't be responsible for anything that I might have done
Persuaded by a host I'm too weak to ignore
His messenger has pit into me with his thorn
I'm under an influence that puts me in sway
Compelled by another rule I'm not the one to be blamed

No fault of my own
These actions I can't control
Something else taken hold

Despite it all in the end I've no consequence
I'm much too foolish and naive to have common sense

No fault of my own
These actions I can't control
Something else taken hold

So who's to blame... so who's to blame...
It's hard for me, sometimes to see
What's wrong or right, I don't know why

Despite it all in the end I've no consequence
I'm much too foolish and naive to have common sense

No fault of my own
These actions I can't control
Something else taken hold

Led into temptation by the disobedient son
I can't be responsible for anything that I might have done
