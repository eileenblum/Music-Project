Thrown their bodies to the fire
Like a living obit pyre
Hair and skin is set to flame
Echoing the wails of pain

The master offers no relief
Suffer for eternity
God has judged you in hell you'll stay
For all your sins you now must pay

Once you pass on through the gate
With its closing seal your fate
From this world there's no return
In the inferno now you burn

The master offers no relief
Suffer for eternity
God has judged you in hell you'll stay
For all your sins you now must pay

In realms of sorrow
Woe with each tomorrow
Rue at times forever
Quarter comes for you once never

The master offers no relief
Suffer for eternity
God has judged you in hell you'll stay
For all your sins you now must pay

No longer favored
Sinful behavior
Divorced from salvation
Into damnation
A lake of sulphur, drowning in the discarded
Bound in the brimstone, heavens departed
