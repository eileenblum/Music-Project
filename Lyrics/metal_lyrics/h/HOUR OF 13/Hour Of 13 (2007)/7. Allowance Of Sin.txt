Ritual commence. the ceremony begins
Sacrament to secen of seven sins
Bearer of light, empower thee with pride
Unbroken by the wheel at Lucifer's side
Rebel son spread to me your greed
Mammon bathe where bodies do not seethe
Allow my lust keep from fire and burning stone
Asmoday my prince bow at your throne
Leviathan I worship your envy
Warm cold waters that baptize me
Beelzebub great liege of he flies
If I'm to gorge may not be pests I dine
If by wrath I was turn to take avenge
Satan not it be a quatering meet my end
Belphegor if let to lotus be
Allooweth not devoured by serpentine
Welcome embrace the evil within
Grand accord allowance of sin
Announted in infinite than twice
As given way the gratis to vice

Ritual commence. the ceremony begins
Sacrament to seven of seven sins
Bearer of light empower thee with pride
Unbroken by the wheel at Lucifer's side
Welcome embrace the evil within
Grand accord allowance of sin
Anointed in infinite than twice
As given way the gratis to vice
In tort as text proclaimed by holy word
To will one this way is something of absurd
Sex and avarice, anger, idleness
Excess, jealousy,, pretense and vanity
Delight in excess all I can consume
God can't pass judgement in the ritual room
Carnal abandon reviled in heresy
Surfeit abounds before the blasphemy
