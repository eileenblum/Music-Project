Once a time when lead afield
And left abandoned to fend
Let a pebble find a way
Weather washed the trail to an end

The young are callow
An easy lure fooled into fantasy
There's no return for the left behind
And not a way from the thick

Tempt is easy when is without one
Becomes unwise to the trick

The young are callow
An easy lure fooled into fantasy

Their tender minds
Take in no discern to the grim of reality

Where do the hungry turn
There's nothing to fall to the feast
On the stray the witches ready
When in convenant of the beast

The young are callow
An easy lure fooled into fantasy

Their tender minds
Take in no discern to the grim of reality

The young are callow
An easy lure fooled into fantasy
