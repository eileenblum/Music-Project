I see her walking all alone
On her way between her school and home
I see her as she passes by
Now I have the chance I'll make her mine
Suddenly she disappears
The reason no one is quite clear
As if she canished from this world
No one knows just where's the missing girl
Finders are the keepers
So it sowed by the reapers
Mine for the taking steal her sou just
As her little heart is breaking
At their feet she now rests beneath
In my backyard her body burned and scarred
Can it be they're just too blind to see
Right in front of them she now belongs to me
Her innocence is all that I would need
In trade for a chance at immortality
A life it seems more than a fair exchange
For all the strength in turn that will be gained

For Satan be a sacrifice
The ritual of power has it's price
Her vestal claret make me strong
No one will miss when she is gone

It's always said the devil that he has his due
Hell be paid in full before the end of day i through
A life it seems to be more than faith exchange
For all the strength in turn that will son be gained
Suddenly she disappears
The reason why no one is clear
As if she canished from this world
No one knows where's the missing girl
Paint the wall with her blood as the cursing of God above
Raping desecrating corpse
For what it is worth I've no remorse
