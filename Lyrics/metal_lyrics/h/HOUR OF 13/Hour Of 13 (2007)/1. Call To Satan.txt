Oh Shining one of vicious base
Wicked beast of brethren blame
Come great serpent of the paradise
Lucifer the lord of lies
Come at once with evil wrought
Power of air to whom I sought
Watch me bleed before the flame
Tempter of unpure be thy name
Stand before false angels light
Risen from the depths of might
Arch of dwelling ascent to fore
And bring with it all darkling hordes

From the abyss please hear thy call
Lord and master ruler of all
God of age hear what I sing
King of the darkness in everything

Oh Satan the adverse one
Slanderer of favored son
Oh great hero of hopeless ruin
Bring your wickedness and doom

From the abyss hear thy call
Lord and master ruler of all
God of Age hear that I sing
King of the dark in everything
...king of the dark in everything

Light the candles in thirteen
At each side than in between
In the circle here I stand
Naked in wait in the pentagram
With sacred blade self mutilate
To my own wounds I masturbate
In a sweat and semen soaked
Surroundedhaze of incense smoke
An offering whose bowels be let
It's carcass placed on chantry set
In spoken tongues the songs I sing
Along with these solemn bells to ring
...king of the dark in everything
