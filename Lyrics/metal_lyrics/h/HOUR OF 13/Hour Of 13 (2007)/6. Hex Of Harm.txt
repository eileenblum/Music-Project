We ask the devil bring forth them pain
With sorrow and sighs and mickle shame
Willed to destroy all the habit hold
All the consorts and family that in fold
Little good shall come to fore
Of all the rest of years to score
Damning all for all in time
Those against thy path align

Call to thy aster do thine bid
Suffer unto them as they may live
And if by the cancer that they should die
Tormend their souls in simple rhyme

Let you and yours that future may find
Upon each and everyone uncounted times
A jinx that is carried to all and for all
With this hex I will the devil to call

Suffer the written all in this dark vow
Bringer of harm to come forth on them now
And if they let pass in a span without tear
Have drawn down upon them a muster of fear
With only a passing and whisper of words
In hopes of casting to them withthis curse
For all of the wicked that they have all done
And of the foulsome they now have become

Little good shall come to fore
Of all the rest of years to score
Damning all for all in time
Those against thy path align
