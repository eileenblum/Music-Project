A crude light blinds my eyes
As to forbid me to see the world behind
Screams splitting my ears
This strange beat resounding in my chest

This red liquid is burning my veins
This fluid they call life
Each breath's burning my throat
If I knew I'd wish not to bor

Looking at me as inquisitors
Trying to read my mind
These strange faces seem so familiar
But I can't tell you why

Who?
Who am I?
And you?
Who are you?

I'm their creautre, I'm their toy
Their machine
Their child

I'm born when they wanted to
It will be the same thing
When I'll die

Scientific experiences
Not thinking about consequences

Born from unknown origin
The first of a new race
Will I ever get a place into this world?
