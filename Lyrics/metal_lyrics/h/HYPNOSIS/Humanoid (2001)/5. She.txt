Walking down the street
Alone among the mass
I thought that was a dream
When she appeared to my sight

In front of me she was
Wrapped in a veil of light
I knew I had to tell her
But no sound came from my mouth

Her eyes in mine were drowned
No need to touch or speak
I knew she was the one
But she didn't know who I was

She's my first emotion
She's the love in motion
She's the beauty
But I'm the beast
