Her face is shining through the night
Companion of my loneliness
Agony's coming from inside
Is leading me to eternal rest

From nowhere to nowhere
How long is the way?
Fron nowhere to nowhere
Yet I know the way

Killing the result of your works
That's your son that you kill
But I don't want to hear your reasons
I'm so fed up with living

I was condemned before my birth
So different from human beings
Never considered as a brother
So different, yet the same

Time passes by, nothing changes
Night will come after every day
Men will not change
Killing themselves a little more
Every day

Secret...
Betrayal...
Lies...
This was my life
I was not supposed to exist

This is the end of a story My story
This is the end of my life
I maybe thought I could be a man
But I never thought I was a machine
Men maybe thought they could be gods
Men maybe thought they could create mechines...
...Towards the point of no return
