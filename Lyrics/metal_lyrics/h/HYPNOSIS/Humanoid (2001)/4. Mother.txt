Born from the brain
Of self-called wise men
Scientists is their name
For military use
They created us
Our destiny was sealed
Brothers with the same faces
The same software as brain

Part human, part machine
Born from the sperm of man
A cell divided
In thousands and thousands
An army for the fight

They've blanked my memories
And then my brain programmed
A machine dressed to kill
Born from the sperm of man

No color of your eyes
To remind of you
No story that you told
To make me sleep at night

They can call themselves my fathers
So far I can't believe it
And even if they're my fathers
Who's my mother?

Mother
How can I be the only one
Without mother?

"...Good night, sleep tight.
See you in the morning light..."
