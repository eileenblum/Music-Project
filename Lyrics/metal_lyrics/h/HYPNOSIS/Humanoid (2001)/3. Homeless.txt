Is there someone who could tell me
Where I'm coming from?
Is there someone who could tell me
Where I go?

I would be
I could be
I should be
No matter who I am
There's no place there I can live
I'm sleepless
I'm useless
I'm homeless
No matter who I am
There's no place where I can live

I look to the burning sky
I think of these centuries of hate
War for religion, politics, race
They were your brothers
But now you will kill them
Until the complete extremination of
your enemies
Your land's devastated
But you think: "This is my country now"

From the four points comes the wind
From the oceans came life
From millions years before
To millions years after
We're just part of the cycle of life

Each man is different and unique
But holds no land in this world
From dust to dust
Ashes to ashes
Nature is the only law
