Blinded were my eyes
For not have known to see
They teached me hatred
Instead of understanding

But now the chains are broken
No one will ever decide of my fate
I'm free for the first time

"...Be carefull
This man is armed and dangerous
He's a serial killer, a psychopath
Anyone that could be in contact with him
Would be in mortal danger..."

Paralyzed
My heart was closed behind
The walls of solitude
Evilized
I can't believe these words you spoke

I trusted in you for so long
You disappointed me so much
Up to now I don't know what to think
I don't know what to do

Human...
Machine...
Humanoid...

I'm a machine that wants to live
I'm human
I'm free

The evil within me is nothing less
Than the venom you put in my veins
The evil within me is nothing less
Than the lies you put in my mind
