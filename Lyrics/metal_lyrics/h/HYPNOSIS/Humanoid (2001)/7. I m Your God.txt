You were so proud of you
Now you're losing control
A monster raised
From the man you created

I'm stronger than the strongest of you
I'm brighter than the best of you

All these years you spent
Building the perfect weapon
And now the weapon
Is pointed on you

Physically perfect
Mentally superior
The machine became man
Then became God

Science you learned me
You built me for war
You teached me no sentiments
Only power and lies

Now I've got the cards in my hand
And you know it's my turn to play

The physical force of thousand men
With the brain of a strategist
Why should I be your slave
As I can be your master?

There's nothing you can say
Nothing you can do
The end is near
Why should I be your slave
As I can be your master?
Now I'm entirely rage
And you're nothing but fear
Cause I'm your god now
