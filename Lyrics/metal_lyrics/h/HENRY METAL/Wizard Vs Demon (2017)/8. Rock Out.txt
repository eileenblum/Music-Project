Some of these girls are a little bit faster
And that's alright
Some of these girls are a little bit calmer
And that's just fine
Some of these girls are a little bit different
Some of them ain't the same
Some of these girls are doin' their own thing
Now it's time to play our game

So rock out with your rock hard rod tonight
Rod's out and it's feelin' right
Rock out with your rock hard rod tonight
Rod's out and it's lookin' tight

That's what Saturday night is for
For bringing the heat
If there's one thing you best believe
I come packing a treat

So rock out with your rock hard rod tonight
Rod's out and it's feelin' right
Rock out with your rock hard rod tonight
Rod's out and it's lookin' tight
It's tight...

You, you are for whom the angels sing
You, you are the wind beneath my wings
For you are the glory and the light
For you are the reason my pants are so tight

[Solo]

Rock out with your rock hard rod tonight
Rock out and the pants are tight
Rod's out and it's out of sight
Pants tight, but it feels alright
Rod's out tonight...
