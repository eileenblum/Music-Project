Roaming the fields of ancient Japan
Was a very particular kind of man
He dealt justice at the end of a blade
And dealt fury like the ace of spades
Think you know who I'm talkin' about...

Samurai, you're a bad a** dude
Samurai will fight for whatever he wants to

If you had a problem you could pay him some coin
To slash your opponent in the groin
Though he often lived as a peaceful man
If you forgot your role he would open up a can
Oh man...

Samurai, you're a bad a** dude
Samurai will fight for whatever he wants to
He will slice you in combinations that you never knew
Samurai, you're a bad a** dude

Here he comes... gonna slice some buns!

Storming up on thundering hooves
Fighting ninjas on the rooves
Geisha girls to sing them songs
Drinking sake til the dawn

Fighting with swords all day
Then dining with the heads of state
Samurai, only one question remains
Why do you choose to be so great?

Samurai, you're a bad a** dude
Samurai will fight for whatever he wants to
Samurai will slice you in combos you never knew
Yeah the Samurai, he's a bad a** dude
