This is a song for the critics and the haters
Of Henry Metal
Not everybody's gonna get Henry Metal
But if you don't, just step off...

When I was 13 and I got my first guitar
They said "Kid you suck"
When I was 21 and playin' in a bar
They said "Kid, you still suck"
That's not the right sound
I don't hear a hit
You're doing everything wrong
Man that sounds like s***

You're not supposed to play that way
That just isn't done
And why do you say all the stupid things you say?
Man you're just dumb
Why do you waste your time and your life
Just pickin' on the guit'?
Don't you know no one buys songs anymore?
Why don't you just quit?

If it's true that Metal is dead I'll bring flowers to the grave
To thank those Metal Gods that gave their lives
That mine might be saved
And in the coldest, blackest night I recommit
To carry on the flame
May I do everything that I can
To live up to my name

Don't you know that Metal cannot die?
You could not kill Metal if you tried... no

[Solo]

I don't care if Heavy Metal is dead and everyone likes pop
I don't care if I sell zero downloads, I'm never gonna stop

If it's true that Metal is dead I'll bring flowers to the grave
To thank those Metal Gods that gave their lives
That mine might be saved
And in the coldest, blackest night I recommit
To carry on the flame
May I do everything that I can
To live up to my name
