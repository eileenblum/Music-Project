Fukushima...

Now that the Pacific Ocean
Has come alive with nuclear light
It's time to rethink some of the dishes that I like
Since it hasn't been in the news
For about 7 years now
I figure it's time for the recipes
That'll make you go Wow

Radioactive fish makes a delicious dish
Nuclear seaweed, it is yummy

Fukushima Ceviche really packs a punch
Daiichi Chowder will spice up your lunch
Three headed Cod, Sir, goes great with chips
Better fill the cupboards with Ramen for the apocalypse

You know it's just a little temporary glitch
Really not important long as the rich stay rich
Geiger counters ticking up and down the coastline
That can wait for later cause now I gots to gits mine

Radioactive fish makes a delicious dish
Nuclear seaweed, it is yummy

Fukushima Ceviche really packs a punch
Daiichi Chowder will spice up your lunch
Three headed Cod, Sir, goes great with chips
Better fill the cupboards with Ramen for the apocalypse

Apocalypse is near
Apocalypse is here

[Solo]

Fukushima Sashimi, how could that be bad?
The green glowing Maki, the best you've ever had
Half life anchovies make a super plate
Get yourself something delicious that you'll be glad you ate!
