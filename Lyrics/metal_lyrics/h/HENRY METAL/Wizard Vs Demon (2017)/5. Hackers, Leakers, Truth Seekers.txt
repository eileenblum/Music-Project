I want to give a shout
To the people who tell us about
All the things that we never knew
Our crooked leaders do
Hackers, leakers, truth seekers

I want to give my applause
To those that fight for a cause
And give their lives for something that's real
To expose very shady deals
Hackers, leakers, truth seekers

Rise - tell your tale
Speak - lift the veil
Lies - in every case
Please - shut the face
For those who spin tales and think we believe
May they suck deeply upon our sheaths

I want to give a shout
To the people who tell us about
Secret stuff that's in a brief case
And the liars that run this place
Hackers, leakers, truth seekers

I want to give my applause
To those that fight for a cause
Keep the truth free for you and me
Hack, leak, truth, seek

Rise - tell your tale
Speak - lift the veil
Lies - in every case
Please - shut the face
For those who spin tales and think we believe
May they suck deeply on our sheaths

All of the garbage that you construe
To blame it on anyone but you
The misdirection and deceit
It is not that sweet, no

[Solo]

Rise - tell your tale
Speak - lift the veil
Lies - in every case
Please - shut the face
For those who spin tales and think we believe
May they drink deeply from our sheaths
