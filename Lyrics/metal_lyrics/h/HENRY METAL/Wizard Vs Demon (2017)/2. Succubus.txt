Succubus...

you come out crawling from the deeps
giving all men the creeps
you are the one that was foretold
the one more tempting than gold
horny demon, satan spawn
horny demon, ye be gone

now you have reentered the room
smelling of sweet Wind Song perfume
I have to stop and remind
Not to stare at your behind
horny demon wants to get it on
eat my soul before the break of dawn
...but you won't eat me...

sweet enchantress, darkest night
evil binds me, it takes my site
lust appears ambiguous
on the wings of a succubus

there's not much more that I can say
about such a bad lady
except that I regret the day
you chose to come my way
devil vixen, cray cray wh*re
you shall haunt my dreams no more
...haunt my dreams no more...

sweet enchantress, darkest night
evil binds me, it takes my site
lust appears ambiguous
on the wings of a succubus

...you don't like me, i'm not tasty
there's no need for you to eat me...

blood sucking Lilleth, thou must repent
for all the turmoil and unending torment
you have caused deep within my loins
never again shall our souls entwine
