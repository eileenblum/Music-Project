I Rise ...above 'em all
Leading the commons in this war
Against the faith
Blood and dust will wrap
The bodies of the preachers fallen
No rain will wash
Their un-scourged souls
We march towards the dregs
To purify the race from those
Who serve the lie
There's no mercy
From the mortal lords
The sound of lashes shall surround them
Once and for all
I - deny your god
I - deny your dogma
And your beliefs
Erase the signs of the lie
For all the sermos given, for every word
We are coming, and we are one
Until the end

Feeding the ignorance with lies
Betraying the men exploiting human weakness
And dreads they have
To hold their souls
In your hands
Spuriously led
Making them believe
What you need is just
All that they really deserve
Slaves of the flesh
Guilties of sins
That you deviously
Invent as protection from them
Bordered by traps
Sentenced to pay
In this earthly hell!

We march against the faith and superstition
We are the legion of the truth
We come and we will fight until your vile demise
Staring at your downfall

We march against
The fake god celebration
We are the legion of the truth
We come and we will rise upon
The ruins of your desolated empire
We march - we march
We are the legion of the truth
We come, come and destroy the falsehood!
We march - we march
We are the legion of the truth
We come, come and destroy you!
From all the sides
We will launch the attack
There's no trench
That can stop our march
No life after us!
No advise of warning alarm
There's no outwork can resist our strike
No life after us!
