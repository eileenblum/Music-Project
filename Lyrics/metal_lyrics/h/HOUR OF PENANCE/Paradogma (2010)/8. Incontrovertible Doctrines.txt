Walking in the desert of shame
Burnt by your guilty conscience
I can see in your eyes the fear of
Abandon from the one you adored
Don't you fell the coming of pain?
While slowly you go
Into the decline of your life
Your last breath is lost
For praying a god that will not come

Lie human redemption is a
Lie led on the people
Lie human redemption is a
Lie set for the feebles

Left alone to carry this weight
Crippled by your existence
When your flesh is cold where is
The savior for your resurrection?

No sense has your redemption!
Betrayed from moment you were born!
Your last gasp is lost for praying to
Nothing! To Nothing! To lie...

Lie human redemption is
Lie led on the people
Lie human redemption is a
Lie set for the feebles

Fight!
Against those who are inflicted on your pain!
Against those who are stealing your life!
Forget all the prayers!
Left the certainties of lies to the weak
And
Deny... Their biblical light

Look inside of your mind to find what
You think it's right
Convert all your fears in a concrete sight!
Take back your existence!

Lie human redemption is a
Lie led on the people
Lie human redemption is a
Lie set for the feebles like you!
