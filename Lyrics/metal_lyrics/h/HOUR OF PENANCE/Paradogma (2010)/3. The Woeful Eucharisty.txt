Pieces of flesh to immolate
Upon the altar
They wait the time of the sacrifice
The silence is broken by
The noise of the prayers

Eucharisty in the name of the lie
Until we will
Rise up - against the deceivers
Rise up - against the deceivers
Slay them!
Vengeance for the true believer
Vengeance for the real redeemer
Kill them!
Celebrate the truth with
This new sacrifice
A godless concrete revelation shall
Enlighten the feebles minds
No compassion for
The shameful fratricides
Bow your heads before our army as sign of submission

Cross symbol of demise
False blessing
Hidden by the filthy sign of
Cross icon of the hidding
Pure falsehood wisely seeded in the praise of lord
Paradigm of the lie
False leaders - Lift their the hands to celebrate the lord
Shame of the minkind
Rise up for every single word they ever preached
And for every single verse they ever read

For every single verse they ever read
And for every single sign
They gotta die

Kill in the name of the truth
Kill in the name of the truth
Kill in the name of the truth
Kill in the name of the truth

Words cage of human sight
The dead walking indoctrinated by the holy words
Wire fence for your mind
Blinded worship in
The false conviction that is
God the leader of your life
Desperate asking for
The fair salvation from a god
That will no reply

Rise for every single word
They ever preached and
For every single verse
They ever read and
For every single sign they gotta die
The time of fall has come
No mercy for the enemies
We'll purify the race from those ones
Kill in the name of truth
Kill in the name of truth
Slay the deceivers!
Make them eat their own sick flesh!
Kill without fear!
Get themselves drunk of
Their own blood!
Finally leader!
Of this woeful eucharisty
Give them the end deserve!
