Slaves of the evil ones
Victim on coward beings
Chancer of the neighbor!
Cursed - by all the preachers
Blamed - by the deceivers
You servants doomed
To an existence of pain
Shaped - by filthy churchmen
Raped- during the childhood
Vileness protected by
The mother church!
Unaware - prisoners
Powerless - wrestler
Fights the enemy inside
Digging deep
Struggling for existence
In quest of the way
To be finally safe
Purifying the earth
With the sharpest knife
Left alone in the
Hard battle of inner war
To clean their soul from the dirt of falseness!
Catched hold of few human doubts,
Last hopes remained
To clean their minds
From the world of the deceivers
Twisted morality passed off as right
False commandments influence
The path of the life
Fake revelations lead the men astray
Wrong convictions affect
The will of the human race
Slaves of the evil ones!
Burn - the holy fire
Brains - self-purified
Miracle on the rational thought
Men slowly released
From the invisible prison
Wedded forever to
The empirical truth!
Unaware - prisoners
Powerless - wreteler
Fights the enemy inside
Digging deep - struggling for
Existence - at their war
In quest of the way
To be finally safe
Purifying the earth
With the sharpest knife
Left alone in the
Hard battle of inner war
To clean their soul
From the dirty of falseness
Catched hold of few humandoubts, last hopes remained
To clean their minds from the word of the deceivers
