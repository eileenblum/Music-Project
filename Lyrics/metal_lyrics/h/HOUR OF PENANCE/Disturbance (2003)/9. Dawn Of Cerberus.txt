A voice from above.
Before dark waters we stand
Beneath leaden sky
we walk.

The day that lied just in our dreams
takes its form, as we slowly fall.
Ethereal dawn
[Missing lines]
Cerberus!

Three tongues of condemnation, disenchantment.
Lost in a one-way maze.
Searching for you.

We face the Phantom God
that mesmerized our dreams,
he who showed the hell before
and broke the spell with fear
with disenchantment made by death.

Becoming dust,
We leave behind our cries of mercy.
We're now possessed, we're free.
Dust is what we've been.
Dust is what he breathes.
Dust is what we've been.
Dust is what he breathes.
