Obedient servants to the faceless god
They blindly follow lies
Oblivious to the light with no shame
Breathing dry sands, once green pastures
We are coming to lay siege to all their stolen lands,
With cold fury

Flatten this town
Flatten this mosque
It's time to cut their faith 
With our fire shall rise
Leading our eastern assault

XXI Century Imperial Crusade
Suffer, the minarets light up the night
Burning infidels outside
XXI Century Imperial Crusade

Pounding, pounding
Their walls crumbling
We must take back what was ours, 
By undisputed divine right

Marching forward, colonizing
Gradually reorganizing worthless plebs,
With martial law

Fire shall rise
Leading our eastern assault
XXI Century Imperial Crusade
Suffer, the minarets light up the night
Burning infidels outside
XXI Century Imperial Crusade
Obey

We are god's descendants [2x]

Pounding, pounding
Their walls crumbling
We must take back what was ours, 
By undisputed divine right

Marching forward, colonizing
Gradually reorganizing worthless plebs,
With martial law

Rebuilding temples for our pantheon
The megalopolis rising from debris of their cult
Holy pages turned to ashes
Historiated walls tower to the sky
We hail Roma

Praise the sun
Face the gods
On the final day of agony

Praise the sun
Face the gods
On the final day of agony
