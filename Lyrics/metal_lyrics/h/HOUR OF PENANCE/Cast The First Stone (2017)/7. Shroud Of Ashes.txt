The lineage born in Ur where now there's silence, devoid of essence and soul
They don't know the gift of immortality and cannot see the legions of gold

This terrible shell of iniquity and the disgusting sins
Are brought to life by our enemies, the sheiks who breed this lies
Desolation, famine and bestialities will lead to war indeed
Among the mass Braves and leprosy, rejoice

The Nile floods its coasts and tons of debris of all your mosques and homes
Are swept ashore with restless brutality and homes and now you see the wrath of Seth

Kill their firstborn, kill their firstborn and shroud this sinkhole in ashes
Bring back to life the sands of Amon after centuries
Kill their firstborn, kill their firstborn, and shroud this sinkhole in ashes
Bring back to life the sands of Amon, there's no retreat

This seed will grow so tall for the newborn Rome
This was your world, failed, lost to the poisoned lord

Kill their firstborn, kill their firstborn, and shroud this sinkhole in ashes
Bring back to life the sands of Amon after centuries
Kill their firstborn, kill their firstborn, and shroud this sinkhole in ashes
Bring back to life the sands of Amon, there's no retreat

You are on the edge of a precipice overlooking the jaws of Hades
Afar shines something ominous this sight bums your eyes
Desolation, famine and bestialities our might shall delete
Among the mass graves and leprosy, rejoice

The Nile floods its coasts and tons of debris of all your mosques and homes
Are swept ashore with restless brutality, and now you see the wrath of Seth

This seed will grow so tall for the newborn Rome
This was your world, failed, lost to the poisoned lord
Freedom from the condemned god
