They deny the glory of the Reason
Left behind by their god
No philosophy, just false prophecies
Pour more blood in the wine

The cosmos lives inside me
Not a wasteland of thorns
Every part of me goes into scrutiny
To fulfill my desires

Bring outside all my enemies, they must see the light blessing their souls of undead
Iron fist will now settle the score and we will reap our deserved spoils of war

This light now blesses our souls
This strength must rearrange every law with Reason and Pride

Lay siege to my enemies, they must see the light blessing their souls of undead
Iron fist will now settle the score and we will reap our deserved spoils of war

Reason and Pride
Reason and Pride

[Solo: Giulio Moschini]

Gods are mine and I shatter their names
Won't forget all the pain
Brought in the name of Him, just idolatry
The blood must be purified

This light now blesses our souls
This strength must rearrange every law with Reason and Pride

The heat now cracks the soil of demonic idolatry
I see His Sulphur corpse vanishing into my sorcery
The brief sound of their souls as they fall in lunacy
Resounds in vibrant cries of inhuman songs of impurity
