Great power without a face shed your feathers unto me
Bring forth the casket of porphyry and cast the seal

Numini strenui, to live again we call upon a most ancient sorcery
Numini strenui, this endless cycle of war is everything we stand for

Devour the master race, this must cease
Pale horse shall ride infinity and cleanse the seal

Equally split the earth from the sky,
even if the stars must become mere sparkles of dust
Ghevurah, the left hand of blood,
master of the judgement who will make the whole earth clean

Red fire now stands ablaze and consecrates humanity
Cohorts placed side by side thee, a wall of steel united

Molten crucibles will become the thorns of enmity
There's just one truth, the endless dominance of fear
Shadows suddenly encase this world in purity
There's just one truth, the endless dominance of fear

Equally split the earth from the sky,
even if the stars must become mere sparkles of dust
Ghevurah, the left hand of blood,
master of the judgement who will make the whole earth clean
