From the East where there is no shame nor pride
Ominous winds of deceit swarm our land

Desperate fools who tremble at the sight of our walls
There is no escape; we will push back their hordes of demented sons
Where they belong and where they must die in their own shitholes
They must not breed

Blame the past, gold will rust the dawn brings a different sky
Blind distrust, sheer disgust; tomorrow we shall shatter the night

Say the fucking word: fire the fucking bombs

Do you see that the East burns bright with fire?

Pray, pray for Him
Pray, no answers for you kind
Pray, pray for Him
Pray, no answers for you kind

Decide on how all those people die
Brutal terror reigns supreme
Subjugate all those cities for me
End this insanity, this worthless creed

Desperate fools who tremble at the sight of our walls

Where they belong and where they must die in their own shitholes
