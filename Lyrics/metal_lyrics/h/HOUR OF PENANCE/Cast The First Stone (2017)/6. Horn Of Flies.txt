Malevolent spirits outside
Dionysus draws out its knife
Redolent blood of a man- Ascension
Dimension Eyes of the gods are upon us
Don't be afraid of the reincarnation

Shameful souls - Blow the horn of flies
When these creatures arise
From black holes of an abysmal domain
Let immolation commence

This endless desire could bring entire worlds to their knees
All this makes no sense anymore - Retain this land from Him

Mars, feed the flames with the corpse of sin
Twist this world with the rage of the empire of Rome
Steal and maim for the glory of my misguide

Malevolent spirits outside
Dionysus draws out its knife
Redolent blood of a man - Ascension
Dimensions won't fall apart anymore
Seek the unhallowed reality
Eyes of the gods are upon us
Don't be afraid of the reincarnation

Crows below, wings of black and white
Feast on the heart of the East
Chaos rifts from an abysmal domain
Predestination is mine

This endless desire could bring entire worlds to their knees
All this makes no sense anymore - Retain this land from Him
