The left behind, remnants of the seven kings that once became the warlords of the world
The ruined Rome desecrated by the words that liars spoke with malice and disgust
We'll not forgive the delusive emptiness who brought the end upon this sacred land
They'll not survive the that from the heart will feed the spirits of the dead

Feathers of disaster
Legions born a
Faster than the Tiber
Legions born in flames

Temples of gold spire to the sun
Then the only god will become subject to damnatio memoriae

[Solo: Paolo Pieri]

Sententia: Damnatio memoriae
Sententia: Damnatio memoriae

Righteous our discipline - order will be brought upon the savage impious people of the East
Behold our are enslaved cause they must serve glory of the empire
We'll not forgive the delusive emptiness who brought the upon this sacred land
They'll nor survive the murderous intent that from the heart will feed the spirits of the dead

Feathers of disaster
Legions born again
Still faster than the Tiber
Legions born in flames

Temples of gold spire to the sun
Then the only god will become subject to damnatio memoriae
Marble columns rise to the skies
Then the only god will become subject to damnatio memoriae
