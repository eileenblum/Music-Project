Treacherous, smouldering
Storm of sand, burn the cross
Severing, all the heads

Fall of the servants
Treading on the ones whoâre in awe
Of the serpent
Beg for mercy fools!
Raping â Killing â Serve the masters

Swarming with chaos from the north
Deafening â Threatening
Marching in line against the feeble souls
Shining in a gloomy dusk
Breaching the walls of the church
Desecrate â Dominate
Here comes the black son of the demon god
Sweeping the sacred land

There is no heaven
Nor a savior god
You shall die

Never seen such a weak, pitiful human being
How you dare call yourself God

Nailed upon the wall with a piece of the cross
Blessing the new altar with a whore
Unholy birth, behold
The last fall of the servants
Treading on the ones whoâre in awe
Of the serpent
Beg for mercy fools!
Face the plague on the sacred land
Breeding the new race
Taste the flesh of the prophet
Shaped under a vengeful eye

Swarming with chaos from the north
Deafening â Threatening
Marching in line against the feeble souls
Shining in a gloomy dusk
Breaching the walls of the church
Desecrate â Dominate
Here comes the black son of the demon god
Sweeping the sacred land

There is no heaven
Nor a savior god
You shall die
