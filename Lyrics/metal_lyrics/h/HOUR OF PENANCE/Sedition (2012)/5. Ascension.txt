Heading for the home of god
The scent of christian blood is upon thee
Seeking to ascend upon the throne again

With rage weâre moving forward,
We donât spare a single human being, no oneâs left, alive
Descend upon the ones who donât submit to our masterâs will,
No oneâs left alive

Hail â Hail â The christian church burns in fire
Hail â Hail â Dethrone the pope, now heâs hanged and defiled
Hail â Hail â Defy the cross, decimate this race
Hail â Hail â The sun is crumbling, all the stars are pale
Hail â Hail â Hail â Hail
The sun is crumbling, all the stars are paleâ¦

â¦and then He raises his hand,
This place becomes a barren land of pain
Unholy tyrant â No mercy, shed their blood
Casting down the cosmos, every lawâs becoming tamed now
Defloration â New monarch, spread your wings

We all Hail â Hail â The christian church burns in fire
Hail â Hail â Dethrone the pope, now heâs hanged and defiled
Hail â Hail â Defy the cross, decimate this race
Hail â Hail â The sun is crumbling, all the stars are pale

With rage weâre moving forward,
We donât spare a single human being, no oneâs left, alive
Descend upon the ones who donât submit to our masterâs will,
No oneâs left alive

Pater, I feel my blood turn into fire
Grow in me, nourish me, I feel my soul turn into fire
