Hearing shattered divine voices
Screaming from the scattered bible Fool!
âGod is the lightâ

Insane â Where no god dominates
Shall be no response and no rewarding
I can feel someone who beholds me

Obey all my lies
Until I see you screaming out and die
I need to see you ripping out your eyes
Desperation

Why canât they hear the call of Jesus Christ?
I see his face smeared with blood that follows
My every move and every single breath

The cross is screaming covered in black blood
My lord is all I want to see
Take my sight

Laid upon the floor
Hear my call
Laid upon the floor blind

Deafening voices are echoing, my headâs on fire

Going insane, thereâs no god, no mistake
Youâll see, none shall save you and lift your sorrows
Now bleed, bleed for a lord that you will never meet

Do it now
Rip out your eyes, Do it
Rip out your eyes, Do it again
Degeneration
Rip out your eyes, Do it
Rip out your eyes, Do it again
Degenerated god

Heâs screaming covered in black blood
His lord is all he wants to see
Take my sight â Bleed him dry
