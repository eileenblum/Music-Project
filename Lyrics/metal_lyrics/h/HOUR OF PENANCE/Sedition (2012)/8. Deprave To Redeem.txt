My sworn enemies upon whom I will tread
With scorn and despise and disdain 

Those worms are breeding in nests, and feeding from us
Their shameful souls I will devour in pain
Thirsty â blood spilt on my reign 
This world soaked with fear, demise
The earth is covered in scars
Desolation

I shall recognize each torn corpse immolated
For I will decide a ritual knife 
Secretly severing every bone
They shall become the square shaped sacrifice
The flesh pyramid upon which Iâll call my new gods

Sacrifice â dead are piled
Prepare and incision on the cervical vertebra 
Check the gusts â Check the stars
Thrusting a nail through the ocular orbit
Cross their arms â Wait the dawn
Cut the third finger in the handoff the seventh dead 
Say the world â She your blood 
Offer the flesh to honor the cannibal gods

Ferte Mortem
Ferte Mortem 
Servi me â Servi me â Servi me - Servi me

Those worms are breeding in nests, and feeding from us
Their shameful souls I will devour in pain
Thirsty â blood spilt on my reign 
This world soaked with fear, demise
The earth is covered in scars

Ferte Mortem
Ferte Mortem, fertote
