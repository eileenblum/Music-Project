Hunting down the light of Christ
Word became flesh - The food for the gods
Praising the weak - Dying as one
Fall by our hands - Never ever to rise
Seeking the truth as way of life - Die

Upon the shame and cries
Never pray - Never try - We despise all your lies
Itâs raining locusts â Face our wrath
Pray the new gods
Swarming plagues defile your sons 
Upon them shame and cries
Sacred grounds become mass graves
Never pray - Never try â We despise all your lies
No more saviors shall descend
Itâs raining locusts - Face our wrath
Serve our dogmas and youâll be spared Pray the new gods
Reaching for the light 

We serve the gods 
We serve the light 
No fear â No lies - So choose
To serve the gods 
To see â To try â To choose
To serve the light

Gods of the dead scorch all of their lands
Serves his son â Nailed to the cross
Claws tear them to pieces and shreds
Slay all the prophets betraying our words â Die
Feast on the flesh of the demigod

It has been decided, a new world shall rise 
With bricks of flesh â enlightened by blood
We shall bring vengeance to the altar of god
The blackened seals on our foreheads shall be no more

Upon the shame and cries
Never pray â Never try â We despise all your lies
Itâs raining locusts â Face our wrath
Pray the new gods
Swarming plagues defile your sons 
Upon them shame and cries
Sacred grounds become mass graves
Never pray â Never try â We despise all your lies
No more saviors shall descend
Itâs raining locusts â Face our wrath
Serve our dogmas and youâll be spared Pray the new gods
Reaching for the light
