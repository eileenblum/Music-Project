Feast on the blood of the weak
Certainty of salvation, i refuse for i was born
Unbound
With the savior's blood i wash my hand
Swearing to god sedition scourged king of none
A god in a shell of flesh every fallen god
Deserves a crown of thorns above his head

Sedition Through Scorn
Redemption of worms

Flesh of my flesh blinded servitude of lambs
People subjugated to commandments
Lies conceived to desecrate them
Laws crawling from above
On the followers of the deprecated doctrine
The silent slaves of god
I brought an end to god
Defiled crashed torn
Icons of the fallen one
Bribe the servants to be treasonous
Sacred places are forsaken
Befouled blood of christ infections as a disease
Befouled blood of christ infections as a disease

Sedition Through Scorn
Redemption of worms

Crown of thorns sedition to god
Your kingdom of grace will now fall [x4]
