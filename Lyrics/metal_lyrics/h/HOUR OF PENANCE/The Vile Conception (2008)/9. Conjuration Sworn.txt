The chains of god will break forth
Decimating his empire of splendour
Denying all his creations
Unbound we rise and destroy his reign
Torn apart in fragments and burn the scriptures of joy and grace

With the ashes of his empire, we will bury every church down in the sand
Inverted crosses will rise, as vexill of the triumph of men
Damned souls now walk on the earth claiming their revenge for his abuse
To reign the world in chaos 'till its destruction

We will break with force his majesty
We will spit against his cross
With the consciousness of our Reason
We will tear apart his son
Let his wisdom of grace fall
Let his words of falsity rot
Through the primal hate and iniquity
He will fall from his throne

Sing curses unto his name
Sing curses unto his name
Torn apart in fragments
The scriptures of joy and grace
As a un-divine conjuration
Against the holy creation
Against the father, the son and the holy ghost

The chains of god we will break forth
Decimating his empire of splendour
Decaying all his creations
Unbound we rise and destroy his reign
Inverted crosses will rise, as vexill of the triumph of men

Behold the chaos
Behold the fall of the tyrant
Behold the fall of the angels
Behold the fall of the reign of god

With the ashes of his empire, we will bury every church down in the sand
Throw your hopes into the fire we will bury every faith in the dust
Damned souls now walk on the earth claiming their revenge for his abuse
To reign the world in chaos till its destruction

Behold the chaos
Behold the tyrant's fall
Behold the chaos
Till its destruction

We will break with force his majesty
We will spit against his cross
We'll tear apart his son
Our conjuration sworn
