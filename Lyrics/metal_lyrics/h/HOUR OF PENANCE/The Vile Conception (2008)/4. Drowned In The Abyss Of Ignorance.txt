An impure race of blinded sheep
They follow in line an infamous shepherd
Who holds their souls controls their deeds
Make them believe in words venomous seeds

False glorification of the unseen
Silent vile submission to the master
Preachers transform people in stupid puppets that believe
And never ask about the reasons of their power

Slow decomposition of their minds
A society sentenced to disaster
No-one left to lift the head and try to break the mental chains
That pull them down into the abyss of ignorance

Dope the men with falsity
Change their own morality

Truth, they'll never know
Truth, intoxicated humanity goes
False, blows in the words
False, while they pray trough the veins the venom flows

Slaves owned with falsity forever
Victims of the illusory verses of deceivers
Spend life praying a god who won't save 'em all when time will come

Fall those who have believed without doubt
Only death they deserve
Drowned in the own blood they will end
When the truth will rise again

An ingenuous race ruled with deceit
They serve in silence a lowest master
Who holds their souls controls their deeds
Make them believe in words venomous seeds

False glorification of the unseen
Silent vile submission to the master
Preachers transform people in stupid puppets that believe
And never ask about the reasons of their power

Slow decomposition of their minds
A society sentenced to disaster
No-one left to lift the head and try to break the mental chains
That pull them down into the abyss of ignorance

Dope the men with falsity
Change their own morality

Truth, they'll never know
Truth, intoxicated humanity goes
False, blows in the words
False, while they pray trough the veins the venom flows
