We can't do anything living in slavery
It will come as mass manipulation
Of your life, of your mind full of lies
Distorted perception, feeling dissection
Mental bomb that explodes in the fog
A white and green burst destroys the silence
In the decayed world of your mind
Until your mind will bleed
Until your words will bleed
Victim of the leaders of society

Kings of a world in a decaying situation
A self infliction of wounds
A slow catatonic destruction
A comatose state of the population

Slavery in a deaf decay
Chained mankind towards extinction
Starving worms consume our soul
Submissive behavior as our life code
Slavery in a deaf decay

Emptiness in our hearts the right way's far away
Unending dark hole in our deep down
Can philosophy save our life
Self inflicted deep wounds that are bleeding
Can our hate free ourselves from ourselves
All that you believe will be deleted
As the things that we loved were erased
Until your mind will bleed
Until your words will bleed
Victim of the leaders of society

Kings of a world in a decaying situation
A self infliction of wounds
A slow catatonic destruction
A comatose state of the population

Slavery in a deaf decay
