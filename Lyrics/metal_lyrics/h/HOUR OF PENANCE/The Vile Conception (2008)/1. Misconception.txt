Cursed be those who led their sons to the path of the false salvation
Dreaming of being purified through redemption
Trusting in lies that blinds their minds with idolatry and misconception
Lies will lead them all to self-destruction

Servants bow your heads and obey to the church
Prayers waiting for the judgement
Observants, unveil the layer of falsity to see an uneasy
Truth there's no god to worship fuck it
Preachers, of the mystery of the holy ghost
Bullshits, hidden by confessions
Sinners, you will wash your dirty hands in your own flowing
Blood, atheistic light, no religion

Decimation of millions, indoctrinations of terror
Under the flags of the nations, under the scriptures of the ancients
Running to the dark oblivion, desolation of our souls
Waiting for the revelation, licking the honey of the false
Condemnation by the guides, no more Christ to sacrifice
A new reaction will delete, every single soldier of the church
Victim of the fear of god, our will's under your control
Every century has its cancer, every generation has its enemies
Every belief will kill us, every divinity is laughing
For the interests of a few tyrants, people will face their last journey
Wrong ideologies will guide us towards a catastrophic scenery
A new beginning is coming now, always starts with the end
The end of everything

No one will be missed by the fury of this massive mutilation
Flesh we are and flesh we'll be in putrefaction
They hold the free will with the lie of the saviour crucifixion
Lies will lead them all to final self-destruction

No recovering and no morphine can heal this society, a new army will come to reset their life
Reconstruct the morality of these injured minds, a new war will erase all these fucking lies

Cries, world is collapsing, men are defeated, fed up by anger and hate
Nothing remains only ashes, prayers are so useless to say
Ceremonials of destruction, sermons of death and despair
Bleeding remains of the west and east cultures now rot

Servants bow your heads and obey to the church
Prayers waiting for the judgement
Observants, unveil the layer of falsity to see an uneasy
Truth there's no god to worship fuck it
Preachers, of the mystery of the holy ghost
Bullshits, hidden by confessions
Sinners, you will wash your dirty hands in your own flowing
Blood, atheistic light

Cursed be those who led their sons to the path of the false salvation
Mind distortion by the greatest hallucination
Trusting in lies that blinds their minds with idolatry and misconception
Lies will lead them all to self-destruction
