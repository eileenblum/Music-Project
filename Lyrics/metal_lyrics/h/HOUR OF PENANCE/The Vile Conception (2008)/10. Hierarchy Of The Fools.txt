Producing abhorrence of life
With morality and religion
Hideous form of malevolence
Indignant self-celebration
Complete demise of human rights
Defeat of the Reason
Denied knowledge to hide disgusting horrors
Hiding horrors
Eradicate the seeds of the cowards
Hands of the preachers to excise
Crown of thorns in the head of the lying ones
Innocents lambs follow their leaders

Foes of the Enlightenment, foes of humanity
Foes of the progress of reason
Debauched hierarchy, deceivers of the weak
Foes of the Enlightenment, foes of humanity
Foes of the progress of Reason
Debauched hierarchy, deceivers of the weak

Nail, everyone is ruling us
Nail, the preachers of lies
Nail, everyone's oppressing us
Nail, the defilers of truth
Nail, everyone is ruling us
Nail, the preachers of lies
Nail everyone's oppressing us
We'll drown into obscurity

We'll be lost in the dark
We'll drown into obscurity
We'll be lost in the dark
Alone, where every sound is eaten by the silence

Producing abhorrence of life
With morality and religion
Hideous form of malevolence
Indignant self-celebration
Complete demise of human rights
Defeat of the Reason
Denied knowledge to hide disgusting horrors
Hiding horrors

Foes, foes of the Enlightenment foes
The fucking deceivers of the weak
Foes of humanity foes

Nail who's ruling us
Nail everyone's ruling us
Nail who's oppressing us
Nail everyone's oppressing us

Nail everyone, pushing us down, must be nailed down

Deceivers of the weak
Nail the deceivers of the weak
