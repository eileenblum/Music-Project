Prophecy of a pregnancy
Greedily a holy virgin committed sins
Befouling his advent
Raped and left her in disgrace
An angel came and took her purity
As god commanded to him

god is coming into her!

Not even her blood, not even her screams,
Not even her tears will stop him from taking his decision
She is the only one, chosen for giving birth
To the miraculous newborn saviour of his vision
Violently as she chokes, violently as she chokes
Down on her knees she's the perfect figure of derision
Through her skin, through her blood, through her flood,
Every breath she takes she's collapsing to the floor
Dying

Raped to give a son to her god
Give birth to a filthy imposer who you'll going to pray
The saviour of men
The one who'll inject lies to your mind

The suffering, of procreation, in a slave state
Decaying with pain while pleasure him

Not even her blood, not even her screams,
Not even her tears will stop him from taking his decision
She is the only one, chosen for giving birth
To the miraculous newborn saviour of his vision
Violently as she chokes, violently as she chokes
Down on her knees she's the perfect figure of derision
Through her skin, through her blood, through her flood,
Every breath she takes she's collapsing to the floor
Dying

Prophecy of the awakening
Greedily a holy virgin will give birth
To the god-sent on the earth
Newborn of a filthy sin
Crawling like a worm inside the dead
You're son of rape and hate

Then he will be tempted by Seraphim
Tempted to accept serpentine offerings
Sent by the evil one to destroy his kingdom
Prophet of false and holy lies
Proclaimer of a decaying purity
Son of the holy and un-divine falsehood

Evil supremacy over the thrice holy
Killed, nailed, so viciously, cut his genitalia
