Kill everyone wants befog our rational free minds

Trapped in world that's like a cage where false moralities delete
All possibilities of freedom
Live with a rational free mind is the worst sin we can commit
Disintegration of our free will
Free from the church to contrast the liars
Kill everyone is trying to infect your thoughts with the lie
Or to deceive your mind
Kill every time they try to reshape your morality
With deceit and lie

Seeds of deception, decay
Altered perception, disguise
They will manipulate your mind
They will manipulate your mind
Their primary aim is deceive
To violently caught you in a cage
Absorb the false hopes
Without a prayer left to say
Your sacrificed life
A useless offer

Everyone who believes men can do anything
To control their own free will and morality
Be those slaves left to rot
Everyone who desires to fight against them who rule
In the name of their religious supremacy
The time to rise has come

Prayers, denied by god, to save my soul
Lies, truths denied, truths disavowed

Trapped in world that's like a cage where false moralities delete
All possibilities of freedom
Live with a rational free mind is the worst sin we can commit
Disintegration of our free will
Free from the church to contrast the liars
Kill everyone is trying to infect your thoughts with the lie
Or to deceive your mind
Kill every time they try to reshape your morality
With deceit and lie

Seeds of deception, decay
Altered perception, disguise
They will manipulate your mind
They will manipulate your mind
Their primary aim is deceive
To violently caught you in a cage
Absorb the false hopes
Without a prayer left to say
Your sacrificed life
A useless offer
