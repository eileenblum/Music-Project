There is feasting once more where we give the sun our sacrifice
The night seems to devour creation
This is the day in which we're sent to take no one alive
Our might needs not to hide ambition

Draw out the sword, you'll see how we build empires
Our march storms like raging sea
Dust and bones is all that's left once we summon thee
Desolated lands

Serving the sun for his warm nourishment

The scars leave this land dried
Too charred, bleak, too cold, burnt

Defenseless - Despised
Scorned - Dead

Don't spare these fools, they serve
the will of rotten gods and shameful creeds
Denied is their life - Cleanse them
This is our fight to set them free from all disunity
This bright scene of end times shall rise

Draw out the sword, you'll see how we build empires
Our march storms like raging sea
Dust and bones is all that's left once we summon thee
This old era ends

The scars leave this land dried
Too charred, bleak, too cold, burnt
Gone
