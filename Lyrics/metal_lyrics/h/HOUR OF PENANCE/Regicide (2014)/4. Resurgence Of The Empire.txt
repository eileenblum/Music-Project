Heavens grant what we seek
Lend us the will to destroy
And the strength to rebuild this empire
From their bones and their guts

Sun has returned at last
Upon our scarred skin burns the prophecy
Slay the son, become one, seeking lust
The spear goes through the flesh declaring their demise

They cannot see the storm is incoming
They cannot feel the heart of burning fire
Scorch this old throne, repentance

Shed upon me the smoke of the athanor
Shed upon me the true meaning of life

Build this new world
Resurgence bow
The spear goes through the flesh declaring their demise

Ave fortuna, fortes metuit et ignavos premit
Heavens grant what we seek
Lend us the will to destroy
And the strenght to rebirth gods from the ash of servants
Obey and submit
All of you traitors shall bow
And we're going to rebuild this empire from their bones and their guts

Now, from dust shall rise
The frightening towers of a new world capital
This day will stain end times
The ultimate blow to the christian ways

Never shall the dried spring of deceit quench our thirst
Become the luminous beacon of the gifts of mars

I will not be subjected to the master
I will not trust the decomposed flesh of the fake son of Jehovah
Shed upon me the smoke of the athanor
Shed upon me the true meaning of life

Build this new world
Resurgence bow
The spear goes through the flesh declaring their demise
Heavens grant what we seek
Lend us the will to destroy
And the strength to rebirth gods from the ash of servants
Obey and submit
All of you traitors shall bow
And we're going to rebuild this empire
