This bleak maze - I want to see where it leads
Between all the fallen creeds
I want to see how the lies and deceptions will die
This devious creed drains life from me
What we can be is the final creation of a destined breed

The corpse decayed emerging from the mud
With a grim scroll shall life in thee be complete

Anthropos - Be conceived
This is called Theogony
No one knows what they'll be
There's no need for prophecies

This being descending, entranced from the light
There's a bit more to what we thought we received

The dead will breath - Awake!
Awake! - And speak with me
Are they eternally awake?

Separate the vile lead from the blood
Between every destiny
I know there's a blend of infections and divine recollections
I want to see how the gods birthed me
This lifeless being can erode and consume all the sky

Devote the blessings and prayers to our kind
Be there once more to summon forth the sealed ones

Anthropos - Be conceived
This is called Theogony
No one knows what they'll be
There's no need for prophecies

The dead will breath - Awake!
Awake! - And speak with me
Are they eternally here?
