Sinful - Pitiful
Why do you lead the flock?
All of your disguises are lies

Spreading the philosophies of venomous greed
The last of divine deception can't breed

Distant reflection of the truth
It's glowing inside
This world is paralyzed
Severe decree to smash redemption

Open up the gates of god
Open up the gates
The world is burning
Open up the gates of god
Breathing down your neck
The light is blinding
All we shall feel now
All we shall bring down
All we shall become
Open up the gates of god
Dead pits all inside the gates and god's falling
Open up the gates of god

Be the redeemer of atrocity
Blending light with dark entities
Never trust your sworn enemies
The seed of Christ
See the disease as it spreads in the wind
The smell of the feast's seeping through
On this dark blood drenched soil
Your last demise

Beautiful - Wonderful
Behold a new dawn
Those who won't follow shall die

Spreading the philosophy of venomous greed
The last of divine deception can't breed

Shattered pieces of the cross
Are burning outside
As we commit deicide
Derelict remains of a forlorn creation

Open up the gates of god
Open up the gates
The world is burning
Open up the gates of god
Breathing down your neck
The light is blinding
All we shall feel now
All we shall bring down
