Pounding terror becomes the loss of all fear
Breathing the cinders - The stars will turn to dust

Do it - Bring the spears of sacred doom
Agony is the real war king
We redeem the mortal sins
The undefeated scourge walking dead

Bring the siblings, the seed of lords that were free
Bleed the worms that feed upon their trust

Blood
Afterglow of this world undone
Now give me more
The dead scrolls have become entwined
Now give me blood

War - the knights raise the flags of hoar
So weak - The knights left this world cold

Do it - Bring the spears of sacred doom
Agony is the real war king
We redeem the mortal sins
The undefeated scourge walking dead

Blood
Afterglow of this world undone
Now give me more
The dead scrolls have become entwined

Battered sore skin besieges the heart of this faith
Inverting the words to turn this book to ash

Believe - Consume - Defy
Return this world to ash
For me - For you - For life
Return this world to ash for you to thrive
