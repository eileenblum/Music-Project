Fading souls of fallen kings waiting for the rite again
Peeling off the flesh, grinding broken bones from those bodies
Collected from the battlefield to desecrate the enemies
Dust above breaches the consecrated walls

The last you'll see of this twisted world
Desecrated souls
Above the rite you shall see
Desecrated souls

Screaming will not cease until the unholy ghost descends in here
Breathing life in thee to thrive upon this land with full wisdom
Contorted skin is shivering as the open eyes begin to stare you
Fire below surrounds the consecrated walls

Fiat iustitia et pereat mundus

Now mark my words:

The last you'll see of this twisted world
Desecrated souls
Above the rite you shall see
Desecrated souls
