Through the flask observe the flame turning black
Transmutation from the fire
Burn the seal upon thee, smell the skin ablaze
Deteriorate old scars with nails
No reaction from the flesh
Ichor seeps in me, a new life begins
Rebirth

Walking through the sun
New world has begun
Immortal we've become
Follow through the path of
The one who walks the sun
One who's not undone
One who shall become
A rampant wave from the sea

We shall bleed
Upon the seas of light
Stars shall set
Upon the fate of men

Dehumanize bones and blood evaporate
Benediction for decline
There is none to redeem, their souls are purified
Retaliate - Bring us forth to the light
Intervention from above
Mesmerize their god, all the sins will die
Rebirth

Walking through the sun
New world has begun
Immortal we've become
Follow through the path of
The one who walks the sun
One who's not undone
One who shall become
A rampant wave from the sea

Upon this trail we reap gods
Upon this trail we reap gods

Upon this trail then
We shall bleed
Upon the seas of light
Stars shall set
Upon the fate of men
We will breed
A whole new race of gods
Stars shall set
Upon the rise of Rome
