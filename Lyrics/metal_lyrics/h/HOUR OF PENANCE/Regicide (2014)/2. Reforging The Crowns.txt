The sons of the harbinger gods
Bred to know, not revere, nor submit
Through the dust they will shine with a sparkle of light
To rip the leash of flesh

Deceits of the worms of denial
They shall clean, no remorse to the end
All the traces of this venomous, degenerate sin
To lead the newborn king

Forward
I can see the red flag
Bathed in warm blood of defeat
I shall mold all the crowns
Into a scepter of ungodly delight

Dominus daemonius
Duce nos ultra nos
To the word of Akatosh
To the peak of absolute
Dominus daemonius
Duce nos ultra nos
Breathe the sun of Tiferet
Hear the sounds of Anahata

Feel the winds as they eat at your flesh
To perceive what is real, what is fear
Through the blades you shall pass and devour your heart
To free the chained god

Your throne shall be tainted with rust
This new creed will bereave the last sin
To the ultimate mean of reversing the cross
To lead the newborn king

Forward
I can see the red flag
Bathed in warm blood of defeat
I shall mold all the crowns
Into a scepter of ungodly delight

Dominus daemonius
Duce nos ultra nos
To the word of Akatosh
To the peak of absolute
Dominus daemonius
Duce nos ultra nos
Breathe the sun of Tiferet
Hear the sounds of Anahata
