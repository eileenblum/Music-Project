Seal me forever into ecstasy
The light exceeds all the binds
One mind oversees the loss of me
Seal me forever into this golden sea

Being devoured by thee
There's no good or evil deed
Free me from this
Nail that's binding me
To this fake delusive creed
Make this being free

I feel the world moving towards wild heights
Up on the top of a pile of bones
All the chances of contagion subside
Now I conceive how we deceive our mind

Burn alive this fake reflection
Burn our mind - Unrestricted

False philosophies
Spread to infect the medicine
Free me from those
Chains entrenching me
In this barren land of none
Make this being free

I feel this world moving towards wild heights
Up on the top of a pile of bones
All the chances of contagion subside
Now I conceive how we deceive our mind

Burn alive this fake reflection
Burn our mind - Unrestricted
