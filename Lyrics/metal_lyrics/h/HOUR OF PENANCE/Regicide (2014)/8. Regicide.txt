Striving for the sun at dawn
Blackened and torn, war has come

Ready for war, we cease to kneel
Suicide, it's live or die
We are the living proof
Regicide - all is falling

Breeding the fear to seep in thee
Suicide, we feed and cry
Upon this trail of blood - Deicide

We shall decimate
We shall deviate
Seething every single god
That shall impose catatonic creeds

Never see - Never be
All the lies and redemptions will die
Never trust who misguides
Never spare genocide

Never see - Never be
Feel the brink of renewal arise
Feed the lust of Lilith
Build the new house of filth

Veritas filia temporis

As we breathe the sun at dusk
Sound the horn, god is gone - Hail

We know no fear
Vengeance's scorn is here
They'll know the fear
They'll know the tears

Ripping the core - the kings appear
Crucify those feeble flies
Their world has come undone
Chastise - All is falling

Brick upon brick the walls stand high
Confide - the skies shall bow
To this immortal trial
To those who choose their will and feed

Never see - Never be
All the lies and redemptions will die
Never trust who misguides
Never spare genocide

Never see - Never be
Feel the brink of renewal arise
Feed the lust of Lilith
To deserve the gods feast
