Humiliate is dominate.

The curse of the weak is a spiral fall.
Powerless scream. The saviour is still unseen.
A mortal god stole my light and reshaped my pain.
Once again I'm the weak one, I'm shapeless for you.
Innocence, still laughing at me.
How could I revive its memory again?

No lesson learned. The enemy inside my head.
Last rosary of humiliation.
For I know what awaits me, I know that it's coming.
I know what awaits me, I know it's coming.
For I know what awaits me, I know that it's coming.
I know what awaits me, I know it's coming.

Secret prayer of my own disease.
"You are alone," says to me.
Sucking venom with unbearable greed.
Finally reshaped.

Negation of relief, once again.
To die some more, tied at the bed.
My plague won't end, my plague won't end.
I can't force my rejection back.
I'm your slave.
I'm your slave.

The echo of insanity is there.
Cannot fall asleep to chase it away.
I'm becoming part of a dream, your dream.
Reshape me and I'm reborn.
