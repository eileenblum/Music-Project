Now, now I see hate living through me.
Nature of savagery.

No longer unknown.
Crudely infected.
Evolution through internal gasp.
Your eyes will testify
the immense desolation of what is mine.

Corrosive breathing,
hatred keeps me alive.
I stretch my hand.
Your innocence is mine.

Turned into your misery.
Ripping the silence.
Transfixed with purple blade.
Undefeated realm of desperation.
Violence leading to relief.

Now, now I see hate living through me.
Nature of savagery.

A reign built on madness.
To dominate my own disease.
The biggest wound inside, that you cannot feed.
Your cries are useless relief.
Innocence crudely torn apart,
violated once more.

Metamorphosis.
The gift of pity I refuse.
In this pit you'll testify.
Innocence exiled, your soul is mine.
