Naked in front of effigies of the oppressor.
I obtain your submission.
Attention comes duly through my spine.
Won't miss the show.
Stimulation by sheer terror.

No time for to redeem myself.
Hunger comes to surface.
Fifteen stains of blood before it's over.

Show me the bone.
Handle me like a fly.

Wretchedly caught up in my delirium.
I make my whole world rumble for you.
Agony is the offering.
Sublimated smell of fear.

Feeding pleasure to mortification.
Inpending disaster.
Tossing my mind, depurate.
Pale emotions through swallowing screen.

Asexual reproduction in the pantheon of demigods.
Naked in front of the oppressor.
As my spine turns into ice, terror the only light.
I'm a believer, I'm a believer.
