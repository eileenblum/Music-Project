Join us, in this midnight black mass
Sorceress chant the incantations
Spilling blood of the virgin sinstress
Under the sacred moonlight

Altar priestess performs Satanic spells
Ceremonial blasphemous trance
Praising the goat, the lord Lucifer
With blackened debaucherous chants

Satanic witches fornicate and writhe
In ecstasy like serpents
Whilst choirs of obscenities intensify
A chalice of blood is drank

Sadistic orgies rage on untill dawn
The black candles burning
The sanctuary of divine evil
The rites of the Antichrist complete

Stained black hearts possessed
Powers of Satan unite
Baphomet's Disciples, ritual magick
Madness, angels of chaos

Inverted crosses adorn the heads of the insane
Chapel of Insidious Pain
Repent unto your Baphomet
