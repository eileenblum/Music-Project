The ships of Armageddon draw near
Us medieval brothers gather on this night
Summoning diabolic powers

Warcraft, the eve of destruction
Warcraft, barbaric brutality
Charred remains of soldiers
Once engaged in blood drenched battles
Victims of the apocalyptic reign
Funerals of the Damned
Mass Grave Burials

Warcraft, canvas of carnage
Warcraft, decimated heathens
Blackend ash fills the skies
Flesh ripped from fucking bones
Misery and morbid disease
The warriors ultimate demise
