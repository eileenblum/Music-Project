All will burn and all shall pay
Scream for me and die today
Don't ask why just fucking kill
Each may die it is my will

Feel my power in this place
Dreams of blood upon your face
Sense my hate, pure disdain
Pour your blood and feel the pain

All I know is that I hate
Stab your heart and masturbate
Evil spewing from my soul
I'm am in total control

Misanthropic Slaughter!
I am burning from inside
Your precious life is denied
Demons have now cleared my sight
Murder feels so right tonight!
Touch and feel life while you can
Death for you the final plan

Cannot stand it in my skin
Killing an enticing sin
Murdering sounds oh so grand
Take you down right where you stand

Smiling as I mock your cries
Emotion has left my eyes
When you scream it fills me up
Drain your blood into my cup

Man or child I'll kill and maim
Show your face, I'll do the same
In the air and from my heart,
God is here to tear apart

Misanthropic Slaughter
I am burning from inside
Your precious life is denied
Demons have now cleared my sight
Murder feels so right tonight
Touch and feel life while you can
Death for you the final plan
