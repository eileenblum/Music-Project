[Rettke/Paeth/Bilski]

In my dreams there's a fire
and a man tells me to beware
face to face I'm leaving to take care
if I get a desire
and I run like a devil's dare
face to face he takes me to his place

[BRIDGE:]
Say if it's real
or is it a tale, so what should I feel
he gives me his advice
I have to realize

[CHORUS:]
Don't ever touch the light
if you don't stand on the edge of time
touch the light
if you're ablazed from a neverending rising power

In my dreams I feel passion
and a man tells me to be strong
face to face he tells me right from wrong
oh, life could be an aggression
if you don't know where you belong
face to face he takes me to his place

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]
[SOLO]

[BRIDGE:]
Now I know that it's real
it's not been a tale, I know what I feel
I've failed to his advice
I have to realize

[CHORUS:]
Don't ever touch the light
if you don't stand on the edge of time
touch the light
and if you fail you will never dream again
