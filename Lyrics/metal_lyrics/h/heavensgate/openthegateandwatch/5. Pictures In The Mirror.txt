[Rettke/Paeth/Bilski]

Sound of breaking glass again
he's on the run and another fightin' stand
no way out there in the night
he's got no choice if he wants to win the fight

[BRIDGE:]
And he's waitin' for a view
but they set his heart on fire

[CHORUS:]
Pictures in the mirror
he is on the loose again
his wasted life is burning in his hand
pictures in the mirror
watch his face it turns to stone
those empty ways he always walks alone
pictures in the mirror

Now his back's against the wall
in the air a painfull call
another broken heart and soul
if noone helps it'a loosin' role

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]
[SOLO]
[CHORUS]
