[Rettke, Paeth, Bilski]

Save us from all those fairytales
We're livin' in a land of fantasies
Give us all those hopes and dreams
Together we could find a way to be free

Put your heart into the fire
An eternal flame is waiting for you
Put your heart into the fire
The only one that lives in my view
Believing in the best days of my life

Days are passing by
And I'm drifting through empty rooms
The rain keeps falling down, I'm living in sorrow
I waited for so long to get the answer
You know it's true
And when the night comes down
I wait for tomorrow

I know why you had gone away
Escaping from my heart
The chains of love were tearing us apart

Could we ever stay away from here
Could you understand I wish you were here
You always, always need a helping hand
Someone's walking through your life with you
A real good friend
