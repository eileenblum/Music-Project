[Rettke, Paeth, Bilski]

Back on the streets tonight
Startin' up the fight
Hassing through his deadly maze
In his hand the acid dreams
But it's not what it seems
We know it's a big disgrace

Lost souls in a dead-end-game
It's always been the same
He is the one to blame
And I hope his time will come
That he'll be on the run
His force will fade away

He's a sidewalk sinner
He never really felt the pain
He's the sidewalk sinner
He never really wants to care
For a brain he drives insane

He's a reckless fool
Judged by his own rules
Clean slate guy
Dealing lies by the gram
Lives his life like a jam
A fortune buy

Lost souls in a dead-end-game
It's always been the same
His force will fade away, fade away

Now listen, there's no doubt about
You're hunted by the deadlock crowd
There is no way for you to go
Without to move from devil's snow
