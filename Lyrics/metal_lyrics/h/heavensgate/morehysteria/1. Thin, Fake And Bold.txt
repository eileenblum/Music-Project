[Rettke, Paeth, Bilski]

Watch the time, take care of a beat from my soul
You're the one and I'm losing control
Always abandoned, lies were your game
Kicked in the teeth and it drives me insane

You tell fairytales but I need no advice
Now it's time for me and I'm breakin' the ice
Time have been changed now, I feel the alert
I'll be back and stick your face in the dirt
Yes I will!

In your fear you wanna run and hide
Rush, run and hide
I've been the loser, but I don't wanna lose my pride

Thin, fake and bold
