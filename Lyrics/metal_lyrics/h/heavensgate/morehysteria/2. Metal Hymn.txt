[Rettke, Paeth, Bilski]

Need an explanation
Times are changing slow
Careless generation?
It's time for you to know
Wipe out the pictures
You're keeping in your mind
We are the ones to change the world
There is one more to find

Oh, rock forever
We keep the world together
Oh, rock forever
We wanna play for our liberty tonight

Put some water to the desert of your soul
And try to catch the sense of honest rock'n'roll
We know your hearts will keep the faith within
So come on, raise your hands, and join the metal hymn

Night after night we walk around and sing together
No need to hide, just come along and join the metal hymn
