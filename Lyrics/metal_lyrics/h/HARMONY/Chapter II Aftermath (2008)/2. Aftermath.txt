[Music &amp; lyrics - Markus Sigfridsson]

Reaching deed within, find the inner me so torn,
How I yearn for more, strength to endure
My heart burst in grief, I can't take no more,
Oh, it burns in me. the so called truth

Let me run and let me hide. cry and fly into the night
Try my wings and find my way, be free

Watching the aftermath, of our deeds,
With fear for the afterlife,

A scar inside my soul, my wings ripped apart and torn.
By the visions of the end of all.

Let me run and let me hide, cry and fly into the night
Try my wings and find my way, be free

Watching the aftermath, of our deeds,
With fear for the afterlife.

Deception rules this game,
we all need someone to blame,
to close this game.

Watching the aftermath, of our deeds.
With fear for the afterlife,
Watching the aftermath, of our deeds,
With fear for the afterlife afterlife.
