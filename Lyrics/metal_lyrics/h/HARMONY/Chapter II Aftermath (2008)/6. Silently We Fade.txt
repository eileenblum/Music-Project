[Music &amp; lyrics - Markus Sigfridsson]

I reflect the silence the echoes of our past
I burn a candle hoping that you will return

So silently we'll fade away from what we are
To never be alone

I chase your light I cry out your name
I pray in silence I dream that you will return

So silently we'll fade away from what we are
We'll never be alone
So silently we'll fade into forevermore
To never be alone

See your face in a frame as innocent as before
Your eyes hold a secret forever we will endure

So silently we'll fade away from what we are
We'll never be alone
So silently we'll fade into forevermore
To never be alone
So silently we'll fade
we'll never be alone
I chase your light cry out your name
So silently we'll fade into forevermore
I chase your light cry out your name.
