[Music &amp; lyrics - Markus Sigfridsson]

In the darkest corner of my mind,
there has always been a battle
agitating craving thoughts

I'm Falling back to where I started,
always loosing control,
prisoner of all my faults

Hear the words,
a cry in the wind,
echoes from the past
See the man fall,
don't want these chains, no,
standing alone,
in the middle of the storm

Those are shadows all around me,
telling me to beware,
agitating craving words

My hands are shaking with desire,
betraying me to the dark,
prisoner of my own fear

Hear the words,
a cry in the wind,
Wasted years. Echoes from the past
See the man fall,
don't want these chains, no,
standing alone,
in the middle of the storm

I hear the sound of rain,
I hear the cry of deliverance,
I hear the sound of rain,
Relieving me again
I hear the sound o f rain,
I hear the cry of deliverance,
I hear the sound of rain,
Relieving me again
I hear the sound of rain,
I hear the cry of deliverance,
that wash my sins away
I hear the sound of rain,
Relieving me again
Sound of rain
