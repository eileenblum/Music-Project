[Music &amp; lyrics - Markus Sigfridsson]

Everytime you look into my eyes
I can fell my world is breaking
Weak as I am
And everytime you ask me how I am
I deny everything I know
Weak as I am

I wish I could hold on
I wish I could stand my ground
I'm losing all meaning
I pray you will catch my fall

Walk with me through fire
Cast all your sins upon me
Far away from heaven
Lay your eyes on me
Cry with me your weary
Tears that will bring salvation
Leave all your darkest fears behind
And face the new day

Every morning waking up in anger
I can see the world is changing
Weak as we are

I wish we could hold on
I wish we could stand our ground
We're loosing all meaning
I pray you will catch our fall

Walk with me through fire
Cast all your sins upon me
Far away from heaven
Lay your eyes on me
Cry with me you weary
Tears that will bring salvation
Leave all your darkest fears behind
And face the new day

Walk with through the fire
Cast all your sins upon me
Far away from heaven
Lay your eyes on me
Cry with me you weary
Tears that will bring salvation
Leave all your darkest fears behind
And face the new day.
