[Music &amp; lyrics - Tobias Enbert]

Day after day
There's struggle within me
To find my way
Through this oppression.To feel free,

I just want to know
Whom to lose and whom to keep near
Where can I go to avoid this sense of fear

Awake in my bed as
Time passes by
A war in my head raging. Tell me why?

Lord of all lords
King of all kings
Is there a place for inner peace?
Oh tell me please
Lord of all lords
Through eternities
I'm reaching for you I'm on my knees

They keep telling me
Who's fool and who's the wise
And how I should see
The surroundings through their eyes
Perplexed in my mind
But I'm trying to stand tall
I'm trying to find
My own path through it all

Awake in my bed as
Time passes by
A war in my head Raging tell me why?

Lord of all lords
King of all kings
Is there a place for inner peace?
Oh tell me please
Lord of all lords
Through eternities
I'm reaching for you I'm on my knees

... psalm 23 ...

Awake in my bed as
Time passes by
This war in my head still raging, tell me why?

Lord of all lords
King of all kings
I have to put my trust in you
What can I do?
Lord of all lords
Through eternities
I'm reaching for you Oh help me please
