[Music &amp; lyrics - Markus Sigfridsson]

I'm loosing faith again
When I see what I have done
Into the fire I go
I'm loosing faith in all
Cause my creed just made me fall

Across the sea I'll search
And down below I'll go
Awaken I'm shivering

I run from all pain
I run from all sorrow
For me to bear
Surrender in will
Oh please breathe me in

I fall in your hands again
But I fear where I have been
Out of the ashes I go
Reach deeper into me
Where it burns,and the bleeding won't stop

Across the sea I'll search
And down below I'll go
Awaken I'm shivering

I run from all pain
I run from all sorrow
For me to bear
Surrender in will
Oh please breathe me in

Please breathe me in
Help me feel alive
Please breathe me in
Awaken I'm shivering

I run from all pain
I run from all sorrow
For me to bear
Surrender in will
Oh please breath me in

I run from all pain
I run from all sorrow
For me to bear
Surrender in will
Oh please breathe me in

I run from all pain
I run from all sorrow
For me to bear
Surrender in will
Oh please breathe me in.
