[Music &amp; lyrics - Markus Sigfridsson]

The sky grows dark again,
As day turns to night
Rain clouds are gathering our judgement closing in

Pray from a new dawn
To greet us all.
Heaven and earth a new kingdom to come

We've danced with the devil, oh for so long.
It has enslaved us all, I can't believe it,

I will fear no evil
I will find the kingdom
I will fight this dark world until the day I die
I will fear no evil
I will change the future
I will roam these dark lands until I find the kingdom

The words are spoken leaving us with fear
The days are truly darker but, I still, so bright to the world

Walk away from this world
And all it's promises,
Heaven above and our earth,is about to dissolve,

We've danced with the devil,
Oh, for so long,
It has enslaved us all,
Oh, for so long,

I will fear no evil
I will find the kingdom
I will fight this dark world until the day I die
I will fear no evil
I will change the future
I will roam these dark lands until I find the kingdom

I'm so tired of this dance,
My goal will always be the same
Never surrender to this world,

I will fear no evil
I will find the kingdom
I will fight this dark world

I will fear no evil
I will find the kingdom
I will fight this dark world until the day I die

I will fear no evil
I will change the future,
I will roam these dark lands until I find the kingdom

I will fear no evil
I will find the kingdom
I will fight this dark world until the day I die

I will fear no evil
I will change the future,
I will roam these dark lands until I find the kingdom
