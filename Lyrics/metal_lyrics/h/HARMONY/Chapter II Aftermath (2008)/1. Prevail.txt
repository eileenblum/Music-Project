[Music &amp; lyrics - Markus Sigfridsson]

We will abandon what we have done and the remains of our sin
And we will seek to find our home in these wasted lands
This time we reach for solace high into the night
In silence we all pray to find strength to break the bonds

In the presence of our enemies
We will prevail
Through darkness and tribulation
We still remain

Don't preach to us your made up doctrine's of disorder and decree
They used to bring us to our knees
But now they make us see
This time we reach for solace high into the night
In silence we all pray to find strength to break the bonds

In the presence of our enemies
We will prevail
Through darkness and tribulation
We still remain

I wish you could see me now
Causing a wind fire
You will never betray me again

We will abandon what we have done and the remains of our sin
And we will seek to find our home in these wasted lands
This time we reach for solace high into the night
In silence we all pray to find strength to break the bonds

In the presence of our enemies
We will prevail
Through darkness and tribulation
We still remain
