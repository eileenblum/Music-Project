[Music &amp; lyrics - Markus Sigfridsson]

Don't you remember my name now,
Here at the end of all things.
I am the on that you lived for
And the one that you killed

Don't you remember my words now
Here at the turn of the tide
I am the one that you clinged to
I heard your call every night.

Am I too blind to see to trust in these words
Am I too numb to feel what will become of me.

Don't turn away the path before you all clear
Don't turn away one thought and nothing is lost
Don't turn away from me now

I weep over you when you cry
It is a thorn in my side
But if i lead will you follow
Me to the end of the times

Am I too blind to see to trust in these words
Am I too numb to feel what will become of me

Don't turn away the path before you lies all clear
Don't turn away one thought and nothing is lost
Don't turn away from me now
don't turn away the path before you lies all clear
don't turn away one thought and nothing is lost
don't turn away from me now
one thought and nothing is lost
