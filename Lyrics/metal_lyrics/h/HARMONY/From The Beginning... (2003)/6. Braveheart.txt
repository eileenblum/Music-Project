Wallace was born around thousand two hundred
Called the greatest hero in Scotland
The fight for it's freedom never ends

Their battles were legend
Their land was it's main ally
Kings, lands, power never could touch the skies

With their sword, and his soul
And his spirit when it flies
For a long time will remember your name
Long it was the way toward a freeman
But you will always be one braveheart

He was a warrior without fear to anything
A fight with his sword
A poet from the heart

My land, my son, for them I'll give my life
Years will go by but I'll never surrender

With their sword, and his soul
And his spirit when it flies
For a long time will remember your name
Long it was the way toward a freeman
But you will always be one...

"hey, fight and you may die
Run and you'll live at least a while
And dying in your beds many years from now
Would you be willing to trade all the days
From this day to that
For one chance, just one chance,
To come back here and tell our enemies
That they may take our lives
But they'll never take our freedom... freedom!!!"
[William Wallace]
