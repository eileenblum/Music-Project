I cannot write of love
I never find the right words
That will reflect in my life

The problems to express me
Saying that I can love you
From me it no longer sound so real

Of that which I was at sometime
Today is not more than a lost man

Alone your smiling face is inspiration
This empty mind is my divine creation
And of your face those tears they finally
Make me speak with the heart

When looking to your eyes
I feel it's all divine
No one will ever separate us
And when remembering I will smile
