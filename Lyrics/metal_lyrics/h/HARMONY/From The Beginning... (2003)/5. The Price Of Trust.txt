I can't take this any longer
Your selfishness will posses you
Eventhough my efforts you see

The deception filled me with pain
To understand your supremacy
There is no sense are you a different man

That the honesty
Of your promises, you look at me
I never requested
Anything, navigating in your stupid
Indifference, what your promises
That you never complete

And he doesn't care
Because you know that some day
I will wake up of the late dream
That it forges in my mind
And when I wake up... I will scream (I will scream)
And the mortal sound
To your hear will deafen
