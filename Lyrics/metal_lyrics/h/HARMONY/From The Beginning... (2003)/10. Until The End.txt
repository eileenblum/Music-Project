A long time ago
In a distant land
A great love lived
That I have not been able to forget
Where we could be happy
Where we could be born
Never pushed to return there
I'll never dream again

Father please, give me all your forces
Never leave me all alone

I harmed you so much
I lost all your great love
All it allows it to die
All the love if you died

Please return, to my side again
But I will never move away from you

I will never change
I will never leave you
The shade of the wrong
It will follow me forever
Demons have my soul
The angels save their place
In this time nobody gives anything

My love tries to help me
Without you I will never achieve it

Please don't forget me
You looked me and you healed my pain
Touch me and you took me with you

As the birds they can sings
As the wind they can fly
My life will continue
Forever with you, until the end

As the sun light up your life
And the night darkens at mine
Our souls joined forever
They will from here to eternity

You lost the feeling toward me
Caught by the deadly sins of desire
Disappeared is the past of your life
You quit me to die and disregard

The time will tell that truth
As the shade they will fall every night
My life in you will be
Forever from here to eternity
And dying in this life
You'll leave with me
My soul, my heart and everything my love

I swear you that some day
Will be together again
Much time passed to live forever

As the birds they can sings
As the wind they can fly
My life will continue
Forever with you, until the end

As the sun light up your life
And the night darkens at mine
Our souls joined forever
They will from here to eternity

I swear you that some day
Will be together again
Much time passed to live forever.
