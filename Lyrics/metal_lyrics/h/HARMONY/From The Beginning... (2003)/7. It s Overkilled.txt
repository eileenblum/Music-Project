Compassion is by virtue of the lords
The truth is the breeze of the justice
Principles that must endure

I will always, follow my destiny
And I will fight against
The enemy
It's overkill
Never could be free

Where the spirits carry on
Innocent people that their life gave
Principles that must endure

I will always, follow my destiny
And I will fight against
The enemy
It's overkill
Never could be free

The blood of the right one
Spilled by centuries
For knights sword believing in their sins
They don't fear to the death
The force of these men
Was born the wrath from their souls
So much of hate (so much of hate)
So much of evil (so much of evil)
That sometime lived
And the land could reign towards
The misty darkness
Where the beast lives
Deceives at those men
Forever always live... forever always live!!!
