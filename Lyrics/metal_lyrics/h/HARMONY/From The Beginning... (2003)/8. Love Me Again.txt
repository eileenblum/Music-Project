The fear in your eyes
That you leave when you pass
Sweet dreams, some day
The hope in your soul
Night to night..remember
The sweetness of your skin
Your insane desire
To love me again

It will return to you the love that freezed it's to be
In your hands must be the force that help you to see

Close your eyes
And the time never quit to die
Our love will be born again
In your soul, in your heart
Only the sweet love
Will last in the time forever

Listen to the wind
It's my voice the one that calls
It's my voice the one that implores
It's my heart that is crying
Hard is the way toward you
Take my hand and come with me
Where nobody will reach us
Where nobody will arrive

It will return to you the love that freezed it's to be
In your hands must be the force that help you to see

Close your eyes
And the time never quit to die
Our love will be born again
In your soul, in your heart
Only the sweet love
Will last in the time
