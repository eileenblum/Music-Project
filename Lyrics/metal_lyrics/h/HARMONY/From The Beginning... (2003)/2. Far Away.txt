Can see the fury that poisons your mind
The one that blinded your conscience (in your conscience)
After so much time of playing with death
The moment has come to look back

His ironic laughter shudders it's being
And forces him to be his most loyal servant

From the dreadful bewitching he wakes
It feels cold in the heart (cold to wake up)
Cruel odyssey, master piece of pain
In her name you sowed the tears and wastes

His ironic laughter shudders it's being
And forces him to be his most loyal servant
Don't must forget your mission in this world
Is to spread eternal fear and in my name you shall kill

His ironic laughter shudders it's being
And forces him to be his most loyal servant
Don't must forget your mission in this world
Is to spread eternal fear and in my name you shall kill.
