I have the secret to live
I have the power to ride on the sky
Forever and ever my spirit will soar

I have the key to open your heart
Give me your sins and I'll give you my dreams
I will be always who rules at this game

In this place:
In this time
I will never return
In this game there is no control
I will never let you leave

Save your time
Forever and ever try
The eternal flame kept burning on and on
Take the sky
And never wait your right
So long alone his walking to the sun... so long alone

You feel so small and miserable man
Trying to regret the above mentioned
Looking for an exit for your sins

I will never escape
I will never return
Pray for a miracle and looking for a better way

Save your time
Forever and ever try
The eternal flame kept burning on and on
Take the sky
And never wait your right
So long alone his walking to the sun... so long alone!!!
