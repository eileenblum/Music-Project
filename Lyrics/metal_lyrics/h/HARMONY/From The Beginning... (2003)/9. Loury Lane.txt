How many stories would have to pass
To bring back my dreams again
Looking for you in a lonely place
Without you I cannot runaway

If you would not wonder to another place
From the sky a fallen star you would be alive again

Laurylane... majesty and magic
Laurylane... she's madness from the dark

Cold winds from the south
Will take me to the sun
To the land of fantasy
Don't leave me here down in this place
Runaway from reality

If you would not wonder to another place
From the sky a fallen star you would be alive again

Laurylane... majesty and magic
Laurylane... she's madness from the dark
Laurylane... majesty and magic
Laurylane... she's madness from the dark.

Forever.
