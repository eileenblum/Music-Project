Lies, theyÂ´re wherever I may go
What is a lie? WhatÂ´s the truth? How will I know?
Fear, Is the result that I see, of peoples greed
Bringing this world to misery

In times when I canÂ´t see whatÂ´s wrong or whatÂ´s right
You help me see things clearly, youÂ´re my eyes, youÂ´re the light

WouldnÂ´t know where to turn
WouldnÂ´t know what to do
DonÂ´t wanna live, without you
WouldnÂ´t know what to say
WouldnÂ´t find my way
WouldnÂ´t make it through without you
Without you

Earth, Will it ever stop to bleed
A world in misery, caused by humans greed
Wars, are raging everywhere
But do we care, as long as weÂ´re not there

When I feel insecure, no help seems to be found
You take me by my hand, put my feet on solid ground

WouldnÂ´t know where to turn
WouldnÂ´t know what to do
DonÂ´t wanna live, without you
WouldnÂ´t know what to say
WouldnÂ´t find my way
WouldnÂ´t make it through without you
Without you

I close my eyes, thinking of you
And I see us two together
In a time when my life is through
ItÂ´s a time, in a land of forever

Sometimes I feel alone, and no one seems to care
But you are by my side, and you will always be there
