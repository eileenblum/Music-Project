Someone told you thereÂ´s a paradise
An afterlife in peace, where no one cries

Can it be there is a place beyond the skies?
Is this the truth, or the greatest among lies?

Someone told you thereÂ´s a place called hell
An afterlife in darkness, there to dwell

When youÂ´re buried six feet deep into the ground
By whom will your soul be found?

Eternity
Where do you wanna be?
You must face the truth to see
Eternity
Waits for all of thee
Just one man can set you free

Someone told you thereÂ´s a man called Christ
Come to earth in love to save our lives (He said)

ThereÂ´s a way to paradise and itÂ´s through me
Not your works, only I can set you free

Eternity
Where do you wanna be?
You must face the truth to see
Eternity
Waits for all of thee
Just one man can set you free

We are all heading for eternity
