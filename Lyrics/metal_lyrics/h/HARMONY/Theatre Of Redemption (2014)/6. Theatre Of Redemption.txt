I remember when we used to play
I remember how you used to feel
I remember what you used to say
But something remains
I remember why, why we prayed
Now we don't fear them

I am on your side
And I will go
Into this theatre of redemption
In the deepest memories of you
You alone were singing a song
Your troubles, they were washed away
But something remained
I remember why we prayed
Now we don't fear them

I am on your side
And I will go
Into this theatre of
Redemption
I will not ever let you walk alone
I'll be there for you
I will not ever let you turn to stone
I'll be there for you

I am on your side
And I will go
Into this theatre of
Redemption
I will not ever let you walk alone
I'll be there for you
I will not ever let you turn to stone
I'll be there for you
