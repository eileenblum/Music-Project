Dark are the days of our past
In the light you think you are
You rest in the shades of tranquility
Your mind comes alive
Brings back your desire
And wakes you up
I will not hold you to your word again
Cause we will contend for the same fate

Remember all that we've seen
Our memories are endless
Revive me, for all that we've done
Take me back and crown me king
In misery we have walked
In the light you think I am
Remembering you with a smile
Left a thorn in my side
In sorrow we're bound
We long for yesterday
I will not hold you to your word again
Cause we will contend for the same fate

Remember all that we've seen
Our memories are endless
Revive me, for all that we've done
Take me back and crown me king
I'm in a restless dream
You are in the realm of the real
If I could only make you fell
We'll be here forever

Remember all that we've seen
Our memories are endless
Revive me, for all that we've done
Take me back and crown me king
