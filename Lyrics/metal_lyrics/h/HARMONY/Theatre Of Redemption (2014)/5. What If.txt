Always nice and shiny
Always fit for fight
Never show no weakness, always strive to look alright
Always keep my head high
No matter what's within
Never need nobody, never let nobody in
Try my best to adapt
I try to stand in line
Living up to what's expected
If I'm choosing "your" path
Will I do just fine?
Will I be someone respected?
Got a descent job
Got a shiny car
Living by the rule: possessions define who we are
Got a nice position
In my community
Still these thoughts of endless treadmills never leaves me be
Try my best to fit in
I try to stand in line
Living up to what's expected
If I'm choosing "your" path
Will I do just fine?
Will I be someone respected?

What if?
We're wasting what's important
Push aside the fact its more than meets the eye
What if?
Our actions are building bridges to the other side
A divine path
Try so hard to become
What you want me to be
I work so hard for all of you, for you to embrace me
Can I rule my future?
Or is it all destiny?
Am I a prisoner of expectations, am I free?
In a world of facades
And minds as hard as steel
Who can know whose false, and what's real?

Sometimes I'm dreaming
A dream where we all can be
Just what we feel like
Come walk, walk with me
