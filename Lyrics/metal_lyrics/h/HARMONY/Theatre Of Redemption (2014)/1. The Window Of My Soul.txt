Bring me her, the one to guide me
Save my soul, from the withering illusion
Call her name, her name to save me
Send her here, here to bring us prosperity
I will forever embrace
The light you will give to me
Never will I be all alone
Walk beside me

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Why can't we see eye to eye
She's the fairest of them all
The window of my soul
Mirror, magic eye to eye
Left without her I will fall
Her light completes me now
She's the window of my soul
Bring me her, one to fulfill me
Save my soul, from the doubt that shadows me
Call her name, her name to save me
Send her here, home to bring us prosperity
I will forever embrace
The light you will give to me
Never will I be all along
Walk beside me

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Why can't we see eye to eye
She's the fairest of them all
The window of my soul
Mirror, magic eye to eye
Left without her I will fall
Her light completes me now
She's the window of my
Don't you forget it my friend
You can hold me to this oath
When you face sorrow on your way
