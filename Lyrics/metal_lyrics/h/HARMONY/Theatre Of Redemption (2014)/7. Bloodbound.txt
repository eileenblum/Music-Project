I will turn the night to day, for you I'll surrender to this life, and it's melodies
I will make this dream come true, in your memory
I will sing this song for you, if you believe

He looked into her eyes, and he was chained forever
His spirit broken down, free no more, oh, not ever
Her strength took him down, he is pierced by her ill will
Nothing to lead him on, history now is gone, he's lost in the storm
When the night falls, he can feel her shadow call
A life in solitude, alone with the scorn of a wound

He see's inside the window of a weary soul
Through the mist of tears, a shine of dark beauty in her eyes
Poison runs in her veins, he's under her control
Still they remain as one in oblivion with time
They speak through the walls, my sweet, now, don't you cry
Her secrets she refuse to admit,
Why can't you, my truth reveal
Please let me in, I will surrender to you
He leads her on, history now is gone, they are lost in a dream
When the night falls, he can feel her shadow rising high
A life in solitude, alone with the scorn of a wound
