I gazed at the end of the rainbow
I was blinded by all that could be mine
I reached out with all of my pride
I was damned
By the hands that hold the time
I felt the need to go so far
Cause I was made to be a star

I fell from grace
I tried to rule the world
How I was cut down to the ground
I gave it all for nothing
I chose a way that was fatal
I flew high up against the strongest wind
I embraced the dark in my mind
I knew I would be the strongest one
I felt the need to go so far
Cause I was made to be the star

I fell from grace
I tried to rule the world
How I was cut down to the ground
I gave it all for nothing
I am, the bright morning star
First of men, created in light
I am, the son of the morning
I'm falling into grace
Through the dark into the light...
I felt the need to go so far
Cause I was made to be the star

I fell from grace
I tried to rule the world
How I was cut down to the ground
I gave it all for nothing
I fell from grace
I tried to rule the world
How I was cut down to the ground
I gave it all for nothing
