Sometimes a life can feel like a living hell
A fight where you can't be
Saved by the bell
I had nothing left to give
I struggled until I lost my will to live
Though I knew, still
You were always there
In my search of solid ground
You will always care
This is what I found

Harmony I finally found my peace
And now I'm free
In someone who will be
There for me
Always and forever there for me
I found my harmony
In times of ignorance
In times of hate
You bring deliverance
Restoring my faith
When darkness comes over me
And blinds my eye
Your presence makes me see
You hold my head up high
You are always there
In our search of solid ground
You will always care
This is what I found

Harmony I finally found my peace
And now I'm free
In someone who will be
There for me
Always and forever there for me
I found my harmony
