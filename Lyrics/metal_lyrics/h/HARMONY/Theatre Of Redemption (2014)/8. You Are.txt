I try to walk a path where, I belong
I try to find out what is right, and what is wrong
I try to walk the path you
Want me to
Please watch my steps please,
Guide me through
See me
See how I try
In tears and in shame
Hear me
Hear me when I cry
Cry out your name

You are
The one who heals a scar
You're the one, above all
You are
Brighter than a star
You're there to catch me when I fall
Sometimes my path is clear and my spirit's free
Sometimes my mind goes numb, and darkness surrounds me
I now know you walk beside,
And help me through
I found the purpose of my path, and it's you
See me
See how I try
In tears and in shame
Hear me
Hear me when I cry
Cry out your name

You are
The one who heals a scar
You're the one, above all
You are
Brighter than a star
You're there to catch me when I fall
Sometimes I wonder if
You're really there
If you are beside me if you really care
Over and over you're
Comforting me
You're always present to
Make me see
