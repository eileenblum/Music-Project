When this day reaches its end
Will you open the door for me
When the dark closes in
Need a reason to go on
Afraid you won't remember
Afraid to let you in

Now I will turn back with the hands of time
And lay my life, on the line
Tear down these walls, for you to clearly see
While the light prevails the night
When the fire, has burned out
I need a way to get to you
The light is closing on me now
But still I must carry on
I pray you will remember
Afraid to let you in

Now I will turn back with the hands of time
And lay my life, on the line
Tear down these walls, for you to clearly see
While the light prevails the night
