You have heard it's not possible
There's no way you can make it through
You have heard that it's never done before
But do they know the strength in you?
Rise above
Kill the thoughts of fear and disbelief
Get rid of
All mind destroying thieves

Inhale
And be ready for the run
A journey just began
Be what you were meant to be (you) won't fail
Keep your aim for the sky
Just spread your wings and fly
They will carry you, you'll see
Feel the power rising in your mind
Chase your dreams, chase what's buried in your heart
Leave the fear, and the weakness behind
And make a fresh start
Rise above
Kill the thoughts of fear and disbelief
Get rid of
All mind destroying thieves

Inhale
And be ready for the run
A journey just began
Be what you were meant to be (you) won't fail
Keep your aim for the sky
Just spread your wings and fly
They will carry you, you'll see
There'll be times,
When you stumble and you fall
Rise up, keep walking
Cause we are reaching for a higher call
This is put inside of, inside of us all
