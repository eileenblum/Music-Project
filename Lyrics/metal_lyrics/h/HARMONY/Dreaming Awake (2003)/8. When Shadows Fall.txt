Rain is falling
Loading my heart with sorrow
Shadows are calling
Making me fear tomorrow

Crossroad after crossroad I face
Feels like my ways are in darkness embraced
Time after time I change my way
Fighting myself day after day

Oh when darkness falls
The words will lead my way like a light on my trail
Oh when the shadows fall
I will walk that way
It is like a light on my path

Tears are falling
Ancient words appear
I hear a calling
Open my eyes to see

The words amaze me
TruthÂ´s revealed by the wisdom within
Like my spirit being set free
I hold on to this, it makes me see

Oh when darkness falls
These words will lead my way like a light on my trail
Oh when the shadows fall
I will walk this way
Cause itÂ´s the light on my path

Feels like my life has itÂ´s own predicted ways
Seems like my time is now, not yesterday, nor tomorrow
