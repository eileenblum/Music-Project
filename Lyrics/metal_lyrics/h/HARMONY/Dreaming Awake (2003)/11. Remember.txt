Sunrise, th garden of Eden was facing its first day
A paradise on earth, and it was meant to stay that way

Now we are fighting wars, thinking weÂ´re smart - ItÂ´s insane!
We say weÂ´re bringing peace, but weÂ´re only bringing pain

The past canÂ´t be redone, we all know so well
Have we made paradise into a living hell?

Remember, if tomorrowÂ´s the final day
Still plant your free anyway

A silent reflection, a thought of what once was
Would it still be there, it it wasnÂ´t for us

We say we conquer all, for all times weÂ´re here to stay
It doesnÂ´t make any sense, feels like weÂ´re fading away

Sometimes itÂ´s easier to give up and give in
But as wise man said: Run the race to win
