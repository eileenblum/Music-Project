Living in a world of vanity and greed
Will this hide us, hide us from whatÂ´s true?

When the night falls, fears and silent whispers
Then the dreams come, bringing shades of light

Sounds like... a roar of a lion
Calls everlasting, calls reminding us, of the time of the fall of man

Fall of man
The fall of man

Our time is running out, weÂ´re out of control
And mankind doesnÂ´t know, know where to go

In our minds, someoneÂ´s coming
In our hearts, like a strength growing

Sounds like... a roar of a lion
Calls everlasting, calls reminding us, of the time of the fall of man

Fall of man
The fall of man

ItÂ´s time to turn back, turn back to what once was
Renew the life again, let the spirit be led
Fight for what is true, reveal what is not
Let this non prove, he can change the greatest fall

Sounds like the roar of a lion
ItÂ´s the call of the one, who alters the fall of man
