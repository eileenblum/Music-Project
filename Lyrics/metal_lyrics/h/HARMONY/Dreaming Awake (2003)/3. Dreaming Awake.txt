I woke up in a dream
And IÂ´m facing twisted shadows
On a journey through no manÂ´s land

No light is present
But still thereÂ´s no sign of the dark
ItÂ´s a place where no oneÂ´s been before

I look ahead
IÂ´m looking back
Standing at the east
Then towards the west
Still thereÂ´s no sign to lead the way

Dreaming awake, please tell me
Will it ever end?
Fantasy or reality
Is this the end of my road?

I walk in my own footprints
Is this a land of eternal sand?
On a journey through no manÂ´s land

IÂ´ll wait for a sign
I pray for a way
IÂ´m on my knees
Crying for relief
Take me away from this nightmare

Dreaming awake, please tell me
Will it ever end?
Fantasy or reality
Is this the end of my road?

Dreaming awake, Oh, now I know
This is true and real
Reality, not fantasy
I have to go through all of this
