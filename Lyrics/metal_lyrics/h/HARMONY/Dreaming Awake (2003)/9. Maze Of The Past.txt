Sometimes I can see it in your eyes
You are carrying burdens from the past
Yesterday is hunting like a shadow

YouÂ´re always awake so late at night
Cause dreams of the past
Keep you away from the light
YouÂ´re wandering around, in a maze of the past

Memories, burning on and on
Like old stories
I wish they were gone

You know where you are, where youÂ´ve been
Still you feel lost and alone
You know who you are, what to believe
Stumbling in the dark

I know youÂ´re dreaming of daylight
But your memories wonÂ´t let it through
YouÂ´re hiding in darkness that you donÂ´t know

In desperation, you search for a key
To close the door behind you
Forget about the past that binds you

Memories, burning on and on
Like old stories
I wish they were gone

You know where you are, where youÂ´ve been
Still you feel lost and alone
You know who you are, what to believe
Stumbling in the dark
