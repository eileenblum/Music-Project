Have you seen him walking?
Have you seen him trying hard to breathe?
There's nothing left to lose, when you've lost truth.

This road is worn with thousands of my own footsteps.
I'm torn between the light and the dark, my eyes can see no more.

Stop, you're moving farther and farther away from the path that brought you here.
I've been watching you fall into the dark, but this isn't the end.

When will you stop to realize that this world is limitless?
'Cause you're far too strong, and this love won't stop.
So tell me why won't you be there, why would you take this away?
This bond is too strong to break.

Breathe for me one last time, let me know you're alive.
My eyes can see no more, my heart can beat no more.

Why won't you be there, why would you take this away?
You're crawling out of sight.
This bond is too strong to break.
This bond is too strong to break.

When will you stop to realize that this world is limitless?
'Cause you're far too strong, and this love won't stop.
So tell me why won't you be there, why would you take this away?
This bond is too strong to break.

I will never stop fighting.
I will bring you back.
This journey is my own.

I've been watching you fall into the dark.
I've been watching you fall into the dark
