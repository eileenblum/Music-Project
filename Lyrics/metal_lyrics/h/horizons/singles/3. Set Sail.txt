If I had a second chance I'd take the time
Take a minute to find out why I am this way.
I've been trying to love not to push you away

So if I had a life planned I'd promise to stay and never push you away
You wished I called and I know it's my fault that I'm living my dream this way (living my dream this way)

Please tell me why I'm stuck inside (stuck inside)
After all these years I'm losing my mind

We are winding through a world neither distant nor our own.
A constant struggle to find the center of what we are.
Look beyond yourself, look beyond what is (what is), and find your peace.

So if I had a life planned I'd promise to stay and never push you away
You wished I called and I know it's my fault that I'm living my dream this way

We find solace in those we have not lost.
We find misery in humanity.
Look past the paradox.
Look past yourself
And know we are all living all the same.
I see your struggle as it becomes my own.
I see your struggle.

You've been here waiting,
I've called back hoping
That another life isn't intended for me,
I plan to come back, I'm never too far away.
It's time to realize I'm not alone.
I'm sick of hearing that I'm on my own.
I feel like everybody's giving up on me,
So please don't give up on me

So if I had a life planned I'd promise to stay and never push you away (push you away)
You wished I called and I know it's my fault that I'm living my dream this way (living my dream this way)
So if I had a life planned I'd promise to stay and never push you away
You wished I called and I know it's my fault that I'm living my dream this way
(I breathe, I see, and this is what makes me free
I breathe, I see, and this is what makes me free)
