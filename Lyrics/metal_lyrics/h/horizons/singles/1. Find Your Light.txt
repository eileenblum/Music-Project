I am reborn.
You start this chapter alone,
but you will never forget this.
Another sign, truly divine in its calling (calling).
With tears in our eyes, we watch the skyline (skyline).

Cause I've been thinking.
What would you say if we could start over?
We're moving up,moving up
I wouldn't change a thing,
this is our reality, and I'm moving on.

Look up, there is a new light.
While you chase the sunset,
your peace will never come.
I will forget your name.
I will forget your face,
but I will never truly understand what has taken me here.

What would you say if we could start over?
We're moving up, moving up
I wouldn't change a thing,
this is our reality, and I'm moving on.

Look up, there is a new light. (and I'm moving on)
While you chase the sunset,
your peace will never come (will never come).

After all this listening,
we've finally found out where we belong.
I feel like I have lost it all. (Moving on)

What would you say if we could start over?
We're moving up, moving up
I wouldn't change a thing,
this is our reality, and I'm moving on.

What would you say if I,
kept myself from living this life.
all over and over again.
I feel like I've been holding you from
all of it, oh
