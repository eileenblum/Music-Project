This is a time to reunite
I am freezing (I am freezing)
And nothing feels right
Nothing feels right!

Come back, feel this, I am never alone
Breathe in, breathe deep, I don't want to go home
Let it out, don't hide from your fears
Let it out, I'm sick of your tears

I am living in fear
I am drowning in tears

Don't let me fall to my descent
The time is now for you to pick me off the ground
(To pick me off the ground)
I promise I won't forget.
I won't forget, I won't forget!
I won't forget!

Falling into the depths of eternity
Falling into the depths of eternity
When you fail, I expect there to be a second chance
Like you would for me
I arrive without a doubt in my mind.
Realize life's undefined
Life's undefined

Is this the place I want to be
(Are these the sights I want to see)
Is this who we want to be
(Is this all you want from me)

Can you hold a candle to the fear inside of you
Can you hold a candle to the fear inside of you
This cannot be my final breath
These will not be my final words
Nothing (nothing) is written in stone

I am living in fear
I am drowning in tears
I am living in fear
I am drowning in tears

Don't let me fall to my descent
The time is now for you to pick me off the ground
(To pick me off the ground)
I promise I won't forget
I won't forget!
