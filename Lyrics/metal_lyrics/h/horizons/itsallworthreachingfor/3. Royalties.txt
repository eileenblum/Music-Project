Just push me out the way.
I'm not the one who's going to be your easy break.

This is my home, it was my everything.
Now that it's gone, I'm left here to say:

Just let it go,
be strong, stand up to it and make it happen
You better know.
I couldn't be
the one to finally embrace my fear.
You're in the clear.

Just let it go, I need a barrier.
You need someone to push down.
You need to bury this.
Put it six feet in the ground.

I think therefore I am just a feeble hearted man.
I am not your god, where did we go wrong.
This is not your home. It belongs to me.
This is not your place. I won't set it free.

I won't set it free.

This is not your home. It belongs to me.
This is not your place. I won't set it free.

I'll take it back, don't underestimate me.
You better be waiting 'cause I will be coming for you.

This is not our fate.
You're risking everything.
I won't sit here alone.
For me, just let this go.

Just let it go,
be strong, stand up to it and make it happen
You better know.
I couldn't be
the one to finally embrace my fear.
You're in the clear.

I won't set it free.
Come on.
I won't set it free.
