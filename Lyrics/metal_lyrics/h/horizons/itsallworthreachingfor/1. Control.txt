A whispered wind, a broken life
I'm everything you took in stride
Find a way to sidestep the bullet
Your time is up and the clock's still ticking
I am not waiting for anyone
I am not waiting for you

You think you're in control
But you're just rolling with the punches
And I see right through you
(I see right through you)
You think you're in control
But you're just rolling with the punches
And I see right through you
(Right through you)

So watch your back and understand me 'cause I believe
('cause I believe)

I'll try to make you see
This is bigger than you and me
Make you understand
This was not part of the plan

I'll try to make you see
This is bigger than you and me
Make you understand
This was not part of the plan

You think you're in control
But you're just rolling with the punches
And I see right through
(Right through you)

So watch your back and understand me 'cause I believe
('cause I believe)
So watch your back and understand me
'Cause I couldn't let it be
('cause I couldn't let it be)

Fight for a chance to have it all
(to have it all)
The world is waiting for you
(The world is waiting for you)
