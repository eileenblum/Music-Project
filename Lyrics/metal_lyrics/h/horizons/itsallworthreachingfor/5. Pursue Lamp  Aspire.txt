I am losing faith in you.
I can not see this through.
I am losing faith in you.
I can not see this through.
Now you see me for what I really am to you.
Deep down, you'll find that our fate still lies within our hands.
Deep down, you'll find that our fate still lies within our hands.
Take a chance, just this time.
This is not a chance for me to take.
Take a chance, just this time.
I could never unfold this side again.
You do not have to be a part of what brings you down.
It's all just a game of uncertainty (uncertainty).
When will you come to your senses and understand this?
When will you see this through? You're all I know.
There is a place for us to go.
I would never find a way down without you (without you).
I'd finally run away from a picture perfect world for a day of composure
(You do not have to have be a part of what brings you down.
It's all just a game of uncertainty).
This is not where I should be.
I'm falling farther and farther from being free.
I am not the man I was.
Counting second after second until I climb back up.
As the stars begin to fall,
I believe that you have the time to see it all.
I could show you a world that is hidden outside these brick walls; a great unknown.
It's time for me (time for me) to realize this place
isn't what it used to be and I'll set you you free.
