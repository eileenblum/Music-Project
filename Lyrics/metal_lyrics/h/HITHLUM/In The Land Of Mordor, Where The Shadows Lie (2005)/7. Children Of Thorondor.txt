The Eagles, they fly so high
Monitoring all with strong eyes
Swooping down on Middle-Earth
Mighty and wise

The Eagles fly
Friends to Gandalf
And enemies of Orcs

Upon Orthanc, Gandalf laid
By wings of mighty, he was saved

Oh the Eagles, they will speak to him
To help the cause and kill through the wind

Above the mountains they fly so high
They see all with mighty eyes

Long before Men they lived
Looking over the ground beneath them
In the final battle they fought
From skies above

The Eagles, they fly so high
Monitoring all with strong eyes
Swooping down on Middle-Earth
Mighty and wise

The Eagles fly
Friend to Gandalf
And enemies of Orcs

Upon Orthanc, Gandalf laid
By wings of mighty, he was saved

Oh the Eagles speak to him
To help the cause and kill through the wind
Above the mountains they all fly
They see all with mighty eyes
