I walk through the forest, Fangorn
As an old man cloacked with my staff
The fire if all that is left
The smoke of Isengard soon I will spread
For my spies, bird, wolf and man
Shall inform me of all their plans

I know the path you walk, I know the beast you stalk
For Men are are now my prey, I foresee all thei days

My colors once ran white
Now the oil coils around my cloak
In the forest once I did walk
But now I'll burn them all down

I know the path you walk, I know the beast you stalk
For Men are are now my prey, I foresee all thei days

An army of superior blood I have bred
Been born to conqueror all the land of Men
Down to the last women and child

I walk through the forest, Fangorn
As an old man cloaked with my staff
The fires are all that is left
The fire of Isengard now I have spread
