To the horizon of the sun we answer thy call

Our people are strong, one with our beasts
The gathering threat we shall defeat
Honor is our most valuable weapon
Warriors through war
Pride beyond pride

We are the mighty Horse Lords
Gondor calls and we shall answer
To war once again
We must ride

Victory is slim
Death is certain
But our honor is our guide

For victory we will ride
On with pride at our side
The race of Men is why we give our lives
A warrior of Rohan
Fighting for our family and race

Welcome to the land of the Horse Lords
One with our beasts
The gathering threat we shall defeat
