Once a man
Now bound by power
Mightiest of the nine
Fallen into darkness
The Morgul Lord leads the great battle

For hope of Men
Shall fail in his hour of death
Who become one and falls in death
Will be lost

High above Pelennor Fields
They fly striking fear in all
One with death
No man can kill
Wraiths of Sauron
Bound by the Ring

No man can kill
Minas Morgul will rise
No man can kill
The hour of the Witch King shall arise

The hour of the Witch King is near
The voice, wich welcome all Men's fears
The Morgul Lord leads on
