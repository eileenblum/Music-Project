Annihilating, destroying, another town is burning
We rape, we kill, we crush and desacrate
Dead bodies and ravens around the battlefield
Conquering with violence dealers of disgrace

I am the warlord and i'll bring fear hate and fire
Die by my hand and taste my sword pain is my desire

Marching another war is starting tomorrow
Struggle for life and glory there's no tomorrow

We are vikings, predators, warmongers from the north
No mercy no prisoners in battle we have no rivals
Thorhammer is falling cancelling false religions
A roaring of thunder an unstoppable force


I am the warlord and i'll bring fear hate and fire
Die by my hand and taste my sword pain is my desire

Marching another war is starting tomorrow
Struggle for life and glory there's no tomorrow

I kill with no remorse there is no love inside my heart
No heaven to believe in i fight with axe in Odin's name
I scream my battle cry there is no fear inside my heart
Valhalla is waiting for me...

Face the foe, die like a man
Blade in hand, is the most glorious death

Battle has come stand up and fight
We kill and die in the name of a god
Armies of hate ready to strike

Thunder and blood flowing in my heart
Face the foe, die like a man
Blade in hand, is the most glorious death

Carnage for the glory, never sweet is the kiss of cold steel
Sailing over seas of blood in a Drakkar made of hatred
I am the warlord, in blood I gain my honour
I lke to kill and I'm watching you... Slowly die
