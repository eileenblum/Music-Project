Stormy winds are blowing from the north
Whispering another nameless war
No more joy for the children
Ina world without freedom

It's war for the evil power
Cities burning in the fire
Obey to your master liar
War is only a bad desire

In your eyes I see the flame
That burns your mind and eats your brain
Warrior's sworn is dripping blood
I'm watching you as you die

In your eyes I see the anger
Of a man who wants peace
From the north comes the war

Now you see the soldiers on the march
They will never be back again
Sacrificing life and happiness
It's the youth that's goin' to die

In your eyes I see the flame
That burns your mind and eats your brain
Warrior's sworn is dripping blood
I'm watching you as you die

In your eyes I see the flame
That burns your mind and eats your brain
Warrior's sworn is dripping blood
I'm watching you as you die

In your eyes I see the anger
Of a man who wants peace
From the north comes the war
