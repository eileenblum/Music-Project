Veterans of war we're the legionaries
Coming to destroy in the name of Roma
Deploy all the troops iron discipline
Perfect war machne of flesh blood and iron

Oh... Mighty Mars hear the legionaries pray
Give us the strength, give us courage and pride

Ave ave Roma
Hail to the eagle of power
Ave ave Roma
Legions of the roman empire

Fire of Mars in my heart
Take the blade, kill 'em all, fight for Roma
Blood and guts, everywhere
There's no mercy for the foes of the empire

Vis Vis Et Honor
Conquering with blood and with fire
Duty honour country
Answer to the call of the emperor

In an age of war of violence and hatred
Obey to the law, we're the dominators

Slaughtering the foes, the jews and the christians
Watching as they die by the crucifixion

March! March! For Roma
Vic! Vis! Et Honor!
March! March! For Roma
