I came through frost and fire, bring by Jotun's secrets
And I'm the last of Skjoldung's stock, my father died in battlefield
I seek revenge, I crave my crown, I've got the right to be a king
A valorous king...But now I'm alone

Who is my foster-father? A Jotun strong and brave
I know the secrets of the forest, I have learned some magic spell
I follow the will of the gods, I'm protected by Odin
The hammer of Thor...Will be my guide

I'm a son of a king - And my father I revenge
I'm a son of a king - I will fight forevermore

Oh my longships now will cross the star of Norway, win or die
Oh my vikings follow me, I'll show the magic inside of me

Metal meets metal - A bloodbath of the titans
White was the the snow - A river of blood warlord

Battle has come - The clash of the titans
Stand up and fight - We follow our warlord

I'm a son of a king - And my father I revenge
I'm a son of a king - I will fight forevermore
I'm a son of a king - And my father I revenge
I'm a son of a king - I will fight forevermore
