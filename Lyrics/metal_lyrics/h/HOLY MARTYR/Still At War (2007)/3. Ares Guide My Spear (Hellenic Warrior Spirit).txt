In the ancient times
Of gods and heroes
In a time of blade and spear
In the ancient hellas

Tides of war men in arms
Thirst of blood, Ares hail

Blade and shield of bronze I'm fighting 
Inside my golden armour
Racing fast on my war chariot,
Almighty like a wargod

Ares the god of war
Ares is guiding my spear
Ares the god of war
Ares is guiding my spear

Mighty men from Hellas
Into countless battles,
Single combat they await
To show the valour

Fire flames of war and hatred, pain and pride
Ares god of war and vengeance, guide my spear
Fighting, with the hellenic warrior spirit in my heart
Racing, into battle with a chariot born to fight
