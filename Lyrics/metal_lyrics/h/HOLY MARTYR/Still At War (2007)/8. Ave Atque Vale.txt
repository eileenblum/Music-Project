Once upon a time there was Europe
There were people full of courage and might
There was the honour, there was the pride
Like a fire in the hearts of the men

Where is my Europe? Now disappeared
Star full of brightness in the dark of the night

One land, once might, Iâ m searching my Europe
No more shall rise, the flag of the empire

How many heroes, how many fights
And how much blood on this sacred ground

Land of the Fathers, Land of the Culture
Guide of the world since the dawn of time
I see no future, no more tradition
Europe is falling, condemned to die

Where is my Europe? Now disappeared
Star full of brightness in the dark of the night

One land, once might, Iâ m searching my Europe
No more shall rise, the flag of the empire

How many heroes, how many fights
And how much blood on this sacred ground

One land, once might, Iâ m searching my Europe
No more shall rise, the flag of the empire
