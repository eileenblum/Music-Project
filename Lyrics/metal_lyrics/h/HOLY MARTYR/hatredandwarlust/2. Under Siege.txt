Wasting my life for the old feudatory
Oppression and war , this is the middle age
Killing for Christ but there is no glory
Holy war, crusade for money

Vassal and master, heaven and purgatory
Saving their souls believing in unholy
The poor goes in hell it's the same old story
No more faith, religion and money

Siege in the castle, I'm the survivor
And now I tell what is the hell

Fear, attack, your body is bleeding
Holy war, your mind is burning
Fight until you'll die

Now is the time to set the castle in fire
Spreading violence, hate and fury
Why this war? What's the real meaning ?
Of a crime we call crusade

Church and power control our minds
When they speak the evil is their guide
From the throne they command this horror
But who die will never cry

Siege in the castle, I'm the survivor 

And now I tell what is the hell

Fear, attack, your body is bleeding 

Holy war, your mind is burning
Fight until you'll die
