Legion after legion coming from the sea
Through the black night their face now I see
Running in the city with fear in the veins
Living in a nightmare, nightmare so real

Reef of the devil , fishman revenge
Ia! Rlye, Cthulhu Ftagn!
Order of dagon, Zadok is dead
Ia! Rlye, Cthulhu Ftagn!

Monsters invasion creatures of Cthulhu
Preparing to kill, Shadow over Innsmouth
Terror and fear, death and destruction
Vision of a Shoggoth, Shadow over Innsmouth

Y'ha-nthlei reign of Cthulhu
Dreamer in the abyss the course is near
Now I am a monster and kill is my wish
I don't want to die the fate is done 

Reef of the devil , fishman revenge
Ia! Rlye, Cthulhu Ftagn
Order of dagon, Zadok is dead
Ia! Rlye, Cthulhu Ftagn

Monsters invasion creatures of Cthulhu
Preparing to kill, Shadow over Innsmouth
Terror and fear, death and destruction
Vision of a Shoggoth, Shadow over Innsmouth

Demon warriors from the sea
Now they rise up from their graves 

With the talisman of hell
Feel the evil in their eyes
And the curse goes on and on
When Cthulhu is still alive
And the shadow cover them 

This is not reality...

[Repeat first Verse and Chorus]
