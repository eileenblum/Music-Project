When the true Heavy Metal is crackin' in my ears
I feel the power just straight to the heart
No compromise! No Falsity!
I'll never follow some fuckin' trend

Is the True Heavy Metal that we defend 

United we fight until the end
Is the true Heavy Metal that we defend 

Forever we'll keep the faith

Alive and proud, 'cause we are Metallians
Alive and proud, we are no posers
And we'll not betray the faith into your heart

Metallian ... I keep the faith
Metallian ... I don't betray

Some people will say : "...this song is so stupid !"
But this is my way and I could not care less
No compromise! No falsity!
I'll never follow some fuckin' trend

Is the True Heavy Metal that we defend
United we fight until the end
Is the true Heavy Metal that we defend
Forever we'll keep the faith

Alive and proud, 'cause we are Metallians
Alive and proud, we are no posers
And we'll not betray the faith into your heart

Metallian ... I keep the faith
Metallian ... I don't betray
