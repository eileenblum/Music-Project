Hear his Name
It blasts like wind on fire
Takeda's knights,
They swing their blades with fury
Fear their bows,
They paint the skies with arrows
They stand as one,
With strength they plan the siege

Ride! Your life will end in glory
Fight! Until the last blood
Rise! Takeda light's returning
The four rumbles sign!
Death! Death! Death to the foes!
â¨Death death death death
And death to the foes! 

A chief, Shingen,
Comes forth showing four rumbles
Spreading death
From Suwa to Musashi
A battle cry, silent like the forest
To win the war,
Stained with pure cruelty
â¨â¨Ride! Your life will end in glory
Fight! Until the last blood
Rise! Takeda light's returning
The four rumbles sign!
Death! Death! Death to the foes!
â¨Death death death death
And death to the foes! 

We are loyally devoted
To our master
Takeda Shingen Warlord
He's mounting a war horse so frightful
The blade of steel in hand
