I just do my job to nowhere I go
Money is what I want
Don't care if I'm wrong
Sickness all around
Men on battleground
I came to feed the bloodshed
No bloodstains on my hands

Children suffering on the streets
Scars of bullets on their dreams
All the people curse my name
Will I burn at the stake?

Taking the weapons through many nations
I'm the lord of war
It's my own passion, my occupation
Please don't you curse my soul

Giving my weapons to many nations
I'm the lord of war
It's my obsession, my occupation
I am without a soul

So much time has passed since my first affair
Now I am paid with drugs
And my guilt is my own path

Merchants of death I serve 
Now my job is just their job
Betraying my own rules
Now it's time to face my curse

Children dying on the streets
Holes of bullets on their heads
All the people curse my name
Will I burn at the stake?
â¨â¨It's not my war, it's not my war

[Solo: Ivano/Eros]
