I stand alone, here in my roof,
Waiting the orders, liege to my Lord
All my life, my whole life,
Like a dreamâ¦ it's time to wake up

And the night is falling down,
Another murder done for you
Ghost Dog
Things are changing day by day,
I feel there is no place for me
Ghost Dog

I have no friends, living in solitude,
Poetry in my soul,
The way of the Samurai
Trying hard, to understand,
Living by the codeâ¦ it's time to die for

And the night is falling down,
Another murder done for you
Ghost Dog
Things are changing day by day,
I feel there is no place for me
Ghost Dog

Hagakure, Hagakure is my only way
A retainer, your retainer, 
Loyal till the end
