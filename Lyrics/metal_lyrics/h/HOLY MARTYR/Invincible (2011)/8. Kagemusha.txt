I'm alive, still alive,
Where is my mighty Clan?
â¨Now they lie a thousand men,
Takeda is no moreâ¦

Here on the field of Nagashino, 
Behind the lines
Seeing impotently a tragedy
A great defeat
I'm just a thief,
Wiping tears from my eyes

Shadow Warrior rise and fall!
â¨Shadow Warriorâ¦

Three years of life
In the court of the Clan
An impersonator
Acting like a shadow
Takeda Shingen
Truly conquered my heart
But I'm a double
Just a puppet on a string

Shadow Warrior rise and fall!
Shadow Warrior you're alone

[Solo: Eros]

It's so cold
When the night comes
Through the camp fires
During the siege
Mysterious flute fatal melody
Swift as the wind, 
Silent as a Forest
Fierce as Fire
Immovable he stands
As a mountain now moving on

Wave after wave of cavalry
Are cut down by volleys of matchlock fire
This is the end,
A sad farewell Takeda's Army
Is wiped out away

And so I lie forgotten and alone
An aimless life
No future for me the story ends
No place for me
I feel so sad the emptiness grows
A mere shadow of a dead man
I don't know what will happen to me

And the days of glory are gone
Only memories are left
There's no hope without our Lordâ¦
A sad farewell

And the banners are falling down
The four rumbles in the dust
It's the end of Takeda's Clanâ¦
A sad farewell
