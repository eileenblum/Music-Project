This is the story of a blind man
Versed in the art of the sword
He has no fear of the darkness
The night is an ally for him
Deadly and skilled with his cane
Surrounded he fights all alone
His name is feared and respected
Ichi the man pure of heart

He's the man
With the cane sword Zatoichi
A masseur blind man
Master of the sword

Zatoichi blind samurai
Fight for your life
You're the hero of us all
Zatoichi defending the poor
Defending the weak
For the justice you will fight

Making his life as a gambler
Travellin' on and on
Town after town through Japan
He's coming to duel once more
Many adventures and troubles
Facing outnumbering foes
Engaged by the brutal Yakuza
Refusing the rules of the clan

He's the man
With the cane sword Zatoichi
A masseur blind man
Master of the swordâ¨â¨Zatoichi blind samurai
Fight for your life
You're the hero of us all
Zatoichi defending the poor
Defending the weak
For the justice you will fight

No one escapes 
From the edge of his blade
Out in the shadows he's waiting for you

[Solo: Eros/Ivano]

Oh can't you see
The wrath of my blade
I'll cut you in two
Oh can't you feel your life is so short
You'll die by my hand
Many will try to subdue my will
Fooling my mind
Day after day I'll kill my opponents
Vengeance is mine

Zatoichi blind samurai
Fight for your life
You're the hero of us all
Zatoichi defending the poor
Defending the weak
For the justice you will fight

You are the heroâ¦
You are the pure of heartâ¦
Defending the oppressed
You are the vengeanceâ¦
You are the justiceâ¦
Always you will fight
