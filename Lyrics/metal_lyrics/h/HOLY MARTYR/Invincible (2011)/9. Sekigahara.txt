Victory so far this day
Pain and agony few are left alive

Sekigahara it's the realm divide
Sekigahara west against the east
Sekigahara remember well this day
Sekigahara a new Japan will rise

A thousand men
Marching on Tokugawa's Clan
Victory treachery just the price to pay
Cannon's fire harquebus
Mitsunari's fall
Only death on this field for those loyal men

So uncertain the outcome of the fight
A sign of hope the allies by their side

Sekigahara it's the realm divide
Sekigahara west against the east
Sekigahara remember well this day
Sekigahara a new Japan will rise

A thousand men
Marching on Tokugawa's Clan
Victory treachery just the price to pay
Cannon's fire harquebus, Mitsunari's fall
Only death on this field for those loyal men

[Solo: Ivano]

Rain onâ¦ on and on
Both the fronts lose their men
Marching on... on and on
Treachery certain death
