I walk my way, I choose my path
Inside my mind only the will to fight
Everyday I stand with pride
Life is hard but I will never fall
I will never fall

So many foes and so much honor
Donât forget to curse my name
Everyday like a sunrise
Iâm a phoenix rising from the dust

Another day, another year
This is my journey and life is like a wheel
Through victory, through misery
Day by day Iâm fighting all alone
Fighting all alone

Through victory, through misery
I walk my way, I choose my path

[Solo: Eros/Ivano]

So many foes and so much honor
Donât forget to curse my name
Everyday like a sunrise
Iâm a phoenix rising from the dust
