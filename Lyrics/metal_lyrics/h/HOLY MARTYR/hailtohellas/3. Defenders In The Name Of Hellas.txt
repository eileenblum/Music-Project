Is this the last goodbye?
Sparta is calling us
Victorious with my shield
or dead upon it
I will return to my Land
Thanatos is my fate
Oh cry Hellas cry
your king has gone to die

Three hundred heroes into Glory ride
They fight with courage no one will survive
All is lost. There's no hope. They are condemned to die?
Oh cry Hellas cry
Leonidas's sacrifice

Wait for the final stand
there's a lion in my Heart
We're not afraid to die
there is Victory in my death
Wait for the final attack
Fight tooth and nail
all is lost!

We march off to war!
Be strong we will die!

We fight to the last!
Be fierce as we die!

We march off to war!
Be strong we will die!

We fight to the last!
Be fierce as we die!
