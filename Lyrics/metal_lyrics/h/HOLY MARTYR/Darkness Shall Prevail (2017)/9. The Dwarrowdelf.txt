Far away on the shores of the lake
Kheled-zÃ¢ram sacred place of the dwarves
Crown of Stars from the sky on a pool
Mirrormere..

Durin the Deathless found this place
But where is stock now?
Beneath the Mountain Celebdil
His people stood strong

Down down underground
Digging for gold and stones

In Khazad-dÃ»m

Long ago in the caves underground
Magic gates endless stairs shining walls
Dwarven realm hadhodronod Fatherland
Misty Mountains...

The Splendour in the halls of stones
A greatness now gone
They dug the mithril in the mines
So far and so deep

Down down underground
Digging for gold and stones

In Khazad-dÃ»m
