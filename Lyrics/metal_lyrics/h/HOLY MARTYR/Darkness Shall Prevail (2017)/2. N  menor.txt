From the depths of the ocean an island raised from the sea
The realm of the Edain an everlasting Power 
They were Kings among the men on these shoresâ¦

NÃºmenor NÃºmenor

A gift from the Valar in the middle of the sea
You will shine like a Star

NÃºmenor NÃºmenor

Youâve paid the price for your pride
But your seed will remainâ¦

Now the floods of destruction bring the realm to an end
The fear and Darkness shall fall upon the island
Only few shall escape from the doomâ¦

NÃºmenor NÃºmenor

A gift from the Valar in the middle of the sea
You will shine like a Star

NÃºmenor NÃºmenor

Youâve paid the price for your pride
But your seed will remainâ¦

On the horizon Dark clouds up ahead
Nine ships are sailing the storm has just begun
The faithful Men devoted to the Valar
They bring the seed a hope for the Middle Earth

Mighty Men of NÃºmenor strong is the faith Dark is the path
Sons of Elendil youâre bound to Glory
Unattainable Deeds of Heroes shall live forever

NÃºmenor NÃºmenor

A gift from the Valar in the middle of the sea
You will shine like a Star

NÃºmenor NÃºmenor

Youâve paid the price for your pride
But your seed will remainâ¦

Men of NÃºmenor 
From the island raised from the sea 

Men of NÃºmenor 
Isle of Elenna in the middle of the sea
