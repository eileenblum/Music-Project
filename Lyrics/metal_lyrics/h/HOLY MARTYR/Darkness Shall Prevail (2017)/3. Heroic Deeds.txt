"Gil-Galad was an Elven-King, Of Him the harpers sadly sing
The last whose realm was fair and free, Between the mountains and the sea

His Sword was so long is Lance was keen, His shining helm afar was seen
The countless Stars of heaven's field, Were mirrored in his silver Shield

But long ago he rode away, And where he dwelleth none can say
For into darkness fell his Star, In Mordor where the shadows are..."

Here they come hundreds of thousand of Elves
As far as the eye can see the ranks of the Alliance
Twelve years at war under the walls
Valiantly standing against the foes
Crushing the gate killing the orks fallen
Is the King with his Spear... now gone

The Darkness is falling no sun rises from the east
A shadow of pain and fear

Heroic Deeds

Men of the West the Star
On their shields seem to glow
Brave Dunedain the Splendour of Numenor 

Day after day here on the front
Besieging the Tower of Barad-Dur
Victory is near the Dark Lord appears
Far in the distance the fires of Mount Doom

The Darkness is falling no sun rises from the east
A shadow of pain and fear

Heroic Deeds

Gil-Galad! Gil-Galad! The mighty the fierce high king 
The last of the Noldor's stock, Elendil! Elendil!
True leader of Men he lies slain on the battle plain

Heroic Deeds
