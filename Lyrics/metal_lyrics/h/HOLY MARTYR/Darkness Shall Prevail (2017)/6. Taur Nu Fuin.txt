Lost inside this tortured dream
I don't know where I am
The wind between the trees is howling
Thirst the poison on the streams
Corrupting all my thoughts
A vision in my mind I'm clouded

Evil's lurking in the Darkness
Fear the forest under nightshade

I'm Immortal but soon my soul shall be damned
Paralyzed I'm trapped in a spider's web
Taur-Nu-Fuin there's no true escape from here
Crawling in the gloom no Stars to light my way

Here the Darkness Shall Prevail, a never ending Black
The flowers on the ground are dying
Dust and ashes of the past the ruins on my path
I'm stranded in this void forever

Evil's lurking in the Darkness
Fear the forest under nightshade

Taur-Nu-Fuin there's no true escape from

I stand in the forest unaware of myself
And I wander never knowing where I'm going
In the Dark forest the moonlight spills over the trees
