Far in the north the last of their kind
Guarding the boundaries in Eriador
Fearless blameless strongest bravest 
Standing as one they strike in the dark

Dunedain 
Hunting for orks by ambush and stealth 
Dunedain
Guerrilla warfare they fight to the last 
Dunedain
Skilled with the sword but deadly with bow
Dunedain 
Into the wild patrolling their lands 

Heir of Isildur the chieftain of men
Preserving the line of the Kings 

Remnant of what once was a realm
But now a new Hope is born... Born Of Hope 

Dunedain 
Hunting for orks by ambush and stealth 
Dunedain
Guerrilla warfare they fight to the last 
Dunedain
Skilled with the sword but deadly with bow
Dunedain 
Into the wild patrolling their lands 

Forces of Darkness all over the land 
Dunedain rangers are taken by storm
Fighting together they're men of the west
In sorrow and pain now he's born... Born Of Hope
