The Darkness has come
Back from where it had been
The Witch-King arises
And the light fades away

Black Numenorean your soul once so mighty
How has fallen in disgrace unmerciful undead King
Once you were King of men now King of the dead
On your throne...

The rain's falling down over the ruins
The pain and the sorrow are washed away
All across the ancient land of the King
The lost Kingdom of Arnor
It lies in decay forgotten by all
The Evil now rules Supreme

Dark is the realm
Of the Witch-King of Angmar
Armies on His side marching off to war
Dark is the realm
Of the Witch-King of Angmar

The Dark Lord has come
A Black Glory shall reign
Immortal his soul the King of the dead
Through pain rules the world
And vengeance shall bring
Corrupting the men enslaving their hearts

Lord of the NazgÃ»l ride servant of Chaos
Bringer of death ride Lord of the NazgÃ»l ride
Let's spread your black wings and scream your Triumph
