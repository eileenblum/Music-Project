[music &amp; lyrics: Ivano Spiga]

Just a child with a blade and a shield
There's no fondness no place for the weak
In our childhood we just learn to fight

Children trained to kill for their Land
Lakedaimon - the man with no fear
Lakedaimon - the faith and the spear
Dying like a man, the way of the Warrior

All my life at war, under the laws of Sparta
Spartan man of war - Lakedaimon
Spartan man of war - Lakedaimon

In my eyes so cold what do you see?
Is the will of the gods or is love?
For my land so beloved and so strong
Spartan warrior you fight with your heart

Lakedaimon - the man with no fear
Lakedaimon - the faith and the spear

Dying like a man, the way of the Warrior
All my life at war, under the laws of Sparta

Spartan man of war - Lakedaimon
Spartan man of war - Lakedaimon

Brothers in arms, giving their life
Fathers and sons, brave men of Sparta
They stand as one, against the foes
Hellenic Pride, fight with Andreia

[Solo: Eros]

Thunder from the sky, Gods of the Olympus
Marching by my side, Zeus Soter Nike
Ares God of War with Phobos and Deimos
Spartan with no fear, praise the Lakedeimon

Spartan man of war - Lakedaimon
Spartan man of war - Lakedaimon
