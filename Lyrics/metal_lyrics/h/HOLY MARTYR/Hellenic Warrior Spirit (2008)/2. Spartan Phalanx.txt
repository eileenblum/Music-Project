[music: Ivano Spiga, lyrics: Ivano Spiga / Giandomenico Cossu]

We... we are the men with blades of bronze
We... we have the Lambda on our shields
May we...be given to kill
Don't need any war cries,
to rush the blood to our heads

Three Hundred men, the Elite Guard
You can't stop the Spartan Phalanx
Stand in the front, no fear to die
You will see the Hellenic valour

Wall! Wall! Wall! of spears and bronze
Wall! Wall! Wall! against the foes
Bloodbath, dead bodies lay on the ground

Strike now, fighting our way trough their rows
Hold fast! Roll in the uproar of the fight
Keenness is the key to subdue all tempting fears

Three Hundred men, the Elite Guard
You can't stop the Spartan Phalanx
Stand in the front, no fear to die
You will see the Hellenic valour

Wall! Wall! Wall! of spears and bronze
Wall! Wall! Wall! against the foes

[Solo: Ivano]

We are the stout spawn of Valour
Bred by the Mother of War
Die like a man of Sparta
The sign of the Lambda prevails
