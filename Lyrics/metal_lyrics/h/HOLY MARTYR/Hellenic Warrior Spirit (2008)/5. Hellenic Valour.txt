[music: Ivano Spiga, lyrics: Ivano Spiga / Giandomenico Cossu]

Look at the field where the wheat's growing stronger
Golden like the sun and as tall as our standing
We in the wind not to break nor to bend
We shining on suffering on in a blaze of glory

[Bridge:]
With a spear in my hand
And my mind in command
Pounding drums in my heart
All of you torn apart

See through the tides and the ages of time
All failed to match our Strength and our Pure Will

Now it's the hour, final test is at hand
Purpose in mind, no retreat, no way out

[Bridge:]
With a spear in my hand
And my mind in command
Pounding drums in my heart
All of you torn apart

[Acoustic Part:]
Softly is whispering the wind
Yielding a measure of hope
Yielding good crop very soon
It'll feed our dears back home

Harvest of brave men at heart
Will truly give faith to the land
Our shields shall be not cast away
In deeds we will prove our Valour...

Valour, Valour,
Valour, Valour!
The Valour of the Hellenic Blood.

Fighting side by side

Closing all the ranks
Marching on, Smashing On
No mercy for the foes

Sons of Heracles
Blessed by the Gods
Bravest men of all
Always fighting full of Valour

...Valour, Valour, Valour!
The Valour of the Hellenic Blood.
