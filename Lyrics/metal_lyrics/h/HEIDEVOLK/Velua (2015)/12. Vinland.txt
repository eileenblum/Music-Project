[Bonus Track]Onwards! We riede the ocean waves
Westwards! Through the storms of fate
For Vinland! Hail to Vinland!

Vinland, hail to Vinland

Our path has been chosen, our fate has been set
Our journey will lead us to the lands in the west
We've prayed to the Gods to be on our path
To guide us and lead us throught the ocean's wrath

Our ship sails out on the morning tide
As we head for the lands on the other side

Onwards! We riede the ocean waves
Westwards! Through the storms of fate
For Vinland! Hail to Vinland!

Vinland! Hail to Vinland!

Heading for the shores of the realm of the free
The land of wine and endless green
Fear nor regret what you will see
Onwards! For the new world beckons thee.

Our ships sail out on the morning tide
As we head for the lands on the other side

Cities will be conquered, villages taken
The gorunds of this new wolrd are shaking
nights of drinking until morning light
Onwards and upwards through the storms we ride.
