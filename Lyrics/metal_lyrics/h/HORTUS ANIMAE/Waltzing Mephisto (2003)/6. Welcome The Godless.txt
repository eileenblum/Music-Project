Crawling so deeper... Nobody should have to do it that way... Breathing so higher... Having thoughts that are never the same... As I
stand here trapped in immortal rites that aren't mine by choice... Welcome the Godless! Living, dying... For something I won't do
again. Screaming, scratching... And the Godless shall be blessed all the same.
I have served the temple and now I want to consider me and them free...
