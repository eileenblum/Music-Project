PSALM: A requiem for the white candle, in a ritual where it must be praised and consumed, ignored and abused. She must be comforted. But how can I soothe the sufferers when mine is the blood of those who cry? The candleâs dumb. I wanna see it burn, I wanna feel them burn like the fire burning in my eyes.

Spirits, I donât wanna see the light of heaven but I wanna see the pain coming out from her eyes. Powers of obscurity, listen to my prayer and give me time for revenge. Spirits, sheâll become insane, her nerves shall yield. In this night of dismal glimmer I invoke malediction. They've let her young beauty fade away.

Velvet skin, withering. Her bloody hate shall turn again in mortal venom. Sacred lust, blooming. The trial is silent. Funeral procession, all dressed in black but white are tears. Unsilent, dip the air of brackish lies. The white dove, killed by faith, wingless. Stained with blood but still screaming because of blind pain.

Lungo Ã¨ il cammino nella notte, la cittÃ  si duole, avvolta nelle ombre. Eâ in piedi la vergine bianca coperta da un sudicio sudario. Un cuore pulsa ancora, gocce di sangue escono dal petto urlandoâ¦ LA LORO VITA!!!

Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.
