Indefinite beings to the non-return point or beings not completely dead. Vegetating by choice or mummified in state of perennial suffering. Where painâs not endured but sought after with morbid perseverance, just to survive. Maybe the only practicable way to continue to survive in a world where the sun no more rises, where motionless creatures are condemned to contemplate the nothing. To them I speak, to them I offer my demise, once again I pray by their side, they are lost in space and time âShamelessly I call to thee, to speak to thee our tragedyâ To them I speak, to them I offer my demise âShamelessly I call to thee, to speak to thee our tragedyâ Once again I pray by their side, they are lost in space and time âShamelessly I call to thee and youâll speak my name with tragedyâ To them I speak, to them I offer my demise, once again I pray by their side and thy happy side is like suicide to me. As a rosary recited in the opposite way, a deviate ritual perpetrated for centuries. In the day when eternal damnation was chosen, which forces them to live with the dead. And now the time has arrived, the time for me to die. To them I offer my still life, now and for always. And I offer them my demise, thereâs no more time to cry, Iâll find my peace by their side. Bleeding eternally.
