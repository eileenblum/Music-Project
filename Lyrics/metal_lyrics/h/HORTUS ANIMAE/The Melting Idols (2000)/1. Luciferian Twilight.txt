All is strange, almost abnormal, I smell no odour. Thereâs only an odd light outside. I feel no pain because Iâve already suffered too much. Day becomes night and I feel its decline start. With Leviathanâs breath on my neck, itâs making me repent to be here now. But all is lost. Thereâs only an odd light outside. Do you feel its presence? Twilight embraces shadows. And I become numb as the frowned eyes of Lucifer that look outside with mine. I feel nothing to the world, what am I living inside? I feel so estranged, so alone. Listen to the dead beatings from my heart. I incarnate pain, sufferingâ¦ Whyâ¦ Sufferingâ¦ Inside. The veil is bare, bones become ashes and the shroud that awaits for me offers nothing but frost. Thereâs only an odd light outside. Outside the window. Outside my soul.
