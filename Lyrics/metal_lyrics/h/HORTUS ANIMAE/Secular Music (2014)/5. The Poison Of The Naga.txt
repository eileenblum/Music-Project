From the dynasty of the waters
Rising from the depths with ascetic discordance
Floods of destruction after rains of fertility

A liquid taste of slaughter
Deity of virulent poison, prowess and endurance
From the water tree giving His offering

And that was not the apple of sin

Holding storms in one hand, whipping away mortality
The revered elixir of life of the great laconic trinity

Supreme Keeper of Knowledge
On the shoulders of the Destroyer
Crowning the head of the Ubiquitous

The shelter of gods, which from nether dimensions He lauds

Nagaraja â Serpent King

Spirits dance along subterranean streams
The entrance is subtle, the trail is so steep
Spirits dance along subterranean streams
The breaths are humid, the realm is so deep

Recover Amrita from the Ocean of Milk
Bending the mountains, churning the seas
Gods and demons, the lockings to bind Him
The greatest of efforts and yielded the King
The last weary breath becomes the strongest of venoms
Wryly the Destroyer becoming the plenum
The essence of immortality is safely back
The threat of doomsday is delayed once again

Nagaraja â Serpent King

Spirits dance along subterranean streams
The entrance is subtle, the trail is so steep
Spirits dance along subterranean streams
The breaths are humid, the realm is so deep
Spirits dance along subterranean streams
With a slow pace they cautiously creep
Spirits dance along subterranean streams
The entrance is subtle, in a well thatâs so deep

Nagaraja â Serpent King

The Mother of Snakes unleashed Her children on trees
To offer the humans all the wisdom they need
The fork-tongued creatures spoke the words of relief
And no that was not the bloody apple of sin
The Mother of Snakes unleashed Her children on trees
To offer the humans all the knowledge they need
Wisdom is tempting, ignorance is bliss
And no that was not the bloody apple of sin

Nagaraja â Serpent King
