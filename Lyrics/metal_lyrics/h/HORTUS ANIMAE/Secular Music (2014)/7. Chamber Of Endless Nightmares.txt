Pest or ghosts, I cannot know
Haunted my skin, flesh and bones
Infested my veins, poisoned my blood
Made me grope deep inside the mud
Made me blind and made me deaf
The mark to the ox, my Taw/Aleph
I couldnât see them, they couldnât see me
Although we lived as one, in company

Through spider webs filtered pale rays
And reached the dark of every place
I have felt the sickness, vomited it out
The flouting mangy old rooks flew up
Giving shapes back before my eyes
I desired the death of such petty flies
Have I gotten rid of all the stains
that decorated my mind

I spit my rage by heavy rains
I wash my wounds, eliminate

I swear I wonât forget this time
The most lone hours ever
Sleepwalking through the dead of night
While particles do sever
I swear I wonât forget this time
The most lone hours ever
The scattered ashes of my life
Keep floating through the never

I spit my rage by heavy rains
I wash my wounds, eliminate
I spit my rage by heavy rains
Withdraw the dirt while I elate

I swear I wonât forget this time
The most lone hours ever
Sleepwalking through the dead of night
While particles do sever
I swear I wonât forget this time
The most lone hours ever
The scattered ashes of my life
Keep floating through the never

Crimson waves wreaking over
I become the fire I held within
Boiling blood spilling over
From the fiery lake of my Abyss
Immense cracks getting larger
The hungry jaws of the Apocalypse
Cold breath whipping stronger
Storming comes my scourging bliss

What have you all done
What the hell have I done
What have we all done

I couldnât guess the gift of sight
Would be the curse during my nights
My endless nightmares, loneliness
Alone in my chamber I dream of them
I feel as dead as they are now
So why to see if my eyes close down
My livid wrath I repudiate
As in solitude one canât create

I couldnât guess the gift of sight
Would be the curse during my nights
My endless nightmares, loneliness
Alone in my chamber I dream of them
I feel as dead as they are now
So why to see if my eyes close down
The good old darkness they infected me with
Keeps resounding in my memories

I swear I wonât forget this time
The most lone hours ever
Sleepwalking through the dead of night
While particles do sever

I swear I wonât forget this time
The most lone hours ever
The scattered ashes of my life
Keep floating through the never
