The symptoms of corrosion
Flowing slow from head to feet
The genesis of abortion
Of beings with sharp protruding teeth

The scum scorns every concept of mortality
Through idioms of duality inaccessible for the brain

This is the sunset of our age
Foretelling the dawn of a new mankind
Shapes are shifting asymmetrically
Deformation calls the new perfection

This is the end of our last day
Connecting trinities once twined
Which have been in growth lethargically
New flesh for new dissections

In the fields where grass grows taller than ever
The winged serpents crawl insidious between our feet
Taking flight and showing a new splendour
New rituals are way beyond belief

In the lakes where water is clearer than ever
The winged serpents drank all the remaining impurities
Testimonies of a vigorous new ardour
Singing rituals that give way beyond relief

Upon the mountains where air is purer than ever
The winged serpents fly in circles of infinity
Prophecy of wealth and awaking ardour
Blinding visions of a world once adrift

The ghastly splendour of a multiform masquerade
Taking place through eruptions of multicolour accolades
The renaissance of a rebellion will come with blazing hordes
Embrace the Dystopian Apocalypse that will change the rules on afterwards

The distant horizon from a vast open space
Yet each distance is shortened, cogent domain

The improvement of beings god has failed to create
A brainchild of mergers, the breed of the quakes
The obscene children and the outcasts of caves

The symptoms of corrosion
Flowing slow from head to feet
The genesis of abortion
Of beings with sharp protruding teeth

This is the sunset of our age
Foretelling the dawn of a new mankind
Shapes are shifting asymmetrically
Deformation calls the new perfection

This is the end of our last day
Connecting trinities once twined
Which have been in growth lethargically
New flesh for new dissections
