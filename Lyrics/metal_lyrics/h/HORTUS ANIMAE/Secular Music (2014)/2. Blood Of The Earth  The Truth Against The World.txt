Millenniums have come to pass
Our world has come great length at last
Old shadows thought still haunt our days
Forever now, we live in shame

Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd
The truth, against the world
Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd
Our fate has been foretold
Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd
Our aeons will whisper still
The lies, that thrive on this
Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd

Through days and nights men carry bold
Greed, blood and sloth that scriptures hold
Words inked in blood stand tall and proud
Hail those who stood against the crowd

Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd
The truth, against the world
Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd
Our fate seems so foretold
Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd

Our aeons may whisper still
Embrace the truth, denounce globe
Denounce the ones whose souls they've sold

Fight... Fight... Fight... Light... Light...
Light... Lies... Lies... Lies... Die... Die...
Die! Fight... Fight... Fight...
March towards the light... Light... Light...
Refuse to live on lies

Disaster fuels the flame of greed
Akin to those who plant the seed
Heed the call our mother screams
In pain she cries to save our dreams

Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd
The truth, against the world
Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd
Our fate has been foretold

Voices travel through time, to warn man of the crime
Alesian fields still cry, our flesh and blood that died
Refuse, resist, refuse resist
Never forget, never regret

History repeats itself
In our search for Midas king
Just how many more must bleed
To feed the dead whose name you sing
Awaken the truth, a-slumber the world
Ancient wisdom's alive, behold what was told
Remember the few that put up a fight
Free men standing strong, with time tested might

Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd
The truth, against the world
Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd
Our fate seems so foretold

Lies, lies, condemn us all to die
Die, die, those snakes that run and hide

Millenniums have passed, humanity still holds
The keys to gates our past, has failed to fight the cold
A choice to make, a stand to hold
The truth against the world

Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd...
