[Part I]

The wind blows light in the stillness of moments, when nothing ever seems to modify the order of things. Nothing looks like an omen of change, while millions and millions of parasites mechanically run, eat and consume every single existing substance, merely dedicated to their livelihood. They feed from all life, they feed from the skin they walk on, over and over again. Until it gets dry. And the creature that holds it gets lifeless. Yet thirsty for vengeance. Winds will start blowing furiously, like never before, more voracious than locusts, tearing souls apart with their cold. Countless ravenous mouths will open wide under their stupid little legs, devouring them in droves. Yet, the bleeding won't be eternal, the obscurity won't last for more than a lifetime. Oh well, if any of you parasites now feel the need to say something at last, let yours be a few final wise words.

[Part II]

As I walk the edge of this cracked road
I watch below and see that everyone is dead
No one to wait for, no more future plans
As I stand on the edge of the Abyss
In silence, cause there's nothing left to say
It calls me down, I try not to shake

If the shadows fell onto this crooked world today
Would past and future melt in a cold embrace
If the shadows fell onto this crooked world today
Would past and future melt in a cold embrace

As I march beside the disasters
White eyes and pale faces are my company
I should feel lonely, I'm just passive to the fate
As the stench pierces the surroundings
I feel both numbness and sympathy
Why shouldn't I abandon myself and dive

If the shadows fell onto this crooked world today
Would past and future melt in a cold embrace
If the shadows fell onto this crooked world today
Would past and future melt in a cold embrace

No more gods to worship, no more saints to praise
I stand alone in the void, just me and my fate
No more gods to worship, no more prayers to say
Alone and forever, just me and our world's fate

If the shadows fell onto this crooked world today
Would past and future melt in a cold embrace
If the shadows fell onto this crooked world today
Would past and future melt in a cold embrace

[Part III]

Seeds burst into life, a life that eats decay

New forms of life, brand new independent cells
Devour the carcasses, build their DNA

Seeds burst into life, a life that eats decay
From the depths of Earth

New forms of life, brand new independent cells
Devour the carcasses, build their DNA
The skies return to weep, giving splendour to the fields
The ground takes over a thousand and thousand of clays

The Earth revolted, a vortex aph-o-ris-ti-cal-ly offered
The Earth revolted, dead bodies ar-tis-ti-cal-ly covered
The Earth revolted, plantations car-niv-o-rous-ly attired
The Earth revolted, the havoc in-cred-u-lous-ly saw seeds burst into life

Today the shadows fell onto this crooked world
Past and future melted in a cold embrace
From darkness came the light, a new horizon shines
Over dead city rises, the new world's face
Culture medium from the departed, a form of rebirth
Withered fingers from the soil take new heart and strength
The reek turns into ozone, a form of redemption
Past and future melted into a new dimension
