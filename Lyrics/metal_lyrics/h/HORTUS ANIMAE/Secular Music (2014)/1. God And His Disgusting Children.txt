Towers of ruins are standing tall, towards a gray and wrathful sky
Derelict stoups dirty with drool, canât satisfy the thirst of mice

Inhale the fever

The walls of cry do crumble down, fulfilling lungs with abrasive ash
On wounded knees, the time is now, to curve the back to the stash

No bulwark there to spurn the slugs, drained by the scorching sun
Leaving a trail they crawl and tug, more and more stunned, no longer shun

Inhale the fever, now
In a line of lepers, now

Iâll stand in line before the ministry
Iâll stand in line for my soul to save
Iâll stand in line, but still Iâm consumed
By pain and regret, itâs killing me

Inhale the fever

Preserved bodies prone to worship, wedged between bricks and mould
Crusts of blood poison the surface, angrily stuck to the power they hold

Rusted chalices on forsaken altars, kept precious fluids for the wretched
Strong statues stagger and falter, when their resoluteness gets banished

Inhale the fever, now
In a line of lepers, now

Iâll stand in line before the ministry
Iâll stand in line for my soul to save
Iâll stand in line, but still Iâm consumed
By pain and regret, itâs killing me

Inhale the fever, now

The creatures of the sunrise are fading in the night
Shade by shade they vanish, a process that is trite
The creatures of the sunrise have been fading in the night
Abhorring the blinding starlight that erode their very life

Children, disgusting children, deformed and helpless
Off the womb of sanctity
Children, repulsive children, reborn from filth
Animus disguised as mercy

Inhale the fever, now

Inhale the fever, now
In a line of lepers, now

Iâll stand in line before the ministry
Iâll stand in line for my soul to save
Iâll stand in line, but still Iâm consumed
By pain and regret, itâs killing me

Inhale the fever, now
In a line of lepers, now

Iâll stand in line before the ministry
Iâll stand in line for my soul to save
Iâll stand in line, but still Iâm consumed
By pain and regret, itâs killing me

Inhale the fever, in a line of lepers, now
