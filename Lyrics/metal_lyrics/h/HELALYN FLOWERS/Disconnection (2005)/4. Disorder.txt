Again, again
I've tried to reach my other me in a space unplaced
Where everything has lost its own image
I've tried and I've wished to find a way to fade away
Where everything could make me over...
I need to wake up my body
I need to wake up my mind, again!
I've tried to reach my mind
I've tried to reach my space
I've tried to find a way
A way to fade away
I've tried to reach my mind
I've tried to reach my space
I've tried again, tried again, tried again, again!
