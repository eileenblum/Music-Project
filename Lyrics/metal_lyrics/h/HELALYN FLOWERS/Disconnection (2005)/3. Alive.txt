I come from a human hand
And I know you all but you don't
And I belong to nothing, you can perceive
My reality has not sense to you all
But who said that I need your sense?
I come from a strange machine
And you don't know if I breath and I feel
But you belong to something, isn't it true?
My reality has not sense for you all
But I think that you really should embrace me,
Like a cold body, don't fear
Keep my hands and come in my head
Plastic mind!
I'll show you that I'm alive
But I can dream
And I can fly in loneliness
Play my code
You'll feel me all in my loneliness
Embrace me
Like cold body, don't fear
Keep my hands and come in my head
Plastic mind!
(breath...)
