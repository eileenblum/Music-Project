I'll be your fastest flight
When I'll cut off your chains
I'll be your sharpest blade
For your moments of pain
Me - the sweetest poison
That will flow through your veins
I'll be the coldest rain
That will cry your old shape
I'll be your vacant pill
To make your mind asleep
To make of your bad remains
The oldest waves of your brain
You - between an eclipse
Blinded by industrial sun
Bleeding as a tv
That has lost each image
Let you be my sinner
And sin will be my name
You - as an hand-grenade
Me - as an oxyhydrogen snake
They won't to leave you be what you are
So...cut off your chains
And feel your fastest flight
Everyday, everyday
You feel always the same
You need to break your own time
And open your eyes
I'm a ticket for you
Let's take me go!
I'll be your fastest flight
When I'll cut off your chains
I'll be your sharpest blade
For your moments of pain
You - between an eclipse
Blinded by industrial sun
Bleeding as a tv
That has lost each image
Let you be my sinner
And sin will be my name
You - as an hand-grenade
Me - as an oxyhydrogen snake
They won't to leave you be what you are
So...cut off your chains
And feel your fastest flight
Everyday, everyday
You feel always the same
You need to break your own time
And open your eyes
I'm a ticket for you
Let's take me go!
