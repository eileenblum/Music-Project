Walkin' on your streets
In front of me you're silent
Like an overdose
You make me feel outside and
What I look around
Is only imagination
But I can see the reality
If I look in your eyes...
Urban atmosphere
A traffic of emotions
As in a cage I feel my brain and actions
And in your eyes...
You're killin' me
I'm killin' you
Please don't try to understand
What my mind is searching for!
You're watchin' me
I'm stabbin' you
Don't you think it is enough
To walk down your own street alone?
People around me
Keeping in hands
Tryin' to cover my face
Mass celebrations
A new daytale's done
Please alienate me... Let it be!
Walkin' on your streets
In front of me you' re silent
Like an overdose
You make me feel outside and
Urban atmosphere
A traffic of emotions
As in a cage I feel my brain and actions
Maybe what I live
Is only my alienation
But I can feel the reality
If I look in your eyes...
You're killin' me
I'm killin' you
Please don't try to understand
What my mind is searching for!
You're watchin' me
I'm stabbin' you
Don't you think it is enough
To walk down your own street alone?
People around me
Keeping in hands
Tryin' to cover my face
Mass celebrations
A new daytale's done
Please alienate me... Let it be!
