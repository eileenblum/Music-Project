A fragile wall beyond your mind
And everything's stranger
Try to fall down
Searching for you
And it's hard to feel
To live and try
To synchronize
And to understand
Once you were so near
And so far away
At the same time
A fragile wall beyond your mind
You feel so fade
A fragile wall beyond your time
And everything's so fade
You try to perceive other times
Something in your hand
Where is it from?
It's over you
And it's hard to feel
To live and try
To synchronize
And to understand
Once you were so near
And so far away
At the same time
A fragile wall beyond your mind
You feel so fade
A fragile wall beyond your time
And everything's so fade
