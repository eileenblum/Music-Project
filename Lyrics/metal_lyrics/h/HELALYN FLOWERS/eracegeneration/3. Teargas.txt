Like a blade
Once I made a crime
I let you taste my pain
A scar inside it's hard to clean
And it's growing on!

To feel like
Feeling like a teargas
Which slides like an hybrid emotion
To feel like
Feeling like a teargas
Which hurts like artificial love

Slide away
On empty streets
I'm in a visionary state
Like a tick-tack inside of me
I feel, I trust, I taste...

To feel like
Feeling like a teargas
Which slides like an hybrid emotion
To feel like
Feeling like a teargas
Which hurts like artificial love
