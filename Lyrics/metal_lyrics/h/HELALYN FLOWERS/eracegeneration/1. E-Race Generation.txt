Still in a frame of my mind
I get a gun
I'm a "lady-borderline"
I've sold you pills of fear and fun
So that you felt alive
But insane
In my eyes
You saw your face
Bleeding empty...

He said:
Dear lady I just want to find the key
To bleed off my innocence
I want to disappear
In my dirty dirty desires
Please erase me violently with your gun

Still in a frame of your mind
You dress my skin
Now you can feel by the senses
that an imitation pill
gave you before that your eyes
became slaves of a forbidden time,
plastic evidence,
and you're empty...

He said:
Dear lady I just want to find the key
To bleed off my innocence
I want to disappear
In my dirty dirty desires
Please erase me violently with your gun

Dear lady I just want to find the key
To bleed off my innocence
I want to disappear
In my dirty dirty desires
Please erase me
Erase me
Erase me
