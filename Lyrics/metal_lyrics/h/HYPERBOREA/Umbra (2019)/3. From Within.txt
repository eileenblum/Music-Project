I see them as not once before
They reach out in despair
And try to feed the internal sore
That brings them so much scare

Programmed to blindly resort
To their fear-ridden ways
In search for peace and love and freedom
They roam in a wrongful place

Through worldly gain they try to find
The light that shines within
And servitude and games of mind
Become their mortal sins

Robbed in this entertainment nightmare
Nothing to understand
Victims of their own creation
Their lifeline will soon end

You're torn apart when fear comes
You lose your basic ground
Reality seems most unreal
Vague light, distorted sounds

Crimes everywhere
Panic and despair
Faces-human masks
Cities fall in dusk

All the way back to the past
You trace the line of fear
Through generations it runs fast
The silent killer nears

Will you take the risk to cross the line
And see what awaits across
I'm telling you, you'll be just fine
Don't fall slave to your inner frost
