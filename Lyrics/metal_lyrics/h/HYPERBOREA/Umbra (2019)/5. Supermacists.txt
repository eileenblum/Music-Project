Read our lips â we are advocates of sorrow
See our hands â the movements you don't follow
Dogmas, religions, you name it
Something to fuel up the hatred

Elitist knowledge keepers
Fruits of a well-known tree
Division of the profane crowds
Supremacists

Our names may differ
Through the course of time
Wars mind pollution
We offer no solution
The thing that doesn't change
The fate of human race
