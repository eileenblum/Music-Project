Can you see under the surface
And question all your statements
Peel them off successively
Layer after layer

Have you tried to jump in the fog
And think your own way
Having faith in no false prophets
But in life itself

Have you felt the subtle presence
Of the Universe
Have you heard the whispering silence
Of the sentient fields

The unseen bridge, the freedom
The interwoven beauty
The silent stream of wisdom -
You will see me in the stars

In the eye of storms and raging battles
Of passions, fears, anxieties
In the middle of deafening noises
Of ambitions, envies, shames

Or in the pitch black pit of despair
Loneliness and hopelessness
Behind a number of tar doors
Carrying the weight of the world

If you are going through hell - keep going
Don't run away - there's no escape
All is you - and you again
Dancing the dance of life

The unseen bridge, the freedom
The interwoven beauty
The silent stream of wisdom -
You will hear me in the winds
