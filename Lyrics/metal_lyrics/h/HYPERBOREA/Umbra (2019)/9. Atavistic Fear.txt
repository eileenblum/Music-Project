Demons hide in the darkness
Creating their own space
Guarded by stone walls of fear
A place you dread to glimpse

You can feel the cold
Streaming from this void
As you try to approach it
Even just a bit

You think it's safe to stay
Where you are now
The walls inside define
How your life will go

So you become a landlord
To creatures you don't know
As every other living thing
They want to live and grow

And terrified you see
The walls are moving closer
Leaving you devoid of options
Paralyzed and stoned

And if you try to crush the demons
Or pretend they're not there
Before long they will strike you back
With hundred times the power

That's the way it's always been
With every human being
The one and only enemy
Is not out to be seen

And yet these mighty demons
However mean they are
Are our own dear children
Grown as we did

They make us lose our minds
And act in insane ways
They manifest through murder,
Hatred, violence, rape

But there's something you should know
About these living ghouls
They're spots where you've been deeply hurt
They're bleeding wounds of soul

They're just places in your psyche
Where you've once been shut down
And through these lacerated holes
Your life force drains away

So you have to go to them
With courage, care and love
Talk with them, spend time with them
They crave for your attention

Once you've shown them love
Soothed they will go
No right-doing, no wrong-doing
Only a path to tread
