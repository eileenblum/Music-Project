Falling prey to my subconscious,
Living stream of fears
Denying clues of transformation
My sentience is seared

The clock inside my chest is ticking
But I neglect the pace
Disconnected from the real
In devastating race

Scared of losing precious things,
I lose them all the time
And seek unfound serenity
Escaping one more time

I interrupt the flow of life
With my confused desires
Fear, doubt and disbelief -
The gods that I admire

Trapped inside with no way out -
Inside my false beliefs
I jettison the wisdom found
To give me full relief

And turn my back to what is proven
To be an efficient way
To let go my oppressing demons -
Forever will they stay

The answer, shrouded by vertigo
Lies deep down below
Confining it, my giant ego
Built a concrete wall

Like flashing lightning, very clear
It soon became to me
Serenity was always here -
Deep inside of me
