The odium in my own soul
holds me captive, breeds the gall
left to change my reverie
to soul-destroying slavery

Odium hasn't died away
wishing to rule just one more day
sucking dry my veins in pain
takes my only strengths away

Life is getting deeply dark
when odium extracts its stark
odium corrodes the sores
tears apart my human heart
And what if a day
mortals accept the way
the odium only to obey
and odium be incarnation
of sick men's aspiration
and eternal human degradation?
