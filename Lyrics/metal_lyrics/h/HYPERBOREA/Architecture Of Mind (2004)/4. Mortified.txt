Look into my empty eyes
deep inside I slowly die
No forgiveness from the past
See my life burning fast

Despair will grow,
already dead tomorrow

I'm a victim of this world
and hidden hope is absurd

No return to happiness
coming only emptiness
I don't care for anyone
and I wanna die fallen down
Never see or feel the light
only slowly, slowly die

End my life - mortified
