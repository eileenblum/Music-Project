A world of countless twins,
same identical faces
Lonely I stay there
like white piece of hair

Waiting the cutting

An ocean of agony
Why do you choose the death-
what are you to gain?

With dreams you heal your conscience
A symbol of death you've turned yourself

Fly in a flock of black butterflies
Black insect floating above rotten flowers
Madness(2)

Madness-a sign of fulfillment;
the primary stage into the food chain
To take a life when you're secure
I am a mirror-the truth may hurt
Madness-a sign of fulfillment
I am a mirror-the truth may hurt

Hypocrisy - ocean of pain
Hypocrisy - space of reality
Who's to look and to confess?
Who's to believe in my words?

Trapped by abundant lies
Who's to believe me?
Everyone's a blackguard
