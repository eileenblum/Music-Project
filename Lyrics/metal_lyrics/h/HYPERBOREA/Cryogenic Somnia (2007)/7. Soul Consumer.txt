Hidden in the shadow of the past
and lurking in the silhouette of the future
Existing with one and single aim
To arrange our fates and lives

Consumer of innocence
Consumer of souls
Consumer of happiness
Consumer of our thoughts

He is a partner of death
Standing like a carnivorous vampire
Smiling greedily at the human failure
A product of his grim activity

Arranged as mechanisms in a clock
A chain of clean perfection
The suffering of others is his food
He is a tumor in the flesh of society
Coming like a friend
Striving for your trust
At once he will enslave you
Craving for your soul
