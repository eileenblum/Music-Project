Far too often man becomes clever,
Instead of him becoming wise,
Becomes inventive instead of thoughtful,
Perpetuates humanity's demise,
A brief glance at the prevailing world,
Exhibits the same symptomatic device,
Of the fatal human error present in all,
We stop at no pain and no price,
Diminished freedom in a blackened future,
You've probably heard it all before,
But we are running out of second chances,
And will ultimately lose this war.

Who will rescue us from the spark of the apocalyptic collapse?
Who will provide some rapture when the bringers of the end amass?
This race can't save it from itself, so much can't be restored,
Always won the battles, and we'll ultimately lose the war.

There never was a greater shame,
A coup d'Ã©tat from within,
And we only have ourselves to blame,
When greed controls no one wins,
A nation that had the potential,
To be heaven on earth,
But the ones upstairs wouldn't let us have it, So we'll give 'em a rebirth!

The human animal; inherently selfish,
Will never change its harmful ways,
No matter how much progress or experience gained,
We are still inept, kept at bay,
I seek to see the good in this government,
And it has little to display!

Who will rescue us from the spark of the apocalyptic collapse?
Who will provide some rapture when the bringers of the end amass?
This race can't save it from itself, so much can't be restored,
Always won the battles, and we'll ultimately lose the war.

The Defense Condition rising,
With no foreign threat or attack,
America is imploding,
The people want true democracy back,
They will destroy this empire,
Who for a century sucked the blood,
Of the third world and eastern states,
Reduced to rubble and mud, Unless we stop now...
