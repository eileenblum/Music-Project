Freedom; the pursued lie, acquiesced to by constant
Denial; our captive state, what you think you know is the cause of our own
Projection; the noose to a blind-folded universe called
Chaos; all that is, was, will be, eternal.

Enthralled by a man whoâs come to save us,
Aforethought economic fall,
Yet the day we stand and hold our ground,
The outcome will shock and awe.

Walk as many, Stand as one,
Rising tides shall wash away all we've done,
Man controlling man only spills more blood,
As we live under the arch of the sun.

Their genius devised in the shadows of our dreams,
Our five senses; the sum of their cause,
Vanity divine, ignorance confines,
Perception; a mortal flaw!

How pure is pure with everyone in the âknow,â
Those who lead, fear the eye in the sky,
I am therefore I am you see,
Iâve learned to die before I die.

Walk as many, Stand as one,
Rising tides shall wash away all we've done,
Man controlling man only spills more blood,
As we live under the arch of the sun.
