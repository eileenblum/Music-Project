It would take a global epiphany to sight,
Mankind's greatest threat,
So fixated on his ways he's blind,
To the damage that will beset,
Us, the children of technology,
By automation will be replaced,
Ascending slopes of dependency,
From celluloid to cyberspace.

Open your mind to the subjugation augmenting reality,
Grave New World, and to think... they'll be the last vestige of humanity.

Seeping into facets of our lives,
As gear oil replaces blood,
Accelerating at an alarming rate,
Where the conversion can't be undone,
Artificial Intelligence soon as organic,
As what was once our minds,
A time when slaves turn into masters,
In silicon the earth is enshrined.

Open your mind to the subjugation augmenting reality,
Grave New World, and to think... they'll be the last vestige of humanity.

The "Uncanny Valley" slowly disappears,
Nano-processors take the place of eyes and ears,
The essence of human lost in translation;
As we transform into our own creation.
Day by day harder to avoid,
Having built what cannot be destroyed,
No matter how tight we clench our fists,
We'll still drown in the digital abyss.

Open your Eyes - For what's soon to befall,
We cannot prepare...
Grave New World - The once inanimate,
Is now living, breathing, sentient and self-aware.
