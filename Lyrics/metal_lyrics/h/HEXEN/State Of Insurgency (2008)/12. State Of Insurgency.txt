Freedom was but a memory,
Under their watchful eyes,
Who mass-conditioned the media,
To believe their fool-proof lies.
I sought to enlighten;
Bring the system to an end,
Through the mold of society,
The freed minds would transcend.

Amass the insurrection!!!
Disprove their prophecy,
The day we let them own our minds,
Is the day of our decease.

Amass the insurrection!!!
Conduct in clandestine,
Wrest power back to the people,
State of insurgency.

When I refused to acknowledge,
Their proclamations I'd negate,
Ostracized victim of a thinking mind,
Turned enemy of the state.
They've bought and sold intelligence,
Apathy was our defect,
It's over now, they've won the war,
Globalization's in full effect.

Amass the insurrection!!!
Target the Illuminati,
Destroy the manipulation,
That's lasted for centuries.

Amass the Insurrection!!!
Conduct in clandestine,
Wrest power back to the people,
State of insurgency!!!

Cut off the head and the body will perish.

I curse you; spineless populace;
Who let freedom of thought be lost,
Demanded by these misled sheep,
To invade at any cost...

They've taken the new world,
The "Amero" is our defeat,
History will repeat itself,
Cause this world's run by the elite.

History will repeat itself,
Orwellian rule world-wide.
The Esoteric Conspiracy;
Buried deep, hidden, denied.
