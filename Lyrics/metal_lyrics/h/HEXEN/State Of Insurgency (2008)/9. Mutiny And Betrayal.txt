Of one purpose we fought hand in hand,
My brother in combat as war scorched the land,
Abandoned me with nothing to fight all alone,
The treachery you gave me I'll never atone.

I bear no life now that the war is done,
But the war between us has only begun,
The hate built from vengeance my soul was possessed,
That only your death would put my soul to rest.

Don't speak to me of forgiveness it is for the blind,
Wolves and lambs respect no truce of the mind,
Who would've thought tonight
We'd face each other enemies,
Today old friend, you pay for your mutiny.

It's not enough to die, desecration is a must,
I want whomever that views your
Remains to vomit in disgust,
Mutilated and slain the vendetta is done,
Mutiny and Betrayal is written in blood.

Mutiny and Betrayal
