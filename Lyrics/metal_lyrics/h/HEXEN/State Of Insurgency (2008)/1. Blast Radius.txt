Just a normal day riding the bus,
...With a hundred pounds of the most potent C4,
A man takes a stand with a trigger in his hand,
Thirty lives vaporized all over the floor.

"Just Cause" will contradict the laws,
But the murder's been justified in the eyes of their gods,
Oil, blood, and limbs scattered amongst the debris,
It's urban chaos of the highest degree.

To strive for vengeance in the night they spawn,
Killing sprees they laid their plans upon,
Fight for the freedom, die for the land,
Slaughtering the hostages that they have at hand.

Politics make casualties out of innocent lives,
The evil brews...as a new plan arrives,
Slowly as the media settles back down,
Another explosion will soon shred the town.

The people burning inside because they know,
The oppressor's only winning because of their back-bone,
An enemy whom they swore they will kill again,
Blast Radius: a promise they won't break or bend...

Distraught for vengeance in the night they spawn,
Killing sprees they laid their plans upon,
Fight for the freedom, die for the land,
Taking back their country any which way they can.
