Cursed was my existence,
Branded eternal blame,
But the law cannot condemn me fools,
Cause I'm pleading insane,
Ceased their bodies to exist,
Severed the legs so they couldn't run,
I told the victim's families,
That I had fucking fun.

Welcome to death row,
Got nowhere to run,
You might take my life,
But I don't think that you've won.

Tattoos litter my entire back,
For every one of the thirteen,
I fed off seeing their dying eyes,
Before my knife slashed in between.
With nothing left to fear,
What's the worst that they can do?
Take away my life,
When death was decades overdue...

[Pre-chorus:]
Now dig me my infernal bedroom,
Wide and ten feet deep,
The extra four is just in case,
I cannot fall asleep.

Gas chamber: I'm ready to die.

Strapped down undefiantly,
They said a musk is all I'll feel,
But cyanide is shredding through my lungs,
They even skipped on my last meal.
Asphyxiation soon consumes me,
Replacing blood with gaseous death
Melting my organs inside out,
A subtle gasp bring my last breath.

[Pre-chorus]

Vapors of death seep through the vents,
And my last thoughts are purely dissident,
They called this method the "most humane",
But my eyes are melting below my brain,
Whatever the hell was wrong with me?
I'll never know for sure,
No one knows why the blind can't see,
No one knows the cure.

I bid you farewell,
My time here is done...

Gas Chamber.
