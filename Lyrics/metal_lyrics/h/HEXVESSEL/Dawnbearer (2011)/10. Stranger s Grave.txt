She put on her old scuffed fan shoes
Wore her favourite navy blue suit, fixed her hair
Before she lay on a strangers grave
Felt her grip on the world disappear

She traced all the names under the photograph
Was it really him or just another man?
So hard to tellâ¦

But in the corner of her eye she would picture him
A familiar voice or the sound of his steps

Upon a stormy wave they are swept away
Just like paper boots in a sails dream
Or the light that plays on a half-lit face
The sound of the sea is a bloodbeat
Of drums from the heart's silent scream

Silent scream, bloodbeat dream
