Warlocks are writhing
In the long summer grass
Making shapes of horns
On their heads with their hands
Human dragons dream
Through the joy in their smiles
Hypnotising jackals
Of love and desire

Heart of the mind-world
Fictions on fire
Magic forest ghost home
Heaven is here forever

They rode the eagle screams
To the universe edge
Where spiders steal the sunlight
With their crystalline thread
The tales that they tell
Have a life of their own
And drink from the wells
In the shadows of the moon

If it's here where I die
I will not mind
Home sweet home
And love is all we know
