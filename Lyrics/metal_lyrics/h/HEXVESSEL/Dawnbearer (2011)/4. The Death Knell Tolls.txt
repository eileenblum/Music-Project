["We must learn to live without the murderous consciousness that every berate we draw swells the rails which bear our frail vessels to the Port of the Grave." - Aleister Crowley (1875-1947)]

I raised myself up from the bottom of a dead lake
Black sirens wail like children screaming under stairways
The Death Knell tolls so long
The Death Knell tolls so long
I saw my mirrored laughing skull-face in eternity
Rain washed my dreams all down the drain right there in front of me
The Death Knell tolls so long
The Death Knell tolls so long

Strike black notes, roads into wells
Heavy drapes fall, the halo dissolves

My haunted memories stuck back together with sellotape
Rooftops refuse their jagged shelter floods my joy away
The Death Knell tolls so long
The Death Knell tolls so long
Towards the neon roars of bars on crucifixion street
The vacant leaded drone of cars that drip into my grief
The Death Knell tolls so long
The Death Knell tolls so long
I suck the sewers up, hold them close, like long lost families
The final hit, I cashed my chips, the way it's got to be
The Death Knell tolls so long
The Death Knell tolls so long

Liars bite the floor, world frowns out
Red right through, inside and out

Holding on hospital gowns
Damned catholic soul
Last doors, last call
