["First, the magic incantation sung about strange secret fires in hidden places, by wild men." -Arthur Machen (1863-1947)]

Invocation summoning
My blood-fuse lit right up
Conjuring the operation
I saw the singing veins of God

Mountains of leaking arks
Slowly yawning in the dark
The black corridor opens
And smoke rose from the Serpents throat

Angels of the seventh house
I raise the cup of blessed blood
Virgin wax and sacred earth
In the name of the holy ghost

For thou shall wash and purge me
Appear within the circle
Answer to those who bid thee
Obey your ritual command
