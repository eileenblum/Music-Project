["I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times, in life after life, in age after age, forever" - Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941)]

I saw a carriage of celestial light
Bless your brow with a chalice
Of silver liquid sunrise
A mysterious semblance of glowing forms
Gathered nearby
Dimming only in the death-darkly shining eyes
Of my summer bride

Your patterns paint wraths
In umbrellas of flame
Great golden crescents
Make the shape of your name

We drove til we reached a clearing
At the edge of the universe
Seeming like we had been swallowed
In a dreamy ceremonial trance
We watched the tide of the language of the sky
Give its cyclical verse
And the trees absorbed our spirits
In a strange and endless rebirth

Renew us forever
Wychwood Shrine
As I take her hand and he will take mine
She will take mine
Wychwood Shrine
Wychwood Shrineâ¦
