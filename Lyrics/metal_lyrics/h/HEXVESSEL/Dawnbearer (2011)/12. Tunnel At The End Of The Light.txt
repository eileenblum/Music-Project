Blackness split my forehead
In infinite truth
As the whole universe began playing
A terrifying tune
Thrown like a shadow
A veiled figure beckons
Framed by the dawn
And riding a dead horse

The tunnel at the end of the light
Igniting my gaze with irradiant fire
Dismantled my dreams in a skeleton pile
Transparent and askew
Under a stark white sky

The tunnel at the end of the light
Chilling my bones till the end of all time
Dismantled my dreams in a skeleton pile
Transparent and askew
Under a stark white sky

Skeletons chatter
Their moribund mantras
Calculations and curses
Scrawled in rough chalk
Cascading visions
Revolve in the moon
These eyes of death
Will not show any mercy to you

I can't seem to stop this mad carousel
That turns in the dark, on and on it goesâ¦

I wait for a call that never comes
Lost in the stars
Alone
Alone
