In forest heart the man of leaves is dancing
He is the source of stream and seed of life begun
At the edge of dawn his lithe green limbs are moving
Our thin flutes play and he steps the mystery round

Green Lord
Green Lord
Spring maiden dances with you
Green Lord
Green Lord
Spring maiden dances with you

Through ripened corn the golden man approaches
He wears the sun â the oldest light as a crown
His fertile magic staff he bears before him
The air is hot as he lays down upon the land

Corn king corn king
Harvest queen lays with you
Corn king corn king
Harvest queen lays with you

On open moor the man of stone is waiting
Between the worlds he guards the twilight hour
Through his eyes the ancient knowledge passes
His feet drum the throbbing beat of earthâs deep heart
Â 
Stone man stone man
Weaving woman waits with you
Stone man stone man
Weaving woman waits with you

Free running stag is riding from the darkness
The world hart he leaps across the sky
He carries deep the heartbeats of the old ones
He marks a trail into the wise and hidden ways
Â 
Horned god horned god
Moon goddess rises with you
Horned god horned god
Moon goddess river with you
