Oh this isn't walking in the forest with grandpa
When life was simple and honest
This is a cold wet camp when the fire wont kindle
And you're damp to the bone and miles from home
When the trees shiver all through the timbers
And the visions are embers of an unfinished sentence
Wrapped in the bleak creeping feeling
That something is missing
From the picture of the universe

A spirit form inside a tree
Blood seen in the creases of a palm
The saddest sign you'll ever read
Conjure me conjure me conjure me

Oh this isn't a sip of a spirit in an old bar
When your troubles all seem unreal
This is losing a war in a desert
Where you're gunned down, dry to the bone
And completely alone
For we creature the leashes
That strap us to leaches
That suck through the marrow
Of the altars of earth
Feasting on the brains of creation
In the graveyard of nature
We get stranger and stranger

A spirit form inside a tree
Blood seen in the creases of a palm
The saddest sign you'll ever read
Conjure me conjure me conjure me
