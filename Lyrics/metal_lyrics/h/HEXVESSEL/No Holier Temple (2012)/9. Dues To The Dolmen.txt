Inspired by the words of Carol Batton
For Niklas at Les Chaumieres de Kerimel and his ancient
Stone neighbours. Thank you!

Holy holy holy old friends
Rise sphinx-like
Ancient megalith
Whispered strangers breath
Coats the cold circumference
Tricks of the light wind wind kite style
The sunpipers shadows solo and riff their discords
Flap tap the frogs in the grass gorge
Uninvited eyes size
And scan up the solitary canopy
Minerals shimmer all
To bear witness and to be witnessed
Gather the modern-day druids
Air-conditioned polyester pilgrims
Folding fabrics fizzle in the wild woods
Souls drawn and magnetized by old stones
Abandoned churches within the great church
A door within a doorway
Our home is outside
Housed where the globe appears to rest on a pine
cone
Your voice like rain echoes like rain echoes like rain
Howl through the barrows ohs ohs ohs
Stone skeleton â spill your spells, secret intentions
A pause on the tape with no reset or rewind
Play button transmits two minds
Back to summer smiles
And dues to the dolmenâ¦
