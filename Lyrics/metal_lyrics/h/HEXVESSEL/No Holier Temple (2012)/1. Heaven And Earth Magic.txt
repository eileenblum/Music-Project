âFor small creatures such as we, the vastness is bearable only through love.â
[Carl Sagan]

She brings the harvest spiral dance
Fruit
Bone
Blood Earth

She is the ellipse of the heavenly bodies
Water Stars
Air
Birth

She calls each thing by its right name
Trees
Hearts
Breath
Plants

She renews the tide as it washes the land
Root Weed
Surf
Sand

She carries peace in the joyless void
Bell
Bird
Wing
Leaf

She is a circle with no beginning and no end
Sky Altar
Wand
Staff

She is above and below, without and within
