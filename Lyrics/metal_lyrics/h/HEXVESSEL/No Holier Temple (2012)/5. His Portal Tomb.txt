I see your face
Painted rays through glass panes
Black pillars beneath your feet
If you could speak what would you tell me?

Hieroglyphic texts
spells that protect
universe descends
symbols that project
Into the underworld

Let's save a kiss
for his wooden lips
let's make a wish
let's take a trip
As in the afterlife

Funerary form 
falcon wings adorn
vaulted eyes carved
staring out beyond
watching the sunrise

Transfixed by your portal eyes
Like passages to the next life
Sarcophagus dreams behind the lid
Carrying secrets meant only for the deceased
