âIs it because wilderness makes pretty picture postcards? Because it protects watersheds for downstream use by agriculture, industry, and homes? Because itâs a good place to clean the cobwebs out of our heads after a long week in the auto factory or over the video display terminal? Because it preserves resource-extraction opportunities for future generations of humans? Because some unknown plant living in the welds may hold a cure for cancer?

No â the answer is, because wilderness is. Because it is the real world, the flow of life, the process of evolution, the repository of that three and a half billion years of shared travelâ
