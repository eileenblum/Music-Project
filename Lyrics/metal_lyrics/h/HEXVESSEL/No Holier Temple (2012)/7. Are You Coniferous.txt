A few minutes ago every tree was excited, bowing to the roaring storm, waving, swirling, tossing their branches in glorious enthusiasm like worship. But though to the outer ear these trees are now silent, their songs never cease.
[John Muir]

Tell me my dears
Are you coniferous?
Do your leaves last all year?
Will you always be here
Are you coniferous?
