[originally by Ultimate Spinach]Collapsed laughter running, falling, drifting, across the mine field of your thoughts dissolved wondering: who am I? why should I be alone, alone?

Concrete forests loom into view
Steel throated robots tell you what to do
Look out big brother is lookin' at you
Look out big brother is lookin' at you

Your head is reeling
Your head is reeling

Flowered children dressed in a shroud
Are enveloped by a great flannel cloud
Because they go around acting too proud
Because they go around acting too proud

Your head is reeling
Your head is reeling

Plastic masses don't know what to say
But they want to make all the flowers go away
Or else take the sun away from your day

Your head is reeling
Your head is reeling
Your head is reeling
Your head is reeling
