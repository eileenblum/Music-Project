Saddle horn
Worn femurs
Worthy bones
Gunsmoke ghosts
The last lost outpost
No call from the wilderness
Canât speak in stone wounds
Wine glasses chink down hollow rooms
No grave for a hero like you
No rest for a curiosity charm
Chime with the term bell toll
Gone with a lecture roll
Witness to vacant ritual assembly
Dormant prefectures

Spoken with a whisper
Used like an old scream
Sold to peering slavers
Another bio-piece on American TV
Distant relatives remember
Trees, dust, wind and mountains
Forever forever forever
