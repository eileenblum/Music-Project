Unseen sun that shines within us
Unseen sun that dwells within us
Unseen sun that grows within us
Unseen sun that lives within us

The sky rings out
Toward your holy seat
The sky sings out
Toward your holy seat

Carried by chariots
All is Void
Your flesh will shine
Until the end of time

Ancient totem
Cleanse me with emptiness
Liberate me
Into nothingness

Cloaked king of light
Cloaked king of light
Cloaked king of light
Cloaked king of light

The sky rings out
Toward your holy seat
The sky rings out
Toward your holy seat

Unseen sun that shines within us
Unseen sun that dwells within us
Unseen sun that grows within us
Unseen sun that dies within us
