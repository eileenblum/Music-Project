This is the end of the world
This is the end of the world
this is the end of the world
this is the end of it all

I drank a dream that I was an oak on fire
where words became birds of a mirror-world
Fellow travelers under a buckling moon
a pack of tricks to play between ghosts
The sudden shadow and a clearing in the wood
astral chrysalis door to the abyss
filled with the origins of eternal things
spores that form into the teeth of mountains

And when the masks of the universe burn
The ancient light will return
And when the tide of the universe churns
A sea of wisdom will return

The iron marsh in a child of stardust
comets burn their tales in our mouths
the horizons of white holes opening and closing
a thunderclap of a universe spawning
Take me like the pacific sweeps the tides
Until every last light of starlight dies
And we're alone, clothed in infinite darkness
We stoop and beg for Sagan's forgiveness

And when the masks of the universe burn
The ancient light will return
And when the tide of the universe churns
A sea of wisdom will return

The only way into the universe is through a clearing in the forest.
Find the doorway to the end of the world and go through it
Reality is only what we make it!
Reality is only what we make it!

Into the nuclear womb of chaos
Lay your head down inside the fall-out

crossed the threshold, clashed together
life confronting life forever
our love is the fiery flames of a fountain of suns
burning in the constant conference of rebirth
