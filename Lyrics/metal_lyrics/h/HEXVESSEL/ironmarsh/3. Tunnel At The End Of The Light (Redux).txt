Blackness split my forehead
In an infinite truth
As the whole universe began playing
A terrifying tune
Thrown like a shadow
A veiled figure beckons
Framed by the dawn
And riding a dead horse

The tunnel at the end of the light
Igniting my gaze with irradiant fire
Dismantled my dreams in a skeleton pile
Transparent and askew
Under a stark white sky

The tunnel at the end of the light
Igniting my gaze with irradiant fire
Dismantled my dreams in a skeleton pile
Transparent and askew
Under a stark white sky

Skeletons chatter
Their moribund mantras
Calculations and curses
Scrawled in rough chalk
Cascading visions
Revolve in the moon
These eyes of death
Will not show any mercy to you
