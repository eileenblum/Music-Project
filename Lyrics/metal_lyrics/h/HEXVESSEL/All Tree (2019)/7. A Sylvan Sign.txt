We're told that the ancient gods
Have ceased to exist
But deep in the woodland and valleys
I hear music
And through the laughing laurels
I draw him near
My golden boy
Sings out for us

Where there are dreams
There are rivers
And within his bones and skin
A sylvan sign
And time means nothing
And the world subsides
When my golden boy
Sings at my side

A sylvan signâ¦ [repeat]

Were told that the ancient gods
Have ceased to exist
But deep in the woodlands and valleys
I hear music
And through the laughing laurels
I draw him near
My golden boy
Sings out for us
