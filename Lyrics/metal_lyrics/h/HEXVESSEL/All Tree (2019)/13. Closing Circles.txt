A scent of lilies
A wreath of pine
The threshold open
For spirits to rise

We light the incense
We close our eyes
The table has been set
The sheets are warmed

The heavens lift you up
Your deeds and works
And all the fields will ring
With the sound of our love

We'll never forget you
Our past is shared
As long as we shall live
You too shall live

Fare thee well
Fare thee well
Fare thee well
My old friend

Fare thee well
Fare thee well
Fare thee well
For we won't meet again

Fare thee well
Fare thee well
Fare thee well
My old friend

Fare thee well
Fare thee well
Fare thee well
For we won't meet again
