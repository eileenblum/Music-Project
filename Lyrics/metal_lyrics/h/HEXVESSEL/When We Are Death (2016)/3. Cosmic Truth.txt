when we watch the spaceship
that exploded in our souls
the sound from its engines
blew apart our world
you stood quietly by my side
as tears well dropped in our eyes
and I knew in this moment the meaning of home
and I knew the meaning of life

it's cosmic truth I know
it's cosmic truth I know
it's cosmic truth I know
it's cosmic truth I know

I am the sea, I am the star
we will ever done, we'll just change our form

it's cosmic truth I know
it's cosmic truth I know
it's cosmic truth I know
it's cosmic truth I know

when we heard
the cranes call
that chilled us to the bones
the banished walks to mirror blue
carry their wistful full song
you sat quietly by my side
as the camp fires to die
and I knew this moment the meaning of love
and I wasn't afraid to die

it's cosmic truth I know
it's cosmic truth I know
it's cosmic truth I know
