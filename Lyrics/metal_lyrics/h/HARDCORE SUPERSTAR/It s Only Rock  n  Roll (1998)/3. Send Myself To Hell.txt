Lost souls beside moneymaking fools
Dollars come and go
Gonna make it or go
Action-filled liquid motion
Tell me the reason why
Long and painful road
Gonna make it or go
Make up your mind
Cause I gotta know
I gotta move, I gotta move

[Chorus:]
I send myself to an early grave
But it's my own choice [x2]
So I know for sure

Today I had some chances
In harmony and peace
No matter what you say
I send myself to hell
My makers grin, my own damn sin,
Judas grin and Jesus sins
Long and painful road
Gotta make it or go
Make up your mind
Cause I gotta know
I gotta move, I gotta move

[Chorus 2x]
