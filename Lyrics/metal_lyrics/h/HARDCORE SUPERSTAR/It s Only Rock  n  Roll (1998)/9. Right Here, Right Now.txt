Well people talk about me
And I don't understand
What the hell can I do
When I'm just the perfect man
I'm just riding my big, black limo
Like I'm supposed to do
I'm a fast-shooting star that aiming more than far

Say what you want
I live my life right here, right now [x2]

You can call me creep
Call me anything you want
I always put my life in the centre of the world
I'm just riding my big black limo
Like I'm supposed to do
I'm a fast-shooting star that aiming more than far

Say what you want
I live my life right here, right now [6x]
