I'm trying to taste you
So fast, so fast, so fast
I'm trying to face you
So fast, so fast, so fast

[Chorus:]
When I'm down you've been around
So I taste you in my mind
When I'm down you paint my mind
In all those colors I'll never find
Come with me and take a ride
Come with me and take a ride
There's something that we can do
Gonna sing
Come along
Gonna do it all again
Something that we can do
Gonna sing
Come along
Gonna do it all over again

I never meant to make you
So fast, so fast, so fast
When I kneel I wanna wake you
So fast, so fast, so fast

[Chorus]
