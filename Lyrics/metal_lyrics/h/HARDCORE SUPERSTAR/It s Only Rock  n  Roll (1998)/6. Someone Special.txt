You came to me
like a little mislead child
You're the only one, my spirit's gold
Don't make our time together
a moment of joy
Cause love will guide us through

Maybe you want it too, maybe you
Cause I don't wanna be the one
that send you away

Someday you gonna be
someone special
All the places we've been
And all the faces we've seen [x2]

I know there were times of pain
And there were times
I didn't understand

And I know there were times
I wouldn't hold your hand
But baby, now I'm here for you

Maybe you want it too, maybe you
Cause I don't wanna be the one
that send you away

Someday you gonna be
someone special
All the places we've been
And all the faces we've seen [x2]
