I made up my mind today
Ain't gonna live like they like everyday
So sick and tired of this
So fucking fed up with this society
Welcome to nowhere fast
Woke up and laughed death in the face again
So sick and tired of this
So fucking fed up with this society

[Chorus:]
I don't like the things you do man
I don't agree with the things you say
It's in our mind to live and breathe in this world you know alright
I've been around
Sad to say that all of us believe in these hypocrites you know
I've been around

Blood sparkled in his eyes
With the devil himself on his side
No one here gets out alive
I'm so fed up with this society

I made up my mind today
Ain't gonna live like they like everyday
So sick and tired of this
So fucking fed up with this society

[Chorus]
