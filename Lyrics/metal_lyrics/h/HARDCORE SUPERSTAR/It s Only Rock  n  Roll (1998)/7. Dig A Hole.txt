Last night it all came clear
I wonder really if you know for sure
A black suit with a blacker tie
I love you, there's nothing to do

[Chorus:]
All there's left, a wooden box and a book of memories
I know that the other night before
I said, all I do is dig a hole for you
All I do is big enough for you
All I do is dig a hole for you

Damn you all, a dream of a fool
Repent my memories, there's nothing you can do
I think you better listen, I only tell you once

[Chorus (2x)]
