Why won't you let me be
Shit seems to follow me
You kick me to the ground
Hit me if I make a sound
Everyone's having fun
Seems like no one cares
Like I'm in some plastic bag
But now I'm done
Gonna look all around
Time to bring you down

I won't be bullied so I beat down the bully
Hit me first got no worries
Won't be bullied so I beat down the bully
To the ground
I beat the bully
I won't be bullied

Beat to the ground now
Everyone is having fun
Yeah I know
Oh I know
When I'm up
You are going down
