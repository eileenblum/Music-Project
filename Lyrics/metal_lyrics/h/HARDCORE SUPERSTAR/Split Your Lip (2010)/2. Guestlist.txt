You're not passing through
Well who the fuck are you

I'm off stage
Don't have a lot to say
But the party starts anyway
We get into a fight
About the show tonight
It's easy to ruin my day
Oh no knocking on the door
And she's got a lot to say
You end up in our dressing room
You fill us up with crap
This shit won't go away

Oh no someone's at the door
I have never seen you before
You say you're on the guestlist
You gotta get through
Well who the fuck are you

Another day
Another gig to play
I gotta go get away
I'm in the dressing room
People having fun
That's about to change
Oh no knocking on the door
I've never met you before
You come into our dressing room
You talk a lot of shit
Can't take it no more
