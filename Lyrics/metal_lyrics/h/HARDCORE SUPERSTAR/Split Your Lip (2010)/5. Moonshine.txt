Don't talk about moonshine
Don't talk about white wine
I'm drawing a fine line
Sick twisted strange kind

I stick my tongue out
Feel stupid
Don't you see
I say the worst things and call it
Honesty
There's something wrong here
I entertain my worst fear
It's all in me

Don't talk about moonshine
Don't talk about white wine
I'm drawing a fine line
Sick twisted strange kind
I get sick when the sun shines
Used up on white lines
Sick twisted strange kind

No doubt about it
Got problems with my head
Don't try to hide it
That's what my girl said
I'm on my own
Don't care at all
Leave me alone
