Looks like a little nice catfight
But there's no women in sight
A little hug from the heartless
Surely those boys just can't fight

A little hug from the heartless
I'm no hero
Just restless
I just feel so alive
That's why I'm always satisfied

One way out
Too late to lie
I'll give you three steps
Time to shine
For the last time
I've told you to split
Split your lip

Come see the beauty in my sickness
A little violence
You're my weakness
When you feel horror grow inside
That's when I come alive
