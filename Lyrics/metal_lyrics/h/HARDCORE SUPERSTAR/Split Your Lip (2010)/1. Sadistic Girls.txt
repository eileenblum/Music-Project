You wanna know
About sadistic girls
The way they walk
The way they talk
Wanna know sadistic girls
Spend some time with me

Can't stop now
Cause she got her hammer out
Feel frightened for sure
There's no reason
But I believe her
She's about to explode

Spit you in the eye
No time to cry
I feel tough
Standing by her side
She wants to break you
She'll kick you in the ass
Like mama style

Can't go back now
Cause she creeps me out
But I love it for sure
Don't you back down
Bring me the action
You better bring me some more
