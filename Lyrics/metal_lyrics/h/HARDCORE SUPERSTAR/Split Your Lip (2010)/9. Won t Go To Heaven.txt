I hate it when you touch me
All your jealousy
You don't really know me
Damn I need something new
I'm sick of being your tool
Not my fantasy
I'm not your clown
I'm not your fool
Damn I need something new

Envy
Empty
Won't go to heaven for sure
Greedy
Jealousy
No place in heaven
It's full

Sentimental bullshit
time to take a zip
I'm sick of being your prick
Damn I need something new
