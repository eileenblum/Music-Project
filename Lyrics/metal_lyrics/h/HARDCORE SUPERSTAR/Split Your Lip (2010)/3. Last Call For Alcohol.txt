I'm on my way I need it now
Last call for alcohol
My limitation my only sin
Last call for alcohol

I don't want to crash and burn
And I never seem to learn at all

Party ain't over 'till I say so
And I feel good tonight
I'm just gettin' started
And I hate you
I just might start a fight
Need nobody's filthy hands
Taken care of me tonight
I'll be just fine

I need a drink I need it now
Last call for alcohol
The bell is ringin'
I can't get enough
Last call for alcohol
