You want some time alone
But I don't think I'll be that strong
I need to know
How much
How long
Where do I belong
How much
How long

Run to your mama
Cause you can't stand the road
You better run and leave us alone
Run to mama before you lose control
Run and leave us alone

Don't know where I shall walk
I follow your steps
But something goes wrong
I need to know
How much
How long
Where do I belong
How much
How long
