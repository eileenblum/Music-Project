I wanna let you know
That I don't care at all
Oh baby don't you know
That I don't care for
Suck ups
Fuck ups
Who don't stand up
Just like a hick up
I"m sick of when you repeat stuff

I wanna know when our love is gone
I'll blame it on you in my honeymoon song
Sometimes I wonder when it all went wrong
I'll blame it on you in my honeymoon song

I can't breathe at all
Cause I don't care for
Suck ups
Fuck ups
Who don't stand up
Just like a hick up
I'm sick of when you repeat stuff

I feel whole when you're gone
You're so wrong
All wrong
I can't breathe at all
Go send me off
Mental institution for all
