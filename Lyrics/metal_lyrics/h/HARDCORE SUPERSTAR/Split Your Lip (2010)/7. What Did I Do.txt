Can not remember last night
No
Think I behaved like an asshole
But she told me I was nice though
Two stars tattooed on her body
That I know

Talk
Give me a memory of some kind
Walk
Sunshine

What did I do?
What did I do that went wrong
Can not remember anything
Nothing at all
What did I do?
What did I do that went wrong
Give me a memory of some kind
Sunshine

Can not remember last night
No
Jeans jacket
Green tobacco
So you think I'm being bored
Her attitude
Just like a freak show
