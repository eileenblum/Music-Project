Got to be strong
Give you my smile
Soon you'll be gone
Won't see you for a while

I heard she had some problems
The kind you can not hide
She'll never be with me again
No more ways to pretend
I'll never find a better friend
Is it a start to the end
So I got to be strong
Remember your smile
Now you are gone
Won't see you for a while
See you for a while

Come with me
Take my hand
Please understand
This is not the end
Long time no see my friend
Go to the rivers end
Where we meet again
This is not the end
Long time no see my friend

I know she had some problems
Something you can not hide
They will never go away
And your smile starts to fade
It eats you up inside
Life's not going your way
So I got to be strong
Remember your smile
Now you are gone
Won't see you for a while
See you for a while

This is not my place
Not where I'm staying
Only darkness in this land
Oh please take my hand
Take me away from here
