Down, down, how I hit the ground,
Canât find a place that I love.
Why, why do you have to cry?
We need some help for the go.

A friend is hard to find,
Youâre a stranger of mine.

Oh, stranger of mine,
Please donât start another fight.
Baby, I donât care whoâs wrong or right.
There are ways about you I donât understand,
You weep like a girl, but hit like a man.
I used to love the way you made me feel when Iâm a kind
But now I can see clearly youâre a stranger of mine,
A stranger of mine.

Try, I try to be on your side,
Even if I donât understand.
Bye, bye, no will to fight,
Running as fast as I can.

A friend is hard to find,
Youâre a stranger of mine.

Oh, stranger of mine,
Please donât start another fight.
Baby, I donât care whoâs wrong or right.
There are ways about you I donât understand,
You weep like a girl, but hit like a man.
I used to love the way you made me feel when Iâm a kind
But now I can see clearly youâre a stranger of mine,
A stranger of mine.

A friend is hard to find,
Youâre a stranger of mine.

Please donât start another fight.
Baby, I donât care whoâs wrong or right.
There are ways about you I donât understand,
You weep like a girl, but hit like a man.
I used to love the way you made me feel when Iâm a kind
But now I can see clearly youâre a stranger of mine,
A stranger of mine.

I used to love the way you made me feel when Iâm a kind,
But now I can see clearly youâre a stranger of mine.
You take it all on me, youâre gonna hurt my break,
Is always so much love you take to make me understand
You give a little crush and now I crush a little more
I donât understand what we are waiting for.
Baby, now Iâm out, Iâm gonna take whatâs mine,
Cause clearly I can see that youâre a stranger of mine.
