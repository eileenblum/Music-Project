Maybe baby I give you one more minute
And if I don't do
I'm not into you

Down in the basement
Where I wanna glow
Why I don't know
Go away for a while
Get myself a smile
I'm gonna take that trip to the other side
I need to feel that I'm alive
Yeah I will take my time

Maybe I give you one more minute
And if I don't do
I don't want you

Save me from heaven
Saddle up for more
Now I know
This night I have it all
Good times I can recall
I'm gonna push myself and leave it all
No fear
I'll never fall
