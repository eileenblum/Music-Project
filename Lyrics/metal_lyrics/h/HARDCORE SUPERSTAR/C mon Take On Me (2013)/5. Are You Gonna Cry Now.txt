Shhhh
I've got a secret
I don't like your face
You wear too much make up
it's all over the place
So low
No confidence
Aiming low high and even wide

Nobody said it was easy
No way
Nobody said I was trouble
Ok
So low
No confidence
Aiming low high and even wide

Poor you
What you gonna do
Are you gonna cry now
Poor you
So are you gonna break down
Poor you
What you gonna do
Are you gonna go down
Poor you
Are you gonna cry now

So what
I've seen you before
Was it at our show or at the liquor store
Maybe you don't understand
That I don't wanna hear your band
No don't care at all
