Mama said keep it straight
Keep that shit away
Too much goin' around
I won't take the blame

No one's dead but I'm wearing black
A conversation with a broken man
I won't lie
I won't cheat
You've been had
Not by me

Too much business
Too much business
Too much business for a rollin' band

Breakdown all around
Take my soul away
Messed up no one cares
All just sounds the same
