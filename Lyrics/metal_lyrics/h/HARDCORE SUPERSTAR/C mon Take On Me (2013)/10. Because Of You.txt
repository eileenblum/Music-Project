I kind of like it when I'm down and out
We like to pass out to our favorite sound
It feels good
It feels alright
Take me out
When I'm feeling down

No fun
It goes on and on and on cause I
Don't care
When you're not around
No fun
It goes on and on and on
Don't care
When you're not around

It always feels like I fall behind
Because of you I lose my mind
We used to drink ourselves to ground
Because of you I lose my mind

We like to pass out to our favorite sound
Need no permission
Just having fun
I won't be fooled
Or pushed around
Take me out
When I'm feeling down
