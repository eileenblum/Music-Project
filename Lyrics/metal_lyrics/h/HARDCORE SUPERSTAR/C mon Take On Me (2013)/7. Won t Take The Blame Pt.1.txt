I smile when I see you cry,
I laugh when I see you die.
When they put you to sleep,
When they tell you that you're out of time.
With no reason I hate you
And never will I tell a lie.

And if you're looking for a fist-fight
Yeah, you probably didn't mean,
Yeah, you found it in me.

Won't take the blame
Kill another me, it's all the same.
When you call me out,
When you bring me down,
Kill them all, burn them underground,
Won't take the blame.

You left it good on me
You feed all the killer, see.
When I tell you the truth,
You just twist it and spit in my eye.
I'll just keep my mouth shut,
Make it easy, I won't make a sound.

And if you're looking for a fist-fight
Yeah, you probably didn't mean,
Yeah, you found it in me.

Won't take the blame
Kill another me, it's all the same.
When you call me out,
When you bring me down,
Kill them all, burn them underground,
Won't take the blame.

I really am an easy-going guy
But when you push me, I just lose my mind.
Why are you always picking on me?
