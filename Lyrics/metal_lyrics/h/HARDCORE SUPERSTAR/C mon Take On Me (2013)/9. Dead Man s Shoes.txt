Well this is how it was and how it is
You'll never learn where to stop and turn
I never need it no I never needed that
Cause I know where I belong

Take a look who you are
No one cares can't you see
It's only jealousy

In and out up and down
Try to be what you see
It's all jealousy

I wanna stay alive
Cause no one cares if I live or die
I wanna stay alive
Even if I walk in a dead man's shoes

This is how it goes this time around
You never learn when you trash my ground
You need to get it out of your mind
Cause you know where you belong

Take a look who you are
No one cares can't you see
It's only jealousy

In and out up and down
Try to be what you see
it's all jealousy

I wanna stay alive
Cause no one cares if I live or die
I wanna stay alive
Even if I walk in a dead man's shoes
