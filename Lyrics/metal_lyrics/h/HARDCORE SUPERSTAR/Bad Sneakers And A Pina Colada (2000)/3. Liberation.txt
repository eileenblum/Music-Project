The love she gives is almost real
Some things inside is always clear
So deep inside my mind I always see

[CHORUS:]
But she will never ever be the one that I need
And she will never ever be the one that I love
But she will always be the one
The only one that I want

I don't know what is in my head
But if it's good then I don't mind
The liberation of my life is what I want and what I need
[X2]

She plays with my head all day
I'm over her in a way
She plays with my mind and says she'll stay

[CHORUS]

I don't know what is in my head
But if it's good then I don't mind
The liberation of my life is what I want and what I need [x4]

You want it
She need it
She want it
She need it
Liberation of my life [x2]
