Crank up your toolbox and step right in
It's your own damn life you live in sin
The bet is on, your life's at stake
The things inside plays your mind

Easy come and easy go you know
So deep inside never ever free in mind
So deep inside no one here gets out alive

Claustrophobic incest, low down on crack
You've got the jack of hearts, so play your card
Dancing with Mr. D you and me
Pleasure spiked with pain, even more and again

Easy come and easy go you know
So deep inside never ever free in mind
So deep inside no one here gets out alive
