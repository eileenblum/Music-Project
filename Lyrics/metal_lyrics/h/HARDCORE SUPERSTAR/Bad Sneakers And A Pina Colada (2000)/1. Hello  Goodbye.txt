I said hello to you my little sin
I said goodbye to you my little friend
I cannot feed my hunger inside this shell
Now I blow the whistle and make it end

[CHORUS]
Now it burns a hole inside, my mind
When I take it to the end
This is not my exit
This is not the thing for me
I said hello
I said hello, goodbye
I said hello, goodbye to you my friend
Hello Goodbye

Why do I pick up the pieces
When I throw them away
Why do I hate myself
When I speak the truth
I cannot feed my hunger inside this shell
Now I blow the whistle
And make it end

[CHORUS x2]

I said hello to you my little sin
I said goodbye to you my friend
I said hello to you my little sin
I said hello to you my little friend
I said goodbye
