You're makin' me crazy girl
You make me mad
You're makin' me crazy girl
Love kills me every day

[CHORUS:]
The main thing to keep me going on
Is the lies I tell myself
Some times it makes me so wild
Climbing this ladder looking down
Sometimes I don't know what to do [2x]

You make me want to kill you girl
You make me mad
You're makin' me crazy girl
Love kills me every day

[CHORUS]
