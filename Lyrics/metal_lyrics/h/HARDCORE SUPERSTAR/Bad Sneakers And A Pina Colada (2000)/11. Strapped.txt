Well I say that you're the only one and I mean just what I say
And I say that everything's alright
So come on honey let this show begin
And you think your thoughts are all so bad
Sick twisted fantasies
The heart throb man that's always close is really here
To please

[CHORUS:]
So come on baby let me show you what it's like
Sex sex baby
Now you're about to see me 'cause I strap you down
Sex sex baby
Now you gonna please me 'cause I strap you down

I showed you all the things I know
I even showed you my favourites
Girl you must have known that I'm god sent
And that I ani to please
But I'm true to you and to myself
Assure you I'm the one
My heart is big and full of love
For your body and your soul

[CHORUS]
