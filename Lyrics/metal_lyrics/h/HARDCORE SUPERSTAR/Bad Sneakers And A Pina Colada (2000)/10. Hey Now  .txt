Hey now what are you doing to me
Trying to run my life in your dreams
I said hey now what you gonna do
What ya gonna do when I come for you

Hey now where are you going now?
I don't really know and I don't really care
I said hey now everywhere to go
Nowhere to stay it really makes me mad
Anyone who tries to sing &amp; anyone that needs romance
Is everywhere but anywhere to me

[CHORUS:]
You know Sally wanted to me change
And I said I don't belong in a world that's full of lies
And I made it clear at once
You know Sally wanted me
And I said I don't belong
In a world that's full of lies

Hey now where are you going now?
I don't really know and I don't really care
I said hey now everywhere to go
Nowhere to stay it really makes me mad
Anyone who tries to sing &amp; anyone that needs romance
Is everywhere but anywhere to me

[CHORUS 2x]
