Ride a big black Cadillac
Dreams come true today
Now look at their faces
Minds locked away for good

Angels fight, angels cry, angels dance and angels die
I loose my mind with faraway eyes
It just feels like I'm paralyzed
Turning 25 thinking of suicide
Just look at my white happy face
Walking like a living dead
Get it off six feet high

[CHORUS:]
Cause I'm a Rock 'n' roll star
Who do you think you are [x2]
I don't have so long to live, not far from above
The things I know means nothing'
Cause I'm a Rock 'n' Roll Star

Angels fight, angels cry, angels dance and angels die
I loose my mind with faraway eyes
It just feels like I'm paralyzed
Turning 25 thinking of suicide
Just look at my white happy face
Walking like a living dead
Get it off six feet high

[CHORUS 2x]

Listen to me baby
This is how it feels
