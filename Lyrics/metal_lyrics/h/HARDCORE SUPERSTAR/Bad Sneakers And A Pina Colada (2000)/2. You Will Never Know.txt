Little baby don't you give me no lip
I'm hard as hell I'm a sexual fix
Pretty one I'm second to none
I'm a love god girl I'm a social mistake
Do you have enough wisdom to know what to do
Are your senses working in full control
Come with me and meet Satan's friend
Don't worry won't live to tell
Sun marks me weak I'm a vampire's son
My senses working full control
Do you have enough wisdom to know what to do
Are your senses working in full control

[CHORUS:]
You will never ever know
How it feels to be alone
You will never ever know
I wanna live to see you grow old

Little baby don't you give me no lip
I'm hard as hell I'm a sexual fix
Pretty one I'm second to none
I'm a love god girl I'm a social mistake
Do you have enough wisdom to know what to do
Are your senses working in full control
