To get it right, people
You must react now
You got to read between the lines to get it right
You got to see it now
You can't be so blind
They're not dancing and you wanna know why?

There's not that much for you to lose now
Get up now, shake it up now
You better keep it clean or you're a waste of time
Put on a record now
You wanna feel all right
You know that funky sound
Put on a record and
You'll fell all right
That's the way, you wanna be

Do you get the message yet?
You fucking hypocrite
You're about to lose and it's really up to you
Too much bitehin' now
Too many faces gone
A lot of bullshit
And there's no reason why

There's not that much for you to lose now
Get up now, shake it up now
You better keep it clean or you're a waste of time
Put on a record now
You wanna feel all right
You know that funky sound
Put on a record and
You'll fell all right
That's the way, you wanna be
