I've been around this world, all the time
I've been going, right on!
And I've been travelling long and living so hard, come on!
Well I'm easy to please while I'm all alone with you
And I tell once and I'll tell you twice, that's me!

[CHORUS:]
That's my life
Baby, how I want it
How I like it
That's my life
Baby, here I got it
And I like it
That's my life
Baby, how I want it
How I like it
That's my life
Baby, here I got it
Hope you like it, baby now!

Sugar came to my roam and I said, honey let's get it on
Well I wrote all the stories and lived to tell the tales
Cuz I'm honest baby, I promise you
I never get bored
I'll tell you once and I'll tell you twice

[CHORUS]
