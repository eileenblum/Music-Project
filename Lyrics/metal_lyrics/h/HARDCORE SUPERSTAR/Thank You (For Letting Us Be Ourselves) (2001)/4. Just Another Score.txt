She's on the radio
When I'm driving down the avenue
Listen to the sound of my heartbeat
As her sweet voice sing alone
She's lonely
Just like a bit'n'run
With a smooth body wrapped in leather and lace
A rotten soul with a movie star's face
But she, she moves just like a queen
But she will never ever set me free
She's no star outside the screen

Dead drunk sweeping around my floor
All the time begging, oh please no more
When I'm through with you, you're just another score

She's a lady
She kept my motor clean
Like Superman waiting to get fit
One last breath dive in to the pit
She's lonely
A power trip trash queen
One drink away from tumbling down
Saves herself with the man she's found
But she, she moves just like a queen
But she will never ever set me free
She's no star outside the screen

Dead drunk sweeping around my floor
All the time begging, oh please no more
When I'm through with you, you're just another score
