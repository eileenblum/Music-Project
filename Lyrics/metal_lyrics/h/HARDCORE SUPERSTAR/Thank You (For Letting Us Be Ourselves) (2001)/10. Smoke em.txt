She is fine in November and I sowed her in September
Looked at her tip, saw that she was ready then
Well I wanted to believe she was
Easy beby! 
Won't you tell me you wanted I never wanted cuz
I never ever sowed it like this before
But she wants to believe me now
Smoke baby, come and tell me what you want
Love me cuz I ain't got nothing else to do
C'mon and smoke my funky... a a a
The smoke moves like you never ever thought it would
C'mon, don't shoot that fix
This is good, this is high
It's just like paradise
Smoke
Smoke 'em if you got 'em
Smoke
Smoke 'em if you got 'em
Some nights I want to have you closer
Tell me what you want I might need it
But I don't need any love, the only thing I need is
C'mon
Smoke
Smoke 'em if you got 'em
You want to feel
You want to fly to heaven?
C'mon and feel my love, feel the heaven that I heading for
Smoke
Smoke 'em if you got 'em
Smoke
Smoke 'em if you got 'em
