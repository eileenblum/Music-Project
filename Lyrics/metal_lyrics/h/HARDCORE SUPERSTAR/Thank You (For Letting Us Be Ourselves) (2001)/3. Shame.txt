Feels like yesterday since she took my lust away
Nothing really matters anyway
Bloodsucker her name, she's envy wrapped in a frame
Affection's no guarantee, say hello to her best friend mrs. jealousy

She will never ever be the one that I want
She will never ever be the one that I adore
She will never ever be the one

Shame
Baptized by jealousy
Shame
It will always, always be the same
Shame
Handcuffed by misery
Shame
It will always, always be the same

Her legs are always crossed cuz she's taught to keep them crossed
The new sensation, sexual gratification
Let me her the sound of my smite when I land on your thigh
No shame on me, it's up to you
Let the redness be my point of view

She will never ever be the one that I want
She will never ever be the one that I adore
She will never ever be the one

Shame
Baptized by jealousy
Shame
It will always, always be the same
Shame
Handcuffed by misery
Shame
It will always, always be the same
