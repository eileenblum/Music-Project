Hey now mama, do you feel like it's over now
Hey honey, don't you worry I'll stay by your side
The time of your life is yet to come but it's coming soon
Hold on and I'll take you to the end of another time
And you, you always believed me true
You always believed my hearts ache
I don't believe you know

I want you to see
Sitting here holding your hand
I don't want to sing this song for you
When you're gone
I want you to see
Sitting here holding your hand
I never really wanted to say goodbye
Oh no, no, no

Little sweet mama, you will be alright, goodnight
There are some things I want you to hear from me
Why you, my god
Take my hole damn world instead
Listen closely and I'll tell you all these tings that you will never see
And you, you always believed me true
You always belived my hearts ache
I don't believe you know

I want you to see
Sitting here holding your hand
I don't want to sing this song for you
When you're gone
I want you to see
Sitting here holding you're hand
I never really wanted to say goodbye
Oh, no, no, no
