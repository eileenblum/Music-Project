Well you can scare my mama, baby
The words you said should not leave your brain
May I suggest a different attitude maybe
Cuz your attitude is driving me insane
But you're attractive still my lady
Appreciate the things you do
And I can always, always count on you honey
I am stupid and I share that with you
Do me that favour my disgusting queen, and share my guillotine
Do me that favour my disgusting queen, and step into my limousine

Don't you question my behaviour?
How you say it feels a bit taboo
You can always try to be my saviour
If I can't live my life I guess we're thru
Each relationship hums on a song
Some melodies sound so sweet
We can't tell what is wrong
But I can always, always smell dead meat
Do me that favour my disgusting queen, and share my guillotine
Do me that favour my disgusting queen, and step into my limousine

I may be deranged, or I'm changed
I value our lives in many ways
A spoiled stubborn youth is what we are
Our parents made it pretty far
We may be deranged, or are we changed
We value our lives in many ways
A spoiled stubborn youth is what we are

Do me that favour my disgusting queen, and share my guillotine
Do me that favour my disgusting queen, and step into my limousine
