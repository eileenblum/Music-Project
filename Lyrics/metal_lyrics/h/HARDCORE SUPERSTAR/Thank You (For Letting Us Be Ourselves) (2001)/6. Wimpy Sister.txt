I wanted to believe you
Yhat you ain't got no one else
I wanted to believe you
But you make me feel ashamed
On and on I hear this voice
On an on the same old noise
Something tells me something's wrong
Tell me now, what's going on?
She said she wanted to dance 
A little romance and a little arrogance
Beat you wimpy sister down
Goddamn woman, I couldn't believe
Your walk, your talk, my insanity
Beat your wimpy sister down
No chance that I'll believe you
Cuz you stole my heart once
No way that I believe you
No diamonds and fancy stones
On and on I hear this voice
On an on the same old noise
Something tells me something's wrong
Tell me now, what's going on?
She said she wanted to dance 
A little romance and a little arrogance
Beat you wimpy sister down
Goddamn woman, I couldn't believe
Your walk, your talk, my insanity
Beat your wimpy sister down
I wanted to believe you
Yhat you ain't got no one else
I wanted to believe you
But you make me feel ashamed
On and on I hear this voice
On an on the same old noise
Something tells me something's wrong
Tell me now, what's going on?
She said she wanted to dance 
A little romance and a little arrogance
Beat you wimpy sister down
Goddamn woman, I couldn't believe
Your walk, your talk, my insanity
Beat your wimpy sister down
