Lets choose, make your choice
It's either do or die
You wanna know where to go?
It's really up to you! 
You kike to see it from your point of view
Cuz the others might think you're a bore
It spins around and hits you hard
On it's way back to the ground
Everything rules, everything's cool
Tell me what you see when your dreaming of your fantasies
Why even struggle?
Something's wrong, not me it's up to you
You stick around, I don't know why
Can' they see your anger
They must be blind, when is your time
Read between the lines
There's two sides to every story, you're truly missing both this time
It spins around and hits you hard
On it's way back to the ground
