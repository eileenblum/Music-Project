You don't want my love cuz I ain't got none for you my friend
Why can't you see, that I'm so messed up I know that you got to believe somehow
You ought to think twice, do it once riding on Sycamore
Ain't for me anymore
You wanna juice it up, stir it up, think about, times we had
Stay that way all right
And I'll stay I ain't got you no more
Cuz I'll stay
You ain't got things that I want you to
You killed all my feelings I know that you wanted to do it right
I say goodbye and I wanna know why
You can't be all right without
You ought to think twice, do it once riding on Sycamore
Ain't for me any more
And I think about, Jessie now, every day, every night
Stay that way all right
And I'll stay I ain't got you no moreStay that way all right
And I'll stay I ain't got you no more
Cuz I'll stay
You ain't got things that I want you to
Well the change of the season, all of my feelings gone
Well all of the reasons, this whole season's gone
Well the change of the season, all of my feelings gone
Well all my loving and this summer season is gone
