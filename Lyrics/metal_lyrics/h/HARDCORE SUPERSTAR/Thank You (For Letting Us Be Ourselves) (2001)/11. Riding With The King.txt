I know you can't believe it and I know you must go on
Something might feel strange, so the damage is done
My world seems so pretty
My world seems so strong
Obsessed with my fantasy, in reality I belong
You must know my world, to really feel what I feel
It's not easy I know, so keep your temper down
I remember you my friend, you're not easy to forget
So let me just tell you, I'll be there when I'll come back
How have you been?
I must write and see
Time changes
Can't control how people feel?
One friend of mine
Patience's for two
My jack of hearts' for you

Take one look at me, tel me what you see
What I feel is what I sing cuz I'm riding with the king
Take one look at me, tel me what you see
What I feel is what I sing cuz I'm riding with the king

I know you can't believe it, and I know you must go on
Something might feel strange, so the damage is done
My world seems so pretty
My world seems so strong
Obsessed with my fantasy, in reality I belong
How have you been?
I must write and see
Time changes
Can't control how people feel?
One friend of mine
Patience's for two
My jack of hearts' for you
