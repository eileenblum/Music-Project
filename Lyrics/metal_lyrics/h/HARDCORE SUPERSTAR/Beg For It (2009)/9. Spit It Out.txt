Can't control the words I'm sayin'
When I curse you start swearin'
But then you badmouth me
You stupid little fuck
Don't come to me

Ain't gonna stand here 
Will not grieve
A righteous man
Not to be seen
So take your act elsewhere
Stupid redneck
Don't want you here

When you spit it out
Full of pride
Spit it out
Take your time

If you don't hear what I'm sayin'

Wish I could say yes I'm a man
But then I lie
The best I can 
I'm seeing red
What's wrong with me
And my rotten head

If you don't hear what I'm sayin'
Go home before you start weepin'
