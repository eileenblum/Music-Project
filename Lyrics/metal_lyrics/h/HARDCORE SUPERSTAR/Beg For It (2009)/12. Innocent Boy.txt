I don't give a damn 
Cause I don't Fuxxin' understand
And that's why they call me a stupid man

You lift me up
Just so you can push me to the ground
You make me weak
Stick around
This man's heading for a breakdown

Don't wanna know 
How low
My self esteem really can go
So when you go 
Let me know
A black cloud on an innocent boy

I've got a jokers smile
An evil grin
A lovely style
And that's why I treat myself
As an innocent child

A black cloud on an innocent boy
Black cloud damn I'm an innocent boy
When you go let me know
I'm an innocent boy
