Why don't you lock your door 
Never seen a bad guy before 
No no no
Lock your door
I've never seen you like this before
You used to be on the floor 
No no no 
On the floor

No one is pure
Nothing to adore
My way will take you home

Next time
Take 'em all out
That's why we love life
So sick
To bring 'em all down
So we can love life 
That's what we all would like

Bad girls can be pure
But I've never seen one before
No one's pure
Oh no one's pure
Innocence be destroyed
Nothing to avoid
No no more
Any more
