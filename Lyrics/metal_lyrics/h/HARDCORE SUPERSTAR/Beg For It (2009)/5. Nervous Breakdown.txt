There's a method to madness
The only way to hide my sadness
I'll come around when you need me
I'm getting better believe me

I don't care what you say
A holliday in my head
Not getting better believe me
I'll come around when you need me

Nervous breakdown on new years eve 
With no dignity
See, see the real me
A toast to my lunacy

It's such a disease
My mind can come and go as it please
We hide from reality
Mad people need no company

Nervous breakdown on new years eve
With no dignity on new years eve
There's a method to madness 
On new years eve
Not getting better believe me
On new years eve
