Let's see this as an invitation
Here's no end
In here you need no reason 
A place to forget about bad beginnings
So when you go there
Look for me

Nobody hears
Nobody cares at all
No judging
I make my own laws

Whatever happened to all illegal fun
A hideout
A sanctuary from the sun

Let's go away for another season
I don't have to explain
Don't need to have a reason
I laugh and cry with a new beginning 
So when I go there 
I'll hide with you
