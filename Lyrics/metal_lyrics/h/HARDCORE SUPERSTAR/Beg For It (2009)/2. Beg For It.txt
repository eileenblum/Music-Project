What!?
Am I thinking to loud 
My brain hurts so I'll rest for a while
Good luck!
My head's about to break 
Emotionally sick
I beg to differ
Just rotten inside
Slowly I die

Beg for it
Lift me up let my touch the sky
Beg for it
No more demons standing by my side
They want inside my head
Guess they want me dead
Lying face down in my grave
Beg for it 
No more demons standing by my side

No way
I'm kept in a cage
My patience has expired 
I need a new face
I feel emotional
I feel I have to fly
I'm not in to living if I know I'm going to die
Slowly I die

Good luck
Cause I'm about to break 
I feel I have to fly
Rest for a while
I feel emotional
I feel I have to fly
Do I have to beg for it
