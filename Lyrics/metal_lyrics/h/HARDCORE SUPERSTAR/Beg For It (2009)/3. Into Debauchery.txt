Oh no
I don't need another trip to that graveyard
Let me be
Already being sick n tired
Being friendly
Bring me
Let me be

Into sweet debauchery 
I'll hang myself
I'm misery

Let's go
Gimme some rope
Gimme something to set me free
Life's tough
With a little bit of fantasy
I'll find something that will kill me
