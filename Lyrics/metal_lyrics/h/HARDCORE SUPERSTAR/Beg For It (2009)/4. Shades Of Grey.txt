That's when I scream
I just wanna be seen
A self destructive kiss
It will always make me sick
Know what I mean?
Shades of grey
Long way from home
Switch to safe mode
I bet you want to be alone
Time to be strong

I am what I am anyway
And I don't need your shit
Everyday
I am what I am
Shades of grey

I wish for more
A bloodsucker
Gotta have it all
I will kill
I will crawl
When I don't need you
I'll let you know

I am what I am everyday
And I hope you feel like shit
Everyday
Cause I am what I am
I'm shades of grey
