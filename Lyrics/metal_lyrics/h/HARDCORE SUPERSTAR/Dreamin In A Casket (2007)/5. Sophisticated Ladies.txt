Baptized without a mother
Am I tough like the others
Oh no
Sunshine on my brothers
I drink when I see problems
Low
So low

That's what they call me sometimes
Beautiful women shine

I don't wanna sleep with sophisticated ladies
I just wanna live in filth with some deadbeats

Can't take this any longer
Some wine
I gotta get stronger
Low
So low
Poor boy U don't know how to stare into her eyes
Oh no
