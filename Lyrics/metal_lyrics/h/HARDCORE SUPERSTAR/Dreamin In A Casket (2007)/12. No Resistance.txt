Can't wait to get under your skin
I got a fistful o attitude
You just won't let me in
Why sleep with insanity
It's such a different approach
It fits me perfectly

No resistance
My decision
Nobody said
U better take it easy

I'm not a stranger
Why question me?
Starry eyes
Suspicious minds
Big fuckin' mystery
Problem solved with a cup of tea
If you don't recognize me
Sleep with stupidity
