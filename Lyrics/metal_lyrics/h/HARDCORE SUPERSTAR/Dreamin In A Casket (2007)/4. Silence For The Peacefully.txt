If people knew
The real me would simply frighten you
I breathe in my dreams
That's who I am
He's real mean
In my reality there are things I can see
One of a kind
No space for me
Just a natural bad
I live as fast as I can
I see myself as the enemy

Scream for me
Silence for the peacefully
Scream for me
I'll make you famous forever
Scream for me
I don't care if you all ready died
So bleed with me
I'll make you famous forever

It feels good
There ain't nothing that I won't to do for you
I am the man in my dreams
No sense of reality
One sick mind
I'm ready to leave
Just a natural bad
I live as fast as I can
I see myself as the enemy
