Dead eyes
I would like to see some light
No surprise
My touch goes out of sight
I have to go
I gotta see the sun
Can't kill what has not begun
Trouble starts in paradise

Time changes
Rearrange my soul
I feel strangled
Now I dance alone

I'm sorry for the shape I'm in
I'm sorry but I lost it friend
I'll never see your face again
There's no tomorrow
No one to follow

Scuse me
Darkness needs no light
I see
Your glories out of sight
I gotta go I have to self destruct
No more fuel
I'm out of luck
Shine on in paradise
