I Never see then sun I find it hard to breathe
Tear me apart rip me up I'm not the one who bleeds
I always crawl so invisible here
I see the picture but I'm outside the frame

What crawled up your ass better keep on dreamin' for what's gone
I'm dreamin' in a casket
What crawled up your ass keep on dreamin' for what's gone
I'm dreamin' in a casket

I see it clearly now I don't believe in me
Cut the crap deep within a casket in my dream
This is my show my only fantasy
You can not blame me cause you don't understand, don't understand

What crawled up your ass better keep on dreamin' for what's gone
I'm dreamin' in a casket
What crawled up your ass keep on dreamin' for what's gone
I'm dreamin' in a casket

What crawled up your ass better keep on dreamin' for what's gone
I'm dreamin' in a casket
What crawled up your ass keep on dreamin' for what's gone
I'm dreamin' in a casket
For what's gone I'm dreamin' in a casket
For what's gone I'm dreamin' in a casket
