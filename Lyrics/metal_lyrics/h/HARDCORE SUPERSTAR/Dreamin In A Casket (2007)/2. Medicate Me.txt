[Verse 1:]
Don't go, got no charm
Let's make it simple
Let's drink it all
Want you to be strong
I drink from the bottle then my *problems* are gone

[Pre-Chorus:]
Why travel in the dark?
Just because I got a poisoned heart
Wish I got a proper start
Now I know I got a poisoned heart

[Chorus:]
Medicate me
Wish me luck
Medicate me
My poisoned heart
Intoxicate me
Intoxicate me, alright!

[Verse 2:]
All fools got no brain
When I drink pressure and shame
None grows to be strong
When I medicate myself there's no right from wrong

[Pre-Chorus:]
Why travel in the dark?
Just because I've got a poisoned heart
Wish I got a proper start
Now I know I've got a poisoned heart

[Chorus:]
Medicate me
Wish me luck
Medicate me
My poisoned heart
Intoxicate me
Intoxicate me, alright!

[Solo]

Medicate me
Wish me luck
Medicate me
My poisoned heart
Intoxicate me
Intoxicate me

I travel in the dark
I got a poisoned heart
I travel in the dark
I got a poisoned heart
