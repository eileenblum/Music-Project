Has anybody seen my baby
She left when I talked to this lady
Nothing's true
Nothing to do
Would you like me to kill you

When I, when I glow
You mean streak shows
I don't, I don't know
So here I come

I don't need no goddamn company
Oh no
I don't want some pig to lecture me
Let me glow

Two-faced witch kept me up all night
No wish to make it right
What I've seen
Not pure
Not clean
Fits me perfectly
