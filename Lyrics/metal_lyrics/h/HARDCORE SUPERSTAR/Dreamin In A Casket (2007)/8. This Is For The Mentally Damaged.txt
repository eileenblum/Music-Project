Give me a moment
I'm leaving my mind behind
Friends are you with me
I kick some soil in your eyes
Could you believe I'm mentally I'll
I got to find a way out of here
I'm so sick of everything
I don't believe in anything

Take away the part that hurts
Let the rest remain

This is for the mentally damaged
For those who don't wish to live
This is for the mentally damaged
We're all damaged within

Mentally damaged
Down on my knees
I beg for forgiveness
Tortured in my dreams
It's all in me
No empathy
I just want to get out of there
I hide from reality
The only way to get out of there
