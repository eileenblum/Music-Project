I gotta get that sinner
Some sentimental bringer
You can put my temper on
I breathe naturally and I know what I see
But now my temper's coming strong
If I have to sit and listen to your fxxkin'
Shit
My body shakes and shivers
My blood starts to boil
That's my real memory
Tears with pain is what I feel

One lesson in violence
Take her head
Total satisfaction
One lesson in violence
Total satisfaction

I gotta give it to ya
Your point is proven
I say it in a simple song
I bleed naturally and I know how to see
Take your rules and troubles are gone
If I have to prove my point and shove my
Hand down your throat
Satisfaction fills me up when I'm done
It's with my last goodbyes
I realize
Tears with pain
I'm coming home
