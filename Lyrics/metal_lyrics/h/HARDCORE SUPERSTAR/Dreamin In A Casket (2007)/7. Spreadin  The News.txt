Suddenly I see my chance
I break their balls the best I can
I take my chance
I stand in their way
What a man what a plan

Start spreadin' the news I'm almost gone
Don't see me for what I have done
Don't you be sad but I'm all ready dead
I'm almost gone
Almost gone
Start spreadin' the news

I did not mean to say those things
So let's get mad and see what I mean
I bring you down
Only lunatics around
When you crash use my name
