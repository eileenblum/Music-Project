I'm changing, could you change for me
I promise I won't lie, masturbate or smoke with my black friend again

I will never learn so forgive me for who I am, I'm not a patient man
I end up on the floor for most of my time, 
That's when you see me shine

I can't change a thing, I said everything
Leave me be, you need a different kind of therapy

I'm changing, could you change for me
I promise I will walk, talk
And play my part again
