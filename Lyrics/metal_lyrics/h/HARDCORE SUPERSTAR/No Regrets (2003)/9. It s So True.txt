Some people always tend to fake
Some people act so bad
What really happened to our heads
Imagination man
Let me just shine on Just like in that diamond song
Shine on all of you
That's when you know

Well it's so true
There's really something wrong
They fill you up with a thousand songs
True
There's really something wrong
I wanna know, know what to do

Everytime I step into that game
It fills me up with an awful taste
This fantasy of broken hearts, let's pretend and play along
