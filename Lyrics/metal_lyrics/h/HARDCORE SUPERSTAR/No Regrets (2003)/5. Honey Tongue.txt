Honey, ah ah yeah
Honey, oh oh yeaah

Alright, 

My babe's got a temper but still she wants to dance
I'm not in the mood and still not ready for romance
She said - Come along and dance to this song
Just don't take it too far

I said you must have dreamt
These words are heaven sent
And here she comes again
She's my honey tongue

Honey
I just made out with you
You're such a, such a honey
Who loves to see me dance

Alright

Idon't need any attention, I don't want your misery
All I am is satisfaction that's my guarantee
She said - please, please I behave like you wish
Just don't take it too far

I said you must have dreamt
These words are heaven sent
And here she comes again
She's my honey tongue
She's my honey tongue

Honey
I just made out with you
You're such a, such a honey
Who loves to see me dance
