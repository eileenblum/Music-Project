I'm on the floor for most of my time
Feeling so bad, it's in my mind
Teens do lock good swinging by
If I'm growing old I'll take my time

My case is safe, it's almost blind
Blowing in the wind, blowing in my mind
I got style, I got my pride
Misery's surfing on my side

Still I'm glad,
I'm glad, for the youth that I had
Way more sensible,
Say no more,
Cradle's laying on the floor

I push you down to the floor
Relax down there or I'll give you some more
Greatest misery in the history of time
If I'm growing old I'll take what's mine

My act is safe when I start to pretend
I hate myself, hero to the end
I got style, I got my pride
Misery's surfing on my side

Still I'm glad,
I'm glad, for the youth that I had
Way more sensible,
Say no more,
Cradle's laying on the floor [2x]

[SOLO]

Still I'm glad,
I'm glad, for the youth that I had
Way more sensible,
Say no more,
Cradle's laying on the floor [2x]

On the floor [4x]
