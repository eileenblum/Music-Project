I hang around with you summer's almost gone
Good attitude honey, I'm in a good mood
Tell me once again, this is forever, my best friend

It took me time to get my hands on you
Will take me twice as much to get over you
Again and again you say
This could be our last great day

Eightynine, I'm in a love state
Eightynine

[Chorus]
Take me far from home, let's play all night
Van Halen's on the radio, I feel alright
Drink's a bit too strong but I got to hold on

Is this the real me or just an act
Whatever, when it comes to you I feel perfect
Tell me once again, this is forever my best friend

We had our first little fight, it's jealousy
Her face turned red my face turned white
Again and again I say
Let's pretend it's our last day
