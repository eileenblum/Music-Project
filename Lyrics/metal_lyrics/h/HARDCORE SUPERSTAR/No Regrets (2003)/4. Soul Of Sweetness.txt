A lonely song so sing along if you felt like this my empathy
A soul of sweetness still wants to kill you
But the queen is way too strong

You're so wrong, it's bizarre
We travel around in a stolen car
And I don't mind a little fight, what's right or wrong

I want to sing you're my everything, my everything
My soul of sweetness, of sweetness

Passion's wrong so come along and feel with me my misery
A soul of sweetness still wants to love you
But tomorrow I'll be gone
