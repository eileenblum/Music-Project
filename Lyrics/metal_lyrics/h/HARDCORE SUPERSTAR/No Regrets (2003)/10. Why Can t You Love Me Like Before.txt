You never looked so good like that day in june and I want you.
And all of my friends, the say that we were ment and I trusted them, 
But now you said goodbye from me it's such a fight, come on now.
The difference is why, and why can't I be with you, oh my god! 
I said; stop that! you're fooling yourself, let me be your man! 

Why can't you love me like before?
All my time now hurts like a wound.
Why can't you and me just be together?

I know you got yours, I better sure got mine, but I want you.
Remember those nights right after the fights when I kissed you.
I said; stop that! you're fooling yourself, let me be your man! 

Why can't you love me like before?
All my time now hurts like a wound.
Why can't you and me just be together?
I said; why can't you and me just be together?
Tell me why. [x2]

Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why-y.
