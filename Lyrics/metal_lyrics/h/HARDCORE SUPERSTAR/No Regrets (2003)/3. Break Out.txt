Loosen up, you're among your friends
Just be cool and let your mind be free
I say - hey you female
Wipe thoes tears right off your face
I'm hear to give you the truth

A message from the stars
My head is frome Mars
Flying like a rocket
One minute from the stars
My passion's from venus
Women who have seen us
That's how we swing it again

Break out baby, don't you wanna dance
I wanna lose it today
Breakout honey, make way. take a chance
My passion is hear to stay

You better stand up, why don't you take a chance
I wanna feel you again
I say - hello little one, let's go out and spend some time
Affection's all around
