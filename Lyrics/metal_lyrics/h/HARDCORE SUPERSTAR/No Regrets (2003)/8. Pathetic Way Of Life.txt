You must be sane to realise
People perform in paradise
Excuse me if I make you low
Got to go fast, can not take it slow

Pathetic way of life
Why can't I service my soul
I can't control
That nothing grows

Kill me for what I used to say
I perform like people I used to hate
Beg me for what I used to do
What I did, what I do, I belive it's true
