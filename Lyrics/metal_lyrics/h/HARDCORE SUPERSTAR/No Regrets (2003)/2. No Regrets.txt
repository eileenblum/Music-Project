I've never been told, I'v never been controlled
Said stupid things and taught myself to laugh
I got no regrets
I've never sold myselft, lost my hope
I'd rather be abused then amuse you like a clown
I've got no regrets

We got immediate hits for you, weÂ´re innocent, accused

What heppand to, What heppand to youe smile
I haven't seen you, haven't seen you for a while

I used to be glad now I'm screaming mad
I've made my decions, your dance is crap, you're bad
Still got no regrets
I appriciate the dance to live in truth
All I got to do is maintain truth the groove
I did have some regrets
