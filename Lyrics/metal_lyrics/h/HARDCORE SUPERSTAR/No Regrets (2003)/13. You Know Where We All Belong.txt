You made my heart and soul collide
You are so fine and full of life
I said - If you don't know where to go
Please love come with me
Sit yourself next to my record machine

You know where we all belong
Sail on and into my song
Don't know where we are going now
Don't know where we've been
Sailing on and on and away

You came to me like in that song
Someone special, spirit's goal and on
If you're feeling lonely now
Please don't shade a tear
I'll be with you at the end of this song

You know where we all belong
Sail on and into my song
Don't know where we are going now
Don't know where we've been
Sailing on and on and away
