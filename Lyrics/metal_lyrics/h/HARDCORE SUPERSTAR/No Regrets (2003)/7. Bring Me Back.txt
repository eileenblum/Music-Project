I wanna tell you wanna let you know this is what I want
I never told you but you and me are on our own
Well it's sad but true, nothing I can do it's up to you
And I hate your whining and your crying, well we are through

I can't tell when you live my life
Sad it's in your mind

Stop now start me up, before you wear me out
Bring us back to the ground
Cause if I sing when you're around your atitude nails me down

I wanna dance I wanna sing my song but not with you
My new love's got so much patience she's not like you
Well it's time to move nothing more to do to get over you
No more whining, no more crying
God, we're through

Stop now start me up, before you wear me out
Bring us back to the ground
Cause if I sing when you're around your atitude nails me down

Your atitude nails me down [x4]
