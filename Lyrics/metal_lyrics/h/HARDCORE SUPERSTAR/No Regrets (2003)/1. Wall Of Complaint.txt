You got to take me home before it wears me out
The city's full of fantasies, I just can't blow my role
This is my wall, wall of complaint

We're not ready for your world
We can manage on our own
We don't want to live in your fake modern world

You people can't give me satisfation, that's a fact
Take me to my holy place and kick me off the stage
