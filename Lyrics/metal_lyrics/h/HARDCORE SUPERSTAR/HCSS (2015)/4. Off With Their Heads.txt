I can't stand it
Always stepping on my feet
There's some people
Who needs a slapping on the cheek...

You got some nerve
Telling me how to shine
I put my foot up your ass
'Cause you're way out of line

We won't win them over
Too hard to explain
Off with their heads! [2x]
Yeah!
We won't win them over
Too hard to explain
Off with their heads! [2x]

This little gangster
He got shot in his face
No clue...
They blamed it on his race

Go back blasting...
Gonna take what is mine
If your take our criminal friend
Then you're way out of line

We won't win them over
Too hard to explain
Off with their heads! [2x]
Yeah!
We won't win them over
Too hard to explain
Off with their heads! [2x]

I can't stand it
Always stepping on my feet
There's some people
Who needs a slapping on the cheek...

You got some nerve
Telling me how to shine
I put my foot up your ass
'Cause you're way out of line

We won't win them over
Too hard to explain
Off with their heads! [2x]
Yeah!
We won't win them over
Too hard to explain
Off with their heads! [2x]
