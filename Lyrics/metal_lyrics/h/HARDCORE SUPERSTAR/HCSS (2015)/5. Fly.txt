It's funny how things end
Sometimes reality
Seems so unreal
Empty shoes in the closet
It feels like there's nothing
Left to love
Sometimes I don't wanna wake up
Sometimes I don't wanna wake up
Fly, fly, fly
To never come back
Fly, fly, fly
To never come back
One thousand memories ain't
Much help for me
Will time ever heal the wounds
I'm bleeding
Sometimes I don't wanna wake up
Sometimes I don't wanna wake up
Fly, fly, fly
To never come back
Fly, fly, fly
To never come back
Fly away my friend
To never come back again
My friend
Fly, fly,fly
