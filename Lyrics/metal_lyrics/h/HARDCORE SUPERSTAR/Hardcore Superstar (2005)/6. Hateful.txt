I've never seen you look so bad
It's been a long time since we had a good laugh
It's time to make amends
I do it cause I care about you
It's all fatasies
Nothing we've said
But people talk and wish we've never met
It's when you feel way behind
They pick up everything
One of a kind

I hate to bring you down
The Horror of them all

[CHORUS:]
Hateful
All the Time
Hateful
Bring me down
All the time

To see it different is to see it so clear
They know your weakness
That's your greatest fear
It's when you feel way behind
They pick up everything
In my mind
You're quite confusing
It's hard to belive
I feel weird
I gotta wipe those tears
I feel it coming
I think I can see
It's not you
I'm talking about Me

You love to bring me bown
The horror of them all
