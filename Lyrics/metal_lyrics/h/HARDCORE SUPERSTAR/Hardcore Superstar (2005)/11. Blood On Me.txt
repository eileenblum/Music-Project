Have you ever heard the question:
Where did you spend the night?
I crave women with a passioin
And I make them stay in shape

I never tried, I'm always wrong
Stupid as I am, I don't change for no one
Almost gone, ready to go
I'm almost gone and I'm ready to go

[Chorus]
Blood on me, I kill suddenly
I'm gonna rip your heart out
It was a trip with a fight
Blood on me

We're standin' back to back
A dagger stabbin' bitch
She's got a tongue like a razor blade
Intoxicated by her hairspray

You never tried, you're always wrong
Stupid as you are, you don't change for no one
Almost gone, ready to go
You're almost gone and you're ready to go

[Chorus]
Blood on me, I kill suddenly
I'm gonna rip your heart out
It was a trip with a fight
Blood on me
