Cry you eyes
I said cry your eyes

IÂ´ve got shit on my hands
DonÂ´t you wanna see me anymore
Well I love to stalk you
I pushed my ego too far

No confusion
ThatÂ´s what I want
I think I took you too far
Stop believe in
ItÂ´s what you want
Is that all youÂ´ve got

Cry your eyes out
My school of charm canÂ´t save me this time
Cry your eyes out
CanÂ´t take me nowhere no more
What you said before
Were all lies youÂ´ve grown
A casanova with a devils charm
Cry your eyes out
Cry your eyes

This is the love
IÂ´ll show you my world tonight
ItÂ´s not my ego
ItÂ´s just my precious delight

I said no confusion
ThatÂ´s what I want
I think I took you too far
Stop believe in
ItÂ´s what you want
Is that all youÂ´ve got

Cry your eyes out
My school of charm canÂ´t save me this time
Cry your eyes out
CanÂ´t take me nowhere no more
What you said before
Were all lies youÂ´ve grown
A casanova with a devils charm
Cry your eyes out
Cry your eyes
Cry your eyes

I said cry your eyes
Cry your eyes
I come on

What you said before
Were all lies youÂ´ve grown
A casanova with a devils charm
What you said before
Lies youÂ´ve grown
A casanova with a devils charm

Cry your eyes out
My school of charm canÂ´t save me this time
Cry your eyes out
CanÂ´t take me nowhere no more
What you said before
Were all lies youÂ´ve grown
A casanova with a devils charm
Cry
