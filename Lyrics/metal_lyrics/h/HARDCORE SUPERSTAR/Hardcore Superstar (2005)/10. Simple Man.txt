Should I care about you
Should I take my chance on you
If I criticize your manners
Would you like to be with me
True blue

I'm a stone cold sinner, a rock 'n' roll singer
But a fool my friend
They say I got no class, I can get no style
Still a fool my friend

Chorus
I can not understand
Is it illegal to be a man
Mommy tried to teach me
But you know, I'm a simple man

True Blue the colour of me and you
I'll send you all my wishes
When I understand your point of view

I'm a stone cold sinner, a rock 'n' roll singer
But a fool my friend
They say I got no class, I can get no style
Still a fool my friend

I can not understand
Is it illegal to be a man
Mommy tried to teach me
Is it so hard to be a simple man

A simpla man... 

I'm a stone cold sinner, a rock 'n' roll singer
But a fool my friend
They say I got no class, I can get no style
Still a fool my friend

I can not understand
Is it illegal to be a man
Mommy tried to teach me
Is it so hard to be a simple man [x2]
