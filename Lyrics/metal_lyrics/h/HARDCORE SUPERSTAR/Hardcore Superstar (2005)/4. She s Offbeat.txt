Slowdown
gotta get in time
i gotta go somewere
i'm always down.
hold tight. gotta stop.
let me know.
you got no rythem at all.
you come offbeat if all.
i think we're almost there.
i coming closer and i'm coming everywhere. 

Ooo
She's offbeat
She's offbeat
Ooo
She's offbeat
Offbeat

Lay down. while the beat goes on.
god gave us one gift.
let us stay hard on.
it's all your fxxkin' fantasies.
dig a deep hole with your shallow soul.
you don't practice wath you preach.
i still come you're out of reash.
