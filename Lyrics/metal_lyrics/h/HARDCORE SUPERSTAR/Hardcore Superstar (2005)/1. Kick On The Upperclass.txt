Scratch my back again
My butchy girlfriend
Pay me
Or I'll comeagain
I'll take you low into my hand

LOW
I've hit rock bottom
The only one who cares about me in on my own kind

Kick on the upperclass
Take them out with the trash
Kick on the upperclass
End of class

He's just a millionaire with a tasteless touch of
class
She stares
I'm single again
Cause I'm broke
Life is fair

What a lovely way to spend the evening
