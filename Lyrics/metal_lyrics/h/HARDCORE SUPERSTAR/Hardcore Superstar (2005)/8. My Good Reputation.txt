You talk so much
You scream in my face
Don't know how let it go
My nose gets punched every time I say
"We're only friend you know"
I feel jealousy baby
Jealousy coming
Your face turns ugly and old
Midnight lady
Precious little baby
Woman your ego has grown

Why don't you just wash your ugly mouth

My good reputation gave me a friend that I don't know
It's a tricky situation cause my girl think she's a whore
She's a midnight lady
Precious little baby
Woman your ego has grown
My good reputation gave me a friend that I don't know

I will always hate your female friends
You can't call them no more
But I haven't had sex with them I swear
It doesn't matter at all
I feel jealousy baby
Headache my lady
Woman your ego has grown
She's a midnight lady
Precious little baby
Woman your ego has grown
