Come smash, you got seats tonight
Sippin'on wine
I'm fine
The music keeps me up all night
'Cause I'm full of lust
Come with us
Run for your lives

I'm only lonely when the music's over
Lonely when you're going home

We don't celebrate Sundays anymore
(We don't celebrate sundays)
My good church is not open on Sundays
(We don't celebrate sundays)

Touched, touched by that amazing sound
My blood begins to boil
A celebration to the night
'Cause I'm full of lust
Come with us
Let's spend the night

There's no religion in my house
No thick people in my house
