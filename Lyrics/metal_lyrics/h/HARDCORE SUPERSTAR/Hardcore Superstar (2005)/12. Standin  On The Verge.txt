I don't know what you've been goin' thru
It's been great I surely will miss you
But I don't need no sympathy from you
It's so frightening when dreams do come true

Standin' on the verge of insanity
Standin' on the edge of being free
Standin' on the verge
Standin' on the verge
Standin' on the edge of being...

I believe I said it twice to you
I confess I can't remember what's true
Out of sight, out of mind that won't happen to me n' you
Same old situation
Sad but true

Standin' on the verge of insanity
Standin' on the edge of being free
Standin' on the verge
Standin' on the verge
Standin' on the edge of being free

Yeah, I need someone
Need another soul
Restless, hopeful and a heart of gold
Yeah, I need someone
Need another soul
Restless, hopeful and a heart of gold

Standin'
Standin'
I'm standin' at the end of the road
Standin'
Standin'
I'm standin' at the end of the road

Standin' on the verge of insanity
Standin' on the edge of being free
Standin' on the verge
Standin' on the verge
Standin' on the edge of being free..
