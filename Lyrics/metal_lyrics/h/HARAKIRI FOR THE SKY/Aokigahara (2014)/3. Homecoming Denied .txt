I donât think we will withstand this trip, 
along these paths cobbled with shards.
To tell you now makes me feel so heavy hearted, 
but one night, this life will tear us apart. 

And now that I gave away the stories end,
its facts sneak in so deadly slow and subtle.
But just that something is subtle, 
doesnât mean itâs going to turn out right!

This lethargy, so perfectly shaped, continues spiting filth in my face.
Steady going on subsisting, outlive this trivial life, 
although this edgeless dagger is stuck deep in my heart.

How sad a fate, even these tidal-washed detonations of relief wonât save me,
cause in case of doubt, this landmine marathon will guide me to my early grave.

And in spite of everything, someday,
Iâll tie this rope to the highest tree and take my life.
And as soon as my last cigarette has burned to its end,
without turning once I will have left this world behind...

Only death is real!
