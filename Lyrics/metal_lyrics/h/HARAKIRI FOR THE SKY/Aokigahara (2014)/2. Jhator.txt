Sundown! A blood-red sunset and the curtain of night devours the light,
somehow this gloaming looks like a painting of two worlds that collide.
As if you marked it in your dying wish, this farewell couldnât be a more impressive sight.
So these are our last common hours, cause tomorrow youâll be laid to rest, at first light.

The days get shorter, even if I try to shout off my head,
weird that every day has its own name but the night holds only one.
But also nascent darkness wonât lull me to sleep,
since Iâve seen these leeches separating the flesh from your bones,

But I donât care if I should crash these walls like waves,
I donât care if I should all too soon face the end of my days.
I donât care wherever this numbness should lead me.
And I donât care, that I couldnât care less!

Das letzte Herbstlaub fÃ¤llt, wie GedÃ¤rme auf Beton. 
Die Luft wird kalt und kÃ¤lter, der Kopf erstarrt im Frost. 
BetÃ¤ubt und regungslos, blau und ausgeweidet.
Verhallt das letzte Wort - im leeren Raum

Would you die for me, if I say please? Iâd take this numbness with me to the bitter end!
So if you see me stumble, please let me drown! Please take me out! Iâm already dead!
You know, I walked the path of sorrow once before, so I will depart and nevermore return,
Thereâs only one decision in our lives we can choose on our own: Vultures or worms?
