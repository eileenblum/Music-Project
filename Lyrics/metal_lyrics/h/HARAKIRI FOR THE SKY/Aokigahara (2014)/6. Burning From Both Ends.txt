I came up to our house, with barren feet and empty handed,
you werenât here in a long time, but your ghost still haunts these walls.
Over all these years, we slowly lost each others sight,
we tried everything just not to forget, but this life has no clean brakesâ¦

So now that youâre gone Iâve got no more reason to croak in this place,
Alas this formerly lively area now turned out just bleak and lonesome.
So why should I stay, why should I scrape a living by disgrace,
When almost every other spot in this world seems to have more meaning than this one?

I keep on starring at these blank walls, where our pictures hung, 
as they indicate: My former home became a grave!
âI am happyâ, is something we havenât said for a while,
we didnât succed to win this fight together, but at least we tried!

At least I tried!

All these sore memories, hidden in a heartshaped-box, 
which I buried so deep, within the power of man.
But the day will dawn, when Iâm going to rake over their ashes,
and scatter them into the river , that once flooded this place.

Run as fast as your legs will carry you away from me,
I just brought you misfortune and the sands of time are running out.
But with every minute thatâs elapsing, the spleen is decreasing,
and when a few years have past, you wonât be able to recall my faceâ¦
