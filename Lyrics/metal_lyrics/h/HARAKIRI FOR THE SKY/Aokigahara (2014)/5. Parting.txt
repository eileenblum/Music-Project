Yet another tone and these walls come tumbling down on our heads,
so that we are finally buried alive, in this dungeon of lies.
After all these years, I discerned, I donât belong here anymore.
Itâs an ardent desire, all we love we have to leave behind!

Itâs about time to take leave, please let me tear apart.
Even this lethargy canât restrain me, it may be too late.
Iâm hungry, Iâm thirsty, Iâm tired and cold.
In this awful state I wonât weather out another winter.

We breathed fire and brimstone, but at the edge of the night,
everything that was left to say was spewed and scattered over the floor.
As well being with or without you guzzles me from the inside,
but have you ever seen happy people with interesting stories to tell?


But if I wouldnât suffer, I wouldnât feel alive, dead but still breathing.
An avenue of escape, but blurred in this hazy notions.

The pain is gone, but I still wear the wounds,
They still flare up in heavy snow and glowing embers.
But these monuments of yesteryears, will soon turn into scars.
Thanks for leaving, so I can finally breath againâ¦
