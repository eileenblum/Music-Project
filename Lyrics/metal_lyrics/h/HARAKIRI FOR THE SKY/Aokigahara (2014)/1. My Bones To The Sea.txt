This life is a river running through cold veins,
no calm gasp at all, weâre always panting for air.
The irrepealable  decision to live and to die young, 
we said:â Destroy! All we love we leave behindâ¦â

Our awful derated state feels like a deathless march of distress.
Scraping through this tales was a hazard, so letâs taste the void.
I saw it all, from heartbreaking delight to crippling pain.
Thatâs why we left it all behind, you, me and the violence.

At least you wonât dry this river and homeâs just a place for the heartless,
no dear friends at all, just strangers with faded but versant faces.
The futureâs so scary, but you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar!
Yes, itâs temptingâ¦ â¦but itâs a mistake!

Where have you been???

These long roads apart seem like a promising shelter,
 a home away from âhomeâ, with a beautiful fierce and a fabulous strut.
Sequel we go on declaring war on nostalgia, hours of remembrance,
we burn all the nice pictures and do the ashes like coke!

All the footsteps weâve ever left, and the oneâs that will follow,
are set for just one reason, someday youâll understand.
We take step by step just not to stall, but when itâs over,
steal me away and deliver my bones to the sea!
