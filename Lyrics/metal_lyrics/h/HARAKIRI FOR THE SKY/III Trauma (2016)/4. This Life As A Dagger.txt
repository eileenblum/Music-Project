It took me almost a year to come
I thought I'd appear here prior
Therefor shorter was the time
Until I found the place you sleep

Our past caught up with me again
This horizon of mountains, as always threatening
Rose up behind me, anything but well-disposed
Like an all shattering orb
Well, that escalated quickly, unsurprisingly
Cause as we know now, we were raised by wolves
So take care if you fuck with the fast
The past at least won't fuck you...

Never... ...ever... this melancholy will pass....
I set a foot in our city and I feel so relegated
The days we lived here as kids, don't seem too far gone
As we hid in these fields together and bolt into the rye

I destroyed their childhood memories
In getting one thing straight
And in doing so, I tried to set their world on fire
Now I came for your graveyard
For the very first time these days
Finally set out for a fleeting visit...
...in the dead of a night...

I carried this picture for the last two hundredth and eighty days
Just to put it near your last smile, so near, but far beyond
Then I did all my tweak and sniffed it off your tombstone
Oh believe me brother, I gulped it all in one...

I'll never write peace on your wings
And let you simmer wordlessly
You promised me, that if we leave this place
We set free as one
But you spoke the words of a coward!
Fuck! What have you done?!
Now I will smell their scorched earth
Until I retire my own worn body...
...or I will finally choke on this city's mephitic air...

Never... ...ever...
This melancholy will pass...
I set a foot in our city and I feel so relegated
The days we lived here as kids
Don't seem too far gone
As we hid in these fields together
And bolt into the rye...
