Since the day they called me and I heard you passed away
I had no peaceful night, no minute of rest
I canât hear myself think, no love left for another
This first night of winter was unison my own deathâ¦

Come closer dearest void and choke me from the inside
Strangle me slowly or break my neck whilst the fall
It makes no difference to me, I donât care at all
Neglect the fall as long as we keep on falling apart!

You were not my closest friend, but the longest-serving
You were my fellowâ¦ â¦or at least you tried.
But you died last winter, strung up in the stable 
They found you in the morning, dead as our dreamsâ¦
Tonight Iâll get so terribly drunk Iâll lapse into coma
For fuckâs sake! Iâll drink myself into oblivion
Cause the only way to forget about you,
is to deafen all senses, until deadness eventuates

Chance had thrown us together and only death can part
If my attempt should not fail, a bullet will all too soon conclude

Fuck this life!

I re-open my scars and fill the hole in my heart with smack and wine
And I will lay down my bones at this stone-cold rivers muddy banks
One breath left until the void engulfs me
One breath left and all belongs to the past

You were not my closest friend, but the longest-serving
You were my fellowâ¦ â¦or at least you tried.
But you died last winter, strung up in the stable 
They found you in the morning, dead as our dreamsâ¦
Tonight Iâll get so terribly drunk Iâll lapse into coma
For fuckâs sake! Iâll drink myself into oblivion
Cause the only way to forget about you,
is to deafen all senses, until deadness eventuates

Fuck this life!
Fuckâ¦ â¦my life!

This was the year of the great depression
this was the year I buried myself in the dust of days!
