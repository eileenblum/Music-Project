Capture the horizon, dry tears with stale wine,
try to turn thoughts into letters, scream as loud as you can!
This empty streets seem like a grace of wounded hearts to me,
just a few hours more to come and they'll enter their long expected target.

An unending story of renunciation, my sacrifice,

so let's stop pretending, you know it was the best decision to part our ways.
Farewells can get quite nasty, that's why I disappeared silently,
to say good bye is still the best information we can ever share.

An endless dawn slowly fades the end of the night,
as former enstrangement again defeats me from behind.
There's no denying, that without you I'm nothing,
but also with you I am still alone...

The distance between us feels as far as an ocean,
when I attempt to traverse it, the raging waves wash me back ashore.
I tried so hard to reach the other side, but I lost consciousness,
