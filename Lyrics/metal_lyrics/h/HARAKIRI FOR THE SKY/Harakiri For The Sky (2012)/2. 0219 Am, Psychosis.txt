This city is a no man's land and I'm in the middle,
still stuck somewhere between last night and disturbing dreams.
Lost in locked up rooms, these walls feel like a casket,
from one moment to the other the dreams become my life.

Silent tappings keep creeping up from downstairs,
we're forever lost in Dystopia, but who cares?
All these charging words I could never say to you,
are gone with the years now, but somehow I miss you.

Break down the walls, they'll cath you in the rye,
one step further, the void comes closer to the edge.
Burn the bridges down, all the streets led us the wrong way,
following down the road to perdition, what a lonely place.

With shattered beleifs and hearts in hands,
we're searching for reasons, ways beyond these ruins.
With arms recently raised and gathering wounds,
now we demand our tribute for all these broken dreams.

The silence of winter is a deafening noise to my ears,
these nights drag unendingly and shadows grow longer.
I cant' understand this agony, what is it for?
When will I at last find my autumn asylum?
