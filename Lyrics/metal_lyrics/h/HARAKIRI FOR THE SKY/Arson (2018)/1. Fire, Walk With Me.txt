How can we forgive ourselves?
For what we have become?
How should we bear this burden?
Displace the things we've done?

I loved you so fucking much
It nearly lasted a lifetime
Fuck! I scratched my heart out
Just to watch it bleed...

I wish I was kerosene, just to set myself on fire
I wish I was kerosene, I'd burn all we've edified
I wish I was kerosene, plain to set your world on fire
I wish I was kerosene... just to feed the flames

And a bottle of whiskey later I can still recall the shape of your face
While I forgot my way home, while I forgot my own fucking name...

Who even calls this place home?
In the best case it's a grave with a view
I was never really here
But the streets still seem to know my name

Stay! Never mind the emptiness!
Leave! Fire walks with me!
You kept a lot of secrets and I kept none
I wish I could go back and keep some...

I usually keep my sadness
Pent up deep inside
Where it can fester quietly
To become mental illness

You were so fucking afraid
You might be living a lie
Oh poor you...
I may have lived like twenty!

I wish I was kerosene, just to set myself on fire
I wish I was kerosene, I'd burn all we've edified
I wish I was kerosene, plain to set youself on fire
I wish I was kerosene... at least to feed the flames

This will never be about life
Always about love and death
These are the only things that make me write
The things that let me bleed, that let me starve

The soil below me whispers my name and suggests:
You are done here... come home now?
Face the triangle of growth, decline and decay
Cause the harder you struggle, the tighter the noose!
...the tighter the noose!
