Scream of love
The seed of evil
First you felt safe
But still you're alone

Forgotten feelings
Erased from existence
And now this world is your home
Fly with me to the end of the world

To the place where Jesus was born
He won't see he is already dead
Let's make love in the desert of sad
When the day is done

We look on the setting sun
And see all of heaven's stars
And know all the world is ours
We stand as one

As night draws near
When intentions become clear
And know that in our hearts do lie
The truth about us, you and I

So stay my love right by my side
Linger while the moon is high
And at rising of the dawn
We share one kiss and I'm gone ...

I give you one kiss
And thousands of stars fall down
Just one gentle kiss
And all the world turns around

First ray of sun
First bird in the tree makes its sound
My time has come
I leave you till dusk

Till shadow of night brings me back to my love
I'll be back
From the dead
I will take you away

We stand as one
As night draws near
When intentions become clear
And know that in our hearts don't lie

The truth about us, you and I
And know that in our hearts don't lie
The truth about us, you and I
And know that in our hearts don't hide

The truth about us and we will fly
