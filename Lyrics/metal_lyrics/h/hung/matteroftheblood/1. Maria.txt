Into time
She sinks with the sins
Of all that is mine
She is thine

But all that is pure
Has already died
And you will keep
What is denied

And never ask why
She will rise
Reborn with the dead
Removed by your Christ

I saw her come in at midnight
With bright camouflage of a lady
The blood mistress
She knows no God

She is mine
But love is dead
And so am I and so am I
She lures you to darkness

Removes you from the light
The mistress, the whore
Of all your delights
Luring all saints

And seducing the weak
Kissing the angels then fucking the priests
Mother of all
You shouldn't believe

The host of your prayers
The end of your dreams
She stole the hearts
Of the unborn

Mary the darkness we adore
She stole your faith
Along all your souls
And she will never and ever let go

She sinks into dreams
And into your lies
She's slowly becoming
The dark of your life

She'll be
The forever forgotten in mind
But you will be watched ... her angels are spies
And you will seek

But never find
Burying deep into her lies
Like everyone fooled by her plastic smile
Like everyone else will ask her to die
