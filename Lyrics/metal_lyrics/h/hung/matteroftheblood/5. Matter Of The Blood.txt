Have I ever hoped for more??
Could you ever stay with me??
Can we ever break this core??
Contemplation pays its fee

Smell your skin just one more time
Walk through dark and rainy streets
Hear your heart beat through the night
Have a sip of wine and leave

Closer
Close your eyes
Don't fear
It's the matter of blood

It's the matter of blood
Darkness is a shadowed curse
The base of all your fears
Though I would not change what I am

I've lived this way for years
Every night another life
Arrested in my arms
Can't you hear it, can't you see it

Are you drowning in my charms??
I bend your will to make you mine
You share your life with me
It is the blood flowing through my soul

That makes me truly me
For centuries long I have been feared
The dark and deadly beast
Every night another search

For my deadly sinner's feast
As for the power of which I speak
I never truly can retire
You've heard my tale, I've told the truth

No love in my empire
Why ... can't ... we stay ... forever??
Fallen
Risen

Blinded by sun and
Broken
Mirrors
Fading scent of the divine

If there ever were saints
By now they must be all dead ... fuck them
Goodness hurts itself forevermore
Remorse is not for me, I've lost my senses

I flew so high to see this planet rot
I chew your fucking souls
You had your chances
I'm waiting for someone to call me

I'm waiting for someone to come along
The shadow sounds still collide around me
It is so hard to find a pure soul
Now I am forsaken ...

I'm walking down a road called "hopeless"
I'm walking down the road ...
Called "hopeless"
Goodness hurts itself forevermore

Remorse is not for me, I've lost my senses
I flew so high to see this planet rot
I chew your fucking souls
You had your chances

I'm waiting for someone to call me
I'm waiting for someone to come along
It is so hard
To find a pure soul
