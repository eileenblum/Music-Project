Hell will chill
Awaiting my return
I scourge the Earth
To make those fires burn

Raise your flags
And join the last parade
Blindfolded corpses
Troops of the crusade

We bring you horror
We call it fate
We share your sorrows
But make you pay

Our unit so strong and
We hear week souls moaning
Repent for forgiveness
Won't help to survive

Let go and die
Naked and drunk
The priest hugs a child
Promised a bright future of the saint

Who had fed on the blood of Christ
I awoke the evil tsar
On the night of Easter
Horses pull away my car

Trying to resist him
Skies have darkened
Lights have dimmed
Four horses riding

Sun shall never shine again
Silence, respect
The Devil is making his rounds
Bow to me

I heard a voice
So pure and distinct
No forgiveness
In my lands

I am healed
Of all your bloody curses
I give in
But all my secret

Love and hatred
Finds it's peace
On the way ...
Today love and hatred

Finds it's peace
On the way to die
Kneel and pray for
Repent - burns my skin off

When heart's rotten I believe in
Repent
And when I poison your freedom
Repent

Child with a soul
Of a fallen angel
Who burned it's wings
On the way to the fires of hell

Time will come, I believe it
The church bursts in flames
They call me the Antichrist
Evil Tsar
