Impregnated with blood of children
Fire's gone with the morning due
Relic of despair won't darn deepest wounds
Reluctantly plow our way through

New generation is now reminiscence
Carrying on the troubles of the past
Look at me I'm crying
Look at me I'm dying

Sailing away, leaving this land
Cherishing thoughts that will never leave my head
Sediment of war is like a beast to me
Whose flesh I will eat and then sleep on it's skin

The smell of decay reveals our Gods
They are who have made the world, now they laugh
The smell of decay is still dejecting our Gods
Omnipotent Gods don't give a damn about us

For once
We could try to avoid all the ominous feelings
And swallow fear
For those who are still alive

Those who don't want to fight
How much more hate can there be??
We are dead but fight for better life
Kill a baby for me

Hunger's blinding mind for better life
Bring this soldier
Up the minaret after tortures
When the sun is red

Old tales of fallen angels
I see them when I close my eyes
Whose candle is still burning??
Attracting the sight of demonized

The ones who seek salvation
Will have to drain the river of Styx
Major risus, acrior ensis
Smiles of front liners feeding me

Worthless lives, obey tyranny
Kill forever and ever more
Sinister will enjoy the show
No one can deny this

We can tear the world apart
Tears of all the holy
Will pour down from the skies on us
Rejection of the system

The blood they pump out through our veins
Shall pay a lovely ransom
For those who had no chance to say
Fat and ugly

Our generals collecting our lives, the day is over
The ripper goes to bed till the next sunrise
