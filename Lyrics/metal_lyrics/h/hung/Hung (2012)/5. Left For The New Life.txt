I still wait in pain
No one can stop the rain
I see you going away
Now my temple is calling

Holy crosses are falling
I could only say "wait"
Please dismantle the sun
Oh please sweep up the wood

Cause nothing now can ever come to any good
I've been praying, I'm still praying
Careless left with
Useless plunder

Vim of sadness
Ousts of darkness
Knew that something
Vile and rotten

Will dump the tender
Burn the plumage
Wake me
Shake me

Take me to it
Nothing is never ever enough
Till heart beat stops to oscillate
Dance me

Spin me
Kiss me to death
Taking the wind out of my sails
I see you going away again

Dream of you
You're not with me
Lie for you
You're not with me

Kill for you
You're not with me
Die for you
You're not with me

Dream and die for me
Dream
Dream of me
Lie for me

Kill for me
Die for me
I won't deny
I will destroy you

All awful lies
Are coming out truth
Come to my arms
Glance at the full moon

Lost souls walk by
Transparent fools
And ...
They can't wait till I rise

They still hope for demise
When nothing's left except fear
It's time for me to forgive them
Rivers of blood for my life

Blood, spirit, flesh are for Christians
Let 'em run no one will survive
Now pay some attention to sleepers
Away from Rome

I paid for your hearts
For your dreams
For what's meant to be souls
Now we are through

To the gates of hell follow me
Follow me
Follow me
Follow me

Children of night
Went to wiping blood
Soon they'll clean Earth
With a streaming flood

Crosses of churches
Are gone in vain
Useless religion
They're all the same

Go
Sign in the bottom here
And sing your last lullaby
For nothing is left for you here

I'm selling you brand new life
Pleasure replaces sorrow
Forgiveness replaces sin
No need to think of tomorrow

You're gonna write the script
Sign in the bottom here
And sing your last lullaby
For nothing is left for you here

I'm selling you brand new life
Stay still
Lay down
Scream, scream

Up
Creatures of careless nature
Down
Preachers of nothing but madness

When everyone's gone
After eve and Adam
And gates of hell shut forever
Listen to wind

Follow its lead
Climb on the tree of wisdom
Cannot define between death and life
Can stop all this with a click of a finger

Make vanish in vain the world I despise
In a new suit last present from joiner
Listen to wind
Follow its lead
