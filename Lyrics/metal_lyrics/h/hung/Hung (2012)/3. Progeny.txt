Now flowers of Eden
And apple of Sodom are mine
I'm talking to you
All God's creatures

Bloodstained sinners
Times of dissection
Of innocent bodies are gone
Red waters from mountains

Stopped feeding the dark valley rivers
They made children work
In the village of sun
In the village of wine

And when I was young
They brought me my fate
God laughed at his own son
When it was too late

They saw what they'd done
I was left behind
It was pitch dark
Nobody saw that I was missing

It's when
He took my hand
And led me down
So far below the coal chamber

Since then
I couldn't feel
My heart won't beat
I couldn't speak

My breath was taken
I became a prince
Adopted son
Destined to rule the darkest kingdom

I will give you the world
Tell me the truth and not the lie
I won't leave you alone
So I believed, I gave in

I will help you forget
Forget sins, remember sinners
The drum of heart won't give the reason
Flesh and blood deceive the spirit

Earth it
Seems so cold
I'm not at home
My mind has changed

Collecting souls with no remorse
There's no recourse
I seized my throne
I wasn't forced

It was my choice
It was his voice
My hatred's source
Brought me this noise

Like
Screams from hell
In my blood this spell
Cold blood

Stale flesh
I brought you to this world
I ought to take you back
Don't run

Don't fight
Feelings get weaker now
But urge to live is strong
Give in

Breathe in
Come to your father's hand
Forget the past and rest
Black skies

Blood rain
Fulfilling destiny
The darkness set me free
