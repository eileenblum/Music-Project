Give me hope
Give me life
Give me all your love and faith
Words she cried

And so dark and quiet
Feel the church tonight
Crucifix shall shed no tears
Widow's sorrow fills the sight

Hours go by
Saying words of prayer
Please leave my heart
My every dream

Stop knocking on my door
Just leave me be
She wept some more
Got off her knees

She threw the wedding ring
Into the priest
Your word
Your deeds

My crop
My seeds
Skies bled outside
Your last donation to God

Ultimate sacrifice
To the ones unforgiven
To the ones who rejoice
In experience

Under my wrath
To redeem my beloved
I shall trade my last breath
To return

A dead man's life
To reverse widow's blight
We'll repair a rotten botch in your heart
Ripping skin off our backs

Claws of infuriated beast
Bringing to life all your desires
Circle of rich madams and sires
Othe rooms with the big old locks

For the fellows with the least of luck
Headless bodies soaking up spices
Should be done in time for the feast

[Russian lyrics]

All are seated
Plates are steaming
Tables are served
And candles are lit

Echoing laughter of master
Infant's blood now has been spilled
New cause
To begin

Disaster
They'll cut you up with a million razors
Allow your body to fly past these blades
Inferiority

I pity not my pray
Demons cheer
Are you with us
To enjoy this lovely dinner

Step inside towards the fire
Raise a glass to my empire
Rain stopped as her lips touched the wine
Just froze in still motion

With one sip
We got a deal
Not to mention that I've got your soul
I am your Krishna

I am your Jesus
You have awakened me
So - I - have - come
With limbs chained

To please the satyr
Impurity fills the night
Caressing tongues of fire
Now you're taken

Not welcomed
Lost wisdom to fill the void
You are possessed by a coven
Your body's raped by a million craving dirty sinners

Your sweat and blood paid the price
Take your man now
Standing tall
Well, does he want you??

... after all
Get back
On your knees now
Go ahead and pray your prayer

Saved by a whore
In a bed of maggots
Now I'll chop off
Your fucking head
