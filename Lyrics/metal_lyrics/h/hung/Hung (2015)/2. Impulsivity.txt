Our Hearts Beat In Unison
Bring forth the impulse,
Beats of continuation.
Our souls will collide as one,
A symbol of eternity,
Will Colide As One

The light shines down,
And marks, the crown
Of passion, and fear
On the final, frontier
The light shines down
The light shines down.

Our Hearts Beat In Unison
Bring forth the impulse,
Beats of continuation.
Our souls will collide as one,
Our Hearts Beat In Unison
Bring forth the impulse,

On a one way journey.

Their
blood is
on your hands.
From the
moment
they
breathe, the
clock starts
ticking.

Impulsivity
The clock starts ticking
When we are born do we understand the concept of death,
First breath in, clock starts ticking.
Donât waste the moment,
Spend it wisely.
Impulsivity!

Impulsivity!

Tick, Tock.
Tick, Tock.
Tick, Tock.
Tick, Tock.
Tick, Tock.

Wasting time is pitiful game,
We gotta open our minds and play to win again.
We have a gift, be it given or not.
We have a gift.

Our Hearts Beat In Unison
Bring forth the impulse,
Beats of continuation.
Our hearts will collide as one,
Our Hearts Beat In Unison
A symbol of eternity,
On a one way journey.
