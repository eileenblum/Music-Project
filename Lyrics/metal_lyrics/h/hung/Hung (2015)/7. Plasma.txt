Inside, we all are the same
Aligned, we all live in vain
But occasionally you hear someone say
Something that changes your mind.
Perhaps it is truth, perhaps it is lies .
But for this judgement who am I?

Who am I?
Some of us are honest,
Some of us are not,
Yet we all contain plasma.
We all contain plasma,

We all have the ability,
To become the facade,
To create something thats not.
But inside we bleed the same.
Pick a fucking side.

I promise you Iâll tell the truth
Is ironically a lie.
Creating yourself.
Denying all else.

And when you look at me,
All I can see inside those eyes
Creating yourself.
Denying all else.

Canât believe this world is turning back on itself again.
The universe, our being,
Made of the same minerals.
Yet dishonesty still takes a hold.

Universe Our Being.
Mountains,
So high,
Evolution,
Still Climbs
Wearing
Our Masks,
To Cover,
Our Tracks

Creating yourself.
Denying all else.

Yeh, weâre creatingâ¦

Creating yourself.
Denying all else.

This is truth.
Universe Our Being.

I promise you Iâll tell the truth
Is ironically a lie.
Creating yourself.
Denying all else.

And when you look at me,
All I can see inside those eyes
Creating yourself.
Denying everything .
