Here it is.
Laid out infront of us.
The human race.
Has failed its home.
We praise no god.
We praise no god.

We praise no god.

In this existence
We had one goal.
We have failed our planet.

I canât believe we try and live with entropy,
Is there no remedy?
A higher entity?
For those that praise are filled with jealousy.
Bring us serenity.
Not this Zealotry.

I canât believe we try and live with entropy,
Is there no remedy?
A higher entity?
We are the gods we try to imagine.
Bring us serenity.
Not this Zealotry.

We will be undone.

Openâ¦ Upâ¦ Yourâ¦ Innerâ¦ Minds Eye.

We praise a being but have no proof,
Believe this dream weâre convincible.
Openâ¦
Up your Inner Minds Eye.

With a steady hand we wait
For the end of time as we know it.
For the end of time as we know it.
This is the end as we know it.

I donât find delight
In knowing that we will die.
Alone in this infinity.
Our polluted planet has had too much.
We will be undone.
Arise.
We will be undone.

We will be undone.

I canât believe we try and live with entropy,
Is there no remedy?
A higher entity?
For those that praise are filled with jealousy.
Bring us serenity.
Not this Zealotry.

I canât believe we try and live with entropy,
Is there no remedy?
A higher entity?
We are the gods we try to imagine.
Bring us serenity.
Not this Zealotry.
