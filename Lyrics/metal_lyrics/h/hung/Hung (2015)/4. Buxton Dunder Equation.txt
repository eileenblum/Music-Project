Iâm so proud of who youâve become
If I was you, I would be done.
Hit after hit, breaking you down
You pick yourself up, Not a cry, not a sound

Not a sound.
Never forgetting,
The way youâve been treated.
Always playing the right card
But being given the wrong hand.

I just canât stay focused on how
You hold your head up high
All the broken promises,
I can openly admit youâre braver than me.

Just like the wind,
You flow,
Youâre a better person than I.

Iâm so proud of who youâve become
If I was you, I would be done.
Hit after hit, breaking you down
You pick yourself up, Not a cry, not a sound

Not a sound.

Iâm bruised,
I heal.
But inside
Still feel.
If I went through,
What youâve been through,
I donât if Iâd be here.

But you wonât do it,
It isnât you, a kind open heart.
Try being selfish, Make a change
And itâll be them that get hurt.

See the best in me,
I donât need to look hard to find it in you.
Hoping is your key.
People always let you down.

People always let you down.

Intoxicating, always caring
You put everyone first.
Try being selfish, Make a change
And itâll be them that get hurt.
But you wonât do it,
It isnât you, a kind open heart.
Try being selfish, Make a change
And itâll be them that get hurt.

Them that get hurt.
