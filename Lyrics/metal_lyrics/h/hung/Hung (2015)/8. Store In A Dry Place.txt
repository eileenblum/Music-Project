I will envision the brighter way,
Circle the sunrise of better days.
A blood red moon, an unpleasant taste.
Do not consume, store in a dry place.

Everything I know relies on..
Stopping the wheel.
As it crashes down,
Destroying,
Everything on the ground.

Turning heads,
In the cycle of eternity,
A festering piece,
The burning trees which we,
Use for
Selfishness,
Counter,
intelligence,
In residence

Sometimes I wake up and feel like I am still asleep.
Break the barrier, separate reality.
Destroy the wheel, obliterate its unholy path,
Destroy the wheel,

I will never rest
Arise from
Reticence.
Arise, From the
Silence of denial

Stopping the wheel.
As it crashes down,
Destroying,
Everything on the ground.

Reticence.
Reticence.

Washing away the pain,
Of indifferent self-denial,
The sick and twisted game,
The highway of the vile
consumption.

Sometimes I wake up and feel like I am still asleep.
Break the barrier, separate reality.
Destroy the wheel, obliterate its unholy path,
Destroy the wheel
I will envision the brighter way,

A blood red moon
Do not consume
