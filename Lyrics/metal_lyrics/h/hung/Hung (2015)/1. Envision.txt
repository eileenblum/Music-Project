Every single hour passes in a moment.
We exist as one, We exist as one.

In societies eyes, we fail to contribute
To endless possibilities, a world without consistency.
See what I envision!

See what I envision!
I will envision the brighter way
Circle the sunrise of better days

Ooh yeh we donât need to change it no,
Weâre already stuck inside it.
The system of mankind.

Envision.

Break.
Because weâreâ¦
Breaking through the barriers of humanity,
Governments say do it, but we can stand in unity.
Every word spoken a lie to bring in money.
Envision

Envision
Ooh We donât need to change it
Envision
Weâre already stuck inside it,
System of mankind

I will envision the brighter way
Circle the sunrise of better days
A blood red moon, An unpleasant taste
Circle the sunrise of better ways

Envision.
The universe is something complicated
We are but a grain of sand
Being filled with regret.
When it comes to the end
When it comes to the end

Envision
Envision
Self evaluation, within the continuum.
Impossibilities or probabilities?

I will envision the brighter way
Circle the sunrise of better days
A blood red moon, An unpleasant taste
Circle the sunrise, Change your ways.

I will envision the brighter way
Circle the sunrise of better days
A blood red moon, An unpleasant taste
Circle the sunrise of better ways

Circle The Sunrise
