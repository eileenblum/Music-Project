After so long on the earth their time is nigh.
They canât believe
After so long on the earth their time is nigh.
They must believe in what is real,
They must believe, oh.

This is the earth at night.

Create unholy life.
Within this construction we abide.
Revere the earth at night.
Under pressure to commit to the falling back to death.

We canât break out,
Of the inevitable.

In this omnipitence, youâd think the world, (youâd think the world)
Would have a master plan.
Amongst the dissonance,
Youâd think the world, (youâd think the world)
Would have a master plan.

Believeâ¦ In Theâ¦ Inevitable.
(the inevitable
constructions
the inevitable)

This is where I
Open up your closed eyes,
We all are, doomed to die,

Conditioned
Re-envisioned.
Asynchronous.

This is the earth at night.

I wonât, I canât believe
I wonât, I canât believe
Synchronous

We canât break out,
Of the inevitable.
Earth at night.
Open up, Open up your,
Eyes and see.
This worlds not what it used to be!

Eyes and see.
The truth behind our lives.
Earth at night.

This omnipitence, youâd think the world, (youâd think the world)
Would have a master plan.
Amongst the dissonance
Youâd think the world, (youâd think the world)
Would have a master plan

Open up your closed eyes,
We all are, doomed to die,
Within this universe, Within our bodies,
We all have one fate.
We all are gonna be doomed to die.

I will envision
Circle The Sunrise
A blood red moon

I will envision the brighter way,
Circle the sunrise of better days,
A blood red moon, an unpleasant taste,
Circle the sunrise of the end of our days.
