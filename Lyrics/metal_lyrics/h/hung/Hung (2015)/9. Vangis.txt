You wonât give up,
Your freedom, Believing
In everything you know.

Living life on a high,
Like ultraviolet light,
Your translucency,
You wonât give up your freedom

You wonât give up your freedom

Donât turn your back on me,
âInsightfulâ
Define the line and be,
âInsightfulâ
Use your Divination,
âInsightfulâ
Define the line and be,

You wonât give up,
Your freedom, Believing
In everything you know.
You wonât give up,
Your freedom, Believing

Your Freedom.
Open your Eyes.
Arise and listen closely
Open your Eyes.
Divinity is right between the lines.

You wonât give up,
Your freedom, Believing
In everything you know.
You wonât give up,
Your freedom, Believing
In everything you know
