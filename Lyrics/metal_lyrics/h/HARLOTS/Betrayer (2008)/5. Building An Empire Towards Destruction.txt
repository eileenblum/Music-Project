Rebuilding structures in our minds that hold strong the test of time.
Consuming voids that are long eroded of all forms of life.
Send a messenger to them with a note that says as of right now we are taking back our pre-machine ways of living life.
A declaration of change.
All the future and the present can be reprogrammed in time.
For all of creation these words carry on and shine new light upon this.
Broken into future predictions of assembly line life.
I must fucking shut it down.
We must shut it down.
