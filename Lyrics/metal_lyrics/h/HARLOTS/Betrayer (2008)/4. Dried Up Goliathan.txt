I know it's true.
There is no hope.
I can still see that there is a light up ahead of me.
Give it up.
Learn to let it go.
Heaven is out of reach, hell is in sight.
Give it up.
Learn to let it go.
Heaven is out of reach, hell is in sight.
Give it up.
Learn to let it go.
Learn to let go of the pain that you hold onto.
I know it's true.
There is no hope.
But I can still see that there's a light up ahead of me.
