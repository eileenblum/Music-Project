The deepest kind of cut is applied when someone else sees me as my own darkest impressions.
I'll gouge out their eyes out and break every bone.
I've met the enemy in me.
I pushed it down inside of me, cleansed the plagues from my hands but you would not let it go.
Your blood raw throat stopped you before I could satisfy my rage.
Silence is a true friend that does not betray.
Madness Grows In The Darkness.
I want your teeth in my molar collection.
I've thrown swords before, but now I know you're the one I should am for.
Fire rages in the heart.
