I have been to the layer of the great betrayer.
He said a sinner is a saint as long as he's a liar.
Searching for a pillar of hope.
Rejection.
I kept my head above the water.
I did not drown amongst the sharks.
Forced to close a door within myself.
My best friend lost the key I have fallen victim fed by betrayal.
"I'm always the fucking victim"
"You're always the fucking victim"
Drown, drown myself in apathy.
You are fucking wrong with what you once did right.
Adopt the idea of a better life.
You gave up.
You can't stop your self from sinking to the bottom of the ocean.
You are the aborted fact of a lesser life.
These words can kill like a curse.
Now your reaction has taken over me.
In time my soul will back away from you.
Another body slipping away towards eternity.
