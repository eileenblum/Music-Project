[Music: Wright / Dunn / Lohrber, lyrics: Lohrber]

These are the paths that we choose choose or be chosen these are the paths that we create where we have thrown down our swords to throw up our lives spit them in the face of our enemies the bloodlines show a reoccurring state of mind that only machines can break through where will you find the strength to live on when you know where all roads end the path that can be regarded as a path is not the great eternal path the path that can be regarded as the path is not an ordinary path the road that is seen as a road under our feet is different these are the paths that we created love does not conquer all some wish love would have not laid them in waste where understanding can give you the fuel to be beaten again these are the paths that we created those who do not have swords can still die upon their blades these are the paths that we created the name that can be named is not the enduring unchanging name these are the paths that we created we are in a constant state of war we're all just fighting for a different reason some turn to violence and corner themselves where only bonds of fire will break your war is a lost cause this war is a lost cause because we are in a constant state of chaos your words act as swords to consume all a lord of lords that thrives on hate these are the paths that we create...

A rain will fall upon us and cleanse the filth acidic bursts to lift the pavement above the ground the rain falls as compounds that we create we have sewn our demise we have ripped out our eyes the strength in mind will wash off in the sea of filth leaving a few to remain I will banish myself from the kingdom of heaven for I do not deserve the privilege I am guilty of the evilest of sins apathy I have hidden my sorrow from the world in the form of an ego I do not deserve to eat with kings of men for I am greater I do not wish this power this is evolution a revolution the pain of living the burden of being alone this is what it's like to be alive.
