[a). In One Day Her Plagues Will Overtake Her]

[Music: Wright / Lohrber, lyrics: Lohrber]

The roads have a natural curl a desert of concrete walk through walls with a burden in the arm I choose to keep death is but a fiction lived above everyday life the want for power will consume there is no hope no siren to give us a warning it's like a gunshot to the stomach no time to react forgiveness is a fiction that will remain nonexistent silence is the response we will receive with open arms shut your ears we are the crush of a fist to the face of humanity driven fathom of a fear that left you weak we keep our eyes shut not taking notice of what is beyond these walls they act as gates to a world that we have never known if walls would stay shut and doors had no keys we would act like cars with no gasoline inside these walls we strike a match ignition as a key sparking engines to move us around driving head on into a wall on this collision course it brings new meaning to us all we all put life aside awake and never wake up autumn will show us the beauty of dying winter will show us the meaning of life...

[c). She Will Be Consumed By Fire]

[Music: Wright / Lohrber, lyrics: Lohrber]

Death, interruptions in our time and space this is the beginning of the end the hope for change remains to wither and rot away we've turned this place into a vacuum life sucks out life in waves of tomorrow we fall into shadow no war is to be won no choice will make you free life is born to be lost each day is cursed with every inhale and every exhale the mind cannot stay in limbo there is always a backdoor perfection is imperfection through chaos I am as a child afraid to face the world alone I will endure true love would never fail where I find desolation I will piss blood of truth there is no more passion through despair i seek solitude through solitude i find the truth there is always a truth that we cannot find and this never ends the seasons will balance themselves out in the end.

[d). Widower]
