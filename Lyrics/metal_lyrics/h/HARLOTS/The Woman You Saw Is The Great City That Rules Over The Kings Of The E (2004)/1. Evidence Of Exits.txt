[a). Mystery]

[Music: Dunn / Lohrber]

[b). Babylon the Great]

[Music: Dunn / Lohrber, lyrics: Lohrber / Netherly]

I am nailing down all I need for keeping the coffin tight buried you deep in the sludge of my lungs couldn't breathe without the pain in my side I feel the time is finally right to pour warm blood on the night drown in it this is the cold sun that will not fight all the old brightness is bathed in red light drink shamelessly when all hope will fail and all you have is yourself will you abandon all hope take the road less traveled where you see no end, take the road less traveled where instinct is your only friend would you stand alone in a fight without arms making love to a serenade sung from the broken jaws of the angels deafened choking beauty you lay serene you taste just like poison I can't kiss you when your teeth are falling down my throat I love you sucking blood from my broken waste bond you lay serene just like as in autumn rotting I'm caught between the chapters of life I cannot find the words to speak I will gut you with the ink of right and wrong your power consumes you this is where I walk away this is where I fall trapped by a sickness with no cure a hole with no end no escape in this fiction there is no true love every action ends in consequence death we all die alone I will shut connections between us this is my last attempt to fall asleep forever I renounce myself from dreams showing my second face at youth I feel as frail as an old man we are pagans with no ambition heavy hearts will wear us down.
