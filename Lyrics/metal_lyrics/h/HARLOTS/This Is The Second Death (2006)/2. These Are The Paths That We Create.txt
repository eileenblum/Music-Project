[Music: Lohrber / Dunn, lyrics: Lohrber]

Acidic bursts to lift the pavement above the ground
A rain falls as compounds that we create
We have sewn our demise we have ripped out our eyes the strength in mind will wash off in a sea of filth
Leaving a few to remain I will banish myself from the kingdom of heaven for
I do not deserve the privilege
I am guilty of the evilest of sins apathy
I have hidden my sorrow from the world in the form of an ego
I do not deserve to eat with the kings of men for I am greater
I do not wish this power
I will banish myself from the kingdom of heaven for I do not deserve the privilege
I am guilty of the evilest of sins apathy
This is evolution a revolution the pain of living the burden of being alone
This is what it's like
This is what it's like to be alive
Consider the ultimate wisdom of renunciation giving up what you do not need for survival we are a plague
