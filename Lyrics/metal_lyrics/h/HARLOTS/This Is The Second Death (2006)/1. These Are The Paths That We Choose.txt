[Music: Lohrber / Wright / Dunn, lyrics: Lohrber]

The truths you speak of are weaving webs of deceit
Your words act as poison
These are the paths that we choose, choose or be chosen
These are the paths that we create where we have thrown down our swords to throw up our lives
Spit them in the face of our enemies the bloodlines show a reoccurring state of mind that only machines can break through
Where will you find the strength to live on when you know where all roads end the path
That can be regarded as the path is not the great eternal path
The path that can be regarded as the path is no an ordinary path
The road that can be called the road under our feet is different
These are the paths that we've created
Love does not conquer all some wish love would have not laid them in waste
Where understanding can give you the fuel to be beaten again
These are the paths that we've created
Those who do not have swords can still die upon their blades
These are the paths that we've created
The name that can be named is not the enduring unchanging name
These are the paths that we've created
This war is a lost cause your war is a lost cause
Because we are in a state of chaos
We are in a constant state of chaos
Your words act as swords to consume all a lord of lords that thrives on hate
These are the paths that we a rain will fall upon us and cleanse the filth
