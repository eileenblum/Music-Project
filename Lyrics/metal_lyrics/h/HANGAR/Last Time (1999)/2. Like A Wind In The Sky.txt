Oh god 
Give me the power
To fight with doubt
That rounds my mind
Tell me what should I do
To understand
The suffering of the spirit
In this imperfect body
Show me the way
I must follow
To reach the sky
And save my soul
When I close my eyes
When the silence prevail
I may see the light
And send my sorrow away
My soul can fly
Like a wind in the sky
