The time is passing by
Your breathing slowly
Open your eyes and feel your heart
Flying the sky tonight
Follow your spirit
Open your mind and feel your soul
Waiting the messenger of heaven
Look at the sky and see the angel
Waiting the messenger of heaven
Look at the sky and see the angel
Angel of the stereo
Angel of the stereo
Open your mind - flying so high
Open your heart - feel the sky
Open your eyes - see the light
Take the hand of the angel and go
