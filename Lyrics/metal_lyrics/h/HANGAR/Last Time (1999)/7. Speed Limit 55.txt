Rounding the world
In the speed of imagination
I see roads passing by
And I feel a great sensation
Be careful
Pay attention
Look the advice
Speed limit 55
Feel the wind in your face
This is a great fascination
See it get faster
Like the rising acceleration
Be careful
Pay attention
Look the advice
Speed limit 55
