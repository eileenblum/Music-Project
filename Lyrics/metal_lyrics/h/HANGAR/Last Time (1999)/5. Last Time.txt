Stars fallen from the sky
Down in the hell before the die
Take your gun and come to fight
Reading the book and waiting the night
Faces come and go
I feel disgrace begin to cry
But the truth will never die
And never change alone in my mind
Darkness coming
You can't hide
Pray now
And wait the night
Look at the mirror
Look at the sky
It's sign of the
Last Time
