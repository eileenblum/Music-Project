[Wortmann, Priester, Polchowicz, Mello]

We are the evil in disguise
Maybe all we want is everything
You try to stay awake
We are living in your mind
We are commanding your life
You try to stay awake
In your cold dreams
You are alone
Then you lie, you cry, 
You taste 
Lost in this place, you don't have control
We can live inside your soul
Lost in this place, you don't have control
We can live inside your soul
Our dark blood runs in your veins
And your body burns in hell
You try to stay awake
In your cold dreams
You are alone
Then you lie, you cry
You taste
Lost in this place, you don't have control
We can live inside your soul
Lost in this place, you don't have control
We can live inside your soul
