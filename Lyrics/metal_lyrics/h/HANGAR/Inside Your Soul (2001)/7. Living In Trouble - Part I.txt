[Martinez, Priester, Polchowicz, Mello]

Inside your home
Nobody stands you
No work, no school
You'll be a homeless soon
Get a job
I don't need a boss 
Cut that hair
Fuck you, I don't care
You go up in smoke
Fucking the maid mad
Locked in the bedroom
Banging until death
Get a job
I don't need a boss
Cut that hair
Fuck you, I don't care
Living in trouble - That's my vocation
Living in trouble - It's no religion
Living in trouble - That's my vocation
Living in trouble - Fuck you, that's my life
