[Wortmann, Priester, Polchowicz, Mello]

It's the year two thousand and ninety 
Beyond the stars
There are so bad creatures living
Creatures from the dark
Then I had a vision, maybe
Devastation comes down
And Earth needs some hope
Aliens coming to fight
Legions of fate
Go to the battle
Forces arise, destroying
The aliens from the stars
They walk among us now
And you don't see
They stole our strength, you can't feel
We fell in disgrace
Something has to be done
Before it's too late
And Earth needs some hope
Aliens coming to fight
Legions of fate
Go to the battle
Forces arise, destroying
The aliens from the stars
Many years ago there was
A people that was guided
By a serpent strong and clever
Running its way of fire 
She dominated the knowledge
To fight creatures of the dark
Help us now
Life goes on...
Forces arise, destroying
The aliens from the stars
