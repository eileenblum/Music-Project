[Martinez, Priester, Polchowicz, Mello]

At night on the streets
Looking for some trouble 
No money, no way
Who am I? I don't know
Get a job
I don't need a boss
Cut that hair
Fuck you, I don't care
Living in trouble - That's my vocation
Living in trouble - It's no religion
Living in trouble - That's my vocation
Living in trouble - Fuck you, that's my life
