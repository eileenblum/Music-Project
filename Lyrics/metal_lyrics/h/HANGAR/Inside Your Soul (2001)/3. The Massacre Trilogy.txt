[Part I: Sailing The Sea of Sorrow]

[Martinez, Priester, Polchowicz, Mello]

Oh Lord, no sign to relief 
Of this agony inside
Such a pain is not fair
How long shall it last
Sailing the sea of sorrow
Beyond this point
There's no turning back
No time to repent
No time to regreat
Sailing the sea of sorrow
My soul is bleeding
A sea of sorrow
In the middle of nothing
Seeking tomorrow
Darkness surrounding
This bloody expedition
Sailing the sea of sorrow
How can I finish
An impossible mission?
A sea of sorrow
Embraces the fleet
The stars above us
And hell underneath
Sailing the sea of sorrow
Sailing the sea of sorrow
Navigating on the sea of sorrow
Under the moonlight
Fear is your only friend 
Vastness just your eyes can see

[Part II: To Tame a Land]

[Martinez, Priester, Polchowicz, Mello]

How long shall we fight
to tame a land? 
How much blood is needed
From the lives spent? 
Thunder and lightning
Flashes of metal
Forces uprising
In the heat of the battle
Violence and force
Weapons and power
Armored corps 
Fearless marching forward
Surrender or die
The crown must prevail
Surrender or die
The King shall be hailed

How long shall we fight
to tame a land? 
How much blood is needed
From the lives spent? 
Blood on the sand 
Screams in the air
We conquer the land
You watch it in despair
Life or death
People are dying
Walking to hell
Burning in the fire
Surrender or die
The crown must prevail
Surrender or die
The King shall be hailed

How long shall we fight
to tame a land? 
How much blood is needed
From the lives spent? 

[Part III: Five Hundred's Enough]

[Martinez, Priester, Polchowicz, Mello]

Sail, white man
Rape, European
Come, bastards
To steal us all
In the name of God
Rise the swords of Christ
And smash every little worm 
That cries for freedom
On your knees, Indians
The old world Barbarian 
Is here to reign
You must kiss the cross
Raise churches of gold
Give diamonds for mirrors
Be blessed the righteous
Who served those chosen ones
God wants you all
To save the Crown of Portugal
In the name of God
They've killed millions
And smashed every little worm
That cried for freedom
On your knees, Indians
The old world Barbarian
Is here to reign
You must kiss the cross
Raise churches of gold
Give diamonds for mirrors
Five hundred's enough
