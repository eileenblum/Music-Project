[Zukauska, Priester, Polchowicz, Mello]

I hear voices in my head
I will see the flame
You will see the flame
Savior is my name
Behind the power of my eyes
Is the escape
You never know who is coming
Create your face
While you think about the past
The world doesn't change
Your life is now in my hand
Give me your plan
Sometimes I think about solutions
But the problems of the world I can't change
I don't know what to do
To stop the visions 
That disturb my thoughts
I feel sick, I feel so tired 
Because I'm lost in my doubt
What do you think about me?
Because Savior is my name
Is my name...
Because Savior is my name
Is my name...
