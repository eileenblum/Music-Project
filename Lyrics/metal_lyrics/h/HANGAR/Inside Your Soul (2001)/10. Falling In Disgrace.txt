[Zukauska, Priester, Martinez, Polchowicz, Mello]

Your brain fries
When you hear my voice
My words are burning 
Burning inside your heart
You don't believe in me
Because I say the truth
In your eyes I see the hope
Fighting to escape
You are a blind man
You don't see the world
Look at your side
Tell me what you see
You see your soul crying
Your hands are tied
Your head feels the pain
Inside your conscience
Falling in disgrace
Your time's ending
What are you gonna do, 
Before it's too late?
It's too late to your sanity
I hear the conflict
Inside your mind
I can feel your spirit
Screaming now
Falling in disgrace
You're gonna lose your soul
Why don't you make your choice
Falling in disgrace
Falling in disgrace
Falling

[This song is dedicated to the drugs slaves. Say no to drugs]
