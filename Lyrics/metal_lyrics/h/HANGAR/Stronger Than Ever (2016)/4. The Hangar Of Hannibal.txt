Have you ever seen â blood in the moonlight?
When life is most like a dream â tonight is the night)
In another place â we had to protect each other
In these lives we create â thereâs no love, thereâs just pain

Sometimes we have no other choice â I would love to meet him again
He smashed the mirrors of the houses to keep himself alive
These shards are set because he wants to see through her eyes

I donât believe you would tell them even if you knew who I was
You are going to be caught â this is my design
No matter how long it takes to get inside your mind

The important thing is what I am becoming
I knew you alone would understand my plan!

Just like you he needs to escapeâ Iâve never known myself
We can all betray â we have no reason to stay
I like the night â itâs more than a piece of mind
I know everything about your sins â the smashing of mirror begins

Sometimes we have no other choice â I would love to meet him again
He smashed the mirrors of the houses to keep himself alive
These shards are set because he wants to see through her eyes

The important thing is what I am becoming
I knew you alone would understand my plan

The important thing is what I am becoming
I knew you alone would understand my plan!
