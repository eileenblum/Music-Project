Thereâs no one left in the world that can find me alone
Left in peace in the dark
Sometimes itâs hard to understand
Oh God, give me the chance to see again

When your eyes are lost and red
When you feel so lost and sad
When it seems you are alone
With all the things that you have done
Thereâs no time to save your mind

Everyday is the same
Hoping to live my life again!

You gotta live until you die in the silence of a long delay

You are stronger than their hate
To feel that pain
I wonât let you down
Oh God, give me the chance to see again

Everyday I remember the flame
They donât ever seem to feel the same
They remind us to forget the pain
Does it feel like itâs gonna hurt the same?
