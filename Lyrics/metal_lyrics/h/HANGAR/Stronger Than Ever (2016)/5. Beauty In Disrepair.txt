In the middle of the night it appears quite black
I am not a ghost, I am much more real than you think
You should be thinking with you head and never with your broken heart

Live your truth (live your truth) and know you are not alone (you are not)
There are things that remain a mystery
How can I help you to believe?
Sometimes the truth wonât set you free
In another life you trusted in me

Itâs so hard to see when it comes to seeing the truth
How do you feel?
Can I help you to see your scars?
Leave it all behind
All the things that we trusted became the truth

Live your truth (live your truth) and know you are not alone (you are not)
You canât control (you canât control) the way I see your life (your life)
There are things that remain a mystery
How can I help you to believe?
Sometimes the truth wonât set you free
In another life you trusted in me, oh...

I was with you behind the veil in another life
It was strange: you were covered in scars
Leave it all behind
All the things that we trusted became the truth

Live your truth (live your truth) and know you are not alone (you are not)
You canât control (you canât control) the way I see your life (your life)
There are things that remain a mystery
How can I help you to believe?
Sometimes the truth wonât set you free
In another life you trusted in me
