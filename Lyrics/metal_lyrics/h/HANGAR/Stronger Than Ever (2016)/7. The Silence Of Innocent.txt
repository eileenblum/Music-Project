We are all living, searching for something
Wishing and hoping â I know that feeling

How did you choose them?
In the middle of darkness
Your heart is full of hate today

I would like to show you some new tricks
I will take your books, peace and your fantasies

You canât remove this pain
Alone inside your mind
Now itâs your turn to pay the price
You will never forget
And that feeds my hopes
To have you back one day again

You can pass on those terrible traits you fear the most and you will cry
You accept what he has done, but you are not afraid to die
You can pass on those terrible traits you fear the most and you will cry
You accept what he has done, but you are not afraid to die

Master! Donât leave me master!
Iâll pay my price
Master! Donât leave me master!
I wonât survive
I wonât survive!
