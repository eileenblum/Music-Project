I still feel this cruel wanting
Yet Iâm sure I donât wanna die

You try to hide your deepest sins
There is no reason
Shadows of you still haunting me
I belong here

Yes, reality is a prison
Reality is a prison
Reality is a prison
Reality...

I have no time on my hands
I keep pushing on
When the moment comes
Iâm just a stranger alone

Yes, reality is a prison
Reality...

Have you ever talked to someone
And it makes you wanna cry?
When itâs time to forget
Everything the makes you want to die

You try to hide your deepest sins
There is no reason
Shadows of you still haunting me
I belong here!

My eyes they see, but I canât believe
My heart is screaming out loud
Iâll make an offer you canât refuse
Some things are not what they seem

I have no time on my hands
I keep pushing on
When the moment comes
Iâm just a stranger

Reality is a prison
Reality...
