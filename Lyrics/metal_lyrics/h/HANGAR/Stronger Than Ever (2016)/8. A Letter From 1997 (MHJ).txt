I think Iâm just a shadow of you
Salvation
Sometimes I feel
I canât go on

Iâve been told what to do
And I donât know what I should do
To change the story of your life
Now Iâm really scared to fight

I think Iâm just (I think Iâm just) a shadow of you
An overwhelming sense of loss hits me when you are gone

I think Iâm just (I think Iâm just) a shadow of you
Salvation
Sometimes I feel
I canât go on (I canât go on)
All through the night Iâm asking you to take my pride

Weâre all living in a dream
Do you really know what I mean?

I think Iâm just (I think Iâm just) a shadow of you
Salvation
Sometimes I feel
I canât go on (I canât go on)
All through the night Iâm asking you to take my pride
Salvation
Sometimes I feel
I canât go on (I canât go on)
All through the night Iâm asking you to take my pride

I think Iâm just (I think Iâm just) a shadow of you
Salvation
Sometimes I feel
I canât go on (I canât go on)
All through the night Iâm asking you to take my pride
Salvation
Sometimes I feel
I canât go on (I canât go on)
All through the night Iâm asking you to take my pride
