I realized I had wasted my time
Your soul remembers things
You once said youâd never forget
Donât let me down
Why are you so scared?
Our time is getting shorter
Where do we go now?

Run away, run away
You must be so determined
Run away

When darkness falls and sets you free (falls and sets you free)
When all your strength has gone and you feel so wrong

Your soul remembers things
You once said youâd never forget
Our time is getting shorter
Where do we go now?

Run away, run away
You must be so determined
Run away

All the things that youâve done wrong
Will find a way to go back to you
Run away, run away

Run away, run away
You must be so determined
Run away
