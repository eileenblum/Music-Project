When the days are too cold
You can feel my heat
Are you afraid to get close?
And deny your other soul

There is nothing else to say now (there is nothing to say)
There is no way to hide the truth (there is nothing to hide)
You are safe in my arms of surrender
And now itâs time for you to walk in your shoes

You can look at my face
But youâre afraid to get lost
All the promises weâve made
To have secrets and not mistakes

There is nothing else to say now (there is nothing to say)
There is no way to hide the truth (there is nothing to hide)
You are safe in my arms of surrender
And now itâs time for you to walk in your shoes

Sometimes thereâs nothing else to feel (sometimes)
Can you feel your power? (Sometimes, ah...)
Your light itâs stronger than the dark

There is nothing else to say now (there is nothing to say)
There is no way to hide the truth (there is nothing to hide)
You are safe in my arms of surrender
And now itâs time for you to walk in your shoes

There is nothing else to say now (there is nothing to say)
There is no way to hide the truth (there is nothing to hide)
You are safe in my arms of surrender
And now itâs time for you to walk in your shoes

Itâs time for you to walk in your shoes, oh...
You are just like heaven, oh...
In your shoes...
