One day you wonât feel this pain anymore
Surrounded by fake dreams you are lost
You are lost, you are totally lost
I still have my hopes to bring you back
You are lost, you are totally lost
I still have my hopes to bring you back...

Thereâs something left inside your mind
That you have been searching all this time
All this time, searching all this time
The lines are getting thinner right now!
All this time, searching all this time
The lines are getting thinner right now, right now, right now!

All this time, searching all this time
The lines are getting thinner right now!
I will take up all your tears one more time
I know there is no one here to blame now!
Right now, thereâs no one to blame!
Right now, thereâs no one here to blame right now
