[Lyrics: Priester, Music: Martinez, Laguna, Priester, Mello]

I could say a couple of words to mesmerize myself
Or I could write a couple of lines to express myself

This time I'm analyzing why your angles are right
Compared with mine your point of view is just ready to fight
Sometimes you are the last one to see beyond
Everyone wants to know why they can't rest alone

I want to make my symbol mark
In the deepest of your heart
And you will be the chosen one

I just want to make a memory to express myself
Oh God, just give me some light to find my way
I am looking for some reason to express myself
Oh God, just give me some light to find my way
And I will never be alone

Everyone wants to know why they can't rest alone

I want to make my symbol mark
In the deepest of your heart
And you will be the chosen one

I just want to make a memory to express myself
Oh God, just give me some light to find my way
I am looking for some reason to express myself
Oh God, just give me some light to find my way

I just want to make a memory to express myself
Oh God, just give me some light again
I am looking for some reason to express myself
Oh God, just give me some light again
And I will never be alone
