[Lyrics: Priester, Music: Priester, Martinez, Mello, Laguna]

I would do anything for you
Wait for your chance
And you will see what they do
I have some things to say now

I tried so hard to understand
Why your dream is over
It's never late to find
The strength inside your eyes

One day you will know what this means
And I hope your lonely heart
Will be open again

Afraid you will not reach your goals now

I tried so hard to understand
Why your dream is over
It's never late to find
The strength inside your eyes

In the strongest man there's
A little weakness
But you will never find it
To face my past now
Just look at those signs
But you will never find it

I know what you have to do
I was waiting for this chance
To say I really care about you

I want to deserve this place now

I tried so hard to understand
Why your dream is over
It's never late to find
The strength inside your eyes
