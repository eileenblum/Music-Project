[Lyrics: Priester, Music: Priester, Mello, Laguna, Martinez, Vieira]

I am the one
Who bring you back to life
No matter what I felt
Walking on the water at night

Since I believe
In the lightness of your soul
There is no turning back

I will take you once again
To keep the balance of your faith
I see light inside the darkness of your eyes

When I saw you alone
Dreaming of black waves
I found the one
I would like to see everyday

Since I believe in the lightness of your soul
There is no turning back

I will take you once again
To keep the balance of your faith
I see light inside the darkness of your eyes

Everyone has a secret life
Floating among your dreams
You are a miracle in my life
Always keeping everything inside

I will take you once again
To keep the balance of your faith
I see light inside the darkness of your eyes
