[Lyrics: Priester, Music: Priester, Martinez, Mello, Laguna, Sobrinho]

Only time can clarify my doubts
All this time I was hoping and praying
Beyond my dreams you can find some love
But there is no love without pain

How does it feel to know?
You will never be alone

My innocence to believe in desires
Bring me closer to a heart attack
Even when you're almost going home
I know you're not coming back

Dressed up with my mask of pain
Life is everything that remains

My time is getting short to live
I need to find someone to love
I want to kill all my pain inside
My destiny can change the course of love
My time is getting short to live
I need to find someone to love
 Cause no one can change the breath of love

Every flower in the garden is dead
And I know the secret place of your heart
Maybe you will never break the bone
Now I have a reason to become strong

Dressed up with my mask of pain
For sure I'll never be the same

My time is getting short to live
I need to find someone to love
I want to kill all my pain inside
My destiny can change the course of love
My time is getting short to live
I need to find someone to love
'Cause no one can change the breath of love
