[Lyrics: Priester, Music: Priester, Martinez, Laguna, Mello]

All the saddest words you say
Can't make any effect on me

Sometimes my thoughts have
The same meaning that you want to spread
Sometimes you want to pray
But you don't realize how much you have to pay

I can't deny what I felt
I wouldn't cry for anything
My memory is always searching for your sins

I have seen faith
You have seen death
And I am ready for the miracle in my life

Now no one can follow me
And I can feel

In my dreams
The evil spirit is haunting my sleep
Beyond my dreams
You appear, haunted by your sins

Now no one can follow me
And I can see

Beyond my dreams
You appear, haunted by your sins

I could feel my insanity when the pain was gone
I can feel my sanity when you are crying alone
When you are crying alone, how can you feel the pain?
So many faces, but they are looking for the same sin

Do you know how long it takes?
To find another host
Do you know how long it takes?
To find yourself alone
One day your story will be told
As a real love and pain

All the saddest words you say are just insane

Sometimes my thoughts have
The same meaning that you want to spread
Sometimes you want to pray
But you don't realize how much you have to pay

I have seen faith
You have seen death
And I am ready for the miracle in my life

Now no one can follow me
And I can feel

In my dreams
The evil spirit is haunting my sleep
Beyond my dreams
You appear haunted by your sins

I could feel my insanity when the pain was gone
I can feel my sanity when you are crying alone

I can't deny what I felt
I wouldn't cry for anything
My memory is always searching for your sins now
