[Lyrics: Priester, Music: Priester, Mello, Laguna, Martinez, Vieira]

The time has come
Your past is knocking at your door
How many times
I saw my face with broken smiles

Now it's time to forget
All the mistakes you have done
Now it's time to believe
My mistakes will make me learn and learn

If you have anything to say
If you have to believe in someone
Make your spirit feel so strong
And you will never be alone
If you have to believe in someone
Believe in yourself again

One second can change your belief again
Be careful,  cause you can be wrong
But if you never try
How can you believe that you are strong?

The time has come
I want to break these chains alone
Now it's time to forget
All the mistakes you have done
Now it's time to believe
My mistakes will make me learn and learn

If you have anything to say
If you have to believe in someone
Make your spirit feel so strong
And you will never be alone
If you have to believe in someone
Believe in yourself again
