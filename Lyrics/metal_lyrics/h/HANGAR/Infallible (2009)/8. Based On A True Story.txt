[Lyrics: Priester, Music: Priester]

Sometimes I am looking
At the stars alone to find
Some reason to forget
Or refuse my sadness again

Here I am in the dark
With my feelings and my scars
Here I am not alone
You are in the roots of my soul

And I always have much more to say
But the wind and the time will find
Some reason to explain my choices
I will take everything in this life

If the stars are hiding in the clouds
Now it's time to make a change
I hope someday don't regret my choices
And I know that's insane

Here I am in the dark
With my feelings and my scars
Here I am not alone
You are in the roots of my soul

And I always have much more to say
But the wind and the time will find
Some reason to explain my choices
I will take everything in this life
