[Lyrics: Priester, Music: Priester, Mello, Laguna, Martinez, Vieira]

Somehow we live and learn
I saw life begin and choose my ways
Why don't you give me facts?
To understand my troubles and go ahead

I really want to know
I am watching you breathing once again
For all this time

Trying to find a word to explain my pride
Waiting for a moment to say
No matter how, but we will be together
To save my life again

No one ever told me when
Stay away and let my feelings find
A real place to live
Where I can be free and keep my open mind

Some things can never change
They are enough to leave yourself behind
For some reason I will stay
Here in my fortress like a solitary mind

I really want to know
I am watching you breathing once again
For all this time

Trying to find a word to explain my pride
Waiting for a moment to say
No matter how, but we will be together
To save my life again

We can only believe in silence
Like a forest in the rain
Like a solitary mind
