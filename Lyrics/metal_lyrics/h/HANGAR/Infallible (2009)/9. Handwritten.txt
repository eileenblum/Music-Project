[Lyrics: Priester, Martinez, Music: Priester, Martinez, Laguna, Mello]

Put away your pride and fears
I will take up all your tears
Take your time, but see what's real
Maybe you'll never get the deal

I can hear what you wanna say
It doesn't matter, I have my way

You have no choices, you just have to pay
You will understand when I say
Try to recreate sad images from your life
Try to guess who is that face

I can hear what you wanna say
It doesn't matter, I have my way
I can hear what you wanna to say
It doesn't matter, I have my way

Hold your fire and tell me secrets of your life
Close your eyes and see them cry
Refuse to live in the shadows of their lives
Prefer to pay the price

Bring me closer hiding your lies
I won't ever be satisfied
You should know better, we can't live alone
They won't cry when you are gone

I can hear what you wanna say
It doesn't matter, I have my way

I found some words many time ago
Handwritten from my soul
No passion no prudence, revenge is my name
You've gotta watch what I'm saying

I can hear what you wanna say
It doesn't matter, I have my way
I can hear what you wanna to say
It doesn't matter, I have my way

Hold your fire and tell me secrets of your life
Close your eyes and see them cry
Refuse to live in the shadows of their lives
Prefer to pay the price
