[Lyrics: Priester / Music: Martinez, Priester, Laguna]

What does that sign mean?
I never saw you facing me so sadly

Daintily the rain dampened everyone
Mysteriously you felt so lost
Standing behind

See the crime scene photos of your life
Listen to the hangman's laughter's echoes
How you can get rid of all those remembrances

Dancing in the awful deepest earth
Desiring to move my eyes to see
Beyond the belief

Revelations, in secrets I believe
Hear the voices calling insanities
No salvation, transforming dreams to kill and kill
Everlasting will be my bloodletting

Screaming out against the facts
As the mind living so sad
I will run away with you
To get your honor back

Hate and love will give you chances
To understand your life
Face to face with your desires
You must make you choices "Right Now"

Revelations, in secrets I believe
Hear the voices calling insanities
No salvation, transforming dreams to kill and kill
Everlasting will be my sickness
