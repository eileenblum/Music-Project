[Lyrics: Priester / Music: Priester, Martinez, Laguna, Mello, Fernandes]

Just tell me that was not real
I am afraid to say
I was hoping to see you one more time
I don't care if you are losing the control
I just care for myself

Safe in my own words
Learning with myself
Realize the way

I don't care if you are losing the control
Watch yourself burn again

Help me - Don't make me sleep alone
Save me - Please try to understand
Don't cross the line
Where my love is dying
No matter what they say
Help me - I feel my love is dying
No matter what they say
Don't cross the line

I don't care if you are losing the control
I just care for myself

Help me - Don't make me sleep alone
Save me - Please try to understand
Don't cross the line
Where my love is dying
No matter what they say
Help me - I feel my love is dying
No matter what they say
Don't cross the line
