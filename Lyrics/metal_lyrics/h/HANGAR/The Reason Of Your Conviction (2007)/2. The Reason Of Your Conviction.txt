[Lyrics: Priester / Music: Martinez, Priester, Laguna, Mello, Polchowicz]

A man of means inert on those skins
Your face is haunting something else to live
Watching me, but as the naivety had been
The reason of your destiny

You can feel the silence
Screaming inside your heart
There is no lie in that house
Your life is changing

Awaking and looking at dead faces
I will forgive the pain and all mistakes

Wanting me my wittiness will be safe
You are taking over me again

Somehow the pain inside your eyes
Is just the beginning

The holiness arriving without fears
Waiting for the sentence in the haze across the dark
Nothing is so sad like the guilty in your heart
And I believe, you have no way to learn

Do you think you can profile me?
I feel something different in your voice
You just have to learn

When the past is real
Screaming inside your heart
Somehow the pain inside your eyes
Is just the beginning

The holiness arriving without fears
Waiting for the sentence in the haze across the dark
Nothing is so dangerous like the guilty in the earth
And I believe, you have no way to learn
