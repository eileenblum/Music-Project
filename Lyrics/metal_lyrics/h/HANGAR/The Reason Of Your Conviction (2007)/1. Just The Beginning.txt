[Lyrics: Priester / Music: Priester, Laguna]

Did I have some kind of dream?
Hear the voices calling insanities
Loneliness is my name
Somehow the pain inside your eyes
Is just the beginning
Strange like angels going to hell
I will see you on the other side
Somehow we found each other
Sacrifices
Have you ever seen a life falling dead?
Hate and love will give you chances
Beyond my silence I have my past
Living promises forever, forever
All the passion will be gone
New sensations
Some creations
Hate and love will give you chances
Somehow the pain inside your eyes
Is just the beginning
Sometimes they call
I just want to live inside your heart
Forever, forever
Love through her eyes forever
"E finalmente encontrei a paz atravÃ©s da dor e do sofrimento...
De alguma forma, a dor de dentro dos seus olhos Ã© apenas o comeÃ§o".
[translation:
"And finally I found the peace through pain and sufferingâ¦
Somehow, the pain inside your eyes is just the beginning."]
