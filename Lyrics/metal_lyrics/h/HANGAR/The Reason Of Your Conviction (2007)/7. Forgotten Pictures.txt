[Lyrics: Priester / Music: Mello, Priester, Martinez, Laguna]

Forever snow falls deeply around
That angry child is far away in the crowd

That old man was right when he said:
Have you ever seen a life falling dead?
Chasing lights between the shadows and lies
Shooting fire defying all the conventions

Loneliness is my name
Don't blame me with pain
My scars were hidden
Forgive my loneliness he said
Embracing the man
Make them sensible again

How can I love without knowing the truth?
If the eyes are dying waiting for you
Heedless some illusion is out of control
Living promises forever, foreverâ¦

Loneliness is my name
Don't blame me with pain
My scars were hidden
Forgive my loneliness he said
Embracing the man
Make them sensible again

Do you remember me?
When you were dying
I was trying to kill someone

Why you want to make your life
So much harder
Spreading your guilty
Around the world

Now the history is endless
Why sometimes the lies are true?

I have to do some things before I dieâ¦
Forever, forever
