[Lyrics: Priester / Music: Priester, Laguna, Martinez, Mello]

Did I have some kind of dream?
Or hallucinations
All the passion will be gone

Alone here in the dark
I could learn to forget
But tears of sorrow fill my eyes

How can I read between the lines?
Trying to understand
Why all the passion will be gone, oh God

When I give some kind of pain
You have to hold my hands
Beyond my silence I have my past
You haven't been in the kind of place I have
And all my suffering will become
Something real for your life

I am so repentant
I couldn't take your life
Can you hear me call your name?
How can I read between the lines?
Trying to understand
Why all the passion will be gone, oh God

When I give some kind of pain
You have to hold my hands
Beyond my silence I have my past
You haven't been in the kind of place I have
And all my suffering will become
Something real for your life
