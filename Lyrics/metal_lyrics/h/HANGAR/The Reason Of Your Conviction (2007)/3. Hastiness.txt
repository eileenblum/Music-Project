[Lyrics: Priester / Music: Martinez, Priester, Laguna, Mello, Polchowicz]

New sensations, some creations
We will pay the price
Now it's time to turn the tide
And they are trying to kill us again

Sometimes I need to be alone
Holding my hand to my heart
Straining the invisible chains and sparks

Sound asleep like a dream
You were under pressure
Sacrifices, hastiness
The mazes are bleeding into your mind

Sometimes I need to be alone
Waiting for somebody else
Building our lies in some places

Sometimes they callâ¦
(Imagine the impure hate in your heart)
And I find myself strong
(I walk away alone and so proud)
Now it's time to make the time
(Instead of declining)
Breathing love through her eyes

Sometimes I need to be alone
Waiting for somebody else
Building our lies in some places

Sometimes they callâ¦
(Imagine the impure hate in your heart)
And I find myself strong
(I walk away alone and so proud)
Now it's time to make the time
(Instead of declining)
Breathing love through her eyes

The Hastiness
To carry on you have to pay the price
