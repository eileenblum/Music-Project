[Lyrics: Priester / Music: Laguna, Priester, Martinez, Fernandes]

I can learn to persist
Why erase my life?
Or sleep to dieâ¦

Reflections in my mind
Teach me how to lie
I don't belong to your world

I want to share my love
Just give me one more chance
Don't disappoint me again

I know we can't hide what we've done
We are the ones who draw the line
I could talk to my pride and never see the chance
To have another try and live my life again

Free â My silence makes you see yourself
All this time I was blind
I want to tell you my secret dreams
And make it easier for myself
God, just give me one more chance

I'm still looking for you
Are you still waiting for me?

If your future's looking dark
Mankind remains the same
Should I feel your pain again?
