[Lyrics: Priester / Music: Mello, Martinez, Priester, Laguna]

She turns her head
To reach a new dimension
But I don't want to see her pray

By her long cool stare and her silence
She turns to me mercifully

Long time ago
I lost my only friend
She said desperately to me

She takes my wrist smiling
I don't want to feel that pain

When the darkness takes you
Tell their names
I just want to live inside your heart

I donÂ´t want to see

When the darkness takes you
Tell their names
I just want to live inside your heart

I see how their eyes
Are waiting for someone
Someday you will return

I will see you on the other side
I want to live inside your heart
Inside your heart
