[Bonus Track for Japan]

[Lyrics: Priester / Music: Mello, Priester, Laguna, Martinez]

You are the wind on my back
And I feel you here
Foreseeing all the fear
I am so unbalanced

When I lay all those bodies
Should I live so long?
To die is better than to be alone
We are exchanging lives

I see the shots
But I never see the blood
And after all I usually to pray to lord

I saw my name in your book
And now I understand
That was some trap to catch me on
It was so disruptive

To feel the pain that I felt
You just have to be free
Now your life belongs to me
And your spirit is gone forever

I see the shots
But I never see the blood
And after all I usually to pray to lord

Just take my skin and bones and live forever
The agony got in my throat I must surrender
Just take my skin and bones and live forever
Sharing your life with me will be your salvation

My hate is for a lifetime
Without memories or desires
Your history ends where it began
