Black box filled with names
Yours is in there
Try to say a prayer
Don't hold your breath
A tradition that's been followed
No questions asked
Population kept in check
Secret to the world
It won't matter if you're good
When they're standing over you
It won't matter what you say
When the stones are in their hands
Death will take you slowly
The weight crushes your bones
Murder in their eyes
The last thing that you'll see
Black box filled with names
Of family and friends
Destiny placed in the hands
Of the common man
Everyone will have their say
It's a matter of time
Who's going next
It could be your own
