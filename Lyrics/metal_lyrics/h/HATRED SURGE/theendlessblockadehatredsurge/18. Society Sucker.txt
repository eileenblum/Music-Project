[originally by Agnostic Front]Spending your life dreaming of rich fantasies
Come back of your dreams and face reality
You think you've got everything, but really have nothing
It's just too much pressure and your mind is bust
Watch out don't make a mistake you'll lose your money
It's poverty's stake society sucker
You've earned your name society sucker
It's just a game
