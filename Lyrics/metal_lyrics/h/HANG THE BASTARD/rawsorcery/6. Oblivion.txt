Youâll fade away in to the darkness weâll waste away in to oblivion
Raining down chaos bringer of war
These are your beliefs based on stories of old
How you will suffer at the hands of the wretched that you cast aside
As you watched children burn comfortable in the knowledge that you where going to a better place
Telling stories to control weak minded fools

I wonât fall into your trap and let your tear my soul apart
I can see, with clear eyes that we live in a cold world
Even if your reign of fear should come to an end itâll be too late
This world has been wasting away for far too long
