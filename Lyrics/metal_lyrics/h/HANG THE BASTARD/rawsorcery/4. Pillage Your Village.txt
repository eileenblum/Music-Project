Pillage you village burn all your crops
Kill all the live stock fun never stops
Pillage your village plunder your wine
Laugh at your lepers dine on your swine
Taking what I can destroy everything
I feed on pain, not please smell the blood and sweat in the air
Fucking love these guilty pleasures donât care about your feeling
You give it all and I am waiting to receive.
