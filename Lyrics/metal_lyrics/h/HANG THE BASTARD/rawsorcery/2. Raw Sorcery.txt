The storm is brewing, The tides are rising
Evil doers are converging cloaked men and women
Preparing for this worlds demise wizards and witches performing black masses
Spilling the blood of the meek preparing all virgin fools for the harvest

You will not find God here now there is no escape
Your end is fucking here no one can save you now
This worlds been doomed since the dawn of time
This worlds been doomed since the dawn of this rotten humanity
You will not find God here this world is crashing down
No one will be spared the children will be coloured blood red
The ground will open and hell on earth begins no one can save you now.
