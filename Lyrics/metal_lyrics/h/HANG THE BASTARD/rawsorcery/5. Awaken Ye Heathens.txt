Filling my world with hate youâll be at the receiving end of my wraith
So cower in fear before you meet your bitter ending
Awaken, Whereâs your soul? crashed on the rocks
You canât see youâre in hell your world is falling apart and I am the one bringing it down
Earthquakes and hurricanes your life is fucking over
Are you through? let me tell you something
My skull brims with hate and youâre the fucking cause
You canât see youâre in hell.
