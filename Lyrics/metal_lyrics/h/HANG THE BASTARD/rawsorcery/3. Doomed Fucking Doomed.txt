Another fucking waste, Another fucking lie isolated again
A kid who doesn't know his place whatâs to lose, when you've lost everything
Roads leading to nowhere but itâs leading away from you
And when I see your face I want to tear it apart
Push it, Rip it, Fuck it, Kill it
In twenty years, I have never felt so low
So I'm pushing and pushing trying to not give a fuck
About the shitty things you did
You are the reason I feel disconnected.
