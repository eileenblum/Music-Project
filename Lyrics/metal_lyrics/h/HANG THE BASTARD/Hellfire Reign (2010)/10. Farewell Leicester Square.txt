The eye of judgement is spying on you as we sit on thrones in dark chambers
'Do what thou wilt' but they will never understand
No boundaries, no gods no leaders, no souls
We are the righteous and you are enslaved
Bound to your idols, not to the flesh
The chosen few, the only ones who can reign

I refuse to live in a world that just doesn't get it
I'm saying goodbye to this cruel world for a higher state of mind
There's no halo above your head just a noose around your neck
When you take that short sharp drop I will be there at the bottom of your fall
There's an end in sight that only we can see your world will crumble and fall
You'll pray on your knees as we look up at the reign
