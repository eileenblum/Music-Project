There's a devil inside of me runs his claws along my insides
I feel him looking through my eyes it's growing stronger everyday 
I'm fighting a war against myself
But I'm not sure which side I am on

Some days I can't bear to look in the mirror
Because I am disgusted with the man I have become
I'm fighting a war against myself,
but I'm not sure which side I'm on

I wonder what you're thinking, when you look at me
I can hear the screams coming from your head
Though it hurts to say that I don't blame you
I won't blame you if you feel ashamed to stand by my side
