When all you see is darkness misery will take its toll
Walking the streets alone rejecting everything you've been told
Outcast who's looked upon like dirt nothing but disgust for the world
I can see a storm coming I see skies burning red I can see the fear in your eyes

I refuse to became a slave to your reality
A sudden spell of fear has been cast over the world
And when darkness surrounds me I will embrace the cold
You're running scared as your world comes crashing down around you
I feel your fear, I see it in your eyes mass media disease, you're all infected
