Black sky comes crashing on us but I don't feel a thing
Dark shape appears that's come to set us free
Why should I feel anything for you?
You deserve all that's coming to you
Look at me and you'll see that I have my father's eyes
Look at me and you'll see that I have the blackest eyes

We love the ones you hate and I embrace, all that you threw away
A hellfire is going to reign and burn you away
We are the Devils children and we have come to destroy
Hellfire Reign
