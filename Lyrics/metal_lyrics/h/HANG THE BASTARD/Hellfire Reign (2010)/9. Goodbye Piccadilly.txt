Hope you realize what you've done
That you were just another regretful fuck
Something to pass the time words can't describe the regret in my mind
As I plead my case to the one I'm hurting the most
Maybe I will suffer; maybe I will burn in hell
I would erase the past if I could
But I am just fucking evil and there is nothing so say
Goodbye
