When the end comes, I'll be laughing laughing in the face of death
When he points at me, I'll look him in the eyes and say take me away
At the edge of my life waiting to be pushed over
I just want to watch this world burn
As I'm sitting back waiting to be swalled whole by time
Now the kids from Rydell High are dead
And life doesn't get another shitty sequel

If I could, I would make it all go away it's well-wishers like you
That tied this noose around my neck and when I choke, you'll choke with me
I don't belong here and I'm trying to wish myself away
Finished with a world that wants nothing more than to swallow me alive
