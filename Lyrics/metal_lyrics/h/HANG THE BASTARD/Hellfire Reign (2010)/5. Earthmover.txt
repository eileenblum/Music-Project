Every setting sun leaves me writhing in pain
Street lights go on and all my fucking teeth fall out
This is a curse play my part for the worse
Though I feel like this I could make the earth move
There's a wolf next to me whispers in my ear
Go out into the reign now I'm drenched and I'm thinking
All my life, nowhere to turn felt worthless and cold and I don't know where to go
