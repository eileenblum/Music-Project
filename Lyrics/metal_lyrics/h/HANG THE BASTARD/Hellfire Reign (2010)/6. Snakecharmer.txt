Using all you've got to get your own way
Play the game but it's all the same
Don't care who you fuck or who you fuck over
Snake Charmer I'm watching you
Snake Charmer you're on your own
Living a life, living lies smoke and mirrors shield you

What are you trying to prove? I hope it was worth it
If you were worth my time, I'd tear you apart
Make sure you don't walk my way because I know
You can't look me in the eyes I'm turning my back on you
Save your apologies, I hope you die alone!
Beware the Snake Charmer
