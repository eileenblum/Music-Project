I still hear the words, still burns the flame
95 was just other day
It went by so fast
20 years in a van
Youth rage while idols age

Wherever you are, near of far
Wherever you are, near of far
Wherever you are, near of far
From the downtown streets to the blue lamp bar

Screaming for change was the words they said
United as one, together we scream
I still hear the words, still burns the flame

Wherever you are, near of far
Wherever you are, near of far
Wherever you are, near of far
From the downtown streets to the blue lamp bar

Wherever you are, near of far
Wherever you are, near of far
Wherever you are, near of far
From the downtown streets to the blue lamp bar
