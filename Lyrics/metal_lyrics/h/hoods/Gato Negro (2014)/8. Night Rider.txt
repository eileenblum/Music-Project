I'm a rocker, a roller
And out of controller

Take these sheep
Take these blades
The slaughter begins
Paint the town red
Seek your revenge
They can run
They can hide
There'll be no escape

Burn them down
Lock the doors
Torture begins

[2x]
I can see you
I can hear you
I can smell you

I will crush you

Paint the walls red
And slit your wrist

Hoods 916

I am
I am
I am
I am nightrider
