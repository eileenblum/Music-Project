Sometimes my feelings can crush
moments cast in my mind like stones
sometimes I can't feel normal pains
sometimes I can't feel at all
when these walls come crashing
the weight of the world is on this back
feelings so strong with words I can't express
so tired of being closed
I believed in you
you opened me up
I know I'm alive inside
lessons aren't buried so easy
when depression falls
I want to be in your arms
I know my time is coming
lessons are drawing near
you
open me up
