When my time comes
I know I'll get what I deserve
so now's the time
as I choke on myself
what happened to me
broken down but never beat
I live in this world
and it seems to fit me
me
now somethings trying to drag me down
I know my faults
I've seen them around
a close call it seems to be
all of you and just one of me
I won't change
I dwell in pain
if I don't change
dwell in pain
I won't change
when my time comes
I know I'll get what I deserve
so now's the time
as I choke on myself
what happened to me
broken down but never beat
I live in this world
it never fit me
