I feel so kept
kept in check
protect us lord
from ourselves
watch society give us suicide
in love with emptiness
here's the razor
give me your wrists
I hate this world
I hate myself
close my eyes I don't want to see
time the destroyer
in our time of greed
feel the worlds on my back
take myself out
I won't last
let 'em die
let 'em starve
put the gun to their heads
make them watch
for all the people on the streets
I won't forgive them
I won't die
because of their greed
greed
relentless acts I commit
[2x]
relentless time served
relentless acts I commit
time the destroyer
