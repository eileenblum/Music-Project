To all the kids who believed in you
to all the kids who trusted you
to all the kids who were true to you
to all the kids that would die for you
all the fucking lies
all the fucking times
all your sincere cries
your unity's a fucking lie
I once believed so much
all your words
all your hope
your words made me try
it's all gone it was a fucking lie
you meant so much to me
you meant so much to the scene
you used us all
as your fucking sheep
deceived
I thought our bond was true
I thought of you so pure
our savior
left us in disbelief
not true
our friend's a fucking thief
I gave it all
never asked for nothing
you take from those
who have the least
it's not fair
you're a fucking thief
I would have lied for you
I would have died for you
I would have defended you
now I burn inside
for you now I burn inside for you
