I'll always be your friend
when my life got tough
you were the only one there
your friendship means everything
I've watched you grow
and this time
I know you're in pain
my head is up my heart is broke
giving so much with no return
when my mind says quit
my heart takes over
and won't let me give in
then I think to myself
I did it all for you
and no one else
pain
[2x]
no truth only lies
being with you I was content
no truth only lies
I've grown inside
I'll never quit
