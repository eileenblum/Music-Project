Going nowhere fast
everywhere at once
no one is king
and there is no god
so if life is a test
then I've failed you all
put the steel to my head
and watch me fall
fall
I scream from inside
lock myself out
look to the past
where's the innocence lost
too proud to be heard
as my heart turned to stone
when you turned your back
is when I lost it all
all
scream from inside
just out of reach
I look for your help you give me nothing
no words to express in these hostile times
killed these dreams
when I believed your lies
lies
