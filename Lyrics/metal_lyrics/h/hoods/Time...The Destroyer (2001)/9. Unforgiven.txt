Sin after sin
to god you confess
you know you're lost
you couldn't resist
these ages in space
captured your time
sin after sin to god you confess
you believe in faith?
I believe in myself
train of thought slips
fuck your faith
unforgiven
I hold profane what you hold sacred
trust in myself
fuck you all
I find contempt in your savior
no help from you
by myself
all the greed
all the hate
all the destruction committed
in your saviors name
I find you sick
contradict
pass the blame
you found a god
now you're saved?
