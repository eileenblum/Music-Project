You always turn your back
you can't face reality
choose fiction over fact
now you motherfuckers bleed
now you'll bleed
you always turn your back
you can't face reality
choose fiction over fact
now you motherfuckers bleed
no more pain
turned your back
no more pain
stand up
counter attack
you always turn your back
you can't face reality
choose fiction over fact
now you'll bleed
bleed
take your place in society
committing the crimes against humanity
all the pain for the government's gun
population wipe out
where no one wins
or gets ahead
humanity's plot
slowly spreads
breaking our backs
for this system of hate
destroy everything sacred
death's the only fate
system controls the masses
but there's no mass appeal
can anyone tell me
what the fuck's the deal?
drowning in this hate
