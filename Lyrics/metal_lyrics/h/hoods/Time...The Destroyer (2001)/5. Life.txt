It means everything
everything just fucking died
I laid my trust
my hope
my whole life to be cut short
[2x]
take me for granted use me as you will I fake it all I'm dead inside
my whole life
every moment
every time I've tried
see you tomorrow
I know I'll never see you again
for all of you that fade away
you take a part of me
[2x]
when I don't care I know I care the most trust no one give me one more chance
I never wanted revenge
that's all that's left
I never wanted revenge
there's nothing left I never wanted revenge
there's nothing left
I never wanted revenge
what's next?
