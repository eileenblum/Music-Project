Live in fear
do you know what's next?
you are nothing
but you exist taking all that's mine
enemy watch your back
I won't walk away caught up in your lies
caught up in your games
turn your back
you turn on me turn her into my enemy
listed to her lies
played her games remember those times
I fucked you
you didn't fuck me
caught up in your lies
caught up in your games
taking all that's mine
consider yourself enemy
