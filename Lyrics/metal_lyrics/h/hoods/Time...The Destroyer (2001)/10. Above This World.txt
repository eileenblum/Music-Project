I don't want your salvation
your words are nothing to me
I've tried to follow your light
you gave so much agony to those I love
these times have offered me nothing
my penance was my birth
and all these times unanswered
I'm so above this world
above this world
above this world
I broke my fucking back
I won't fall to my knees
I'll never pray to such a bastard
you'll never answer our pleas
I search for inner peace
pure to call my own
not even faith exists for me now
to me your god is useless
I broke my fucking back
I won't fall to my knees
I'll never pray to such a bastard
you'll never answer my pleas
