Something head to give it was you or me questioned your heart you questioned me 
I will never turned my back this is how it must be no hard feelings no memories lost 
We'll always be family but the struggle must go on this isn't no game but 
The voice of the true 
It bleeds through me what happed to you the fight was hard we were almost there 
But you didn't fucking care true colors always shine through dedication we needed you 
Your dedication was shit we never needed you so question yourself are you true 
So question yourself are you fucking true
