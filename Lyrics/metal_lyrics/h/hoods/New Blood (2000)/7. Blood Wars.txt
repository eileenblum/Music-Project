Every beating builty my strength now you cower to my hate 
One with no future I dissolve the one who forces pain you must fall 
You want the truth you live a lie with pain vengeance and beatdowns 
You talk big led to false hope you led you lied just a fucking joke 
I trusted you full of shit I gave you took you lied now you die 
From our first breath the first emotion's pain pain is addiction's my slave 
From our first breath the first emotion's pain now you die
