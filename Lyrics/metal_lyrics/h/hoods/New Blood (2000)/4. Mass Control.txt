Take your place in society 
committing crimes for humanity 
All the pain for the government's gun 
Population wipe out where no one wins or get ahead 
Humanity's plot slowly spreads breaking our backs for the system of hate 
Destroy everything sacred death's the only fate 
System controls the masses but there's no mass appeal 
Can anyone tell me what the fuck's the deal
