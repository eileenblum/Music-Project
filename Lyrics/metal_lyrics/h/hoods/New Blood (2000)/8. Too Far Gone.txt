At one time you seemed so strong 
Now I ask where are you now 
If you couldn't fit the part 
Why'd you play the role 
I know I didn't always show respect 
At least what I feel is real 
For you to say it's all for me 
When I was there for you 
No matter what you do 
We were always there for you 
You turned lost walk away 
No matter what you do 
We were always there for you 
The meaning of friendship's lost betray 
Always strung along 
Promises we fail to keep 
A strong gesture at the tine 
Moments with no sincerity 
Some say pride never dies but 
Your turned walk away 
To spend so much time doing what you love 
Then throw it all away 
Your too far gone [x2]
