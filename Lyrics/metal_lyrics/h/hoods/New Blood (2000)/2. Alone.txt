All alone I'm not scared just empty 
I feel there's nothing left I keep going 
Despite the feelings I lack when worlds collide 
I can't get this pain off my back - off my back 
All that's wrong - I stand alone 
Sickness and pain for what? - for what? 
I'm still here our worlds collide 
I survive now you rot the mistakes you made 
All these scars for nothing 
All these scars for nothing 
Stand alone 
All these scars - all these scars for what? 
all alone I'm not scared just empty 
There's nothing left
