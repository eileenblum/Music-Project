Those days are here once again 
I can feel it in my heart 
Believing in myself helped me through 
The hardest part of time 
We've resurrected once again 
United united we'll win 
Take it back taking back our scene 
Old style we'll tear you apart 
A new day has arisen a moment in time 
That will not be forgot 
This is the time the time is now 
So tear it apart once again [x2]
