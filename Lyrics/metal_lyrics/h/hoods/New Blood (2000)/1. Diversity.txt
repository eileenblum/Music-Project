We're the only ones left I guess the strongest will never fall 
Each day moving on straight one day we'll reach our final goal 
It's time for us to wise up take each other in open arms 
strength through diversity together we'll never fall 
I know our lives are different in many ways 
we've come to accept each other through diversity 
So let's drop our fronts, lose our insecurities 
it's time for us to come together in unity 
Fuck your politics your part of diving dfad 
when your scene while you still can 
I know our lives are different in many ways 
we've come to accept each other through diversity 
So let's drop our fronts, lose our insecurities 
it's time for us to come together in unity 
Now... unity is what we need one strength through diversity 
Standing together with open arms for a better scene... 
together with pride
