Life's hard tomorrow's harder eyes open wide I drown in sorrow 
At a loss of words adversity strikes no one wins in the game of life 
I choke blind hold it all in material greed leads sinners to sin 
World's havok will never stop people's compassion forgot not lost 
I'm lost hardened block out the pain as life slips nothing to gain 
Won't give in I know I've lost when I die my hate stops street wise 
I always look back past lessons ready to attack anger suppressed 
Towards the guilty who've sinned I keep my head up I know I'll never win 
You gotta learn life's a game no one wins 
Everything's lost in the world's greed so much pain 
No ones sees everything's lost in the world's greed 
God give eyes to witness not to turn our backs 
So open your eyes and see 
Everything's lost no one wins
