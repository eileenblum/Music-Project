The art of suffering
use consume
all I had left
set me free
with nothing left
all is yours
I'm left with no defense
take it back
my wounds won't heal
minds at war
all I hear is kill
blood stained hands
loss of faith
I search for you
I'm no slave
I'll give you endless pain
[2x]
violence takes the place of love
love was never an option
I pray but things are getting worse
I've been given something I don't deserve
