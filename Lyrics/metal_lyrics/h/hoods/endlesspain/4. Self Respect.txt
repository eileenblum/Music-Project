addiction builds my rage my faith has befallen you my plot is set in stone inner hatred sets down on you show some strength bring back some pride you made this choice you're the one who lied I'm not scared of your shit fear is my strength you're locked down in your own pain another loss of respect you said you wouldn't and did it again another struggle lost why couldn't you quit
