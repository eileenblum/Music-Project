promises failed I've failed again inner turmoil forever lost in a lesson in life I'll never forget in this world I'm all alone all who cared were left in the past I drown more in my lonely existence my only regret is that no one could last - in the past - I wish I could see through your eyes I reach for the sky why must this cycle repeat in these times of fallen lives so incomplete I'm guilty I'm the one to blame I'm sorry but it's too late to prove that I was wrong I'll never be the same in those times I was scared our future dreams clashed all seemed so bleak not a day passes where I don't wish I could do it again.
