past acts of brutality evils in life took a normal place at a young age I learned these evil ways how many suffered because of my hate there's nothing left I face my fate jacked as never before I needed help but no one's there it's hard to change when your worst enemy is yourself I want to change - I can't cope - you won't help growing up terrified each day I didn't know life could be any other way we hit the bottom have we lost it all life makes you stong unless you die you took the loss when I look back at what I took from you it's hard to change I can't cope - how can I care for you when I don't care for myself I know it's hard to change experience such hell to sit back and watch your life slip away I feel sorry for you not myself
