EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVED IN WAS JUST A LIE.

Too many times you were the one who lied.
Karma's at the door- she has a knife.
Guilty pleasures lead to this pain.
I can't forget those words- or that day.

Everything you loved and everything you lived for
Just stabbed you in your back.

THIS TORMENT IT'S KILLING ME - IT'S CONSUMING ME - IT SWALLOWS ME [2x]

Take the safety off and slip in the clip
I don't care anymore just make it quick
A whores honor is torment and pain
The ice in my heart has melted again

THIS TORMENT IT'S KILLING ME - IT'S CONSUMING ME - IT SWALLOWS ME [2x]
