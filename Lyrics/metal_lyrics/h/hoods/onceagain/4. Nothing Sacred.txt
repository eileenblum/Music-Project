NOTHING IS SACRED question all the reasons why an inflicted notion of a victim's pain told you to kill and take away what wasn't yours but you saw it coming it was something to control the taking of a life now retribution is going to take yours depression I have stays in my mind I can't release to anyone else I wanna kill the inner-hate that controls my plot to your death.
