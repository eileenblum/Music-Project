Out of time committed the crime now you must pay we all must pay sent to the eight by eight as your fear turns to hate cold stares turn to death as I took my enemy's last breath to survive he had to die reality survival I killed my last rival respect comes as time grows longer as my brothers gain respect we grow stronger did what we must to survive earned respect to survive took another life just yesterday my rep grows bigger with loyalty gained I'm growing older as time goes on will I make it to tomorrow remaining strong everyday I must strife when will the time come sentenced to life under the gun.
