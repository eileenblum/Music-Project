i've always been a loser in your eyes. put my action down when you know i've tried. been trying for so many years. a losing battle i've been losing for years. my head is up, but my heart has sunk. i look for acceptance in actions i've done. i did it for you, not for myself. this time you die. i feel nothing. my head is up, my heart has sunk. negative reinforcement reinforced my anger. my anger never fades. i'd die for you.
