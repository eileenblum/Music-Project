I feel i'm lost to the world - out of touch and far behind 
put my passion to the test - i feel i've lost it all 
look at me with hate in your eyes - a reflection of you 
is what i feel inside all i've done 
and all i gave - years have passed - nothing's changed 
NOW YOU'LL WALK ALONE 
NOW YOU'LL WALK ALONE 
i hope the lesson you've learned - 
all these years of work 
NOW YOU'LL WALK ALONE 
a loss of mind, family, love, respect 
NO RESPECT
