Going nowhere fast - everywhere at once - no one is king and there is no god 
so if life is a test then i've failed you all - 
put the steel to my head and watch me fall - fall 
i scream from inside - lock myself out - i look to the past - where's the innocence lost 
too proud to be heard as my heart turns to stone 
when you turned your back is when i lost it all - all 
scream from inside - just outta reach - i look for your help 
you give me nothing - no words to express in the hostile times 
killed these dreams - when i believed your lies - lies 
going nowhere fast - everywhere at once - no one is king and there is no god 
so if life is a test then i've failed you all 
put the steel to my head and watch me fall 
i scream from inside - lock myself out - i look to the past - where's the innocence lost 
too proud to be heard as my heart turns to stone 
when you turned your back is when i lost it all - all
