I watched you every day saw the addiction get worse 
you fucking lied when you cried and stole from your friends 
i stood by your side and watched you grow thing 
saw you pulling tricks sucking dicks to get the next taste 
saw you under the freeway taking handouts of cash 
i know you ain't eating you that shits for your stash 
your food is dope there's no hope when your needles are friends - 
these days too short when your life's at its end this shit kills us all to see you like this 
i know how it feels to feel this is it 
i wake up every day not knowing what's next 
and lately life's not doing us right and the feelings not there 
i sleep these days away at night i drown in my fears - i wish you were here 
death wont steal you away not this time i'm by your side we wont lose - caught up heroin sick 
life brings us all down death wont steal you away not this time 
i'm boy your side we wont lose caught up heroin sick 
life brings us all down
