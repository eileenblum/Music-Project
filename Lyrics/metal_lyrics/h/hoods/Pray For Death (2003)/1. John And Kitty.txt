This tragedy fills in my mind - daughter of a whore - born from lust 
i can see it in your eyes - throw it away - pushed to the side 
a pipedream reality in my father's veins - i want to scream 
you killed my dreams - when i look in the mirror - it's not you - it's me 
so spread your legs and feel the disease - come and rape me 
i'll pull you with me as i bleed 
so spread your legs and feel the disease - come and rape me 
i'll pull you with me as i bleed 
i hate you with all my heart you motherfucker 
horror is the look on your face - a thousand times you have been raped 
mother look into my eyes - do you see my father's face? do you?
