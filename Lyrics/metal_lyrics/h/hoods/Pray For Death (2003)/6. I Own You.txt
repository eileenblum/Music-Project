In this time of hatred - i chose loneliness 
and this pain i feel inside - makes me want to kill you 
I OWN YOU - I OWN YOU - I OWN YOU - I OWN YOU 
the pain you've given me - all these years of torture - years of abuse 
i can't think straight - i just want to kill you 
all the pain you've given me - the years of torture - years of abuse 
and when you see me coming - i've got something for you 
i want to watch you die - i want to watch you die 
I OWN YOU - I OWN YOU - I OWN YOU - I OWN YOU
