I hope you fucking beat me - when its twenty on one 
I hope you have your gun - the next time i come around 
all your friends - a crew of fakes - i know when it all comes down 
i'll bring this shit one on one - and beat you into the fucking ground 
when you all surround me - i hope you take the fucking piss outta me 
in time my wounds will heal - i'll hunt you down and make you bleed 
try to get away crawling - my bat in hand - i start to swing 
revenge is something sacred - i'm the last motherfucker you'll ever see
