Everyday - my dreams slip away - i wont go out without a fight 
everyday - my life is taken from me - i wont go out without a fight 
treat me as the bastard - life is cold - i'm so lost 
these days drag on and on - minutes to years - years that i've lost 
bastard - bastard 
bastard - the life you gave - is the life that you took 
bastard - the life you gave - is the life no one deserves 
bastard - bastard
