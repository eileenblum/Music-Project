I've been down before - so i chose to drink it away
used to wake up and pour it down - hurt the ones i love - everyday
today's a new day - a fresh start for me - now i look through sober eyes 
at the life i've made - love almost threw away
not gonna lose this time - gotta think straight
fight for whats mine - too many times - i've chosen the wrong path
stumbled my life through - over and over again
i've seen the look of pain - on your face
i hope it never comes back - found love - in my best friend
you stood by through it all - until the end a true friend
always by my side - by my side - by my side - been down before
over and over again - stumbled my life through
i'm stronger now that i have you
