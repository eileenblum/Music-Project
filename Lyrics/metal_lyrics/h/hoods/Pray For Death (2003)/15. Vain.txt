it's only the beginning.  they're weighing down on us.  we gotta take them out together, once and for all.  no one is here to fight for you.  we gotta do this ourselves.  stand hard and true.  no one.  always feels sickness.  always hears lies.  no one.  listens to our cries.  my feelings of relief are still vain.
