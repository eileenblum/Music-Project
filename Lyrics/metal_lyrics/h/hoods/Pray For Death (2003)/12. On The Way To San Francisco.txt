I don't want to die but i feel that this is it 
stomach in knots - twenty pounds less - a weekend of hell - six months depression 
lose in a love sick - world of pain - i cry cause you're gone - 
i'm dying in pain - in pain my love for you is forever - 
i promise this sick world i'll never forget 
i wrote you this note - i put this razor into my skin 
the tub overflows - i awaken in pain - i choke on my own blood - i hear the phone right 
back to reality - pat and i are off to the city 
drunk for six months straight - i'm drowning myself in alcohol - and pain 
depression magnifies times ten - the blood in my veins - is starting to run thin 
i don't want to die - i feel that this is it - my face is in my hands 
i don't want to die - i feel that this is it - my face is in my hangs 
again i slit my wrists - i want to watch you kill yourself
