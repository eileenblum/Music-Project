Drama makes me step everyday it gets worse - my stomach twists in fear 
when the shit starts to turn - a friend pulls a knife - and starts to attack 
i'd take their life - if i could get you back 
i'll fight you fucking all - myself i would kill - i hate this bastard life 
enemy of this world - i search for relief - there's no place to hide 
tired of being depressed - i hope you all fucking die 
i search for relief there's no place to hide 
tired of being depressed i hope you all fucking die 
drama makes me step everyday it gets worse - my stomach twists in fear 
when the shit starts to turn - days hin hades - you all hope for the best 
so much to give - too much of a test - i feel myself fold 
under the weight of this hell - still hope for the best - i still hope for this world 
search for relief - there's no place to hide 
tired of being depressed - i hope you all fucking die
