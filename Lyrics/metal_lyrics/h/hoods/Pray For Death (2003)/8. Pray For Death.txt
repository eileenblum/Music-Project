From day one - it's been a test for the best 
a road straight down - prayers at my bed 
time and time again - waiting to see our fall 
you cant kill what's dead undead inside myself - 
learned my lessons well no god can tame this beast - 
your heaven's inside my hell - no god died for me undead - inside myself 
his love - i've thrown away now no god - can drink from me 
it's time to pay for your sins - drink from me 
pray for your sins - pray for your sins his time to pay the price - 
for what you've put us through children slain everyday - 
true sickness was born in you - no god would drink from me
