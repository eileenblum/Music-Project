All these years of sincerity lost? 
No we want them back. 
Destroy- destroy you all. 
I'll be ready when your fake ass falls. 
You're nothing, fashion rules your life. 
You're nothing, nothing at all. 
No heart, no mind, I give you no respect. 
No heart, you're nothing in my mind. 
No heart, no mind, you're true? 
We'll see in time, this time. 

All those years of sincerity lost, tell me why? 
Your fashion means nothing, not this time. 
All those years of sincerity lost, tell me why? 
Your fashion means nothing, not this time. 

What happened to your heart? 
So much we had before, fashion rulse your life, and not your heart. 
All those years sincerity. 
Well I still have mine 
As for you- I'll tear you apart
