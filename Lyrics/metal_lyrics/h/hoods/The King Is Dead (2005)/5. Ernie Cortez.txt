The day you died, was the day I cried. 
All alone on that hill with all of my friends by my side. 
That's the fucking world and the way that it works. 
Everything I loved, eight feet in the dirt. 
I've been here before, and I'll be here again. 
God took you away and I buried my friend. 
My heart feels empty and my blood runs cold. 
Your life came to a halt, and you slipped in the ground. 

When you entered the ground, ink filled tears fell down. 
And I hope you're in a better place. 
My bother, this beers for you. 
When you entered the ground hardcore blues all around. 
And I hope you're in a better place. 
My brother, our tears for you. 

The day you died, was the day I cried. 
All alone on that hill with all of my friends by my side. 
That's the fucking world and the way that it works. 
Everything I loved, eight feet in the dirt. 
I've been here before, and I'll be here again. 
God took you away and I buried my friend. 
My heart feels empty and my blood runs cold. 
Your life came to a halt, and you slipped in the ground
