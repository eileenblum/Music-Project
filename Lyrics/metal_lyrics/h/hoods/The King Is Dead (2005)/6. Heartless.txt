It's so sad- another loved one dies. 
Stand strong- I know inside you cry. 
Families mourn- as two gods fight for a soul. 
Nothing- is what it seems 
Never thought today you would wake up 
Just to have to say goodbye- I hate goodbyes. 
One day- you'll smile again. 
For awhile- gotta fight through some pain. 
So take a deep breath- I'm here for you my friend. 
Unlike a god that's heartless. 
You god is heartless. 
I feel your loss- taking over on me. 
Trade my life for your pain- in a heartbeat. 
Fatherless son- a childless father. 
The next life lost is yours- mother fucker. 
Heartless- you're heartless. 
HEARTLESS- A GOD THAT'S HEARTLESS
