(No one in this world can you trust. 
Not men, not women, not beasts. 
..this you can trust.)

I've given up everything for what? 
You never cared. 
My hatred filled me to the top- I can't take this. 
Conversations get bad- Mother fuckers get stabbed- 
Get the point? 
Don't think I've lost touch with who I am. 

You question me, now who the fuck are you? 
Don't cross the line with me. 
I'll get you blindside, until you die. 
I won't let it ride. 
Now combined hatred with pride- I'm taking your fucking life- your fucking life. 

I've chosen one to many times. In my life to swallow my pride- with my hate. 
It's finally time to give back some hate. 

I've given up everything for what? 
You never cared. 
My hatred filled me to the top- I can't take this. 
Conversations get bad- Mother fuckers get stabbed- 
Get the point? 
Don't think I've lost touch with who I am
