I've lost hope 
your broken words- all you have to be proud of. 
Never gave a fuck about anyone. 
Never a matter of love. 
To look you in the face is to know your games the same. 
You haven't changed. 

Which way do you run from here? 
Cannot hide from your back stabbing life-your back stabbing life. 
You've burned too many bridges again- you've burned me again. 
And now knowing non ones got your back, 
gotta hurt more than life itself. 

So may the bridges you burn- light your way- they fade. 
Deeper and deeper, dig your own hole. 
There is no heart- can't bury a soul. 
Alone at last- your back's against the wall. 
I'm here for you to help you fucking fall. 
Which way do you run from here?
