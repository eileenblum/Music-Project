You thought that you would break us 
you'll never beat us down, as long as blood runs through these veins. 
you'll never wear the crown. 

I'm sorry that I hate you- I tried and tried again. 
But everytime we take you back, you fuck us once again. 

All the times we've suffered, years and years of pain 
A contract we gave, with our blood, the wolf leads in the sheep. 

LIAR- a liar and a fucking thief. 
I'm sorry that I hate you- I tried and tried again. 
But everytime we take you back, you fuck us once again. 
The king is fucking dead, and he lays there in the street. 
No one left to fuck, you're dead you fucking thief. 
You're dead, you fucking thief. 

All we ever wanted, was a fighting chance. 
The years and the love we gave you a band that you forgot. 
We will keep on fighting your greed can't wear us thin. 
Our success is all you have to show a man who has no friends. 
You have no friends
