Pushed for the last time I can see no point all I see is Lies 
Convenience keeps me here I trust no one- trust no one. 

Watch it all fall- watch it fall apart- your creation has failed 
Still see the sheep follow blind? 
Give them lies with no direction at all- give them lies. 
This time I'll fight I'll give everything because I want you all to die. 
You can have it all. 
I'm already out. 
Fuck all yours games. 
It's all over. 
It's the end of days- the end of days. 

I'll take myself out with a blast. 
I want to kill you all, slit your wrists. 
I'll kill this world I feel I'm already dead. Locked in this cell. 
Locked in a cell with no escape. 
I want to watch you all die. 
If I could reach inside it would be the last time I'd ever cry- cry
