You're in love with a fucking whore- memories follow you everywhere you go / in bars and cars, on sidewalks, streets, and stores

When I see you down I think of her because I know this shit kills you inside / and the next time I see that fucking bitch I'm gonna pull a fucking knife / maybe I'll use the one she stuck in your back / I'll kill that fucking bitch while she fucks all your friends / ram this shit so deep in her back she'll never fucking breathe again

You never loved me it was just my turn I tried so hard / now it's another lesson learned / my heart is heavy and I'm swimming with bricks / when I fight I think of you then I pray for death
