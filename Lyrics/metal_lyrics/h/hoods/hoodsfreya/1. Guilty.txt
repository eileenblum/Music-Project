My anger is burning my eyes see red / a casualty of a repressed life / the judgement is passed and I'll never be free / the hammer slams down the judge yells "GUILTY"

The bastards have spoke and my future is set / a place of cold bars is where I've been sent / the judgement passed down and I'll never be free / the hammer slams down the judge yells "GUILTY"

Sometimes the innocent slip through the cracks / overlooked shunned upon and given a sentence / that doesn't reflect the life, the verdict, the times

Sometimes the innocent slip through the cracks / overlooked shunned upon and given a sentence / that doesn't reflect the life, the verdict, the times

Sometimes the innocent slip through the cracks / overlooked shunned upon and given a sentence / that doesn't reflect the life, the verdict, the times

My anger is burning my eyes see red / a casualty of a repressed life / the judgement is passed and I'll never be free / the hammer slams down the judge yells "GUILTY"
