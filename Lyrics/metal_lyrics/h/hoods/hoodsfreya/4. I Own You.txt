In this time of hatred - I chose loneliness
and this pain I feel inside - makes me want to kill you
I OWN YOU - I OWN YOU - I OWN YOU - I OWN YOU
the pain you've given me - all these years of torture - years of abuse
I can't think straight - I just want to kill you
all the pain you've given me - the years of torture - years of abuse
and when you see me coming - I've got something for you
I want to watch you die - I want to watch you die
I OWN YOU - I OWN YOU - I OWN YOU - I OWN YOU
