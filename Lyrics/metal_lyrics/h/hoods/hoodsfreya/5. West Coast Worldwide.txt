This is not a band this is a movement

A lot of years have passed many kids have come and gone / all these years and memories the / best times of our lives / "and we're still here"

Every time I open these doors all the shit in my life I seem to forget / because this means everything to me and my friends / I won't forget the struggle and the music that molded me / the flame that burns inside is stronger than ever / "we're stronger than ever" / more than half my life I've dedicated myself to the scene / I didn't choose this music the movement chose me

A lot of years have passed many kids have come and gone / all these years and memories the best times of our lives / "and we're still here"

Every time I open these doors all the shit in my life I seem to forget / because this means everything to me and my friends

April 20th, 1999 the day we opened our doors was a page written in hardcore history / westcoast worldwide sacramento california this is a time we'll fucking remember forever

WE'RE STILL HERE
