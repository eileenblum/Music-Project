Here for the fashion not for the show- I'm gonna beat you, stab you, kill you / here for the fashion not for the show- I'm gonna beat you, stab you, kill you / here for the fashion not for the show- I'm gonna beat you, stab you, kill you / here for the fashion not for the show- I'm gonna beat you, stab you, kill you

All these years and we're still here / the life I love the scene I love / I wouldn't trade the world for my fucking scene

Found the money and you lost your way / the only reason you're here is because you get paid / each and every day I wake this is what I breathe

Everything we gave you was fucking true you never gave a fuck about us / you shit on us and the kids who believed in you we all know you're a / fucking thief / your time is up motherfucker- FUCK YOU

It's time to fucking beat you / an empire built by the kids who believed / it's time to fucking bash you / traded your conviction for your fucking greed- greed
