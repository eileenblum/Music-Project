Screaming at the top of my lungs 
No one hears and no one cares! 
Your eyes are shut - your mind is shut 
Logic fades with every breath 
See the masses they follow the crave 
They're eating out of your hand 
This whole scene is fake 
There's nothing left to grasp! 

You ask me how i'm doing 
I guess everything's all right 
Oh by the way did i tell you? 
This is the last time i'll ever fight 
For your cause, for your just, for anything 
You're just using me - I nursed you back to health 
Only for you to deceive! 

I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! 
The whole world is on my back 
The only trophy I have in this life 
Is the callouses on my hands! 

Use your fucking head! 
Or lose your fucking head! 

I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! 
The whole world is on my back 
The only trophy I have in this life 
Is the callouses on my hands!
