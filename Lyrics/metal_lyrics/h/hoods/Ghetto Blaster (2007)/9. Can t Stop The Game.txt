Can't stop the game! 

I can't stand the way people act these days 
To me you're all fake! 
Throw up my hands and pray - you're gonna judge me? 
That's your mistake! 

You always told me to choose the wrong or the right 
There is no wrong or right in your motherfucking eyes 
Gotta do what i gotta do to provide for my family 
Can only do this the only way i know how 
It seems you turned your back on me? FUCK YOU! 

CAN'T STOP THE GAME! 
CAN'T STOP THE GAME!
