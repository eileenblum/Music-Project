I came to you with all my problems 
And all i got was a script to repeat 
I didn't come this far to surrender 
I'm content standing on my own feet 

Oh yeah! I got my own two feet! 
Keep telling me to give up my will 
Conquer the weakness cuz the weak get killed 
I've got my problems but not with my vision 
Laying down and giving up just isn't for me 

No way! it's not for me 
I've got my heart and my fire 
And no power is higher 
I came to you when i was in trouble 
Fed me bullshit and i felt used 
There's no excuses now I know myself 
I don't need you to trust in myself 

"SURRENDER IS NOT AN OPTION" 

No matter how much you tell It's hopeless 
You've gotta keep fighting thats the only way 
I came to you with a whole lot of problems 
Fed me bullshit made me feel used 
No excuses now I've got a clue 
I don't need your meetings and I don't believe in you!
