Tired of being sick inside 
From the drugs and the liquor i drank last night 
Morning is a daze in bed i lay 
As soon as night breaks i'll do it again 
And i'm sorry i can't think straight 
Give me anything to numb this pain that i feel inside - just want to die! 

Wake up cold i shake in bed 
This is the last time i'll ever do that again 
Wait a minute I said that before 
As i lose control i fall on the floor 
Another night - numbness and pain 
Here we go - as i lose it again FUCK! 

UNTIL I BREAK! 
UNTIL I BREAK! 
UNTIL I BREAK! 

UNTIL I BREAK! 
UNTIL I BREAK! 
UNTIL I BREAK!
