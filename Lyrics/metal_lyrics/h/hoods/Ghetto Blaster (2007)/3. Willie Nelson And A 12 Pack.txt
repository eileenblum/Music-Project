Pack your shit get in the van 
The road is ours tonight 
Like a band of gypsies we'll roll down the highway 
Willie Nelson sure was right 

Many many places and many many faces 
Still so far to go 
Shooting guns and playing pool 
Beer, bud, chicks and booze 
Take your job - stick it up your ass it's not for me 
The road is my life, my love 
It's where I need to be 
57 cities down - another 100 to go 
Been here my whole life - I really have nothing to lose 

Crack a beer turn the radio up 
"On the road again" we all yell 
We all think we're in heaven 
The rest of y'all livin' in hell! 
Take your job stick it up your ass it's not for me 
The road is my life, my love 
It's where i need to be 
57 cities down - another 100 to go! 
Been out here my whole life 
I really have nothing to lose - nothing to lose! 
LOSE! LOSE! LOSE!
