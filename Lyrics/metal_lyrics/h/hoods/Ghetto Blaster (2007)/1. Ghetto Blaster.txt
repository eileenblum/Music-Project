Look into your eyes 
I see right through it's all lies 
Revenge is all i seek 
You'll never walk aside 
All your tricks and all your games 
Are coming to an end 
I'll do this to your weak 

MY GOD IS PAIN 

As I walk through the valley of death 
I fear no one because everyone's dead 
I chose this knife, it's all i need by my side 
MY GOD IS PAIN 

This earth is hell - submit to the pain 
Salvation at the end of a knife 
Your fucking god lied to you, you're all alone 
Submit to the rest follow the pack and give in - Bastards! 
The bastards cause is self destruct - all alone 
Will you die on your feet? 

Look into your eyes - I see right through 
It's all lies - revenge is all i seek 
MY GOD IS PAIN - MY GOD IS PAIN 

As i walk through the valley of death 
I fear no one because everyone's dead 
I trust this knife - it's all i need by my side 
MY GOD IS PAIN - MY GOD IS PAIN
