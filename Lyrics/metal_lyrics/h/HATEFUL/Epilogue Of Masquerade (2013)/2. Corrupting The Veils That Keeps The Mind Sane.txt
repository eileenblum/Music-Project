Transforming what is most sacred in the world
Into an exaggerated hurricane of possession
Dripping matter into the jaws of hell
White as die light of an exploding star
Before its atoms disperse into the dark

The catharsis imposes bleeding
Devours gestures, leaves fossilized tracks
Of its passage into this world
Through sin, clandestine creation
Indiscriminate cloning of a corrupt self
That accepts no orders

Let the void fill with pain

The senses sharpen, the mind excretes miasmas
That slide off the skin and assail
The canvas of common perception
A veil of Maya, corroded and penetrated
This is my recurring dream
Beyond which unsounded depths open before me

From their darkness they emanated glowing rays
Burnt out with sunrise
But I don't doubt their supremacy
My bloody traces, my means to reach them
