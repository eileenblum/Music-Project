Why this feeling of vertigo?
A brief distraction and this struggle
Would be vain
Darkness has one thousand eyes

Look at my face, distorted by the need to exist
In this ever-changing ephemeral form
Conceived to survive
The sempiternal vortex
In which loathsome organisms feed on flesh

Not a drop of blood will be wasted

Nourishing the instinct
Of this carnivorous mass
Food for evolved thoughts
Condemning themselves perpetually
Until their facades crumble
At the first vital breath

Centuries of coherence through destruction
An abysmal archetype is crawling inside me

It keeps the beauty subdued

Scattering her remains along the main road

An omen for the brave
The prison of flesh
