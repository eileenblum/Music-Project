Smoldering hatred internally
A wolf in sheep's clothing

Remaining motionless
Hanging between clouds and ash
Harmony is only a chimera

Slumbering sequences
Are yearning for awakening
How many lives will they restore?

Swept into currents, march of revenants
Smoldering hatred internally

The glance of the predator
Enlightened by God's shine
In torment consumed

A pitch black fluid melts nerves
Once geometrically linked
By aeons of obedience
And boils over, destroying the embankments
Built to save the last glimmers of sanity

Nurturing erosion
Brandishing flags by others embroidered

The blasphemous force has been vanquished
Enslaved through caresses and simpers

Ready to kill at command

Organized hordes of deformity
Emerging from beneath
Claws, spines, teeth
Polished by velvet gloves
Ivory for unattainable towers
