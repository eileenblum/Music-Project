An unheard sound
Buried by the blanket that covers the mind
Perpetually iterated gestures mislead the flock
While the air becomes unbearable
Proclaiming its earthly descent

Like the fist of a vengeful God
Drawing itself on the heart
And limbs of millions

Divine breath, angelic fervor
Subliming a matter given up for perished

To the Earth arteries it excavates
Dark blood spurts in the wind as if freed

Breathing the whirlwind

A new dawn rips the silence
And a liquid glow
Enlightens the tarnished faces

It doesn't distinguish lie from truth

Only strength legitimates its deeds
Endless lines before it wait for its vanquish
Delivered from the prison of flesh
Vaporized in the purple sky
