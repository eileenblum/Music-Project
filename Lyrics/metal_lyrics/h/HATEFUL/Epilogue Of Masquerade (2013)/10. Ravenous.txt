Walking into the jaws of the future
Devour the flesh, annihilate this heretic will
Eternal suffering for he who defies
The atrocious abyss

Transformed into a shadow of himself
Drawing near to entities
Materialized by his black miasmas

Worn-out from within
The soul expands its evil humours
Like a ravenous abscess

Lord of atrocities
Perpetuates his dynasty
Through the dust of time

His blackened arteries
Branched out through the parched soil
Enthroned

The privilege of sharing suffering
The projection of my damnation
On your unknowing minds
With blades forged in my image &amp; likeness
I will engrave a path through your hearts
