A flock of stars follow its inexorable advance
While the Earth is screaming in terror
Stunned eyes witness its might
As it evaporates sentiments

Beat uninterrupted
Tension without release
Ceaseless friction razing oracles down
Dreaded by men, Gods, universes
Ten thousand harpoons in its snow-white trail

All in vain

Roaring amongst joy and fear
Ancient dogmas dissolved in atoms
Their purulent roots dried up and blown away
Their shapes forever denied

No war strategy can bridle its fury
Nor pleas for mercy restrain its march
When its breath moves mountains
And an inscrutable night
Encircles your tired limbs

Bow down
Heart in hands
