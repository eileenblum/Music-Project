A blood-red line
Breaks through the dusty blanket
Spreading amidst the astonished masses

Its schizoid rush knows no impediments

Piercing the heart
Infecting the most hidden recesses
Inhuman, it accepts no rules

A tyrant sleep wearing down

Light swallowed
Hate assimilated
Reason rejected

Through these biting roads
Sowed with hooks
Another disciple bleeds

Its flesh hideously torn
But the line keeps moving forward

In its whirling twitch
A main road has been found
Chiseled in the flesh, unidirectional

Destination unknown
Its reaching will demand victims
