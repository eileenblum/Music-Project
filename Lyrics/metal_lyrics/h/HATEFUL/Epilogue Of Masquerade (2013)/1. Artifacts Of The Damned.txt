Drops from the eyes like liquid fire
Lying down, partially absorbed, on these inert walls

Salvation through ominous light idolatry
The blackened blood flows into turbulent oceans

Over the short sighted glance
Of your deflagration
Ages of infinity before me
My pilgrimage through the valley of shadows

Artifacted sons of fierce arrangements
Never satiated, never defeated

It's useless to fight against them
The overwhelming strain
Of the soul against the flesh
Makes them shine, makes symmetries out of
Chaos they emerged from
Vomited on the storm

This dreadful crawling lubricated
The machinery of conscience
I sought beyond the veil of perdition
Tearing this somber canvas, plunging myself
Into the crimson sea
Gushed out by itself

Lymph of a misconceived existence
Rebirth through tyranny
