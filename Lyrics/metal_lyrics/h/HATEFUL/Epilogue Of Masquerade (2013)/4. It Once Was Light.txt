It once was light
Caresses resting on the tired limbs
Now everything becomes heavy
Ooze sticks to the skin
And leaches inside
Violation
Inhalation of entity

Where is the sensation of magnificent vertigo
Of terrifying euphoria?

The vault falls down on me like a shroud
Its brightness gives way to a fetid mist
Which feeds off my flesh
Contagion falls from its accursed breath
Who am I to gel lost on my way home?
To feel myself already dead?
What have I done?

I feel blood drip from my hands
The valley of the shadow welcomes me
With its viscous terrain, familiar
Fertilized by the decomposition of my spirit

While the march weighs me down
While each pain goes dead

No friendly sleep can find me
In this limp obscurity

Suffocate...
