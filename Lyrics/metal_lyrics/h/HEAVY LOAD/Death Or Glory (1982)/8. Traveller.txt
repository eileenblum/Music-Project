I've always been a traveller
Seeking a better life
Will ever my dream be closer than today
Will ever my dream be closer than today
I guess I'll find an answer, yes, a way

Alright

I looked for joy in the colden night
I looked for joy everywhere
I looked for joy in the morning light
I looked for joy in despair

I've travelled from coast to coast
All I could find was pain
I'm seeking for my dream
Yes, my life
Will ever my dream be closer than today
I know that there's an answer, yes, a way

Oh yeah

I looked for joy in the colden night
I looked for joy everywhere
I looked for joy in the morning light
I looked for joy in despair

I've been alone too long
Now I've found a way
Never my dream has been closer than today
Never my dream has been closer than today
Now there's an answer, yes, a way

I looked for joy in the colden night
I looked for joy everywhere
I looked for joy in the morning light
I looked for joy in despair
