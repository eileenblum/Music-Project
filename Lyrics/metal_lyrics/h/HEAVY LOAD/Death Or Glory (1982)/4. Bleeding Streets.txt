The night is black, I'm ready to attack
Vengeance is boiling inside my soul
Haven't forgotten, my brain is getting rotten
So I kill them all before I lose control

Down the subway they can't get away
I know all dealers, no one I'll save
Out to the night into the neon light
I'm in for the kill out on the...

Bleeding streets
Bleeding streets

Revenge of a living dead
Vengeance is boiling inside my head
Revenge of a living dead
Revenge of a living dead

I've made up my mind, the plan's in my head
Revenge of a living dead
I'm one of the living dead

A junky I am, don't even look like a man
I'm a living dead, got nothing to lose
My death is slow but I can't say no
Victim of the big bad city

Bleeding streets
Bleeding streets

My life's been a mess but I didn't sell death
Those who did I killed for free
All over this town blood is floating all around
My knife's done right everyone must see

I'm on my last trip, life is losing its grip
I leave this letter where I die
I've done a good thing, it makes my soul sing
I made the streets bleed

Bleeding streets
Bleeding streets
