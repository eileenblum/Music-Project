Skyless night
Promising happiness
Moonlight right
Can't stand for less
There's a star
Joy, it's telling me
Crystal light so far
Too far, I can't see

Clouds are passing
Making it worse
Light you're not lasting
I can't do but curse
Too long I've stayed here
Bestow me in my search of light
Alone, alone with my fear
Bestow me in the night

The moon is gone away
Now it's past
Light, can I ever say
It'll last
The clouds are mine
The light is you
Dawn is you

The nights are cold
As the water below
'Til the sun is to be
But still, still I can't see

Life has been a fight
An endless wood
Dark as the night
I can't feel good
Will this be over
Can I see the sun
Stop being a rover
But still I run
Now there's no time
It's past
See the rime
Darkness will last
I was a cloud
You were dawn
I'm crying

The nights are cold
As the water below
'Til the sun is to be
But still, still I can't see
