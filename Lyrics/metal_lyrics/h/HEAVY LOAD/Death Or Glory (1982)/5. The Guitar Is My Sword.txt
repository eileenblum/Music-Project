I was born in pain
In the everlasting rain
I stood alone in the night
No one to hold me tight

Oh, the times were bad
Nothing I had
For what I thought was right
I had to fight

The guitar is my sword, I'll fight 'til I die
Rock 'n' roll is my lord 'til the very last sigh

Nothing is for free
And nothing is for me
It's victory or death
'Til the last breath

Life, I love you and one day you won't be
Life, I love you and one day you won't be

In the light of the moon
In the night very soon
You can see me strike
I pick up my mike

It's evil and death
It's victory or death
I've seen a dove
For peace and for love

The guitar is my sword, I'll fight 'til I die
Rock 'n' roll is my lord 'til the very last sigh
