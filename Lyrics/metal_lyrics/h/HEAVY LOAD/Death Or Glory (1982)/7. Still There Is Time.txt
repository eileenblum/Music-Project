They say it's all for nothing
'Cause there'll be a disaster
Caused by war or pollution
Soon we're all gonna die

Let's go for that star
I know it's not very far

Still there is time
Time for life
Still there is time
Time for you and I

Man has polluted the air, I say
Man that is we all together
It's for your own wellfare, they say
We kill ourselves to live

Let's go for that star
I know it's not very far

Still there is time
Time for life
Still there is time
Time for you and I
