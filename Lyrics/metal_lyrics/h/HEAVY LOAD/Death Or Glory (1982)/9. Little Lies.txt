Can't believe the lies I hear
Can't believe it's true
Can't believe the lies I hear
When they're coming from you

I could have sworn
My life had been torn
I was a dreamer
How could I be so blind
Those lies you made me swallow
I swallowed every single one

I should have known
You played me a fool
I had the feeling
I sensed it in my soul
And in the end I saw you
I saw you telling me those lies

Your little lies made me wise
Your little lies made me wise
Your little lies made me wise

I could have sworn
I'd heard that before
Those little lies
Won't hurt me anymore
Yes, in the end I made it
I made it clear to everyone

Your little lies made me wise
Your little lies made me wise
Your little lies made me wise
