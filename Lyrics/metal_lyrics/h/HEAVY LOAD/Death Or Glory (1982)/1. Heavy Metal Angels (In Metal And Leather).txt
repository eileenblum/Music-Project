Driving down the highway now
The speed is high, just like lightning
They have the wind in their hair
The light of sunshine in their eyes

They're always there, every night
Standing up in the front
They look so fine in metal and leather
Heavy metal is their life

Heavy metal angels, metal and leather
Heavy metal angels
Heavy metal angels, metal and leather
Heavy metal angels, metal and leather

They come to see the show each night
Oh, the music takes you away
I'm for you and you're for me
We look so fine in metal and leather

Like angels of the dark
You come to the show each night
You know I need you now
Need you 'cause you are the light

Like angels of the dark
Inhaling me with darken eyes
Making me paralysed
I'm burning, burning inside

We have the power, oh, of thunder
We can change the world together
There's an aim for joy and glory
It's not far to reach the sky
