It might be wrong for all I know
But something in the air tells me no
I'm feeling strong, my senses know
That something in the air can't be wrong

I've waited so long for this day to come true

I've been so low, ready to go
But something made me stay on the show
I've turned the page, I felt the rage
Now nothing's gonna hold me away

I've waited so long for this day to come true

I have found something new in my heart
I have found something new in my heart

Now lights will shine, I know they're mine
The siege of a dream has come true
I've found the way, I'm gonna stay
And something in the air surely paid

I've waited so long for this day to come true
