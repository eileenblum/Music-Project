They came from far beyond
Across the sea of evil
From a land so strange
Defying the powers of the dark sea
Heathens from the north
Coming to take it all
Burning up your godforsaken church
Raving the country coast to coast
Raping all your daughters
Torturing your sons for the pleasure
Heathens from the north
Coming to take it all
When everything is done
No treasures left behind
They'll leave an exhausted land
Sweeping away in their ships of dragon
Heathens from the north
Coming to take it all
