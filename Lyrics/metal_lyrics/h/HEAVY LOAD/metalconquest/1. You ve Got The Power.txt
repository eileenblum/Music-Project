Give away with action
Give away tonight
Come along with thunder
Come along and fight
You can do it your way
You can do your act
Come along with thunder
You're getting, you're getting
You're getting away
You've got the power
You can do what ever you want
You're getting higher
Doing everything you've want
You've got the power
You can make your dream come true
You're getting higher
When your dream is coming true
Open up your eyes now
Open up your mind
Yes, you have the power
You're flying, you're flying
You're flying away
You've got the power
You can do what ever you want
You're getting higher
Doing everything you've want
You've got the power
You can make your dream come true
You're getting higher
When your dream is coming true
What it takes you have, yeah
It's all in you
Don't you see the power
You can sail away
Other peoples power
Might be easy to see
But you have your own
You've got to, you've got to
You've got to try
You've got the power
You can do what ever you want
You're getting higher
Doing everything you've want
You've got the power
You can make your dream come true
You're getting higher
When your dream is coming true
