We are living in a hard time
Full of concrete, glass and steel
Maybe that's why we like rock'n'roll
It makes you feel like an iron wheel
We are the heavy metal warriors
Our music is hard, tough and rough

Stand up - get up
For heavy metal heaven tonight
Waiting for the band to come in
Waiting in the darkness for the light
We are roaring for thunder and lightning
Roaring for metal in all its might
We are the heavy metal warriors
We need flashing guitars, hammering drums

Stand up - get up
For heavy metal heaven tonight
When the show is over
We are back in the street, going home in the rain
I come home, put on the record
Got to listen to that music again
We are the heavy metal warriors
Been a soldier since sixtyseven and I'm in heaven
When I...
Stand up - get up
For heavy metal heaven tonight
