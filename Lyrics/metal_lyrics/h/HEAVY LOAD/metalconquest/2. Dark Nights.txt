Long time since we left it all
Walking down separate ways
Lots of time left for thinking
'Bout those things we used to do
Ain't much to complain about
Something's there on my mind
Feeling lonely in the evenings
I can hardly turn out the light
Dark nights are painful
Dark nights for me
No way to adjust my mind
Trying hard every day
But when I'm home in the evenings
I feel the pain, I'm lonely again
Dark nights are painful
Dark nights for me
Long time since we left it all
Baby, we've gone too far
I need you here in the evenings
Before I go out of my mind
Dark nights are painful
Dark nights for me
