I don't want you to think I'm lying
Please don't tell me to walk away
Well, I don't want you to give me trouble
I've got plenty of heading my way
Hey
Please understand
I'll never land
I'm crying
You despise me for being ugly
'Cause I'm different you walk away
Well, I can tell you that I've got something
I've got trouble that's killing my soul
Hey
Please understand
I'll never land
I'm crying
Oh, I need you to keep me breathing
Please don't leave me to fight alone
Well, I could use some of that sweet loving
'Cause I need something that'll keep me alive
Hey
Please understand
I'll never land
I'm crying
