Late at night I take off my clothes
I'm running through the door
That never was close,
Civilization is miles away
The wind is quiet
It's got nothing to say
The wind is old, I'm feeling cold
And still I'm on the run
In the city people are laughing
Having so much fun
But oh no, oh no
I'm a long way from home
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Still I'm alone
I'm running through centuries
I'm running through the cold night
My legs are bleeding
And the stars are looking down on me
The night is dark
And it's getting difficult to see
Freedom, freedom
That's what I'm longing for
Freedom, freedom
I do want to be free
Civilization is miles away
And I'm a long way from home
Still I'm running
And still I'm alone.
I'm running through centuries
I'm running through the cold night.
