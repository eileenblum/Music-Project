By the old brook you came along
You made me write this song
Just audible the word
The whispering breeze made heard
This beautiful little song
Just silently oh love came along
Very violently
Oh Caroline please give me some time
Please, please be mine
Oh Caroline please come to me girl
And I'll give you all the love I have for you
Your hair is soft I have to touch it
Your walking is so incentive
It makes me want you
Caroline come into my life
Give me what you have to give
Caroline you've got to come to me girl
So I can love, give you all my feelings...
Caroline please come to me girl
So I can love, give you all my feelings...
By the old brook you came along
Yes you made me write this song
This beautiful little song
Just silently oh love came along
Very violently
