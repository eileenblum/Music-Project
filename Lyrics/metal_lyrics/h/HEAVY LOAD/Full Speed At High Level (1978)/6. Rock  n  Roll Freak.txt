I'm dreaming, I'm feeling
I'm turning loose tonight
My sorrow is hanging in a gray sky
That I will paint blue and white
If anybody tries to knock me down
I will fight in the neon light,
I'm rocking steady
Roll me over
I'm rocking steady
Even when I'm older
I'm rocking steady
Cause I'm a rock' n' roll soldier
I'm rocking steady allright...
I'll be a rock' n' roll freak
Till the day I die
I'll be a rock' n' roll freak
Till the day I die
My hair is growing longer
I think I'm getting stronger
I know what I want to be
Everybody used to sit on top of me
I fought and now I'm free
They called me a rock' n' roll loser
Now, I know that I'm me
I'm rocking steady
Roll me over...
I wonder if I will live tomorrow
I wonder if I will live today
Without my rock' n' roll
I can't stand another day
But I'm a rock' n' roller
And he better watch out
He who stands in my way
I'm rocking steady
Roll me over...
