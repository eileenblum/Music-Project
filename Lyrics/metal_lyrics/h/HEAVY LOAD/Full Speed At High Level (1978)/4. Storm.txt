There's a storm coming after you
Breathing in your face
With all the strange causes,
Trying to change your mind
When you can feel the gentle breeze
Whisper in your ear
Then you can be sure, yeah
There's that it will enclose you
There's a storm coming after you
Breathing in your face
With all the strange causes,
Trying to change your mind
Some of you will run your ass off
Trying to get away
Some of you will see the happy days
That was in your dream
There's a storm coming after you
Breathing in your face
With all the strange causes,
Trying to change your mind
It got in odder far away
It learned how to breathe far away
It will break you
It will fake you
It will change you
It will try to don't you understand,
You might say,
What is this feeling all confused
And you might say that you need her
To get rich and happy
She's so strong! She's so cold!
Feel the coldness when you breathe
She's so young and yet she's old
Know what is and what shall be
There's a storm coming after you
Breathing in your face
With all the strange causes,
Trying to change your mind,
Now when you know that she's coming
What are you going to do
Yeah you know that she'll get you perhaps
Not until you're dead.
