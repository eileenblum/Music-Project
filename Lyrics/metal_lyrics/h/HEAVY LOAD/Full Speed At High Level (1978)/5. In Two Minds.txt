You're so kind good and nice
Believing that you are wise
To heaven you'll come, yes you believe
But you're the one that you deceive
You're trying so hard to do what's right
You follow the Bible, yes you can't fight
You're a coward so you read what to do
No you can't even count to two
Oh I am a seducer
Disguised in your dream
You'll think that you're a loser
Disguised in a dream
You think you're happy, glad and nice
Disguising the evil with all your dreams
I assure you one day it'll rise
Destroying your dreams yes so it seems
Why are you trying when you know it's no use?
You just read no you can't choose
I'm sure there's only one way
At the end before
Beelzebub you'll lay
Oh I am a seducer
Disguised in your dream
You'll think that you're a loser
Disguised in a dream
You fight so hard to reach your heaven
Nevertheless you'll end in hell...
It's no use, I'm the one
Son of the devil, yes I'm his son
Born to destroy all your dreams
Undress your mind feel it know
You'll feel helpless all alone
Lost in a world naked and lost
You'll stumble between sorrow and death
Hoping you'll die before your last breath
You fight so hard to reach your heaven
Nevertheless you'll end in hell...
Now when you know that you're evil
You're dirty as mud you ain't clean
You know you're evil now you can change
Use your brain now even though it's strange
Yes you can try from me turn
But you're not strong enough in hell you'll burn
Oh I am you now
So you can't get away
But there's a chance if you fight
Go to heaven yes you may
You fight so hard to reach your heaven
Nevertheless you'll end in hell...
