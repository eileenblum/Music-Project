When midnight comes you've better
Watch out for the crawler
Or else he will take your life
Did you think you could keep it for ever
When the moon hide behind the clouds
And the night is as dark as his soul
Ah, he'll catch you...
Don't you remember the times
When the night was safe
And the sun and the rain
Blessed your soul
Don't you remember...
Don't you remember...
You've got to remember,
When he whispers out your name
From the outside of your window
You will tell yourself
That it only was the wind
And that I know, yes I know
You're only fooling yourself
Cause I know, oh I know
That death is only a breath away...
You've better look at the sun
And the nature for the last time
Cause it won't take long
Till you never see again
The midnight crawler
Is after you
He'll reach out to catch you
Ah, he'll catch you...
