Here I am it's all for you
I worked in blood and sweat for you
My body ached I felt bad,
I don't regret, now I'm glad
I'm playing my guitar
To make you see I'm a star
So why don't you get on the floor
Yeah and shout for more
Shout for, full speed at high level
Yeah, full speed...
It took me some years
To get that rock' n' roll
I had to pay in tears
But now I play the rock' n' roll
I hope I can make you see
See my rock' n' roll
Please don't let it be
Here's my rock' n' roll
I hope you feel engaged
It's for you to make you high
I do hope you can see me
Hear the rock' n' roll feel happy too
I do hope you understand me
Join me and shout,
Shout for, full speed at high level
Yeah, full speed...
Oh, I think I hear you
Singing along too
It's what I've been working for
To make you pleased, shout for more
It took me some years
And I had to pay in tears
So get up on the floor
Yeah and shout for more,
Shout for, full speed at high level,
Yeah, full speed...
