He has all the power
Of darkness and night
Making you believe
That evil's all right
There's a fire in his eyes
He can make you burn
From the dead
He'll make you return
Sell your soul for gold
Do as you are told
Run with the devil
Don't come to me
Run with the devil
You can take me
Filling you with dreams
Promising the moon
Making you believe
You'll get there very soon
Offering you a life
Of glory and gold
It's really in you
To hell I know you're sold
Sell your soul for gold
Do as you are told
Run with the devil
Don't come to me
Run with the devil
You can take me
Take him to your heart
And you'll lose your soul
It's tearing you apart
Taking all control
Dreaming of a lie
All you get is fear
Agony and pain
Your end is very near
Sell your soul for gold
Do as you are told
Run with the devil
Don't come to me
Run with the devil
You can take me
