Life is good for me and you
What you want you can do
It's so fine all the time
It's so good 'cause it's mine
Everyday something great
Yesterday wasn't too late
I know that life is in my hand
I try so hard for my own land
Free, I can take the fight
We, we can make it right
I've never felt this strong before
It's my dream, it gives me more
It shows me the way like the moonlight
Shows the way in the night
Free, I can take the fight
We, we can make it right
When it's hard, I feel pain
Moving on through the rain
It's only bad for a while
Very soon I'm gonna smile
'Cause I know it's so fine
It's so good, 'cause it's mine
Life is good, it's for you
What you want you can do
Free, I can take the fight
We, we can make it right
