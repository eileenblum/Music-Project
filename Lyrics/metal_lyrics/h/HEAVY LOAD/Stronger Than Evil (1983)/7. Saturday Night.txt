I just flew in
My aim is clear
I'm gonna show them
No one in town is gonna miss the fact
It's been OK
All through the day
I feel like smiling
There doesn't seem to be a cloud in sight
No wonder why
I'm feeling high
The stage is set
The time is right
Let's get it going
There's gonna be a heavy show tonight
My heart will beat
Just like the drum
I hear behind me
I want to show you all a real good act
No wonder why
I'm feeling high
Another Saturday night when it all feels right
I'm gonna give it to you any way you want
Another Saturday night when it all feels right
Tonight
Get off your bums
Let's have some fun
I want to hear you
Let's make the noise that takes us to the top
We've got the night
Let's make it right
I want to feel it
That magic feeling in the air tonight
No wonder why
I'm feeling high
Another Saturday night when it all feels right
I'm gonna give it to you any way you want
Another Saturday night when it all feels right
Tonight
The sound is right
The crowd's a gas
We're really moving
I think we're gonna blow the lid tonight
And if we do
It's 'cause of you
You made it happen
I wanna thank you all for showing up
No wonder why
I'm feeling high
Another Saturday night when it all feels right
I'm gonna give it to you any way you want
Another Saturday night when it all feels right
Tonight
