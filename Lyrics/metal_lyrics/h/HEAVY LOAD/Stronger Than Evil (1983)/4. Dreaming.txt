I've had the strangest feelings in my time
Trying so hard to make out what's in my line
Many times I've been crying all alone
Been afraid of my own life, is it my own
Dreaming of a better life
Dreaming of a life that's mine
When my time is over it has past
Who will be crying on my grave, what will last
Taking bad time for the good all the way
I have to live 'cause life is mine today
Dreaming of a better life
Dreaming of a life that's mine
I'm loving life in spite of all the pain
I have to live 'cause my time is just today
Feeling that life is running out of time
I know it's taking from me what is mine
Dreaming of a better life
Dreaming of a life that's mine
