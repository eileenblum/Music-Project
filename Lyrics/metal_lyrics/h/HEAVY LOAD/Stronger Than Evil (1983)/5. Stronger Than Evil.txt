Being raised in peace
With freedom as a right
Taught to believe that good
Was stronger than evil
There was no need for arms
'Cause freedom was supreme
Having one law for all
Living in equilibrium
I am stronger than evil
I'm gonna change my world
They came down at night
With fire in their eyes
Killing and taking it all
Their gold and their lives
Night was light with fire
And dawn was dark with smoke
From the ashes I rose
Condemning them all
I am stronger than evil
I'm gonna change my world
In my fathers blood
At last I understood
That life is not for free
For freedom you must fight
I will claim my right
With arms in my hand
I'm gonna fight the world
In my power
I am stronger than evil
I'm gonna change my world
