The king he rose
He's on his toes
He's breaking down the order
His heart of stone
Sword of steel
He's changing all the world
His kingdom's proud
They're in a cloud
He'll save them all from evil
He'll raise his hand
Praise his land
His words are webbed in glory
The king is on his way
The king has come to stay
The king is on his way
There'll be no other way
The king will call
To one and all
The time has come to show him
Stand by his side
Until you die
Or you won't live tomorrow
The king is on his way
The king has come to stay
The king is on his way
There'll be no other way
He brings us war
'Cause he wants more
He turns us all to soldiers
So many died
Who knows why
Soon it will be over
The king will fall
With men and all
His time has come to leave us
His kingdom burns
Did we learn
That he'll be back tomorrow
