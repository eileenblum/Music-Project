In the night, this is very strange
I hear voices in the whispering rain
Not alone, I can feel they're here
From the past, way back, thousands of years
I can hear them calling
Calling across the borders of time
I can hear them calling
The heathen inside me waits for the sign
Lost and gone, no one's been recalled
Only kings live on for ever more
On the rocks stand our history
They wrote this for their offspring to see
I can hear them calling
Calling across the borders of time
I can hear them calling
The heathen inside me waits for the sign
Nothing last, all will fade and die
Will we ever find the reason why
I do hear from deep inside
Can't you hear the howling call of the wild
I can hear them calling
Calling across the borders of time
I can hear them calling
The heathen inside me waits for the sign
