Bleeding from a thousand sores
I drown in seas of blood
Lying here on the battlefield
I'm crawling in the mud
I'm a young boy fooled to follow
Fighting an old man's war
It made me to a killing machine
I loved the battleroar
For king and country
I'll ride the sky with Thor
For king and country
I'll rot here for ever more
Singing swords
See flashing blades in the night
Singing swords
Muscle, blood and steel, is this right?
Singing swords
Valhalla calls, I'm on my way
Played all the fun games of war
In the name of my king
Killing, ripping, raping
My sword does still ring
The battle is raging all around
As I lie here watching the sky
I see the story of my life
It all is flashing by
Singing swords
See flashing blades in the night
Singing swords
Muscle, blood and steel, is this right?
Singing swords
Valhalla calls, I'm on my way
Just because of circumstance
I'm fighting on this side
Could have been born in another land
But to our destiny's we're tied
All brothers fighting against each other
We fought to the last breath
Wonder if we will shake hands
Beyond the gates of death
Singing swords
See flashing blades in the night
Singing swords
Muscle, blood and steel, is this right?
Singing swords
Valhalla calls, I'm on my way
