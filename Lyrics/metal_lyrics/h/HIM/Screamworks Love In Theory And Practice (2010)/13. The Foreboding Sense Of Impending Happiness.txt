By your heart strings I'm hanging from a dream,
Gently swinging in the warm autumn breeze.

Come look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up, no more.

Tip toeing along a strand of your hair suspended between,
These thoughts and actions miles above reality.

Come look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.

Come look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.

Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.

[Background:]
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.
Look at the scars, smother a heart, opening up.

Opening up, opening up, opening up, opening up.
Look at the scars, You open me up, open me up.
Smother a heart, Opening up, opening up.
Look at the Scars, You open me up, opening up, open me up
