[Valo, Ville Hermanni]

Church bells toll
Thunder roars around me
Iâve been warned to prepare myself for the fall

Iâm armed to the teeth with tender pain
Of all yesterdays

Tears on tape
I will follow into your heart
Sketching rain from afar

Tears on tape
She surrenders, needle in arm
While we dance into the storm

Darkness falls
Settling the score with love for once and for all
Soaked in blood

I cry my farewells to the summer rain
Lonely and afraid

Tears on tape
I will follow into your heart
Sketching rain from afar

Tears on tape
She surrenders, needle in arm
While we dance into the storm

And for a moment thereâs no pain
For once thereâs no more pain in your eyes
But maybe a little love
Just enough to convince us to keep breathing on

Tears on tape
Tears on tape
I will follow into your heart

Tears on tape
Tears on tape
I will follow into your arms
