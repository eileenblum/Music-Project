[Valo, Ville Hermanni]

Trapped in autumn, buried 'neath the leaves
To the echo of the summer softly weeping
Sinking further in this sanguinary sea
Painting pain with pastels through her cemetery eyes

[Chorus:]
Into the night
We ride,
Scars wide open
Into the night (into the night),
You and I
Torn and broken
Bleed into the night

Blinded by the sun's brightest rays
Radiating from the sharpened razor blade (razor blades)
Side by side; darkness and light
Play their games so unafraid,
Their heart beats synchronized
(We're engulfed in fire)

[Chorus:]
Into the night
We ride,
Scars wide open
Into the night
You and I
Torn and broken
Bleed into the night and I'll meet you there

Waiting for the world to end
Oh, let it end again

[Chorus:]
Into the night
We ride,
Scars wide open
Into the night,
You and I
Torn and broken
Bleed into the night (into the night, into the night),
Arms wide open

Will you meet me there?
