I kissed the void and crawled straight into its heart
Disowning all I adore
I pray to hear again that serpent song
Wishing it would be over

When love starts to die
It begins with a kiss
Violently soothing and warm
When love starts to die
When love starts to die
So do I (so do I)
So do I
Thatâs right

My foot firmly in heartache's door
Still waiting for your call

When love starts to die
It begins with a kiss
Violently soothing and warm
When love starts to die
When love starts to die
So do I (so do I)

Ooh, ooh
Your words tickle like angel's wings clipped

When love starts to die
It begins with a kiss
Violently soothing and warm
When love starts to die
When love starts to die
So do I (so do I)
So I die
I die

When love starts to die
When love starts to die
So do I
