Forever and ever!

Shadows grow taller
And I'm sleeping on my scars
Lonely, I hold her
And crave for your warmth
(And her touch)

There's no love
No love will be enough for what I'm feeling
No love
No love will be the end of this dreaming of you

Hell is freezing over
And the light is long gone
And I wonder where you are

There's no love
No love will be enough for what I'm feeling
No love
No love will be the end of this dreaming of you

We're the stars in the drawing of the flame
Making love to the rain

There's no love
No love will be enough for what I'm feeling
No love
No love will be the end of this dreaming of you
This dreaming of you
Forever and ever
