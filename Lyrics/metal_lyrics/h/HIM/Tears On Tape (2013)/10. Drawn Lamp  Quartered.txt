We could be like all the others
With nowhere to go
Paint ourselves into a corner with hope
This could be the end of everything we're afraid of of a dream of one

[Chorus:]
Letâs hold these hearts for one another
Itâs worth all wounds, it must be
If Iâm drawn and quartered
Itâs only for you
Shall we hold that thought now and forever
In all shades of blue?

So why wonât you (why wonât you) been waiting for you (waiting for you)?
So why wonât you go on and run?

Every part of me wants to believe
Thereâs a darkness we need to feel
For the brightest light to be seen and felt inside
Only because of you

[Chorus:]
Letâs hold these hearts for one another
Itâs worth all wounds, it must be
If Iâm drawn and quartered
Itâs only for you
Shall we hold that thought now and forever
In all shades of blue?

So why wonât you (why wonât you) been watching to (waiting to)?
So why wonât you go on and run?

Why wonât you go on and run with them?
Run away, go on and run away
And Iâll stay yours
Drawn and quartered [3x]
For you

Itâs all I can do.

My baby, hold that thought now and forever in all shades of blue
Why wonât you?
Iâll wait for you
So why wonât you
Go on and run?
Why wonât you
Go on and run?
So why wonât you
Go on and run?
Go on and run away.

Hold these hearts for one another
Hold these thoughts now and forever
We'll be always
