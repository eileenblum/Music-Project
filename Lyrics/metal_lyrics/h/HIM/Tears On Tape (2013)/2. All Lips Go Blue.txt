Hear the silence sigh its song
Of moments of calm before the storm
My heart so violently beats along
Leaving me to want to end it all

I weep for the dream in a grave
The one that made all lips go blue, blue, blue

I read the words on torn down walls
Reminding me how much I love you

I weep for the dream in a grave
The one that made all lips go blue, blue, blue
I leave bleeding yet another day
The one that made all lips go blue, blue, blue
It's all for you
Blue, blue, blue
It's all for you

I weep for the dream in a grave
The one that made all lips go blue, blue, blue
I leave bleeding yet another day
The one that made all lips go blue, blue, blue
It's all for you
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
It's all for you
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
It's all for you

And the silence sighs its song.
