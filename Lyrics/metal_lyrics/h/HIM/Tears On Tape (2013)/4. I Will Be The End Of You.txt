Cold underneath the starry night
Breathing in everything but air
See as the fiery light dies in your eyes
Oh, you're leaving

Love's screaming,
"I will be the end of you."
And I'm pleading,
"Don't you stop, now."
Go on and tear me apart
Show me all you have got
And I will be so free

Hear the cries of the stormy skies
Letting go of all the tears held in
Waiting for that shadow to smile
And realize you're nowhere near me

Love's screaming,
"I will be the end of you."
And I'm pleading,
"Don't you stop, now."
Go on and tear me apart
Show me all you have got
And I will be (I will be) so free
From all that has been

Love's screaming,
"I will be the end of you."
And I'm pleading,
"Don't you stop, now."
Go on and tear me apart (tear me apart)
Show me all you have got (show me all you've got)
We will be so free
From all that has been
So free from all that we've seen
So free
