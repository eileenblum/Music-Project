So, after all that we have done
Are you feeling cold like the winter sun?
And have you thought about all the words that we left unsaid?
Don't be scared
(You shouldn't be)

Hearts at war drunk on dreams
Of all that's been lost,
Now let them bleed
Just let them...

Run away as far as you can
And hide behind all the promises
But I'll find you, 'cause you are a fire
And I'm the rain,
Don't be afraid
(It would be a shame)

Hearts at war drunk on dreams
Of all that's been lost,
Now let them bleed.
Hearts at war for thing called love
And there's no escaping
What we have brought upon ourselves again?

Hearts at war drunk on dreams
Of all that's been lost,
Now let them bleed
Hearts at war for thing called love
And there is no escaping
What we have brought upon ourselves again?

There's no way out, baby
We brought this upon ourselves again
