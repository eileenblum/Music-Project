As the light across the room flickers its dying song
Waiting for a reason to keep going on (on)
The sweetest wine has now turned bitter by these thoughts,
So I wander the dark of my own

I should've known all along
That love without tears
Is just a story told to keep us hanging on
In the cold all alone
Bathing in fear
I sing
Love without tears, love without tears

A ghost residing here,
A boy who canât let go
Won't take "No" for an answer
Crying his song

I should've known all along
That love without tears
Is just a story told to keep us hanging on
In the cold all alone
Bathing in fear
I sing
Love without tears, love without tears
Go on and prove me wrong

I should've known all along
That love without tears
Is just a story told to keep us hanging on
In the cold all alone
Bathing in fear
I sing
Love without tears, love without tears
Go on and prove me wrong
Love without tears, love without tears
Please let me be so wrong
