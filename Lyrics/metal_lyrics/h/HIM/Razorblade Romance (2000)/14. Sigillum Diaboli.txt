I can't see your sad face in your pitiful lies
Don't have the strength to carry your heavy load of life
I'm your Christ and i want you
I just woke up for hearse and you know it as well as I do

oh

I can't see through your eyes, bring your tears on me
I will leave the body for your shoulder you just have to killing
I'm your Christ and i want you
I just woke up for hearse and you know it as well as I do

Oh as well as I do
Oh as well as I do
Just as well as I do
Oh as well as I do
Oh as well as I do

So I'm your Christ and i want you
I just woke up for hearse and you know it as well as I do
So I'm your Christ and i want you
I just woke up for hearse and you know it as well as I do

Oh, so you've come from above
and you say you want to
and I kill myself for your love
I'm killing myself for you, yes you

I can't see your sad face in your pitiful lies
Don't have the strength to carry your heavy load of life
I'm your Christ and i want you
I just woke up for hearse and you know it as well as I do

Yes you do
Yes you do, my Darling
Yes you do..oh
Yes you do, oh my Love
