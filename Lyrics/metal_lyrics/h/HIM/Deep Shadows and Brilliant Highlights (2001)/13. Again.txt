[Limited Edition Christmas' Version Track]I see you turn your back on life again
And i see you're stumbling downwards once again

And I feel despair kissing our lips again
And I feel despair holding our hearts again

You hear me crying behind your back again
And you hear my heartbeat slowing down again

And I feel despair kissing our lips again
And I feel despair holding our hearts again
I feel despair kissing our lips again
And I feel despair holding our hearts again

Oh baby yes
I feel despair kissing our lips again
And I feel despair holding our hearts again
And I feel despair kissing our lips again
And I feel despair holding our hearts again

Despair holding our hearts again
That's right
Yeah
