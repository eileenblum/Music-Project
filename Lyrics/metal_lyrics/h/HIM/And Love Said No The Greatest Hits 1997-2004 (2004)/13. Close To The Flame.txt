The kiss sweetest
And touch so warm
The smile kindest
In this world so cold and strong

So close to the flame
Burning brightly
It won't fade away
And leave us lonely

The arms safest
And words all good
The faith deepest
In this world so cold and cruel

So close to the flame
Burning brightly
It won't fade away
And leave us lonely
