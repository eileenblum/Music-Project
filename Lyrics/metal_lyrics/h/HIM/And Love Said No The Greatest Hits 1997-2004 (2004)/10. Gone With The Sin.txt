I love your skin oh so white
I love your touch cold as ice
And I love every single tear you cry
I just love the way you're losing your life

Oh my baby, how beautiful you are
Oh my darling, completely torn apart
You're gone with the sin, my baby
And beautiful you are
You're gone with the sin, my darling

I adore the despair in your eyes
I worship your lips once red as wine
I crave for your scent sending shivers down my spine
I just love the way you're running out of life

Oh my baby, how beautiful you are
Oh my darling, completely torn apart
You're gone with the sin, my baby
And beautiful you are
You're gone with the sin, my darling
