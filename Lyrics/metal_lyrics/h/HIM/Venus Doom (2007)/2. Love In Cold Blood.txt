Serpentine love's thighs wrap around me in search for death
Drenched in blood the adored and beloved will give in to'

Love in cold blood.
Breathe me in sweet suffering.
Love in cold blood.

Love's feline eyes in darkness shine on her web
Demonised with divine insight we draw our last breath

Love in cold blood
Breathe me in sweet suffering
Love in cold blood
Put me out of my misery

Love in cold blood.
Breathe me in sweet suffering.
Love in cold blood.

Darling take me home to the castle made of skulls and bones
Sing me a song to remind me where I belong in your arms,
My love, in cold blood

[solo]

Love in cold blood
Breathe me in sweet suffering
Love in cold blood
Put me out of my misery

Love in cold blood.
Breathe me in sweet suffering.
Love in cold blood.

Darling take me home to the castle made of skulls and bones
Sing me a song to remind me where I belong in your arms,
My love, in cold blood
