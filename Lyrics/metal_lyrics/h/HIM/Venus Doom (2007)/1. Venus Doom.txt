Leave all behind now to watch her crawl
Through our dark gardens of insanity
Sheâll be the light to guide you back home
Just give her a kiss worth dying for
And open your arms

[Chorus:]
Watch me fall for you
My venus doom
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed
My venus doom
All dreams are of you
My venus doom

Grieve all your hearts out and sheâll writhe enthralled
In tragic ecstatic agony
And in her flames we will die some more
Just show me her life worth living for
And light up the dark

[Chorus]

Hold me inside your infernal offering
Touch me as I fall
Don't lose yourself in this suffering yet
Hold on

Watch me fall for you
My venus doom
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed

Watch me fall for you
My venus doom
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed
My venus doom
All tears are of you
My venus doom
