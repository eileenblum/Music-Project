It's poetry carved in flesh
This beautiful Hell of ours
To the deadliest sin we confess
(tears of joy fill our eyes)

We are safe where disfigured saints
Cry out their prophecies of doom

[Chorus:]
My heart's a graveyard, baby
And to evil we make love
On our passion's killing floor
In my arms you won't sleep safely
And of lust we are reborn
On our passion's killing floor

At the first kiss the seeds of hatred are sown
Back into darkness we flee (to tear our hearts out)

We are safe where all faiths fail
Alive inside of our tomb

[Chorus]

(oh, my heart's a graveyard, baby)
Oh, my heart's a graveyard, baby
On our passion's killing floor

(in my arms you won't sleep safely)
And to evil we make love
On our passion's killing floor

Forevermore
