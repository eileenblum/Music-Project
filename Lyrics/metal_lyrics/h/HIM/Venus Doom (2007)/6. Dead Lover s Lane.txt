Despair has a face and all these wounds remain unhealed
Bless to kill and enslave are all hearts around love's will
Thrilled to start all over again

Crawl down dead lover's lane,
The maze of memories stained
And sucks the blood right out of my heart

Scream out love's name in vain
Erase the pain again
And lose yourself alone in the dark
On dead lover's lane

Fear has a name written on unhallowed ground with dead leaves
Those words never fail to feed the hunger that dreams
Our needs beyond god's grasp

Crawl down dead lover's lane,
The maze of memories stained
And sucks the blood right out of my heart

Scream out love's name in vain
Erase the pain again
And lose yourself alone in the dark
On dead lover's lane

Crawl down dead lover's lane,
The maze of memories stained
And sucks the blood right out of my heart

Scream out love's name in vain
Erase the pain again
And lose yourself alone in the dark
On dead lover's lane

And suck the blood right of my heart
Right out of my heart
