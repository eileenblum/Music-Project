Can't you see he's the heartless, your pain is not love
He's taking it too far, don't you know it is wrong
You're the one for me lady, you're the one
If you'd only see in my heart, you'd know all is not lost...no

I'm waiting, I'm waiting, waiting, waiting

Your time is running out and you still haven't made up your mind
Can't you see he's the heartless, and that you're one of a kind ..ou

[Chorus]
He's the heartless... [6x]

You're the one for me lady, together we shall be 'till the end
And if the sun comes down when you're not around it will surely put me through hell
You're the one for me lady, together we shall be 'till the end
And if the sun comes down when you're not around it will surely put me through hell
Don't listen to the one with no heart he's tearing you apart
He won't ever let you go, do you know what that means
He's not the man of you're dreams if he's the one with no heart and he's tearing you apart

You can't see he's the heartless, your pain won't ever be love
It doesn't matter how hard you try, to you all is lost

I'm waiting, I'm waiting, waiting, waiting

You're pain isn't love

[Chorus]
He's the heartless... [6x]
