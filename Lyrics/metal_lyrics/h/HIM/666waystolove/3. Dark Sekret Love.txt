For a moment the world turns its back
And you let me come closer
Though the hearts were filled with fear
For this dark sekret love

Oh let the world turn its back
And please let me come closer
Though the hearts filled with fear
For this love

Our 666 has got a name
We burn in its flames again and again
For is it our dark sekret love

Set me as a seal upon thine heart,
As a seal upon thine arm,
For love is strong as death
And jealousy is cruel as the grave.
The coals thereof are coals of fire,
Which hath a most vehement flame.
I love you - I love you

For a moment the world turns its back
And you let me come closer
Though the hearts touched with joy

Our 666 has got a name
We burn in its flames again and again
For is it our dark sekret love
