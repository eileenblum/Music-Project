I can't see as I'm facing your pitiful lies
Don't have the strength to carry your heavy load of life
I'm your Christ and I want you
This world's not for us and you know it as well as I do

I can't see through your eyes, spill your tears on me
I will leave the body for your shoulder, you just have to killing
I'm your Christ and I want you
This world's not for us and you know it as well as I do

Oh as well as I do
Oh as well as I do
Just as well as I do
Oh as well as I do
Oh as well as I do

I'm your Christ and I want you
This world's not for us and you know it as well as I do
I'm your Christ and I want you
This world's not for us and you know it as well as I do

Oh, so you've come for more
And you say you want it all
And I kill myself for your love
I'm killing myself for you but you want more

I'm your Christ and you want more
