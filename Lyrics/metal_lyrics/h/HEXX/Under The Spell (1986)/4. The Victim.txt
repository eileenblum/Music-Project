What is life but a dream
Masquerading as kings and queens
Forbidden fruit within reach
The flesh is strong the mind is weak

Now at last the path is clear
Free of death, free of fear
Your fire's burning bright
You cast your spell into the night

I can see it in your eyes
Now I've got you hypnotised
You have lost all control
Now the real truth can be told

As the moon hangs in the sky
First you'll love and then you'll cry
Your fire's burning, burning bright
You are the Victim tonight
The Victim tonight

When I look into your eyes
I feel the pain
When I give you all my love
No doubt will remain
