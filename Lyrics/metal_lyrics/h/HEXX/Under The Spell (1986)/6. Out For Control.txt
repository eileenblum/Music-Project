Everyday is another war
Blazing outside your door
Will this madness ever end
To the death, to the death you must defend

Out, out for control
Leaders of earth are out for control

Thrashing the city, the city by night
Roaming the wastelands, ready to fight
Armored men with an iron jaw
Fighting to win is the nature of law

Out, out for control
The human race is out of control

Run for your lives
Duck for cover
Don't ever turn your back
you are under the attack
