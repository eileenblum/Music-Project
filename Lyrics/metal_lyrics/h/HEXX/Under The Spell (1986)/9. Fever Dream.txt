Darkest eyes hypnotise
The air smells of warning
With fiery light in the sky

Blackest night, evil eye
Many have fallen
To the strange ways of the night

Fever Dream
Fight in the Kingdom of Shadows
Fever Dream
Trapped in a nightmare
You can't wake up 'cause it's real

Torment and anger, waves of searing pain
Having to shut out the screams of the insane
All is denied to the wicked and the deranged.
