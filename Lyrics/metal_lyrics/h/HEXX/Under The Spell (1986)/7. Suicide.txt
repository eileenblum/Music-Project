This is for a friend I had,
They say he lost his mind.
He took his own life willingly,
Before it was his time.

Now he's gone
I sill see his face
Suicide
Had to get out of this place

What kind of horror
Fills this world with pain?
So much that our children
Would take their lives in vain?

Just 21, barely learned to live
Suicide
Nothing left to give.

I grieve now, not just for him
But for our wretched souls
We made this Hell we live in
And now it takes its toll

It's useless now to speculate
Suicide
Now it's just too late.
