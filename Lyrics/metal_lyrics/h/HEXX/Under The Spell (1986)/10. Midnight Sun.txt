A place full of pleasures
Much more than meets the eye.
Still, haunting emptiness,
So deep within me lies.

Evil minds are plotting
To take it all away
An ancient curse we live with,
There will be a price to pay.

Through the coldest nights,
The pounding rains
I hear the Sirens cry
It drives me insane.
One foot in the grave.
Are we free or enslaved?
A fight that can't be won
After you've seen
The Midnight Sun.
