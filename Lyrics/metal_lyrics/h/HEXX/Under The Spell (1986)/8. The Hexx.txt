Welcome to her castle
The tormenting will now begin
Allured with charm yet bewildered
Enticed by the beauty within

She put a Hexx on you

One look into her crystal ball
The past, the present revealed
Awaiting your fate, the future
Excruciating pain you feel

She put a Hexx on you

She cast a spell on you
One that will never go away
Your foolish fascination
Trapped in a spider's web forever
