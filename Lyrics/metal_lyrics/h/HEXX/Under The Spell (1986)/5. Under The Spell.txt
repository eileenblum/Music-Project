If your life is stalling and you are falling
You hear it calling beware
If you are waiting, anticipating
What lies in store for you there

Taking you on a journey
To a place of screaming laughter
You'll be lost in the end

Your mind is racing, almost tasting it
You are soon out of time
While you're learning your candle's burning
Ever deeper you climb

Taking you on a journey
To a place of screaming laughter
In the end you will find

Like a soul trapped in hell
You are Under the Spell.

Come closer my friend
Gaze into the ancient pages
Learn the secrets of the ages
You may have all you desire
But the weak of mind will burn
In fire
