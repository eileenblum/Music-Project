Taking the city
On an iron horse they ride
The evil is coming to take you away
When you hear the thunder
Exploding down the streets
You know it's time to run and hide

Close the gates
Don't you let 'em in
Hell Riders of Sin

Demons in leather
They're out to rule the world
On a stormy night they ride the wind
When lightening strikes
You know they're getting near
Step aside, look out they're coming in
