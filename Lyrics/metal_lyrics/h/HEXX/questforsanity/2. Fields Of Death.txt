No more of what we know
It's lost in a nuclear cloud
So many so hungry so mad
Painful death takes the crowd
Cry out but never heard
Machine is huge and loud

War machine
War machine
Grinding, smashing
You're falling in
War machine

No hope, all is lost
As bodies sink in the mud
Death's river is widening
Made of bone and blood
Years of building are swept away
By the deadly, rushing flood

War machine
War machine
Burning, melting
Frying you
War machine

Trapped in confusion
The children wondering why
Huddled in the trenches
no one hear them cry
War machine destroying all
Growing stronger, soon you die

My sickened mind is trained to kill
We were enemies before we were borned
Fight our fathers wars, we were taught to hate

Born as enemies
Inherited war
Meet who we are
Taught to hate
In fields of death

Strong nations fall to rubble
Soldiers starving, cold, alone
Wind of death advancing
Radiation burns your flesh and bone
Stupidity feeding fire
Mans' heart made of stone
