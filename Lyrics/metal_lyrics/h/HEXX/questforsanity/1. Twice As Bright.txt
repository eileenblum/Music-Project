Living on the razor's edge
Speed demon inside my head
He's racing round and round
Look at the fool he's found
Exceed to excess
I just can't take the stress
Another mortal sin
Speeding to the end

Tonight we'll all fly high
We're not afraid to die
Too many broken dreams
Listen, hear the screams
One day fades to the next
Face the odds, place your bets
Observe the synthetic spark
That dares to brave the dark

Twice as bright, half as long

How many sleepless days have passed
On deadly fuel my engines blast
My mind and flesh are rotting slow
Insane thoughts; anger grow
Each day we press closer to death
The next could be our last breath
We just want to sing our song
Before this fucking world is gone

Twice as bright, half as long.
