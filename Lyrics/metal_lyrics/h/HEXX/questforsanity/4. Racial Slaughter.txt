Senseless slaughter blood soaked memory
Numbing patrons of Hell
blind faith segregated by hate
Tortured beyond recognition
School yards with barwire fences
Incomassing all who oppose
To admit to the truth or accept the lie
To be shown all the ways you can die

Festering rodents crawl through the bodies
Left in the compond to rot
The stench of the carnage is a constant reminder
Of the suckening evil at large

Prayers for a savior
Are prayers gone unanswered
No end to the madness in sight

Condemned raise their voices
To the tormentors
To sing "Die gedanken sind frie"

The living are dying
The lucky are dead
Racial subtraction under a flag of
Black, white and red

Born at the wrong time
Born in the wrong place
Serving only to die

Not of the right blood
Not of the right race
Heartless monsters destroy

Thousand of lives
No mercy is shown
Hideous memories lie dormant

Like rats in a cage
No one to be saved
Echoes of screams from the grave
