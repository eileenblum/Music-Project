Welcome to the future
A mirror of the past
The flags and faces change
But the hatred always lasts
The weapons now more deadly
Pain and death take you fast

Man never learns from his mistakes
Destined again to follow lies to war
We heed not the warnings
But build the weapons to kill once more

Living in the dreams of dead men
Their ideas have gone astray
Twisted minds bend the truth
Wrong or right your life you'll pay
Fools follow liars to death
Armies fall and rot where they lay

The clouds of hate grow darker
Another storm grows near
Don't wonder why we don't care
We're born and raised in fear

History repeats itself, we're starting wars again
Pick up your gun, of to war, no one will ever win

Modern world screams in your face
The future so unsure
A violent past returning now
The circle incomplete
Peace trough violence, time to pay
The dues that may by late

Nostradamus warns of three Antichrists
Napoleon, Hitler, the third yet to show
Unseen fools in charge
Deals made we'll never know

Armies and nations playing games
Drawing lines, choosing sides
Who is your friend or foe
Don't let them decide
The world had been split forever
It makes no sense to divide

Old men decide our fate
We have no say in how the play
What should they care what they start
They will die soon anyway
History repeats itself, we're starting wars again
Pick up your gun, off to war, no one will ever win.

Computer warfare raging
Emotionless murder slaying
The foolish who persist
To build hates's existence

Lies attack your mined
Truth you'll never find
Politics of death
Rob you of your breath

Paid soldiers and machines
U.S. satellite lazerbeams
Science logic kills
General gets a thrill

Same as the past
Peace never lasts
Our last years
Living in fear

Politicans and their puppets
They will stretch the truth
Change the facts around
Knowingly lie to you

Our evil Uncle Scam
Has been reading gobbel's book
He knows the power or propaganda
So we must take a closer look

History repeats itself we're starting wars again
Pick up your gun off to war no one will ever win
