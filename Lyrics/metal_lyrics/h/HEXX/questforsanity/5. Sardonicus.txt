There was a night
Death grinned with delight
At the ghoulish deed of a fool
To an old grave
Where his father is lain
He sought a fortune untold
Fear turns to fright
A cold hellish sight
A sardonic smile ear to ear
Featured paralyzed a grimacing skull
His face is now grotesque
Scared from the sight of the decaying corpse
Once his father, profaned

All the mirrors have been removed
Empty frames hang around the room
No reflections to behold
A twisted mind, a restless soul
He learned to leave the dead alone

To search for a cure
The methods unsure
With blood sucking leaches he tested
On young peasant girls from the village below
He could not get results requested
A doctor was summoned
From beyond the valley
A master with needles and toxins
Upon his arrival he was to be greeted
With chains, shackles and irons
Demanding a potion to cure the affliction
The doctor was forced to comply

All the mirrors have been removed
Empty frames hang around the room
No reflections to behold
A twisted mind, a restless soul
He learned to leave the dead alone

Months of trial and error
Finally showed success
The mocking sardonic grin
Gone and won't be missed
Now with the doctor's task complete
His captor sets him free
Unwary of a side effect
No one could forsee
Jaws locked tight
Can't eat or drink
No more can he see
Left alone to his own
Self-inflicted doom.
