[Lyrics/Music: Clint Bower]

Growing tired of living this way
The meaning of life has faded away
Iâve seen the failure of gloryâs plans
Control of future is not in my hands

But I canât lose grip of the answers that l have found
Itâs just more confusing the more that I find

In a world that is dying a good attitude is hard
Wonder why I stick around to see things fall apart
So Iâm inviting Death to help me get away
One last step will kill the pain today

Standing on this building
Looking down at the ground
Searching through my mind
For answers that cannot lo be found

Peering out of this skull
Sick of what I see
Trapped, no escape
No hope of being free

Imprisoned in skin and muscle
Stretched over breakable bones
A hell so fragile can easily be destroyed

Dreaming with my eyes wide open
Floating in air, time is frozen
Am I falling, Iâve lost sensation
Death, please, come and take me away

There comes a time to leave but is this really the end
Or just smashing the shell that weâre trapped in
To somehow come back again
Look in the dead manâs eyes
He can tell if the spirit survives
Ask him whatâs to be
The secret kept he sleeps silently

Imprisoned in skin and muscle
Stretched over breakable bones
Did he escape?
Where did he escape to?

Dreaming with my eyes wide open
Floating in air, time is frozen
Am I falling, Iâve lost sensation
Death, please, come and take me away!

Look into my neighborâs eyes
All I see is fear and doubt
Paranoid, confused and lost
What was this all about?
See friendship fade to hate
Beauty and hope decay
Time to loose reality
Frustrating never-ending pain

Take that big step
Itâs your last step
Itâs time to fly
The only future is no future
Iâve canceled me
Take the big step
Itâs your last step
Itâs time to die

Take your last step!
