[Lyrics/Music: Clint Bower]

This is where the blood of the machines
Is pumped from the dust of ancient Babylon
Rocket bombs bring out the sun at night
The pig-nose men in death machines fill the sky

Malignant ulcers infest mankind
Rivers and fountains turn to blood
The sea is burning, the sky rains black
All ocean lifeâs is dead on the beach

Every island, every mountain
Removed from its place
The sun turns black, the moon is blood
Stars of heaven fall to earth

Send the planes off to war
Drop the bombs, settle the score
Lock and seal shelter doors
Red alert, weâre at war

When a shell hits a tank
The tank rings like a bell
The bell rings you will know
Four more are burning alive

Your tongue burns in your mouth
Before your body hits the ground
Your eyes bubble in your skull
Before your body hits the ground
Your skin peels from your flesh
Your screaming body hasnât hit the ground
No one left to bury the dead
Left behind by the nuclear cloud

This is where the blood of the machines
Is pumped from the dust of ancient Babylon
This is where you see the sun at night
And the half pig men do battle in the sky
This is where the brutal beast
Is heard to speak of the winds of fear

Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death
I will fear no evil

The Antichrist masses his armies driven by false religion
Holy angels walk among us to break the Seven Seals of Revelation
Seeds of destruction on winds of hatred came from halfway around the world
The fire mushrooms will grow here soon and nothing will grow here again
