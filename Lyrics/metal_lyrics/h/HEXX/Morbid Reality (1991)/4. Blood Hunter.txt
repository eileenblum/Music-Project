[Lyrics/Music: Dan Watson]

Pure evil, predator of man
Rancid bastard is stalking
The meek and innocent are easy prey

For the savage hunter to liquidate
Lonely creature, urgent hunger
Man-beast crazed with obsession
Shunned by the light, nocturnal flight
Ancient torment continuing

Corporate man
With blood on his hands
He donât give a fuck
Heâll take your last buck
Heâll smile as you cry
Heâll laugh as you die
Feast on your brain
Lifeâs down the drain
Heâs in your TV
He wants you and me
No mercy heâll show
As heâll watch you die slow

Random victim, assault obscure
Archaic ritual fulfilled
Puncturing flash with no remorse

Greedily claiming his prize
The thrill of hot bubbling blood
Sucked from a still living vein
The bleating whimper of a man dying
To feed what is no longer a man

The vapid body lay at his feet
His thirst is quenched for now
A lifeless shell discarded into hell

A damnation to be revisited
Tainted soul, demented and old
Transcending evil prevailing
Power, pain, vital fluid drained, cursed
It is death that sustains him

Corporate man
With blood on his hands
He donât give a fuck
Heâll take your last buck
Heâll smile as you cry
Heâll laugh as you die
Feast on your brain
Lifeâs down the drain
Heâs in your TV
He wants you and me
No mercy heâll show
As heâll watch you die slow
