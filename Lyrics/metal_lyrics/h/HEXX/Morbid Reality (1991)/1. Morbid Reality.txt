[Lyrics/Music: Dan Watson]

Paranoia rips through my head
Wonder what itâs like to be dead
Intense hatred all about
Left alone to figure it out

Truth and justice just a joke
Entire system just a hoax
Weakening with insecurity
No such thing as racial purity

Life and death become a game
Live or die itâs all the same
Lost my sense of morality
Got no place in reality

Got no point of reference
Got no religious preference
Must have really lost my mind
Time to leave this world behind

Heard too many lies
Afraid to close my eyes
Just donât know whatâs real
Whatâs the fucking deal?

Total darkness without a clue
Not much choice what can I do
Used to believe now I donât
Make a difference you know I wonât

Product of my environment
Wonât live to see retirement
Fight while Iâm still young and bold
Probably die before Iâm old

With my back against the wall
What to do canât take a fall
The heaviness is pressing down
Trying to force me to the ground

Canât give up must somehow win
Canât go through this hell again
Have to give it one more try
One more time before I die

Heard too many lies
Afraid to close my eyes
Just donât know whatâs real
Whatâs the fucking deal?

I canât believe what I see
Only my thoughts are free
Itâs morbid reality
