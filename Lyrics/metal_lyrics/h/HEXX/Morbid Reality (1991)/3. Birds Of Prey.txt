[Lyrics/Music: Clint Bower]

Moving along the assembly line of society
Becoming another piece of the machinery

You are expendable
The wars go on for years
You are replaceable
Just so many circuits and gears

Abomination of nature
Blasphemy of creation
The plagues now take their toll
Lessons in germ warfare
Cut out infected organs
Replace them with machinery

Our leaders are all playing God
Now we are running out of what weâve got
They need a soldier that never dies
In a future thatâs a little less civilized

Birds of prey fill the air
Sent to cleanse with rains of fire

In ivory towers with marble stairs
In front of TV walls sit billionaires
Live footage of the battles is always on the air

All those years spent going to school
Mind your manners, follow the rules
Donât you step out of line
Getting nowhere, running out of time

Round and round we go
Spinning on our solar star
Picking up the pace
Final evolution of the human race

See the glow of the burning cites
In the distant evening sky
Hear the fighting getting closer
Fulfill your program, kill all that is alive

The will to kill is your only memory
Whose brain is behind those eyes?

For your crimes against society
We have a new death penalty
Take out your identity
Replace your brain with control circuitry

Birds of prey fill the air
Sent to cleanse with rains of fire

Chemicals fall from a smoke-filled sky
Freezing your lungs, melting your eyes
Blistering your skin but youâll never die

It was then that I could see
All earth creatures will be extinct
Killed by the one with the mechanical brain
Killed by the beast called human being

Close the door and donât go back
There is no way Iâll go back that way
Lock the door, lose the key
Itâs not for you, not for me...

Donât go down that path again
There is nothing there for us, my friend
There is what is and what should never be...

Lies!
Hate!
Greed!
Birds of prey!
