Twisted faces, rising evil
Cold dark places, hypnotizing
Slicing slashing bone and flesh
Bleeding screaming sacrifice

Now I can feel, I'm losing my mind
The deeper I fall into madness
I hear the master, whisper to me
Leading me straight to the blackness

In this silence, pure frustration
Filled with violent, condemnation
Slicing slashing bone and flesh
Bleeding screaming sacrifice

Now I can feel, I'm losing my mind
The deeper I fall into madness
I hear the master, whisper to me
Leading me straight to the blackness

[Solo]

Apparitions, torture me
Blind sadistic, destiny
Slicing slashing bone and flesh
Bleeding screaming sacrifice

Now I can feel, I'm losing my mind
The deeper I fall into madness
I hear the master, whisper to me
Leading me straight to the blackness

[Solo]

Now I can feel, I'm losing my mind
The deeper I fall into madness
I hear the master, whisper to me
Leading me straight to the blackness
