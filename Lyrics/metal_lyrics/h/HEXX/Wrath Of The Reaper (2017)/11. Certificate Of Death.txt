You have expired, the coroner is here
The hears has arrived, to take you away
Now you're in your bag, with your toe tag
Down in the morgue, lying on the slab

Soon you'll get your certificate of death
Your final document from life
The last paper to be filled away
Your certificate of death

Your autopsy proves, that you're really dead
Embalming fluids, now fill your veins
Your lifeless corpse, is pale and cold
Your ghostly spirit, hovers above

Waiting for your certificate of death
Your final document from life
The last paper to be filled away
Your certificate of death

[Solo]

At rest in your coffin, at the funeral home
Family and friends, come to say good bye
The grave digger digs, a hole just for you
Now you will lay, down deep in your grave

With your certificate of death
Your final document from life
The last paper to be filled away

Your certificate of death, your certificate of death
Your final document from life
The last paper to be filled away
Your certificate of death
