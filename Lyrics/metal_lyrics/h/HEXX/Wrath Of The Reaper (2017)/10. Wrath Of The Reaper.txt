Wrath

It's the wrath, of the reaper
And he knows your name
Wrath, of the reaper
And he knows your game

Always breathing down my neck,
Everywhere I stand
But you ain't gonna get me yet,
You need a better plan
One step ahead of you,
It always ends the same
Cheat the reaper's what I do,
I live my life in pain

Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your name
Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your game
One step ahead of you,
It always ends the same
Nothing that you can do
When he swings his sacred blade

As he does his dance of death, hour glass in hand
He ain't gonna get me yet, 'til that final grain of sand
I cheat the reaper fro my life, I cheat him for my soul
Always riding to the left, 'til he drops his final stone

Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your name
Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your game
One step ahead of you,
It always ends the same
Nothing that you can do
When he swings his sacred blade

[Solo]

Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your name
Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your game

Death is hanging over you, and everything you do
Black cloak and a grinning skull
He's got a stone for you
Though he wants my head to roll,
I cheat him to the end
And when he gets his way,
To hell my soul he'll send

Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your name
Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your game
One step ahead of you,
It always ends the same
Nothing that you can do
When he swings his sacred blade

Wrath
