Protected soul, shoveled into a grave
A ghoulish reminder, of a challis made of bone
Oceans of time, corridors of eternity
Ritual spells, address the evil by name
A madhouse of pain, the body will burn
The soul moves down

A slave in hell, a slave in hell

A lifetime of sin, guided by the devil's hand
Prayers for the damned, to be redeemed
It's up to the righteous, and their hypocrisy
To fight the good fight, for you and me
A madhouse of pain, the body will burn
The soul moves down

A slave in hell, a slave in hell

[Solo]

Touched by evil, never to reach the sweet forever
Your torment is profound, writing in agony
With the poetry of reality, can't keep the faith alive
A madhouse of pain, the body will burn
The soul moves down

A slave in hell, a slave in hell
A slave in hell, a slave in hell
