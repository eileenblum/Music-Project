Starving marching for miles in the snow
Weakened from enduring the violence
Grave faces with deaths perspective
From the bottomless depths of corruption

Through the back roads and small towns
March one foot in front of other
Dragging along their skeletal bodies
This macabre procession of specters

Only a hand full of survivors
Knowing not where they are going
Tattered in rags, hunger in their eyes
Followed by a black cloud of flies

Through the back roads and small towns
March one foot in front of other
Dragging along their skeletal bodies
This macabre procession of specters

[Solo]

Shot and tossed into a grave
Or lead right into the Baltic Sea
Some survive only to die
By the deadly sting of machine gun fire

Through the back roads and small towns
March one foot in front of other
Dragging along their skeletal bodies
This macabre procession of specters

Through the back roads and small towns
March one foot in front of other
Dragging along their skeletal bodies
This macabre procession of specters
Of specters
