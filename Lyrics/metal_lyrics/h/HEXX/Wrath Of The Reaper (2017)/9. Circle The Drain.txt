Welcome to the freak show, you get a front row seat
To witness the end, of civilization
The grim decline, and rampant decay
All point the way, to our extinction

Now we circle the drain, down, down we all go
Now we circle the drain, all of our struggles in vain

The evil and hatred, that grows from religion
Gives the illusion, of infinite wisdom
We all pay, the penalty of living
While the ownership class, does all the taking

Now we circle the drain, down, down we all go
Now we circle the drain, all of our struggles in vain

The circles get smaller and smaller
The circles go faster and faster
The circles get smaller and smaller
The circles go faster and faster, faster

[Solo]

In the spiral vortex, we still cling to life
Swirling ever downward, to what waits below
With a ticket to the freak show,
You get a front row seat
To witness the end, our fatal climax

The circles get smaller and smaller
The circles go faster and faster
The circles get smaller and smaller
The circles go faster and faster, faster

Now we circle the drain, down, down we all go
Now we circle the drain, all of our struggles in vain
Now we circle the drain
All of our struggles in vain
