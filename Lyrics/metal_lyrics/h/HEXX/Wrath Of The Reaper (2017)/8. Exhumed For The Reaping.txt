Buried deep down in the ground,
Long ago forgotten sorrow
Smoldering, in the grave, nothing but a memory
In the past a promised future, stolen by too many lies
A chance for vengeance and redemption,
Stirs the rotting corpse to rise

No souls are saved, no prayers for the weeping
Arise from the grave, exhumed for the reaping

A new life is born, out of the ashes
Alive with a passion, passion to kill
Now the, sharpened, sickle will swing
To harvest the in corrupted remains

No souls are saved, no prayers for the weeping
Arise from the grave, exhumed for the reaping

[Solo]

From the unconsecrated, hole in the earth
Revived, restored, resurrected
To dredge up the hopes, and dreams of the dead
The whirlwind has come, to reap what was sown.

No souls are saved, no prayers for the weeping
Arise from the grave, exhumed for the reaping

And on the darkest night, that which was dead
Returned to the living once again,
To walk the earth in madness!

[Solo]

No souls are saved, no prayers for the weeping
Arise from the grave, exhumed for the reaping
No souls are saved, no prayers for the weeping
Arise from the grave, exhumed for the reaping
