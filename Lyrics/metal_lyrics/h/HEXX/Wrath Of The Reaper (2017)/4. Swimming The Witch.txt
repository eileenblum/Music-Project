Crusade against science
Angel eyes, filled with betrayal
A sacred dance, beneath the full moon
Confirms the evil, that walks among them
Release the harlot, from the stockade

Self-righteous fools
Blinded by fear and bonded by ignorance
Inflict the accused with their virtuous suffering
A trial by water determines their fate
As the black hearted spectators gather around

There will be fear in their eyes
While they're swimming the witch
Swimming the witch
Swimming the witch tonight

[Solo]

Naked and bound
Humiliated servant of Satan
Shall the water refuse to receive them
In the cold dark waters, repeated immersion
Never to see the surface, again

There will be fear in their eyes
While they're swimming the witch
Swimming the witch
Swimming the witch tonight
In the pale moonlight
