Voices, deep inside my mind
Reminds me of nightmares
I wish I could leave, behind
Fire, racing through my veins
I'm out of control, and burning a hole every day

I hear the voices calling me
They will never, ever, set me free

Take your chances, roll the dice
Live your life like, you're gonna live it twice
Just remember, this my friend
If you play with fire, you'll burn, in the end

Desire flowing through my veins
I'm losing control, it's burning a hole every day
Changes, rolling with the dice
There's got to be a way I can see the light

I hear the voices calling me
They will never, ever, set me free

Take your chances, roll the dice
Live your life like, you're gonna live it twice
Just remember, this my friend
If you play with fire,
You'll burn, in the end
Burn

[Solo]

Take your chances, roll the dice
Live your life like, you're gonna live it twice
Just remember, this my friend
If you play with fire, you'll burn, in the end

Burning in the end, burning
Burning in the end, burning
Burning in the end, burning
