Sinners fear the preacher
But the preachers gotta know
Miracles out of scripture
Are part of the show
Broken and divided
It's always the same
The faithful need a prophet
And the prophet needs someone to blame

Like the spirit, of a graveyard ghost
Whose dreams are all shadows and dust
Whose soul, still stirs in the breeze
All alone, in a dark void of evil

[Solo]

Turn a blind eye, when you understand
Angers more useful, than despair
Hell-fires burning, torch is ablaze
All alone, in a dark void of evil
Dark void of evil
