When the darkness falls over me
Changing perspectives and priorities
It takes away all new possibilities

It's not the way it should be
Stifled and drowning, in mediocrity
Scratching and clawing, your way to the end
Sometimes it's better, to break than to bend

I must have gone too far,
I've come unraveled again
It's just all too hard,
To look within, and not to look away

[Solo]

Some days are not like the rest
Some blur together, to make up the years
Soon you stop wondering why
Until you find, your life has passed you by

I couldn't help myself, I've come unraveled again
It's just all too hard,
To look within, and not to look away

[Solo]

It always starts out this way
Striving to stay in control
Give in to weakness and hide all the same
The dam has busted loose and I am to blame

I don't posses the strength,
I've come unraveled again
I've come all undone,
There's not the glue, to hold me in place

I must have gone too far,
I've come unraveled again
It's just all too hard,
To look within, and not to look away

Not to look away
Not to look away
Not to look away
Not to look away
Not to look away
Oh, not to look away
