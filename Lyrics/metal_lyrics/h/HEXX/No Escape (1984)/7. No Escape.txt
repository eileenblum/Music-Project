Picture a man in another timeâ¦
Sailing virgin seasâ¦
He dreams of home as he draws in lifeâ¦
From the cold dark seaâ¦

Then from behind an evil laughterâ¦
Destroys his magic sceneâ¦
To his dismay he turns to findâ¦
Demons rising from a dreamâ¦

Watch Outâ¦ Thereâs evil all around
Look Outâ¦ They long to bring you down

With no escape still he tries to fleeâ¦
Without a sound his world explodesâ¦
Plunged into battling nightmaresâ¦
From demonsâ abodesâ¦

Then with a start, as he awakensâ¦
He fails to hold a gaspâ¦
The beast is laughing, poor man is runningâ¦
Heâs got him at lastâ¦

Watch Outâ¦ Thereâs evil all around
Look Outâ¦ They long to bring you down
Watch Outâ¦ Your soul must not be bound

Watch Outâ¦

OH WATCH OUT!!!...
