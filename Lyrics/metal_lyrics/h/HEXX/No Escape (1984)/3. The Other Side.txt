(Alrightâ¦ Ooh, ooh, ooh, oohâ¦ Donât look backâ¦)

When all is confusion and the time comes around
And all the hassles seem to blot out the sound
A fading starlight shines not even a thought
Your lifeâs in danger and you feel so distraught

The walls are closing in on youâ¦
You must think of ways to escape, ohâ¦

And you know you must chooseâ¦ You donât want to die
Oh you fear the unknownâ¦ On the other side
(Come on)

Your eyes bleed water and your muscles grow tense
Youâre still in dangerâ¦ you got no defense
You can get out right now if your timing is right
Donât let these evils strip your soul, of all its sight

And you know you must chooseâ¦ you donât want to die
Yeah you fear the unknownâ¦ On the other side
(Donât run and hide)

You must think of ways to escape, oh

All hope is dying now you feel so alone
You feel the pressure crushing you like brittle stone
Donât let your future grow into your bitter past
Donât let your evils bane you, be free at last

Know you must chooseâ¦ you donât want to die
Yeah you fear the unknownâ¦ On the other side
(Alright)
