Ooohâ¦
Look to the sky
When you feel, thereâs something that youâve lost

Nowâ¦
Look all around
Donât you know, whatâs lost, can never be found

When all seems lostâ¦

Whatâ¦
What can be done
To hold back, the feelings, we show

Donât runâ¦
Youâre running from yourself
Donât you know, your problems canât be put upon a shelf

If thereâs something missing insideâ¦
You better findâ¦
Find it todayâ¦

Look deep insideâ¦
You may findâ¦
There is another way
You mustnât hide
You cannot go on
This wayâ¦

Ohâ¦
What can be done
To hold back, those feelings, we show
