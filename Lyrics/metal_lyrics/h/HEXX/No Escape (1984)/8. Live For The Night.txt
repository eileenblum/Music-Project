When you look into my eyes I ask what you see
Do you see my features changing drastically
Do you know what I can be, if I close my eyes

Masters of reality, blessed with all your might
Keepers of fatality, blessed with your insight
Do you know what I can be, if I choose to fight

Oh liveâ¦ Oh, Live for the night
Live i-i-i-iveâ¦ Live for the night (Alrightâ¦!!!)

All of us are children yet in numbers we have might
Smashing down on all of them who rule with fright
Do you know what we can be, in the black of night

Masters of reality, blessed with all your might
Keepers of fatality, blessed with your insight
Do you know what I can be, if I choose to fight

Oh liveâ¦ Oh, Live for the night
Live i-i-i-iveâ¦ Live for the night

Yeah liveâ¦ Live for the night
Live i-i-i-iveâ¦ Live for the night
Weâre gonna Liveâ¦ COME ON!!!!

Oh liveâ¦ Oh, Live for the night
Live i-i-i-iveâ¦ Live for the night

Yeah liveâ¦ Oh Liveâ¦ Come on
OH YEAH!!!
