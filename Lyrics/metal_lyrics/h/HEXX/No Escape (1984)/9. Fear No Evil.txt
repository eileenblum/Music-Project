If you find yourself, lost upon some darkened road
Will you, be afraid of the dark
And when your imagination, is giving you the indication
Thereâs something wrong, in the nightâ¦ ALRIGHT!!!

Ooh-oohâ¦ yeah, ah-ah-aahhh
Hhhmmmâ¦ youâre on your own

Well Iâm, driving through fog, and Iâm running through the night
Towards my place of comfort, but the window holds no light
Suppressing all the anger, thereâs nothing in my hand
I can feel your arms around me, but where is my promised land

Fear no evilâ¦ If you hear the wind cryâ¦
Fear no evilâ¦ As the ravens, begin to flyâ¦
Fear no evilâ¦ TONIGHT!!! (Yeah)
My destiny awaits me, I am blinded by its mist

Its clouding all the memories, of lonely spirits, I have kissed
Stranger in the night, magic lady, behold the light
Unholy dream, Iâm gonna crush you, with a scream

Oh-ohâ¦ oh-oh
Oh-ohâ¦ oh-ohâ¦ oh-oh-oh
Oh-ohâ¦ oh-oh
Oh-ohâ¦ oh-ohâ¦ oh-oh-oh
Oh-ohâ¦ oh-oh
Oh-ohâ¦ oh-ohâ¦ oh-oh-oh
Oh-ohâ¦ oh-oh
Oh-ohâ¦ oh-ohâ¦ oh-oh-ohâ¦ ooooohhhh

Fear no evilâ¦ If you hear the wind cryâ¦
Fear no evilâ¦ As the ravens, begin to flyâ¦
I fear no evilâ¦ TONIGHT!!!
