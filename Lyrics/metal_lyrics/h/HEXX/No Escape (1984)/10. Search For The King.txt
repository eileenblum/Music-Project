With sword in hand and shield at your side,
your bodyâs weak hot and dry
And you feel the blood, run down your faceâ¦

Your heart is hot, your steel is cold,
you must defend this land of old
Still you wonder, can it be savedâ¦
The moon is riding ever low,
the darkness reaching for your soul

And you must push onward, into the nightâ¦
Oh he went onâ¦ in search for the King
Will you spend your lifeâ¦ in search for the King

Love is a death trap, for all who stumble in
For a blind man, will still lose his wayâ¦

And now itâs fading into night,
but you are true hold back your fright
Still you must push onward or end your questâ¦

Oh he went onâ¦ in search for the King
Will you spend your lifeâ¦ in search for the King
Search for the Kingâ¦ oh in search for the King
And heâll never come back nowâ¦
Oh, in search for theâ¦ King
