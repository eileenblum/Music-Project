Gonna shoutâ¦
Gonna screamâ¦
Gonna cry out to all of the world
Gonna soarâ¦
Fly with my wings all unfurled
Gonna seeâ¦
What no other manâs ever seen
I watch over everything

If a light above shines down on you
Thereâs not much you can do
Invaderâ¦
I am invaderâ¦

Come with meâ¦
I will showâ¦
You places seen never before
Take a chanceâ¦
You never know what lies in store
Ride with meâ¦
Ecstasy, come on
I will take you, thereâs no need to run

If a light above shines down on you
Thereâs not much you can do
Invadeâ¦ oh
Invaderâ¦ Invaderâ¦ INVADER!!!

I will invadeâ¦ Ya, I will invadeâ¦
I will, I will, I will, I will invadeâ¦
Ohâ¦ Tell me that you do, if you really want me toâ¦
And I will invade youâ¦ Oh I will, I will, I willâ¦ ya
