On a cold and gloomy night
Out in the shadows after light
Gazing oâer a ledge
All the mystic forestâs edge

Youâre waiting there, without a care
As the night embraces you, you better bewareâ¦

You better hold on, you better hold on
You better take yourself awayâ¦ Beware the Darkness

The evils brooding far below
Arise within the night
Like dancers in the afterglow
They shed an awful light

Youâre waiting there, without a care
As the night embraces you, you better bewareâ¦

You better hold on, you better hold on
You better find a place to hideâ¦ Beware the Darkness
Beware the darkness, itâs falling behind you
You better find a place to hideâ¦ Beware the Darkness
BEWARE!!!!

You better hold on, you better hold on
You better find a place to runâ¦ Beware the Darkness
Beware the darkness, falling behind you
You better find a place to hideâ¦ Beware the Darkness

Beware the darkness, creeping behind you
If there is something you might screamâ¦
(But no one answers in a dream)
