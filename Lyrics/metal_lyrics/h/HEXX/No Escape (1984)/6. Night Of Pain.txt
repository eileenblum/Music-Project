(ooohâ¦ sheâs hot!!)
Last night I was feeling all alone
Resting my head on the telephone
Thinking how I could ease my head
Will things get better, or worse instead ?`

All nightâ¦ Night of pain
All nightâ¦ Blood is rushing through my vein
All nightâ¦ Night of pain
All nightâ¦ I will never be the same

Last night was hot, you should have been there
She put her lips to me everywhere
We were burning, all night long
The way she loved me, loved me so strong

All nightâ¦ Night of pain
All nightâ¦ Blood is rushing through my vein
All nightâ¦ Night of pain
All nightâ¦ I will never be the same

When I am down and out oh she is around
Ooh she touches me and my heart starts to pound
And all I have to do i stell her my needs
With a smile, sheâs happy top lease

Yeah, all nightâ¦ Night of pain
All nightâ¦ Blood is rushing through my vein
All nightâ¦ Night of pain
All nightâ¦ I will never be the same
All nightâ¦ Night of pain
All nightâ¦ Blood is rushing through my vein
All nightâ¦ Night of pain
All nightâ¦ I will never be the sameâ¦ NO!!!
