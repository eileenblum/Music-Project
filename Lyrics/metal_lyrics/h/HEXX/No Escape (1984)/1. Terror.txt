In the time of your nightmares, when demons and darkness control
You feel the anger, and fight till the night sky explodes
Giving no thought to the danger, the danger that lies up ahead
Crawling your way through the darkness,
and the Terror that lies in its stead

You know your time is waning, you feel it in the wind
For Terror now is reigning, itâs time to re-begin

Itâs time to goâ¦ oh-oh
Itâs time to goâ¦ oh
Itâs time to goâ¦ oh-oh
Itâs time to goâ¦ oh-oh

In the time of your nightmares, when demons and darkness control
You feel the anger, and fight till the night sky explodes
Giving no thought to the danger, the danger that lies up ahead
Crawling your way through the darkness,
and the Terror that lies in its stead

You know your time is waning, you feel it in the wind
For Terror now is reigning, itâs time to re-begin

You know your time is waning, you feel it in the wind
For Terror now is reigningâ¦ Itâs timeâ¦
Itâs timeâ¦ Itâs timeâ¦ Itâs timeâ¦ now!!!
