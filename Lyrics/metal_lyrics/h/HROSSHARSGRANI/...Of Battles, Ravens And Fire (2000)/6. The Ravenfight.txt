The final battle - and the final fight
With wounded bodys - and blooded swords
The mighty ravens - in the northern sky
For glory and victory - to Asgard they fly
Two ravens on his shoulders
And the wolfs by his side
On the golden bridge of Bifrost
The warriors they stand
The mighty ravens and all the brave
Survived the final fight
So Gjallerhorn will sound again
Back to Asgar we ride
Battles - Raven - Fire
