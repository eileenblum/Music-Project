Beware the dark ages...
When gods and man were fighting side by side,
When dragons spit fire and mighty ravens ruled the air.
In those long forgotten times glorious legends were told,
Of brave man and demons and the mighty steel they carried.
This is the story of men of war and their battles in Valhall!
