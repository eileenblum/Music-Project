I am Wrath

Submit yourself to spoken lies that one cannot resist
Dwelling in a fragile shroud that leads your thoughts adrift
Perpetuated rapture drove your urge to have me slain
Retaliation shall be done, revenge is mine to claim

I bring death

So frail youâre torn
I yearned for this moment to vanquish you all
Contented with your self-deceit
Your way to die was set
For justice shall lay down the traitors to rest

Prided on your own disgrace
Redemption you refused
Encompassed by a fatal truth
Escape was yours to choose
Befallen by this blinding taint
Your recreance brought me to my death
My will passed on to be avenged
For vengeance will be served at last

Haunt the traitors
Exert the right to wipe out all the lives attained by forcing my demise
Fearing that your righteous sickness would be first to die

Abandoned by your hollow lies
Relinquished to my wrath you fall
Suffering the truth you stalled
Shattering this fallacy for this is now your time to bleed

Commencing to blot out this specious disease
Relieving myself of beguilement unseen
Revenge wonât be denied

Trapped inside your false faÃ§ade
You perish as it breaks
Reprisal imposed
Bereaved of this deceit you die
For justice cannot be defied

So frail youâre torn
I yearned for this moment to vanquish you all
Contented with your self-deceit
Your way to die was set
For justice shall lay down the traitors to rest

My sacrifice that you condemned
A treachery you canât repent
Your shallow deeds have met their end
Your sheltered faith erased and quenched
A single life dispatched by fear avenged
