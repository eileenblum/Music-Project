Crossing over the edge of this spell
This is whatâs left to testify
Mental mirror reflecting conviction
Watch this struggle become undone

Confinement to this earthly shell
Fragile vessel to its cause

Devouring apathy raging inside
Emptiness stalking the steps of my mind
Only suffering left to betray
Bitter solution determined this way

Caught in this nightmare possessing this life
Perpetual silence is clutching me tight
Beneath this image I swallowed my fate
My ashen memories shall be scattered away

Restricted to a weaker self
Silence marks this constant fear

And soon this dream is gone

Soon it all starts fading, silence stains this trade
No need for regrets, life has slipped away
Unlock this chain of fear, ending drawing near
Let it fade away
