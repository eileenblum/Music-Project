Bring forth your sins, the sky above you smiles
They watch the blade, for death will end your lies

Your end will free all minds of your chains
This infection will cease to be
Your eyes are watching the red of the sky
For all you longed for has long been denied

You face the hate of the bloodthirsty mass
They seek revenge on those to blame

Among the shade you slowly await
The time when it all comes to pass

Onwards to your final moments
Tilt your head towards your back
Watch the heavens silent laughter
For heresy comes along with death

Mindless screaming fills the air
Drugged by fear of faith deprived
Despised by those you tried to save
Now all they want is your life
Their blindness has set the ending right
Your death is long past due
