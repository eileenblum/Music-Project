There is no God and Satan,
only an ancient evil who is inside us.
Will we be together
Like the snow on those beautiful mountains?
Our spirit was always together.

Dreams from another dimension
they are so weird all the time.
Im so cold my eyes are freezed.
You are the only in my sight, so
Keep me in your mind i won't be here forever.

Solitude
Hug me!
Emptiness
Caress me!
Coldness
Heat me up!

You won't see me anymore
when I'll become to ashes.
Darkness
cover my soul
Light
engaged.
Where I don't exist.

Together.
The Nothing and me
forever.
