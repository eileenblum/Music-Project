Darkened woods are bleeding everywhere.
Things are happening what only i see here.
Things went wrong, and they followed by even more.
Sorry, but I can't let you go.

Oh false gods why dont you go back,
go back to those human minds.  
Destroy them inside.

I can't explain myself,
why don't you go and fuck yourself?
No more reason to live, it's time to say goodbye.
Make a last favor you mother fucker whore.

Physically weak, sickness... ahhrhhh.

Tighten the rope and let me go to nowhere and say farewell.

Tighten the rope, i can't do it alone.
Tighten the rope because of madness
Tighten the rope one more time
Listen to the sound how would i die.
