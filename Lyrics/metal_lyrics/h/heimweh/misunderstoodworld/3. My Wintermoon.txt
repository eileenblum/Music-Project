I'm looking around in this dark land.
There is only a knife in my hand.
Groaning by pain, rotten by life
the only solution here is to die.

I'm pulling clos er the knife,
but my hand is touched by a beauty.
I lost my bride, and just cried. 
Wintermoon. (My Wintermoon)

Everything's lost,
it's easier to be like a ghost.
Falling snow, falling tears.
How nice is the winter.

I'm pulling closer the knife,
but my hand is touched by a beauty.
I lost my bride, and just cried. 
Wintermoon (My Wintermoon)

Arghhh... new meaning of life.
