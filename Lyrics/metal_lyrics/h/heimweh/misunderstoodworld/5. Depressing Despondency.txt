Look as an evil, walking in the forest,
the demon is full with hatred.
We are animals, not like humans.
Will we ever find the happiness?

The day is turning into night.
People are tortured by fight.
What was good, it has been forgotten long ago.
It's questionable what will bring by the future.

Emptiness...

This is the end...
