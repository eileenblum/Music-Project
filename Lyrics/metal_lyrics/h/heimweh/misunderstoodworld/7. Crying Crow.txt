Never, never want to be the same again.
Frustrated, false illusions everywhere.

Fucked up but don't know why.

Open your fucking eyes, you are nothing.
Nothing like the others who are made by false thoughts.

Crying crow is inside me once and for all.
Everywhere, everytime and someday i will die.

Negotiations with death.
