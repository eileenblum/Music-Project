Come with me let's start this journey.
You find yourself in the dark forest
when time and distance are forever.

I'm just a broken bough on a bottomless lake.
The wind blow me away and the sky is gray.
I see you as a star who are far away more and more.
Will the wind bring me to a better vision
or the nature unbuild me to find my place in eternity?
