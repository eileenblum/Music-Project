Chaos and constancy forever intertwined
Peace and adversity at war within the mind
Locked in a struggle, an illusion trapped in time
When worlds collide just enjoy the ride

Determination is just the beginning so there's no reason to stall
Your destination is on the horizon, it's time to answer the call
No consolation, it's all about winning, we gotta fight and stand tall

All systems are overloaded!
All weapons are locked &amp; loaded!

Fight that feelin'
Before it pulls you under
Has you reelin'
Already full of wonder
Twistin', turnin', whirlin'
Caught in the crosswinds... and left behind

No indication of end or beginning, there's no perception of right or wrong
A conflagration will end all your sinning, into the fire you'll fall

All systems are overloaded!
All weapons are locked &amp; loaded!

Fight that feelin'
Before it pulls you under
Has you reelin'
Already full of wonder
Twistin', turnin', whirlin'
Caught in the crosswinds... and left behind

All systems overloaded!
All weapons locked &amp; loaded!
All systems overloaded!
Caught up in the crosswinds!
