We've been the victim of all your lies
We peeled away at your disguise
Been persecuted behind these walls
Your reign is over, we rise, you fall

And still we ask the reason why
We know the victors always lie

Our fingertips caress your face
These hands of doom will seal your fate

And now you ask the reason why
You know the victors always lie

The truth will not survive
A billion bodies burned before our eyes
Ask yourselves again the reason you're alive
We live today, tomorrow never dies

Wonderful life, virtual paradise
Billions of bodies lay burning before our eyes
Blinded by ignorance, avarice spawns their lies

And now we ask the reason why
We know the victors always lie

The truth will not survive
A billion bodies burned before our eyes
Ask yourselves again the reason you're alive
We live today, tomorrow never dies
