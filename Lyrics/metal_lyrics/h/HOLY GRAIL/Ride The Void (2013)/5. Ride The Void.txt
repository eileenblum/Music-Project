When you look into the void do you see something there?
Nothing in your blackened heart has made you even care
All the hopes that you had always dreamed up in the night
Cultivated instantly before your very eyes

Wish I could slow down the river
Blow out the sky
But I still hold on to nothingness
Reach out yet no one's there
Hungry for nothing less
And I'll keep riding on through the void, riding through the void

Fortune falls upon your life
A gift which one should spare
Did you think your hopes and dreams would magically appear?

Wish I could slow down the river
Blow out the sky
But I still hold on to nothingness
Reach out yet no one's there
Hungry for nothing less
And I'll keep riding on through the void, riding through the void

Storming through darkness we ride
Blowing out the sky
In darkness we ride tonight

Hold out forever
And fight for your life

Slow down the river
Blow out the sky

Hold on to nothingness
Reach out yet no one's there
Hungry for nothing less
And I'll keep riding on through the void.

Ride the void
