What moves inside you?
Is it living, or is it dead?
These are the questions left unsaid
Who knows the answers?
Is it something I shouldâve sensed?
What is this feeling I possess?

Slipping into darkness, feel that cold, cloudy air
Hear the voices calling,
Screaming something else is there
But I donât know where

Harness the hatred
Through the ray of distant light
No more deception, no more lies!

Slipping into darkness, feel that cold, cloudy air
Hear the voices calling,
Screaming something else is there
Reaching for the huntress as she slithers through the night
Searching for the secret, to the labyrinth of my life
I gotta find a way, my mind begins to break
While things are changing shape
I gotta find a way
Iâve shattered all my faith
But whoâs to blame?

How long must I wait?
Frozen in pain?
I cannot sustain
Vengeance remains

I gotta find a way, my mind begins to break
While things are changing shape
I gotta find a way
Iâve shattered all my faith
I gotta find a way
My mind begins to break
While things are changing shape
I gotta find a way
Iâve shattered all my faith
But whoâs to blame?
