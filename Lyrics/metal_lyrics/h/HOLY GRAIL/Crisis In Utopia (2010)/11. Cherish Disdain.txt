Dim the lights on a force fed future
Dim the lights just enough
So that your eyes will never adjust to the darkness

Left fluent in a murdered language
Your alibis have evolved to motives that fracture
With my name extracted

Thrashed and torn, ripped and worn
Double crossed and left out in the cold
Misinformed, face the storm
Once ignored what's left in the unknown
Now we're numbed by the truth that's been exposed

I never gave up my life to be lifeless
I never gave up this crown
So you could show up with woven thorn retribution

This is how every weakest link fails
Your first day on the job
Thrashing and begging, till logic has told you... "The End"

Thrashed and torn, ripped and worn
Double crossed and left out in the cold
Misinformed, face the storm
Once ignored what's left in the unknown
Now we're numbed by the truth that's been exposed

Now don't ask why I tell you to let go
Cherish disdain because it's all that's left for you

Forever's now past tense,
Truces are bent
And you can't repent
Failures eternal sequence, your futile advent,
You're not even there yet

Thanks to crypticgenius for correcting track #11 lyrics.
