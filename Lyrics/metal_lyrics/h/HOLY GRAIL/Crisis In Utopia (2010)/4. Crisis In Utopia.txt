Without warning, doomsday arrives
Atmosphere splits open wide
It seems to me we've reached our decline
There's no time left to say goodbye

The terror's struck and will remain

Hope is lost as the worlds collide
Blackened venom adorns the skies
Earth's existence is vaporized
Leaving nothing but parasites

All seek shelter which they will never find
Friends and loved ones left behind
Ash and bones of unlucky souls
Will meet again in afterlife

The terror's struck and will remain

Pulverized by atomic waves
Mother earth mourns in retrograde
Humans vanish without a trace
No salvation will be attained

Hope is lost as the word collide
Blackened venom adorns the skies
Earth's existence is vaporized
Leaving nothing but parasites

Crawling with life

Toxic life roams
Earth is deformed
All is survived
Crawling with doom
Spawning new lines
Parasites rise
