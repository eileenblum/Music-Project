Desperately wanting this nightmare to end, I must have Found hell on earth
I cannot feel and I cannot mend this evil that you've Given birth

Lights out! As I'm reaching on, drown in blood of life
Lights out! As it draws you in silent despair we...
Lights out! As I'm reaching on, drown in blood of life
Lights out! I must carry on as death creeps upon we...

...Come to fight, awake our demons
We've sacrificed our lives and now we fight for freedom
With all our might, we show no mercy
Terrorize and leave no man to stand before thee

Now they are dry, these tears that I weep, I cannot be Fooled again
I will not rest, No! I'll never sleep 'til to this I can Say amen
But I'm blinded by hate and by fear in the end, just a Child in the night that must ascend
One more dead soul and you'll lose self control cause you Have no more ways to defend

Lights out! As I'm reaching on, drown in blood of life
Lights out! I must carry on as death creeps upon we...

...Come to fight, awake our demons
We've sacrificed our lives and now we fight for freedom
With all our might, we show no mercy
Terrorize and leave no man to stand before thee

Lights out! As I'm reaching on, drown in blood of life
Lights out! I must carry on as death creeps upon we...

...Come to fight, awake our demons
We've sacrificed our lives and now we fight for freedom
With all our might, we show no mercy
Terrorize and leave no man to stand before thee
