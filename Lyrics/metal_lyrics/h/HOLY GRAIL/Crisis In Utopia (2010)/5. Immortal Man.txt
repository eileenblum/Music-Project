So here we go again on the last crusade
Who ya think you're fooling now?
Until the war is done your luck will never change
Now the horde will cut you down

Beware!
I'm comin' fast!
Any chance you take will be your last
So run while you still can

I am!
Immortal man!
You mortal fools may run and hide
But I will never die

Don't pull the plug upon our everlasting hate
I'm too pissed to give up now
Ultimate power vulture warrior from above
Who ya foolin' anyhow?

Beware!
I'm comin' fast!
Any chance you take will be your last
So run while you still can

I am!
Immortal man!
You mortal fools may run and hide
But I will never die

Improper burial you had it coming your way
He comes from a perilous land where the Pegasus lay
Seen in great strides from galaxies so far away

Beware!
I'm comin' fast!
Any chance you take will be your last
So run while you still can

I am!
Immortal man!
You mortal fools may run and hide
But I will never die
