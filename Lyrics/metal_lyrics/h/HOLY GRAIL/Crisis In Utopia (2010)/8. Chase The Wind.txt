Bloodshot eyes watch secretly
Headless fools observing me
Walk on by with nose held high
It's what they can't perceive, that they'll never realize

Run for your life! Outcasts and Derelicts unite
Don't try to hide! We must expose their sinful pride
Which the fools have denied

All of our lives
We've always been
Alone in the dark
Chasing the Wind

Empty inside
Withered within
At the edge of the night
Gone again

There's no difference, us and them
Aside from pride that swells their heads
Casting judgment on what they see
It's what they can't perceive, that they'll never realize

Buried in lies! Outcasts and Derelicts unite
Don't try to hide! We must expose their sinful pride
Which the fools have denied

All of our lives
We've always been
Alone in the dark
Chasing the Wind

Empty inside
Withered within
At the edge of the night
Gone again

No two different, none alike
It's what they can't perceive, that they'll never realize
