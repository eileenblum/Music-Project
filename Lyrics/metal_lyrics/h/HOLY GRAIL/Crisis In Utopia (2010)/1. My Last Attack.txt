Poured down by lies, You've left me to suffer
Crawling along to survive
Stricken with hate, this hate that you gave me
It's time that you realize

Death awaits you! I'll soon overtake you!
Nothing will stand between us anymore
Turn and face me! Repent for your envy!
My vengeance runs cold, this is my last attack

No other way, I'll turn away
I've been provoked without retreat
I'll bear down all of your deceit

Your path is paved straight to the grave
Looking disdain right in the face
Won't find the good that you've misplaced, no other way

Walls take the place where windows once let out
A hate-cage we can't escape
Take on this plague and treat it with poison
Waste you and spit on your grave

Death awaits you! I'll soon overtake you!
Nothing will stand between us anymore
Turn and face me! Repent for your envy!
My vengeance runs cold, this is my last attack

No other way, I'll turn away
I've been provoked without retreat
I'll bear down all of your deceit

Your path is paved straight to the grave
Looking disdain right in the face
Won't find the good that you've misplaced, no other way

No saving grace!
