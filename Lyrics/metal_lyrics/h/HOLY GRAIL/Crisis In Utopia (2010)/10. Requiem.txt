I'm feeling uninspired and I'm feeling uncontrolled
The whole world turned against me and left me out in the Cold
That fire once inside is a distant memory
I've lost all hope in life and I'm stuck in misery

I'm trapped inside this prison and no one really cares
But I know this is my fate and It's time to get things Squared
My stomach grinds and turns as my palms are beginning to Sweat
I don't see sense in trying I guess I'm better off dead

There's nothing that you can do, My fate is all that's True
I've got myself to blame for all of my tears and pain
There's no way I'm turning back, No way to say goodbye
Don't want to hear you cry, I'll save my remorse for the Afterlife...

I've tried to let it go and I've tried to make amends
I watch the storm approach as I reach the bitter end
Today is my last day on Eartha but tomorrow I'll start a New
I've run for long enough, It's time I paid my dues

There's nothing that you can do, My fate is all that's True
I've got myself to blame for all of my tears and pain
There's no way I'm turning back, No way to say goodbye
Don't want to hear you cry, I'll save my remorse for the Afterlife...

There's nothing that you can do, My fate is all that's True
I've got myself to blame for all of my tears and pain
There's no way I'm turning back, No way to say goodbye
Don't want to hear you cry, I've made my last wish, It's Time to die.
