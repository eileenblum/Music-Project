Off the cosatline on the horizon,
Ships appear in the moonlight
No shelter, no time, as they descend on our tribe
Now the raiders storm the invaders
In the shadow of night
Overtaken, now it has come to the end of your life

Run your sword through the enemy
Run your sword through...

Enemies falling in shame
You're facing a similar fate
Crushing destroying the light is fading
Valhalla is calling your name

See the corpse fallen brethren
Hear the lament of the loss of their lives
Fire's burning all around you
Enter the gates of the afterlife
Lead away by valkyries on high,
As you descend to the golden halls
Odin bestows his blessing on you,
Valour and honor after the fall

Run your sword through the enemy
Run your sword through...

Enemies falling in shame
You're facing a similar fate
Crushing destroying the light is fading
Valhalla is calling your name

Run your sword through the enemy
Run your sword through...

Enemies falling in shame
You're facing a similar fate
Crushing destroying the light is fading
Valhalla is calling your name

Take back the hate that you gave, I'll force you to suffer
No signs of mercy remain, no escape from the torture
