White lightning over you
Fire in the air
The night grabs hold of you

Voices calling you
From long ago
Entranced with bravery
A call to victory

Power, courage, sword and shield
In the dark of night the blood will spill
Our destiny will be fulfilled
Gods of battle, fight to kill

The sound of solid steel
Smashing everywhere
Exploding victory

Mighty, righteously
Enthralled with chivalry
For all eternity

Power, courage, sword and shield
In the dark of night the blood will spill
Our destiny will be fulfilled
Gods of battle, fight to kill

C'mon!

Power, courage, sword and shield
In the dark of night the blood will spill
Our destiny will be fulfilled
Gods of battle, fight to kill
