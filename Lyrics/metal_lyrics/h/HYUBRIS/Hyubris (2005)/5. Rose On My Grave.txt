Nobody knows
What I'm looking for
Nobody cares
What I feel

My life is the end of something
Something that never begins
Something grow inside me
Maybe a terrible nightmare
Tears fall like rain
Like rain

And the world is invited
To enjoy in all my madness

And breathe for the last time
The rose that you put on my grave

And feelthe wind through your hair
Like a hand who wants to hang you
From the sky...
