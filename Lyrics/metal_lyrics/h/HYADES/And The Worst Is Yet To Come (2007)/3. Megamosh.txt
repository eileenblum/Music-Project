Don't lower your head
You might mess up your hair
Be evil, look straight
Walk with a stake in your ass
Don't laugh at our jokes
Or your face painting melts
Dress black, drink blood
And sleep outdoor in the snow

Cursed be God
Write it on your shirt
Put it on the back
To show how cruel you are
Pentacles to scare
Methuselahs at the park
You wanna be so cool
But we take the mickey out of you

You the Antichrist
Evil is for sale
666, flaunt it everywhere
You deserve a fist
Your name is on a black list
From Zdaynikuf megamosh force

You wouldn't frighten a rabbit
You wouldn't debauch a hooker
Sweat in leather clothes
But hold on, don't give in
Necroputriblasphemator
Or the weakest of the pussies
Satan is a poser
And you're just a bunch of losers

You the Antichrist
Evil is for sale
666, flaunt it everywhere
You deserve a fist
Your name is on a black list
From Zdaynikuf megamosh force
