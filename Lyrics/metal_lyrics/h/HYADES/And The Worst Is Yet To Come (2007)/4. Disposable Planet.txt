Mountains of garbage spill into the streets
Tramps are sleeping they're still in the trash
Your children are playing with rats and pests
But you're so busy turning rivers into drains

We buy, consume, use, spend, accumulate
Never discerning the real necessities
Earth is too small for all that we produce
There's no more space left for all your shit

Years of ruthless buys
Are making this world rot
Use and throw away
That's the American way

Incinerator spits venom for your lungs
Harmful gases and dioxin
Are polluting the air
Bulldozer buries
Your waste under the earth
Is it the price to pay
For your fucking lethargy?

For the first time in your fucking life
Let them hear your voice
Let them hear your voice
Boycott, deny, refuse, resist
The dumb consumerism of this society

There is enough on earth
For everybody's need
But there is not enough
For everyone's greed

We have been taken for sure
'Cause they all always knew
The world is coming to a head
Buried under your waste
When I pointed my finger
At your fucking apathy
You were laughing
You were scoffing at me
