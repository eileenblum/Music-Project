Will to believe
New catastrophe is coming
Panic, anguish and fear
A new menace upon us
Need to find a shelter
To recover your soul
Build up your self made bunker and hide

Pray to survive the first deadly strike
Oh my god, can't stand the tension over me
Prophecy is clear, the ancient ones right
World War Three is coming, coming near

Will there really be a new world war?
Be sure it wouldn't be so far from this world
We're all living and waiting for disasters coming
Acting hopelessly like actors in a tragic play

New war, purify this world
No more, hatred filled inside
Fight for, fight to stay alive
World war, human genocide

New war, purify this world
No more, hatred filled inside
Fight for, fight to stay alive
World war, human genocide
