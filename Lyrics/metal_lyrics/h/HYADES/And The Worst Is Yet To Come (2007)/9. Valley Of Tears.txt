Through the centuries
Through all the suffering
What the human race
Has faced in its history
To be consoled from
All the pain and the sorrow
Only one chance
To believe in the future

Religion gave us a reason
To go on with this life
Alienation of man
Into something unknown

Our strength and our will
Focused on what no one can explain
Our strength and our will
Focused on what no one can explain

Thank you for giving us
A light to follow
In the darkness where people feel safe
Soon to be redeemed we don't care
About the present
Living in sin praying
For a god to protect us

It's just what we all wish for
A better future, nothing more
It's just what we all wish for
A better future, nothing more

We created our idol
The mighty one to answer
Unreturned questions
That drive us mad

Time still heals nothing
Scars already opened
Kill your brother for not praying
To your god

Who is right, who is wrong?
Dying for a faith
That's the final conclusion
Who is right, who is wrong?
Dying for a faith
That's the final conclusion

It's just what we all wish for
A better future, nothing more
It's just what we all wish for
A better future, nothing more
