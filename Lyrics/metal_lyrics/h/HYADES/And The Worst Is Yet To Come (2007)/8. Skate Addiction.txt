That damn fat Bob with his easy to see tips
Is driving us crazy understanding what is it
I80 shove it shower
Front side, nollie, grab nose stall

How can we pretend to do that bag of tricks
We can't even jump off the board without a twist
Acne filled kids cut from mother a breast
Laugh behind our shoulders

We started too late for this damned game
Skating when older, it's not the same
Smashed bones and face on the ground
Who got us to do it, fuck you all

Skate addiction
It's more than a religion
Who cares about the rest
When you're trying to do your best
Skate addiction
Bones fly but skates
Are still on the ground

Bones fly but skates

Friends break clavicles in ruinous falls
Unconscious on the ground
Through a bunch of crooks
Even the pushers suggest for us to stop
But ankles keeps on getting sprained

We shot off from work
With a squeal of tires
Macehunger's cement waits for us
We'll tear another shirt
Trying a basic trick
Maybe when we're 40 years old
We'll succeed with it
