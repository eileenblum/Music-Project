We are the voice arms itself to be heard
We are the face hides itself to be seen
We are the name hides itself to be named
We are the star calling out to humanity

Years of struggle and harsh resistance
Voices and faces of brothers and sisters
We are here with all of them
Soldiers became, soldiers remain

Forget our names so we could be named
This is who we are

E.Z.L.N.

We are the dead being alive and well
We are all colours of mother earth
We are the tomorrow harvested in the past
We are the star calling out to humanity

Forget our names so we could be named
This is who we are

E.Z.L.N.

Behind our black mask, behind this we're you
Forgotten natives or despised youth
Humbled workers or beaten migrants
Forgotten men and dead from neglect

Dreams won't end as long as we live
The wind from below is coming to storm
And when it leaves the country in peace
We'll lay down the arms and take back our mug

But now forget our names so we could be named
This is who we are

E.Z.L.N.
