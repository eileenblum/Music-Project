Shut your eyes and cover your ears
You're the good, they're the evil
From the other side of a barricade
Even children become pricks
Raise up the barriers of hate
Build up the perfect ruse
Knock down your enemies
And take back what is yours

God has chosen you all
You've soiled his hands with blood
Tainted in a rotten coffin
He lies listening to you lying
I am the terrorist
Mad man, paranoid
You're right, my world is null
Its dead with a bullet in it's head

We are all on a purge list
God doesn't care if you are straight
You are just a black bastard
Your call for rights is a crime
God does bless America
But someone help us all
Where is the land of freedom?
Its buried under shit and blood

False teachers, P2ists
Necktied to sell out deaths
Fat merchants of goods
Dickheads or warheads
Gamblers and speculators
Crooked politicans
Look in the eyes of he who dies
They just ask you why

We are all on a purge list
God doesn't care if you're straight
You are just a black bastard
Your call for rights is a crime
God bless America
But someone help us all
Where is the land of freedom?
Its buried under shit and blood

We are all on a purge list
God doesn't care if you're straight
You are just a black bastard
Your call for rights is a crime
God bless America
But someone help us all
Where is the land of freedom?
It's buried under shit and blood
