We're obsessed with negligible risks
Killer mad cows in your farm
BSE lurking in your burger
Pedophiles in bushes
Or roasted KFC breathing
A shifting parade of boogeymen

Panic-demic more than a pandemic
It's easier to win the lottery
Than contract Avian Flu
But y'all are going to shit
In your D&amp;C shorts
This smell of your fear is kinda like piss

Why do you fear flu and not planet's decay?
You don't give a fuck about living in the dirt
Think what the hell you are doing with your shit
Grub of system you're fattening their wallets

Your farts stink the air
A mere minor of the problems
The gases killing us
Aren't a product of your ass
Humans are crammed into mega slum cities
Eating shit pills and spitting car burps

What you fear is what they want you to fear
They build up a fiend to divert your eyes
Do you really believe they care about your health?
They're selling you death in each way they get
Our fields have been turned into nuclear plants
And the worst on earth still has to come
Food is poisoned, world is for sale
This earth is under siege

You don't know a fuck about the shit you daily eat
Are Schwarzenegger eggplants healthy or what?
You stupid white man fear unreasonable problems
It's worse than a small penis
Or a dead empty brain

So put your fucking Cialis
In your fucking ass
My mailbox is exploding
With this kind of crap
Stop to think about
Your idle needle dick
There's out a world
That dies just now

What you fear is what they want you to fear
They build up a fiend to divert your eyes
Do you really believe they care about your health?
They're selling you death in each way they get
Our fields have been turned into nuclear plants
And the worst on earth still has to come
Food is poisoned, world is for sale
This earth is under siege
