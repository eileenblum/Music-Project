Darkness and voices
Steps comin' near
There's mess out of my lifeless cell
Jingling keys unlocking my door
Enter light, I'm blind

Dazed and confused
My hands are tied
Someone is hauling me out of this cell
I can't scream, I can't know
But a voice up there force me to walk

My sight is growing dim
Sedative reaction
I don't feel the grief inside
Start the execution
No discharge can make me forget
I am a blameless
Walking in the deathrow

Here we are
How cold is this fucking chair
Oh Go, how many people beyond the glass
Say hello with the hand
Say goodbye
They wanna see you die

Twinkling of an eye
A life burns away
You can't know because there's no sense
The only reason why I'm seated here
You can't know
But is the colour of skin

My sight is growing dim
Sedative reaction
I don't feel the grief inside
Start the execution
No discharge can make me forget
I am a blameless
Waiting for the death call

My sight is growing dim
Sedative reaction
I don't feel the grief inside
Start the execution
No discharge can make me forget
I am a blameless
Screaming in the deathrow
