Shut up now you fuckin' dork
And listen for the first time in your life
It's enough, I can't resist
Stick up your ass all that advises
Stop drinking, no more smoking
Turn down the gain
Stop eating like a pig

Quit with your cramps now
I will not repeat
Maybe tomorrow
I'll be dead and gone
Wherever I'll be
Is it heaven or hell
I'll not curse myself
For missing a chance
Exit from your tight clothes
Leave it all behind
Scream out that rage
That weighs on your mind
You can find a better way
To use your hate
Instead of being a cancer
That nourish with my life

Shut the fuck up
There's nothing you can give me
Nothing you can do for me
Shut the fuck up
You hate me just because
You'll never be like me
Shut the fuck up
I'm on your list
And I'm pleased to be there
Shut the fuck up
You are bullet bait
Bag your face and
Shut the fuck up

Look at yourself
What do you see
The worst motherfucker
Is just better than you
Pathetic existence
Hypocrisy rules
How can you face a mirror without shame
I know what you think
When you look at me
You feel something inside
And no one can see
Your lie doesn't work
Not even with yourself
You call me a fool
But envy devours you
