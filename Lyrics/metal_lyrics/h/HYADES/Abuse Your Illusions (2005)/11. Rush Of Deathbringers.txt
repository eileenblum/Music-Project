My sword is now wet
By the blood of your people
Your courage is not enough
Why don't try to escape
Your end is so near
Soon this land will be mine

Don't exult it's only afternoon
Our soldiers are ready to battle again
Look at the horizon
And hear the throat of horses
Thunder of wrath
Spirit of vengeance
The knights of the league have come

All around the cart
The bell of our patron
Starts to ring again
The cross, the cross
For the cross we'll return with the shield
Not over the shield

Your sword is now mine
And your blood is now spilled
This is the triumph of courage
Run to announce that you're on your knees
In front of Albert our guide

For the price
Look into our eyes
A tear falls
And wets the soil
The cross is safe
Our homes are surviving
Crumble of fury, cries of joy
They have heard our scream of revenge

All around the cart
The bell of our patron
Starts to ring again
The cross, the cross
For the cross we've returned
Victory
