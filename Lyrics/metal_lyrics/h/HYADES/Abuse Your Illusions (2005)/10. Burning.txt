I see the towers burning
I see the fields in flame
Sounds of ravage fill the air
Blood and tears moisten the soil
On this sacred plans
I curse the name of tyrant
'Cause the throne is one and waits
To the victor of clash of the titans

We're shades in fire
We gaze at yields burning
We're shades in fire
On through death and destruction
We wait, we wait
Blinded by hate
Blinded by revenge
We wait, we wait
For the victory of company of death

We sing of the arms
We sing of a man
Who first in our land
Was sent by fate's will
To face the foreign invader
From the north
To rescue his people
From blindness and decay

Bloodshed, mayhem
Sin after sin, hatred
Please deliver us
We call for your name
The company of death

We're shades in fire
We gaze at yields burning
We're shades in fire
On through death and destruction
We wait, we wait
Blinded by hate
Blinded by revenge
We wait, we wait
For the victory of company of death

Fate guides my hand
You have mistaken
Now you'll pay
Last hour awaits you king
By rage in our heart
You will die
