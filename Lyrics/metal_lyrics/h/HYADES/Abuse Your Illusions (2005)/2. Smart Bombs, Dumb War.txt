Good morning Baghdad it's five o'clock
The night is ripped by flash and explosions
Silence and fright
Alarm bell sounds
The attack begins
There's no time to flee

Glasses are crumbling
Walls can't resist
Only destruction from the strike of the beast
No one can stop the fury
No one can search for glory
Pushed the button
It's just the triumph of idiocy

From the hands of a tyrant
To desert storm fire
What kind of life is this to live for us?
Smart bombs, dumb war
Falseness and lies
This fucking world is coming to a head

Bombs on the markets from the US led forces
Iraqi shells on the populace
Some hundred thousand children
At the risk of disease
Are just a statistic
For the government department

Murdering madness
From each side of the war
Dictatorships veiled by democracy form
Human kind decay
Foolishness the only winner
When will be life more important
Than the money god?

From the hands of a tyrant
To desert storm fire
What kind of life is this to live for us?
Smart bombs, dumb war
Falseness and lies
This fucking world is coming to a head
