Lies over lies so the people die
Don't you see you've been deceived
WMD, just a bum steer
To hide real interests in Middle East
You piss ball around
While children die
Thanks to vote a liar dicksplat
Do you really think they don't know
Wake up it was all an excuse

Where are the weapons of mass destruction
Intolerance, belligerence and oil gain
These are the reason
For a fucking war of interests
They've told you lies
But you're not justified

False documents, big lie tactic
War announced like a product launch
Ignorance is no excuse
Everybody knows that war calls violence
You are proud of your hate
But you're a fool
Never getting anything done
Say the truth you always knew
It was a trick for a game
That makes you feel cool

Where are the weapons of mass destruction
Intolerance, belligerence and oil gain
These are the reason
For a fucking war of interests
They've told you lies
But you're not justified

War for oil
It was a fucking war for oil

Your impeding threat
Two empty warheads
Covered in rust and 45 years old
No mustard gas, no VX nerve
Thank goodness there was no doubt
Dear president, I can't trust
You're making fun of this castle of lies
Why don't you embrace a gun?
Why don't you go out
To risk your ass
For the bullshit you've told us?
