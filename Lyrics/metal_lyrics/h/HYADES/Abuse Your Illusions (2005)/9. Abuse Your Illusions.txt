Turn on the TV
They broadcast the news
A storm rages on
But out I see a few drops
Emergency weather
A stupid alarmism
It's too late
You have shit your pants

Maybe Bin Laden is hidden in your cellar
Maybe a nuclear car bomb
Is parked at the mall

A virus in your PC
And also in your lavatory
Hey, it can growl and eat your sitting room
No kidding?
Do you believe in these fantasies
No shit Sherlock
I'm not born yesterday

Is a tsunami coming over my house
Why can't I simply slip from well

Give me an unusual death
I don't wanna blow up
Give me an unusual death
Why must I be murdered
Give me an unusual death
I don't wanna be in a movie
Give me an unusual death
Give me a normal standard fucking death

There is a terrorist hidden in your sandwich
Please be careful
The hot dog can be toxic
If you've to cross the street
Look at the sky
A meteor is coming to raze all to the ground

Pulverized by a nuclear storm
Or sucked back in a black hole
Why can't I die a natural death
