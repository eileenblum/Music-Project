Senseless alarmism
Mad catastrophism
There's just insanity and foolishness
A fucking planet, ruined by greed and avarice
Able to speculate with a mortal disease
A world so weak can slip out of our hands
It's enough a power failure
And the systems go mad
Outrageous games of passing the buck
Specious pretexts to atomic research

Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
Is this what you call democracy form
Burning for burning
Wound for a wound
Is this the answer to terror's attack

Hunger and disease, blame it's on you
Dryness , pollution, blame it's on you
Children are dying, blame it's on you
This world is fading, blame it's on you

Sweat and blood are the price you must pay
Work for your country with nothing to say
Do you know which is the reason you are there
You're to believe in something
'Cause you don't believe in yourself
