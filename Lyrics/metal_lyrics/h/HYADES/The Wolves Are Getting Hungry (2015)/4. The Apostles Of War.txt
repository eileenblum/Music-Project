Some says that history is cyclical
But ignorance is sovereign
Because war after bloody war
We still have to learn
Colonialism, interference
Disguised business interests
And a new media world
That the Congress will bless
We all need an enemy
To march proud under a flag
To give a our children a reason
For living in the shit
They sell it as a religion war
Lead by fiends against us all
So we are the good ones
Besieged by a threat
War after war
Our hands are stained with blood
The world that we are building up
Is an empire of dirt
Bomb after bomb
More guiltless head will fall
We are the democracy
The apostles of war
We hide ourselves behind
The dirty flag of democracy
To hurl drones through the lands
Of refugees and wretches
We hide ourselves behind
Our freedom of speech
To slag the off and make some fun
Of their humanity

[Chorus]

We have in our hands
Devices made so great
We have access to all the knowledge
Of the human race
But instead of read and learn
Tell me what went wrong
We use the up just for a check
The social network we belong
