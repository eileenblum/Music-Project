Nights over the books, revising for an example
Dates,quotes and heroes, black on white up there
They told you about the years of power and war
Instilling you the idea of evil against the good
Hanged on the walls are the portraits of them
The founding fathers, all the virtuous men
We kneel down to them, we pay our respect
We choose to be the righteous, the good side on the field
Think back on execimutions, each murdering attack
How this is the line between a rebel and a terrorist?
Did they tell you the same lies you're listening on TV
Iraq, Afghanistan, ISIS or Russia?
What if it all hadn't happened in this way?
We are the sons of hundred years of injustice
This generation is the one and only proof
That we won all the wars,but we were so wrong
Only the winners write down the past
The losers are hanged or battered to death
Shot in cold blood, execute by squads
The great lie of history
The great lie of history
is history itself
It's said that it's the paradox of democracy
Is people united to choose a dictatorship
But isn't this what we all do
Every four years with a card and a pen?
We elect the least worst between two autocrats
We follow him and we bring him up there
And when he loses or begins to falls
We change our side and rewrite our past

[Chorus]

I had an illusions: a world growing faster
New voices speaking, brand new mass medias
A word where you can know almost everything
And choose to believe or distrust it all
For a bog-standard take there are other viewpoints
You just have to plumbs the depth of'el all
But then I realized that all this is useless
Cause the are only a few who want to know
