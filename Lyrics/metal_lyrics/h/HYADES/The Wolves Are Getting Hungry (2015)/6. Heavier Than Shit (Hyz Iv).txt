Everything is packed and ready
merch and guitars heads
Something's in the wrong car
Of course we will forget it
It's over thousand kms
just to play one show
But we don't give a fuck about it
That's the way we do
Twenty years are gone
We are getting old
Out-of-date, obsolete
But still on the road
Can't band our head
Without a broken neck
But we're faster than our farts
And heavier than a fucking mould of shit
The serial list is incomplete
We'll do it on the way
The lads at the border
Will show us their regrets
Try to sleep inside a car
With four dead farting guys
Close your eyes, hold your nose
it's gonna be bad

[Chorus]

We could be lawyers
Notaries or CPAs
We choose to make some fun
Playing a guitar
We have been ripped off
Our CDs lie unsold
We're now too young for the old school
And too old for the new
How many days we wasted
Rehearsing in the basement
But if we could go back in time
Well do it all again
Smashing beer cans on our head
We met our best friends
Played with 'em for twenty years
What more can we ask for?
Twenty years are gone
We are getting old
Out-of-date, obsolete
But still on the road
Can't band our head
Without a broken neck
But we're faster than our farts
And heavier than a fucking mould of shit
