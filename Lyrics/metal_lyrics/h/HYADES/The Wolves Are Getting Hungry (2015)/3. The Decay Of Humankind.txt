We are the only species that has stopped the evolution 
Keeping the weakest alive with our practical sympathy 
And even when ripe for destruction, our pity saves every soul 
But the evil springs from the weakness 
and this world is yet the proof 
We broke the path to be more than an infesting race on Earth 
That made the ground going rotten since the day of our birth 
May a muddy black hole filled whit shit and blood and tears 
Swallows us all from the tiptoe to our tears 
We are the end and the principle 
We are the ones who decide 
We, the cause of it all 
The decay of humankind 
We are the plague and the illness 
A cancer behind your mind 
We are the run-up to extinction 
To decay of humankind 
This scurvy world is mouldering, buried by our own shit 
We're eating just everything straight down to our hell 
And while a new peace agreement 
is signed by your men in black 
Life is wiped away and the green of a leaf turns red 
We are the pathetical lifeform
We are the ones who decline 
We, the cause of it all 
The decay of  humankind 
We are the worst kind of illness 
A virus into our mind 
We are inside our nightmare 
The decay of humankind
