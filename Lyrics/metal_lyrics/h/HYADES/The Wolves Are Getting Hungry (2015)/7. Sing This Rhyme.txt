Sing this rhyme, sing it twice 
Say you got something to say 
At the end it goes this way 
Two rhymes here, just keep the time 
Then the bridge and again a rhyme 
When you think it's dumb enough 
just repeat from 5 to 1 
What's that riff on a pentatonic blues? 
Chromatic tunes are now the rule 
Then sit at home surfing on the web 
Search some words to fill the text 
This drums kick ass, this solo's  bad
Where's the bass, listen the refrain!
I don't like this voice, I love this song 
But what is singer saying? I don't know! 
Sing it out, sing it out,sing it out loud 
No matter what we're saying,
no matter what's the song about 
Sing it out, sing it out,sing it with proud 
Sing it out, sing it out,sing it out loud 
No matter what we're saying,
no matter what's the song about 
Sing it out, sing it out,sing it with proud 
Random word: mushroom cloud! 
So download everything you listen on the tube 
Never get a CD, get it on Emule
who cares about what bands are saying? 
Who fucking cares about the lyrics? 
After all it's easy to get a song done 
A couple of chords then a good breakdown 
isn't hard at all to put a lyric down 
Talk about that girl that you met downton
Sing it out, sing it out,sing it out loud 
No matter what we're saying, no matter what's the song about 
Sing it out, sing it out,sing it with proud 
Sing it out, sing it out,sing it out loud 
No matter what we're saying, no matter what's the song about 
Sing it out, sing it out,sing it with proud 
Random word: mushroom cloud!
