Every night we're out together,
drinking beer, water? Never!
Holbrand, Kjeler and every shit,
the morning after you just forget
Where you were, what you drank,
who you met and what you said
My best friend again is calling,
the toilet bowl in the morning
In your mouth a battlefield,
in your belly a thousand beers
Cigarettes are everywhere,
in your hands, nose and hair
It doesn't matter what you said,
I'll never give a fuckin' damn
Let me be the rebel one,
let me be drink forevermore

[Chorus]

Metal music in our ears,
crashing heads and flowing beers
Banging head and scream voice,
against our future, null and void
in a pissed off state of mind
every day we want to fight
Just a beer is what we need,
just a beer and fuck you all

[Chorus]

Beer and whiskey is what we want,
be unconscious is what we need
Love the shows and every party
where the people are really dirty
Easy girls, mature or teen
but only on the TV screen
Never a date nor a dinner
Just a beer to be the winner
