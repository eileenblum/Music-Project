I care about the Nasdaq, I have to check it on TV
I care about the debt, that's what they told on BBC
Let's talk about the MIB, I check it every day 
Oh wait a second I just got and update on Nikkei
I'm shitting my pants off, reading of the Italian spread
I'll lock my door and throw the key, things are getting red 
Gotta find a way,man, to get investments done 
Who cares I'm barely able to get it through the mouth 
I don't have time for a beer man, leave me alone 
Need to check a Brent graph, here on my phone 
Have you seen what happened to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
If just think about it I'm gonna have a panic attack!
Tell me about your missing cat 
Let's make a good ol'soccer chat 
I'm not getting sucked in 
Talk and I won't be listening 
Tell me that the weather sucks 
Kill my ears with your bad luck 
Let's talk about democracy 
But please no more economy!
Read on wikipedia, paste it on web,
make a shitty argument, go on and forget
Buy a lobotomic book written just for you, 
go to the bar and teach it to your crew 
Scream against the news that you don't understand
then repeat everything and make you stand 
You are the best example of this idiocy,
you don't give a fuck about economy 
I don't wanna know man about this shit
I don't wanna listen, so please, just quit! 
This is just too much for me, I cannot stand 
if I let you speak again, then I will be damned
Please can we talk about something else? 
please tell me about when you broke with your ex 
please tell me something about urology 
please guys no more fuckin' economy!
Tell me about your missing cat 
Let's make a good ol'soccer chat 
I'm not getting sucked in 
Talk and I won't be listening 
Tell me that the weather sucks 
Kill my ears with your bad luck 
Let's talk about democracy 
But please no more economy!
