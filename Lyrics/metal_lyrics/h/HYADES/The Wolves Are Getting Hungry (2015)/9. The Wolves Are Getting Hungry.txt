Maybe there's a reason 
For I'm always pissed off 
I spent my life in fighting 
The apathy of the mass 
But when people take the power 
They're nothing but the same 
A multitude of rip-offs 
Wolfing down themselves 
There's no one to be saved 
and redeemed graves 
Just a bunch of plonkers 
selfish to death 
Is this our Fourth Estate,
Now that we have won? 
My trust in the human race 
is we dead and gone 
Follow them and join their bloody revolution 
Take a Selfie, smile and wink, be the worst solution 
And when I see behind you a huge pile of scum 
All that I say: the worst has come 
You get on your feet 
And out on the street 
To queue at the Apple Store 
On 1st day of the sales 
the student of '68
Parks his SUV on the pavement 
He's now a bean counter 
For a corporate bank 
We fought for human rights 
Equality and justice 
We got back Showoff parades 
Where decency has gone 
Follow them and join their bloody revolution 
Take a selfie, smile and wink, be the worst solution 
And when I see behind you a huge pile of scum 
All that I say:the worst has come 
Public participion 
Is nothing but a lie 
Governments of plutocrats 
Come one after one 
Your good idea of protest 
Is a post on your wall 
To see that thumb highlighted 
And clean your conscience out 
Follow them and join their bloody revolution 
Take a selfie, smile and wink, be the worst solution 
And when I see behind you a huge pile of scum 
All that I say:the worst has come
