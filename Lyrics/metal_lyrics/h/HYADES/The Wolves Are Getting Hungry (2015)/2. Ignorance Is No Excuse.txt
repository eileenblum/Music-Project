I've thrown away my voting card 
what you call a right it's just a crap 
you perfect ideal democracy 
is nothing but a scram 
Worse than you Christ on the cross 
are the hucksters on TV 
Who're telling you some filthy lies 
that you'll never doubt 
The cynicism has now prevailed 
But I will offend you again 
You are just pure shite, shite to me 
The cynicism has now prevailed 
But I will offend you again because 
Ignorance is no excuse 
I fought hard until the end 
But my generation has lost 
just like the one before 
and the one before that one 
It's a world ruled by the suits 
Blindness mad deafness 
I spoke to you but you would not hear 
I pointed it out but you would not see
I have been a socialist 
struggling for my ideals 
but now I'm just a cynic 
and I don't give a fuck 
I believed in humankind 
But idiocy is on wholesale 
The masses are dumb 
in a world that we've fucked up 
The cynicism has now prevailed 
But I will offend you again 
You are just pure shite, shite to me 
The cynicism has now prevailed 
But I will offend you again because 
Ignorance is no excuse
