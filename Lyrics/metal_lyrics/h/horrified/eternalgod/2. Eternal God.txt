After earths, genetic fate
curse of war at our race
after christ reborn to earth
God has send the eternal curse

Away, fail, Nail, Pain

Eternal war, forgotten soul
endless gore fire flows
hate grows in the world
land of blood nuclear force

victimise
I deny
I despise
I will die

Daeth will rise
forgotten life
no reply
end of time

Try to see away the sun to live
Try to breed decay eternal bleed
look at the sea today you have been deceived
God you believe betrayed the word you speak

Hide escaping from dark
searching to find another land
nations forgatening their flags

watch the sky die
smell the daths to obey
look the dark to rise

The time to live the earth has come
too late to believe that won't stop
deny and resist upon gods law
