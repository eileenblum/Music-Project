Look to her eyes
Find eternal life
God of feelings
She wake up my heart
I show my cries
I show the reason of my life
I show her smile I can live thousand times

In the garden of beauty - In the garden of God
There is a flower of romance - try to put in my hand

I feel like god

Look to her eyes
Find eternal life
God of feelings
She wake up my heart
I show my cries
I show the reason of my life
I show her smile I can live thousand times

Beyond our hearts
There is only one
Beyond our God
She is my queens
She shines like star
She is perfection called Elisaph
