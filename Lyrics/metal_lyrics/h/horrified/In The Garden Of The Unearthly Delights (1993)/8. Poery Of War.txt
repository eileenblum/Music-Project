Under the suns of Aria
Into the seas of fear
Lost desire into the fire

Let the blood of the ancients flow
Meet the serpent kthulu
He passed back to a season without moon a shadow
Under the light he meets
The great voice of Kthulu

Trying to fly
Escape from far away
Travelling accross the maud
Trying to hide
Hoping the gods will pray to save

Hide away
Let gods to pray
Bring them hate
Human flesh remains

Let the blood of the ancients flow

Under the suns of Aria
Into the seas of fear
Lost desire into the fire
