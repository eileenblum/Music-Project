Trying to reach the heart of soul
Bleed for the sin the sin in me
I deny

Under betray
Under the hell of human shame

Looking the land, filthy seasons of the past
Admiring the life inside the heart

I deny

First to be master of all
Bleed for the gift the gift in me

Under betray
Under the hell of human shame

Lying sun forgoten faith
Promise the symbol of the last sky
