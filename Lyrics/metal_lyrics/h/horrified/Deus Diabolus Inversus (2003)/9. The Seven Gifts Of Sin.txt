Waking up from dream.
Or falling in to it.
I don't know - I can't tell.
Please tell me - Please save me.
Alone - Existence falls.
Six months of suffering - Illusion staged.
Two fear full worlds - An ego maze.
Clash of the titans - An endless game of morn.
Is it a sin in your sleep?
I will never awake again.
Keep my gift.
Free from being little man.
Alone - Existence falls.
Six months of suffering - Illusion staged.
Two fear full worlds - An ego maze.
Clash of the titans - An endless game of joy.
