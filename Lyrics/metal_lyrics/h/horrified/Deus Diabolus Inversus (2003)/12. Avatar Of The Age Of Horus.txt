Theatre of madness.
I play the clown.
You control the hidden.
To stay in shadow.
-Light-
Make my presence renowned.
Make me feel.
I know the way.
Do not deny me.
I love in pain.
I am not the puppet.
Primordial presence.
Give bith to me.
-Dream-
Make my presence renowned.
Make me feel.
Glow, glow out of the dark.
And pray for me.
