Revolution to uncover all the nonsense silent science.
Exploration - Bits of noise he break.
Cosmos empire.

Monolith.

Rich your hand - Taste the stars.
Drink from the falen light.
Inner self - Outer world.
Drink from the falen light.
Space dance - Earth walk.
Emerge in dark.

Activate, incorporate.
Alien breed is brother.
Insulate with suffering, dominate.

We ride - Rich every world.
Live among you - You searching us in god.
We know - We set the rules.
Remember us on your prime years thatthat time that dreams were truth and vessel.
