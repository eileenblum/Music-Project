My breath has broken - End.
"Who are they what do they want from me?" - "Don't let him go"
My breath has broken - End.
I'm hunted.
I'm their pray.
Memories rot me again.
Run.
Not moving In a loop.
No end.
Define the ocean end.
Then define the start, in a fractal head.
God can be undone.
By now the game is close to end.
One of many.
Never loose, taste the bitter.
Bitter end you can't complete and die.
Took myradiance light their empty s h e l l s.
Suck my soul for white cold sparks of death.
