From far came to spread his love.
On weakness, displays his lying touch.
Servant to us.
Our greatness, given to his god.
Dreams, buried to faulse light.
When you face the last hour.
And the reaper of the gate.
If you want to enter.
Do not speak his name.
You fool.
You ignorant.
Temptation drinks life as it goes.
Ignore faulse prophets and their laws.
Servant to me.
