Hate falls.
Eyes slow.
Dark lights (makes) love to corn.
In dark.
Enslaved.
No rays of sun grace me.

Neural meltdown.
Broken code.
No religions.
Help to brake my lock.

I'm in you release me together will fight this storm.
Sky open give my honor back.

Caged love.
Caged lust.

Unleash your shadows you have done it before - Be reborn.
You can't fight illusion if buried deep in soul - This is war We won.
This time.
We saved the precious corn.
In light.
In glory.
Sun rays revive my soul.

Why!!!

New battles await ahead.
If not we seek them.
A quest of reason to our eyes.

Caged love.
Caged lust.
