I have stepped at all the zones of worlds,
I have stepped down at the places of endless thirst.
Through the gates of Ganzir, built at Ur,
Before the days of the great Babylon.

I travelled under the seas
Looking for the palace of my master
And I found abominations, of lost worlds

I have called the old ghost that take flesh and bones
At the top of the temple,
The place that helps to reach the stars
I have called the dark wizard Azagthoth,
And I fly back to earth

I have fought the world of East
Calling the demon I command
I discover Ngai, the god that spits fire,
That growl with the power of thousnd seas.
I FOUND FEAR
I found the final gate that leads to unknown,
The place that the ancients seek ways
To pass at our world.

I have spoken to the spirit, Anu save my soul,
I saw the underland, I have leaved at unstepped deserts.

I have called the old ghost that take flesh and bones
At the top of the temple,
The place that helps to reach the stars
I have called the dark wizard Azagthoth
