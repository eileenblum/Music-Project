I have seen the sees of Masu
I have seen thousand and one moon
And when alone I feel exhasted
And one more breath deep in my chest I'm old

The wolf speaks my name
And that week voice calls me from away

I have to tell all I can
The ancient secret it is suspended over us
Humans dont know that evil waits at every gate open gate

From away -pray for them
Forgotten life - apart the world
Before the humans - were born
Beware the gate from the fools at the altar of insanity

And one more voice closer to me
Will speak to me - impatient
