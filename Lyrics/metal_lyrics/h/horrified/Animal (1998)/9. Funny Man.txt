Breed of me
Rise us we weep
En - stict free

Mouth on dust
Joy to be mad
Toy of blood
Dark red seed
I will retreat
You in me

Blood on hand
Sane will be stopped
Pulse attack

I swear
I declare the arrival
Declare the dominion

Wake up god
I'm your last card
Fear my laugh

Fist to fist
Sin not to sin
Heat to freeze

Dark red seed
I will retreat
You in me
