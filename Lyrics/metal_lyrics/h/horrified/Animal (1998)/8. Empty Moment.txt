I cannot forgive the god that makes me breed
I suppose I could live the life designed for me

[Chorus:]
You will never know
You will never know
You will never know - the ultimate desire
You will never know - how to build your own empire

I cannot grow seed island of misery
I devote empathy to those that breed apathy
Disclosed in the open world
Enthroned behind closed doors
Earth under our feet is sick
Sky upon, our head, our dream
