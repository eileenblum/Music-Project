I will grow my rage - defeat the pain
Pass the point of break - I shall prevail
On the day of deliverance - I'll live in grace
Release my entity - go with my race

You can die on time
As long as you live
Sacrifice your eyes
For those that will see endlessly

Come and enjoy
Survival grapes
Taste - raise - live moments of life to end

Weak souls - under symbols of death
A man awaits you - with something funny to tell
