In the land of the risin sun
Were the water burns in sand
Obey my queen and stand
Waiting for her judjement touch

She knows best my living task
I'm clay in her hands
Breath she takes I give my blood
Dark desire brings out of dark

Born in hands of a dying god
Bastard daughter of the only one
Hatred floes into artistic love
Legend grows tale collapse
