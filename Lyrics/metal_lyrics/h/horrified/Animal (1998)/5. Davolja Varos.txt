In the hills of vlasina
Down deep in the lake
Lost soul of war
Moving earth - dance

Soul of knes Lazarus
Crawls silent and pray
Pray for the men he lost
Thirty thousand dead

Lake keeper
Secret keeper

[Chorus:]
The men he lost
Fight to remember the dead.

For your soul to be forgiven
Speak all the dead names
Thirty thousand slaughtered men
Seek for revenge
He is doomed to move the earth
Doomed my Morena
For your soul to be released
And meet Midas
