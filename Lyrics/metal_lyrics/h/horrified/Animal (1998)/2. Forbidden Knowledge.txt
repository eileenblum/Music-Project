Eastern science - of monks
Rejected - by the west
To good - for our law
Evil for the rest

I cant believe they stopped our hope
Damn them - destroy them

Religion
Of feeble
Prevailing
Poor reason
Enthroning knowledge of the cave
Destruction
Of passion
Impatient
Reaction
Enthroning knowledge of the cave

Weak desire, behold
Surrender to misery
Enlightenment of the dark
Drop your walls reborn
