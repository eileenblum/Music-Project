Life's full of anger.
I am the nail in eye's of few...
But I watch the suffering of you,
making your hate survive.

Loneliness, virulence is what you feel!
Was it the pain of the game that you lost?
Obstacles making you crawl in the dust,
of everlasting tragedy.

If you're my enemy.
I'll set your destiny.
Repent your lies to me now.
In fierce I'll reap your soul.

Planting the venom, hiding in shadows of the coil.
A steal upon life and taking life.
You think you'll get away...

Loneliness, virulence is what you feel!
Was it the pain of the game that you lost?
Obstacles making you crawl in the dust,
of everlasting tragedy.

If your my enemy.
I'll set your destiny.
Repent your lies to me now.
Believe my words.
If you're my enemy.
I'll make you bleed and I'll tear down your life,
for now, I own your breath...
In fierce I'll reap your soul.

If your my enemy.
I'll set your destiny.
Repent your lies to me now.
Believe my words.
If you're my enemy.
I'll make you bleed and I'll tear down your life,
for now, I own your breath...
In fierce I'll reap your soul.

I am your last elegy...
I am thy enemy I will reap your soul.
