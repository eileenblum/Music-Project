Endless despair in the wastelands,
Of a world that left someone cold.
I know what we all can feel from the hunger,
In those eye's upon the screen.
Trying to find all the answers,
But a clue was lost in a void.
Hiding in the centre of moral crisis,
From those eye's that stare at us.

Still heart is warm and the thought is good,
But what can I do to make a change.
The world is so big and all my might,
Is fading slow...

Looking around us we're bathing,
In the gold we stole from their hands.
Making all the profit on someone else
And shaking hands on someone's grave.

Still heart is warm and the thought is good,
But what can I do to make a change.
The world is so big and all my might,
Is fading slow...

Salvation for world's misery.
A redemption from our death.

We are out of sight and reach, from their world.
And the blessed are dressed in bleach, to the world
And the mob will give their speech,
To this hell on earth...

Salvation for world's misery.
A redemption from our death.
