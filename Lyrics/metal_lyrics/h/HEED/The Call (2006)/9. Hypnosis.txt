I wake up to see you set a world in flames,
just like a flare.
I've come to hear your cries again and again.
Counting tides, in dreams your safe
with me and here,
we spend the darkness in togetherness and bitterness...

Free to watch over the world,
I fall asleep with time beside me...

Here I am now, by own desire.
Here I am now, I supervise.
Here I am now, my own desire.
Here I am now, I mesmerize...

Who deny the making of eternal life?
Inside the flare, we evoke the pain sublime
again and again...
Black crow fly, through night so cold
but silver clear.
Puncture the gloom, foresee the black wings
of eternity...

Free to watch over the world,
I fall asleep with time beside me...

Here I am now, by own desire.
Here I am now, I supervise.
Here I am now, my own desire.
Here I am now, I mesmerize...

I want to see your world now, yours like a world unclouded...
I fame the stars above us, shine, make us meet
inside the mind...

Here I am now, by own desire.
Here I am now, I supervise.
Here I am now, my own desire.
Here I am now, I mesmerize...
Here I am now, by own desire.
Here I am now, I supervise.
Here I am now, my own desire.
Here we are now, hypnotic minds...
