Hiding my pain in this womb where I lie
I can't heal no more as I, resemble this cry,
Why?
Tears of the dragon still falls from the sky,
And the hands of our father still shivers from cold.

Hear me now for no reason!
I stand on grounds that won't give in.
My strength and will are forever.
I heed the world with what I believe,
I can feel that I'm alive...

Men with the truth and the honour intact,
Stand in line on the market of blood, flesh, and fate.
Why?
Children of darkness are drawn from the light,
In the night they are victims, you know what I mean.

Hear me now for no reason!
I stand on grounds that won't give in.
My strength and will are forever.
I heed the world with what I believe,
I can feel that I'm alive...

I can feel that I am alive now, feel the pain.
I can feel that I am alive now, feel the pain.

Hear me now for no reason!
I stand on grounds that won't give in.
My strength and will are forever.
I heed the world with what I believe,
I can feel that I'm alive...

My strength and will are forever.
I heed the world with what I believe,
I can feel that I'm alive...

I can feel that I am alive now, feel the pain.
I can feel that I am alive now, feel the pain.
