In the end the measure of life is an endless flame,
still burning.
And all the life, that counts down in time,
neglects me.

In the end of life comes a change and the mystery
is fading.
Far in the wastelands of aeon roams,
the mislead...

How can I, a shadow feed?
The stranger is, is the man within me.
Darkness here in shadows greed.
To strangers lust, yet, I gave last drop of blood.

Like a ghost inside of me of you and all around,
It's spreading.
See just how small it can seem to live,
just breathe in...

How can I, a shadow feed?
The stranger is, is the man within me.
Darkness here in shadows greed.
To strangers lust, yet, I gave last drop of blood.

The stranger within me.
The shadows feed.
This change within me.
Can't make me stop to bleed.

How can I, a shadow feed?
The stranger is, is the man within me.
Darkness here in shadows greed.
To strangers lust, yet, I gave last drop of blood.

The stranger within me.
The shadows feed.
This change within me.
Can't make me stop to bleed.
