Followed by the morning breeze,
In the sun I rest my head.
Thinking of the memories
And times we had in the past, dream.

No one can live life in loneliness,
Only stars in the sky far away...
In the void there's nothing to say or embrace.
Empty souls are lost deep in there.
Like astray in time and in space.

Walking in the sands of life,
Where the lost will burn his feet...
Suffering from sad melodies,
Chanting life can never be the same now...

No one can live life in loneliness,
Only stars in the sky far away...
In the void there's nothing to say or embrace.
Empty souls are lost deep in there.
Like astray in time and in space.

In the heart of a strange and wild moon.
There's a brave light shining for all.
The thing of knowing the end of a life.
Gives us time for heeding the call, dream on.

No one can live life in loneliness,
Only stars in the sky far away...
In the void there's nothing to say or embrace.
Empty souls are lost deep in there.
Like astray in time and in space.

In avoid there's nothing to say.
Empty souls are lost deep in there.
