Raining tears from heaven.
That will guide my dreams in time.
Breaking bonds of treason.
With the fallen angel.

Errors come to haunt you.
From the chambers of thy will.
Errors come and haunt you now.
To the core of your memory mill.

I hate like you...

I hate like you!
The world and the life.
The soil and bloody stones.
I share, all my hate.
Through Tears of prodigy.

Always marked as hellion.
And a fiendish shape alive.
Destined life I'm leaving.
With the fallen angel.

Satan comes to seize you.
Blindly fool and dupe thy sane.
Darkness comes to force you down.
Makes you crawl fast against your bane.

I hate like you...

I hate like you!
The world and the life.
The soil and bloody stones.
I share, all my hate.
Through Tears of prodigy.

Fallen angel brings, crown of thorns to kings.

I hate like you!
The world and the life.
The soil and bloody stones.
I share, all my hate.
Through Tears of prodigy.

I hate like you...

The world and the life.
The soil and bloody stones.
I share, all my hate.
Through Tears of prodigy.
