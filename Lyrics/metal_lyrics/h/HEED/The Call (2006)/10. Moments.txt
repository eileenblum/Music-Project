I seek my dominion,
Lost we all are in paradise soil.
Faith gives and then taketh away,
Erode sins away.
Holy water see all that's reflecting from within memories.
Breathe in utter depth of my life,
Breathe out in throe.

Far beyond the stars.
Starlight guides on the path to the dream.
Night eclipse the sun,
Enchanted by the silvery moon.

Hear the bells ringing in,
Watch the glare red horizon.
Now the moment of truth wakes
The life in me.

Now I am here, take this hand
In yours and follow through your agony.
I believe in you, I always did.
Can't you tell me where you are...

Far beyond the stars.
Starlight guides on the path to the dream.
Sent to kingdom come
In turmoil and magic I soar.

Hear the bells ringing in,
Watch the glare red horizon.
Now the moment of truth wakes
The life in me.

I seek for the spirit...

Far beyond the stars,
Lies the truth that wee seek in our fate?
Gods can't hide from us,
The myth that we share will unfold.

In my sense, force is mine,
Master of grand illusions.
I create my own truth,
That wakes the life in me...

Now everything will change,
The master plan is old to life.
Revelation time is here!
And moment of the truth...
