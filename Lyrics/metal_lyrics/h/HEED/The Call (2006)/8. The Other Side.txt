I wonder where I'll go, without you hear.
I wonder what I'll do, so far away from you...

Naive orbs, I could see the pain there.
Hiding away from times of that day...
Naive orbs are we hiding away.
From life that we hold still so precious, now?

I wonder where I'll go, without you hear.
I wonder what I'll do, so far away from you...

Signs, the spirit is free.
Rain through eyes out of me.
When desire claims our pride.
We'll meet on the other side.

Closing doors, from the silence 'round us.
Hiding away from life yesterday.
Search no more, for the hero will say;
No life can we hold yet so precious, more!

I wonder where I'll go, without you hear.
I wonder what I'll do, so far away from you...

Signs, the spirit is free.
Rain through eyes out of me.
When desire claims our pride.
We'll meet on the other side.

Their hearts forever yearn...
Like fire burn!
In skies they'll meet again, eternally.

Signs, the spirit is free.
Rain through eyes out of me.
When desire claims our pride.
We'll meet on the other side.

Signs, the spirit is free.
Rain through eyes out of me.
When desire claims our pride.
We'll meet on the other side.
