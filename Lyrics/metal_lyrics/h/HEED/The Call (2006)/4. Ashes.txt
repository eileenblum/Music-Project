Curse.
I bleed.
My sorrow so hollow.

In the dusk of eternity where agony
like fire flows in veins.
There in heart lies a secret that beckons.
All the tears I cried that made me see
that life is not endless.
In my dungeons I keep the bliss. The bliss...

Locked in chains by the glorious and notorious
in shadows how I crawl.
Now I try, search the reason to live here.
All the years that died couldn't make me see
that mind is fooled by fear.

In the ashes I crawl again.
Not free.
In the ashes I crawl again.

Curse.
I bleed.
My sorrow so hollow.
I feel inside, with pure power I will rise again.

Make me believe.
The words that you give to me.
All lies I can see and you fade away.

Growing strength from my hatred gives
and with passion thrills,
determined oath to reign.
When I rise up from ashes to haunt you.
All the years that died, my hate denied,
now I will give the flame...

From the ashes I rise again.
Now free.
I will never remain the same.

Curse.
I bleed.
My sorrow so hollow.
I feel inside, with pure power I will rise again.

Make me believe.
The words that you give to me.
All lies I can see and you fade away.

I can see the truth of life. - Make me believe.
Deep inside there lies a vision. - The words that you give to me.

Now I'm free my dreams complete.
Ashes are dust, eternally.
