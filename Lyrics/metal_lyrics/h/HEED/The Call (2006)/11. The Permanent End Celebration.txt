Here I lay beneath the alter cold.
In a dream I used to see myself this way.
Now I know a time will come for me
and a day this mourning will become real...

Reach for the hand that will take you in
and pray, for your prayer will be the last one.
(Father)
Clean all your sins in the holy water,
Spiritus sanctus and bless our sons...

Far away from life, another sun another moon.
The semblance look so real but still.
I can feel grief as I waiting for you, by my side,
The rain and I fall like, tears...

Reach for the hand that will take you in
and pray, for your prayer will be the last one.
(Son)
Clean all your sins in the holy water,
Spiritus sanctus and bless our sons...

Take away my sorrows.
Take away my pain.
Take away my troubles.
And I walk from shadows...

Reach for the hand that will take you in
and pray, for your prayer will be the last one.
(Holy)
Clean all your sins in the holy water,
Spiritus sanctus and bless our sons...
(Ghost)

Reach for the hand that will take you in
and pray, for your prayer will be the last one.
Clean all your sins in the holy water,
Spiritus sanctus and bless our sons...
