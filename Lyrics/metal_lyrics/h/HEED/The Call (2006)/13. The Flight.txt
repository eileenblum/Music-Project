[Japanese Bonus Track]Under the surface and under the skin,of a snake in the land, of the last of the lion tribe.
There's a secret...
Facing the darkness of power and madness, the all seeing eye is watching our every move.
From the high towers...

But we stay strong, brave all the way home...

We take the flight we race the world, in blood we unite.
In wonderful supreme delight... We take the flight.
We take the flight in dreams unite, falling through the pure rainbow...

Crying for vengeance the lion deserved it the slaughter is smiling the reaper is coming soon...
To his victim.
Blinded by fire, Achilles denial, the venom is working its way through the liar and I search the truth in life...

So we stay strong, brave all the way home...

We take the flight we race the world, in blood we unite.
In wonderful supreme delight... We take the flight.
We take the flight in dreams unite, falling through the pure rainbow...

We take the flight we race the world, in blood we unite.
In wonderful supreme delight... We take the flight.
We take the flight in dreams unite, falling through the pure rain.
We take the flight in dreams unite, falling through the pure rainbow...
