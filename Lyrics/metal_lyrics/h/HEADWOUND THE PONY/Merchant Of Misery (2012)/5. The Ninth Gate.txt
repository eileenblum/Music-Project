I have bathed in the rivers of hell and destroyed the heavens you love so dearly. The earth will burn where my feet have trodden, my hands will be stained with the blood of the fallen. Sin has taken over and has flushed the light, darkness has begun its almighty reign. I am the one who extinguished the flame, I am the one who banished the ghost, I am the stigmata the spear in your side. My vengeance is cruel and malicious, I will oil my hatred machine with the blood of humanity. This is the end. Fall to your knees sons and daughter of the father and exalt me. Unleashing the seventh circle of hell upon the world, society will crumble with the abundance of violence. My reign can begin to take course, welcome to the new world order.
