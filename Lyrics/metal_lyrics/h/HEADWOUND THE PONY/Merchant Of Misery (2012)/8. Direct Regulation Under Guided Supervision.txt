With a single drop the mind becomes at ease. A yearning I require to please. Risen from the earth to a higher plain deliver me from the brink of insanity. I love what this feels like, I lust for what this gives me. A blanked mind that results in mental peace, watch me walk the line as they pass through my teeth. A destructive vice taken without concern. Time slows down as I start to take a turn. The bitter taste upon my tongue. Ill-advised and nonsensical consumption to mange a brief interruption to properly function. Deliver me to a place where I can seep into the ground. Deliver me.
