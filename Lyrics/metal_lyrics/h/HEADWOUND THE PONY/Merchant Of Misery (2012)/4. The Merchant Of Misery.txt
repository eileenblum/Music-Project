I will stand upon the podium the bringer of death, the alpha and omega of this wretched earth. My place in history is fixed in stone, the worst plague this earth has ever known. My practices you will ultimately shun, bow before me as my will be done. I take from the land what isnât rightfully mine as I destroy you soul body and mind. I will be inscribed in the annals of history as the ruler of land and the merchant of misery. The earth will burn and humanity scorched, from your homes you will be violently forced. I will eat and devour this world completely because it fucking belongs to me. It belongs to me.
