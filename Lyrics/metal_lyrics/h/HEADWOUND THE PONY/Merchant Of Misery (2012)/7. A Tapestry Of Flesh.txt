I take my scalpel to your filthy flesh, the ultimate self-control test. The potential cannibalistic feast or gore induced art masterpiece. The sickly feel of the first incision, a rampant murder inclined decision. This is not a crazed obsession itâs a human artwork progression. Tear you apart limb from limb separating the good from sin. Arranging the parts so delicately, an artwork presented for all to see. The rush involved is overwhelming, when it ends there is no telling. A maniacal artwork no more no less, the presentation so immensely grotesque. The final touches put in place, the deformed mess glass encased. Seen by all your final sleep, upon my wall youâre mine to keep. This is not a crazed obsession itâs a human artwork progression.
