Reclamation of the land. Destructive forces that kill the earth will become the factor that unravels societyâs threads. Mother nature is pulsating with anger she grows ever so weary of our wanton destruction. Remove and discard the eyes of man, for they have never been open. As a new era begins we will be the ones extinct. Remove and discard the eyes of man. Walk with me beneath the trees, listen to the stories of misery told, the pain endured by the hands of man all in the name of progression. Rising waters encroach on cities, life, as we know it, it is gasping for air.
