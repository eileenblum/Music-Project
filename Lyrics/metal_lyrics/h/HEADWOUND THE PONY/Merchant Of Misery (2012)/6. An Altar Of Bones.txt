Meticulously and carefully I roam these streets, a though towards a final place in history. Mutilated with such precision, finalising the body with mechanical vision. This enriching and consuming procedure, transforming from man to creature. Historyâs hard to forget feature. I will stand the test of time as the diabolical teacher. Searching for you will provide me the ultimate chase, for a certain type I do have unquenchable taste. Years of suffering and misguided investigation, atrocities that will finally cease a nation. I roam these streets. I roam with mechanical vision.
