Alive again, I walk as a hollow statue of meat. My eyes filled with hatred and hunger for all. Long ago my heart stopped its beat, I walk with one terrible goal. Risen from the earth to walk again feeding on souls of men. A living carcass none are safe from me. I am a rotting menace, there is no escape. Risen from the earth sucking life from the world. My brother brothers risen again to unleash terrors untold, I am a rotting menace sucking life from the world. Feeding on every last one that comes within our grasp. There is a new future watch us erase the past. The revenant scourge will infect the lands with a disease, breaching the void the resurrected. A misanthropic race breaches the void prepare yourself.
