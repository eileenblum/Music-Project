So it begins the day we've feared is upon us
The walls are - the walls are closing in
We close our eyes as we number our transgressions
The dawn approaching and we've only just begun
The days of redemption are gone
Gone forever

When will we see our worst fears are coming true
The monsters that we seek are just faces in the mirror

Did we ignore as we were warned in phases
A beastly mark exchanged for so much more
The suffering will be forever
Engulfed in flames in pain reaching for the surface

The days of redemption are gone
Gone forever

No time for forgiveness the last degree befalls me
How i wished I'd known that this would be my eternity
To burn forever in the pit of Belial
With the sons of fire

When will we see our worst fears are coming true
The monsters that we seek are just faces in the mirror
