Iâm down on my knees
What lay before me but ruin and misery
Now in deep reflection I see
That we are solely to blame
Imprisoned, our own words
Separate us from our hearts
We longed for, something more
So we sacrificed it all
Bathed in doubt I scream
Should this fate befall me
I surely was pure in deed
Or am I rightly
Placed in these guilty chains
Face to the earth in shame
In my disbelief
I tried to flee, but the jury convicted me
The charges I stand before
Guilty of searching for something more
Searching for something more
