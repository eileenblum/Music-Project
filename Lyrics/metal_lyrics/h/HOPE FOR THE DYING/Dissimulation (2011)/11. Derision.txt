Oh bringer of foreverâs fires, where is your victory
Destroyer of souls, devourer, where is your sting
How the oppressor has ceased, your insolence failing
Your minions descend the grave
Your image revolting
Where is your sting
Oh prince of darkness
The savior commands you
For your rebellion
You will ascend no more
The time is drawing nigh
Your supremacy ending
The end of your reign approaches
Atonement is waiting
Weâve set our eyes to Zion
