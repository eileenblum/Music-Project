Once I believed
The very air I breathed
To be the only life Iâd need
Lost and alone
Tattered and torn
My heart cries out
My soul cries out
Now here I stand, strong as I am
Unable to bear all these burdens alone
Take, take all these fears
I give them to you, I cast them on you
Set me on fire, Iâm alive
