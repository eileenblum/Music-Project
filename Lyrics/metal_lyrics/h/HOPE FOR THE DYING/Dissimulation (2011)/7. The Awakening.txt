I am wasting away
The desires of my mind left
A shameful path walked by a man
Surely unworthy of grace
And I have no one to blame
And no one to take the pain away
Iâve had my life
Hit the bottom multiple times before my eyes
So Iâm left wasting away, wasting away
But Iâm supposed to believe
That I can be saved
When the life Iâve lead is so despicable
Can I push the limits, be accepted for the things that Iâve done
Behind Closed Doors
For Iâve lived a life that Iâm ashamed of
Will I be forgiven, or abandoned for the secrets I keep
Behind Closed Doors
Never had I imagined Iâd seek forgiveness
And be accepted
Like I had never committed these sins
As I lay filthy, disgusted at my own reflection
I slowly I wonder if Iâll ever end this suffering

So I bide my time
And I lie awake at night
Then I close my eyes
And wonder if Iâll ever wake up
Itâs been too long now
Since I could believe
In places for people like me
To have their sins washed clean
Itâs been too long
Since I believed
Can I be clean
Its been too long
