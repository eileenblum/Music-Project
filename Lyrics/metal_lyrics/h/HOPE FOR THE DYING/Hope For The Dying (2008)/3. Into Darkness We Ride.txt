Forever, man spent searching for answers
Never knowing just what to believe
How can, in this tragedy we call life
Can we be so blind to what's real
Nothing here is permanent
Nothing stays the same
Abandoned and hopeless
we're falling away
We are falling away

So down the narrow road we will travel
Never knowing what lies ahead
Contemplating this choice we have chosen
Will it lead to our life or our death?
So down the narrow road we will travel
Never knowing what lies ahead
Contemplating this choice we have chosen
Will it lead to our life or our death?

For this journey will bring many trials
And these trials will bring many sins
So today we ready our horses
And ride through the darkness, again
This wasteland, no roads fit to travel
Still will not slow us down
This hatred, we are sure to encounter
Is the least of our worries for now
The lights growing dimmer now
The flames seem slow
The darkness consuming the unoccupied gallows we've left down below
Nothing here is permanent
Nothing stays the same
Abandoned and hopeless we're falling away
We are falling away
