I will go, leveling mountains
These will break, I'm not afraid
My eyes now open, from prophet's wisdom
An army burns in front of me
When we see the truth we will be set free
What sit we then, projecting peace and war
Unclean blood no longer clings
What sit we then, projecting peace and war
Unclean blood no longer clings to our hands
I will be strong, as this battle rages
Knowing the end, before it starts
Straining to hear, all of the captain's orders
Rousing myself to die again
When we see the truth we will be set free
Where will you stand
The time is now
The seen and unseen a constant back and forth
But only we decide the worth
