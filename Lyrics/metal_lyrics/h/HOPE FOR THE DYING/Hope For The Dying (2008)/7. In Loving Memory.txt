I never conceived this pain
And I know your time was short, but I never expected
That those words you said would stay with me forever
And those words I said would be the last you heard
But it all is over now, and we'll never have the chance again
I want you to know I'm sorry
(You should have listened to me, you should have listened to me)
All the times I told you how I wanted to know what you believed
I wish I'd have known you're sorry
I never accepted the fact
That I may never see you again
And those words you said cause pain I can't regress
And those words I said never will forget
And those days where we just wasted both our breaths
And I'll never have the freedom of knowing
While I'm here, and I'm screaming these words
But it all is over now, and we'll never have this chance again
I want you to know I'm sorry
(You should have listened to me, you should have listened to me)
And the chance has passed us by, and we both may never meet again
I wished I'd have known you're sorry
I left that way with nothing left to say, nothing to say
But I should have told you...
That I could have been the one to yell you of a Man
Who could have saved your soul and saved me from eternal guilt
And wondering, guessing, when will we meet again
Asking questions like how and why would He would let you die without me even there
To say goodbye or apologize for things that should've been said instead of screamed
And the chance to not spend my life wondering
But no, no, no, no, that chance is gone...
