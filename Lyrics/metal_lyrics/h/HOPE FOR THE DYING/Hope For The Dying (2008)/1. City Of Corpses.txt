You are the walking dead
Will you be turned to ashes
For all your lies
Dear Adelaide,
When will you rest
Your time has come, truly
From the absence of clean hands
Innocence lost

Dragged from the river torrents
Are the bodies of all of you
Your final breath approaches, as death closes in
When will she turn from her lies
Millions of people, will your fate reign down from the sky
On the City of Corpses
Innocence lost

Dragged from the river torrents
Are the bodies of all of your youth
Dear Adelaide,
When will you rest
Your time has come, it's through
The absence of clean hands
Destruction stands before her
The city laid to waste
Their sins have turned to ashes
She sealed her own fate
