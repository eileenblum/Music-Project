I heard the angels say
I wish that we could wake this sleeping city
So desolate
I wish that they'd remove the veil from their face
I heard them say
Yet they remain...
Take their hearts and mold them to everything that you are
Take their souls; ignite them until they burn for you
Make this day, the day your reckoning bestowed
On hungry hearts, the flavor of mercy and justice
Would the angels say
I wish could wake these sleeping people
We see them lay
So beautiful, perfect and perfectly broken
Yet we see them lay
And they remain...
