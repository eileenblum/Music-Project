Pick up your armor
You can survive this
Donât run for cover
You can withstand
Oppose the masses
And show your strength
We can survive this
We can withstand

I hear the trumpets sound
The sky is closing in
The wind carries the clouds
Providing darkness
And as the light slowly slips away
I can feel the earth tremble
I can feel it shake

I slowly open my eyes
Thoughts are grim
A thousand warriors
Sword in hand
Is this the end of me?
Should I martyr and die
Or is it time to change sides

Pick up your armor
You can survive this
Donât run for cover
You can withstand
Oppose the masses
And show your strength
We can survive this
We can withstand

Oh how can it be?
I feel the weight of a blade in my hand
The sun peeks through the clouds
A blinding reflection
Oh, I am but one man
Surely I cannot prevail
What power could this be?
Enough to blind an entire army

Slain
Where once 1000 warriors stood
1000 bodies now lay
Unscathed
I remain standing
My only injury the heat from the blade
