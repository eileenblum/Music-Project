â¦Death â finds us
All of us
Who knows the hour?
But itâs upon us
We canât escape
Our bodies,
Worthless bags of flesh in waiting
Most left just counting down the hoursâ¦

Hours wasted
Days even
I canât believe the time Iâve spent
Toiling away
I was a slave to all of my own demons
Meanwhile my soul was in decay,
In decay

Oh, the end is near
I am not worthy
Oh, what have I done?
My life was wasted

Selfish reasons
Filling the depths of my mind
Ever consuming my thoughts
Mountains climbed and conquered only
Validated my own self-worth
If time allowed
Iâd spread my name across the earth

Redemption seems like a far away fantasy
Am I too late?
To absolve all my sins
As I approach my eternal destiny
Will it be light or darkness I see?

So here it is
My story as it unfolds
How it will end
Soon to be known

Chiseled in stone
Here lies the man who
Didnât believe
His heart could be pure
Buried alone
In my final resting place
Even my thoughts
Are fading from form
Cast aside
As if I were nothing
Beneath the Earth
Where souls go to burn

Oh, the end is near
My life was wasted on my selfish reasons
