Time, it passes by â
We are but passengers along for the ride
And all the faces change
But we all know that the scenes remain the same

The sun goes down
We blow the dust off our gloves
Though years have gone by
We find they still fit the same
Another journey for my brothers and I
I light up the torches for again we will ride

Through all the trends of the ages
Those who might tear us down
Through all the friends who betrayed us
We still ride

Never surrendering our focus
Nothing to slow us down
Just when you thought that we were ending
We raise our banner high

We will carry on through sun and storm
Through thick and thin
Regardless of the circumstances we are dealt
The flames burn on
With torches above our heads
We power through
This darkened world once again
Another journey for my brothers and I
Never surrender
Never lay down and die

Through all the trends on the ages
Those who might tear us down
Through all the friends who betrayed us
We still ride

Bringing the sounds of tomorrow
Nothing so slow us down
Though many miles are behind us
We still ride
