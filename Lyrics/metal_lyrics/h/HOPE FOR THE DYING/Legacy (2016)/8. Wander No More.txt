Oh are you lost and broken
And beaten down?
Are you alone and weary
And seeking rest?
Have you forgot your purpose
For being here?
And do you seek the refuge
Your battered body surely needs?

You chose to face it all
Put your back against the wall
And in the event of everything
Breaking you down
You let the flames engulf
What was left of your soul

There is a light we can follow
Look up and wander no more

For all the stars in the sky
Fighting for the chance to outshine
Even if all were combined
Could never cast the same light

All who are weary can find rest
All have received the call
Itâs inside of us all
Inside of us all

Pick up the pieces of your shattered soul
And know that you can find rest
Itâs not too late for all who seek can be absolved
Of any transgression

Sad and broken hearted
Addicted and sick inside
Open up, open your eyes
And wander no more

Never too far gone
To reconcile the past
A new path set before you
So wander no more

There is a light we can follow
Look up and wander no more
There is a light we can follow
Look up and wander no more
