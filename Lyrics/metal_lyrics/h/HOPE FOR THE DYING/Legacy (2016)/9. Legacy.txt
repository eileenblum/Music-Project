Throughout the ages
Mankind left stepping stones along
The path of the righteous
And the road that never leads you home
Destiny turns to history
Then thereâs nothing left
But the lives we touched
And the path we chose to follow

How weâre remembered
Our legacy
It defines us
So stand tall

Hope of the hopeless
Strength for the weak
Look beyond your own desires
The clock is winding down
Its fading fast
The only chance to leave your mark
On this world
In the blink of an eye
Itâs all laid to waste
When youâre gone
And your memory fades
What do you want?
What do you want to remain?

How weâre remembered
Our legacy
It defines us

Crush your fears
Release your doubts
Lay all your burdens down

For even if just one
Rises to battle
Transcends the darkness
To guard the hearts of all the earth
All reformation starts with one
A legacy can save us all

Become a warrior
Stand tall and true
Harden your armor
Let your strength carry you
Pick up your sword
Raise it above your head
Etched in the metal
Is the path you have set

Crush your fears
Release your doubts
Lay all your, your burdens down
Your burdens down

How weâre remembered
Our legacy
It defines us
