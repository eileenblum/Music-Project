Without a sound
Converging on my skin
I feel sick
Itâs coming around
Can I contain the beast within me?
Just this one time, one time

I feel the wretched in the air
And I see it follow me
I feel the wretched in the air
And I see it follow me
I feel the burning inside
Calling me again
I feel the wretched in the air
Feel the wretched in the air

Running scared
Escaping the grip
I can beat this one step at a time

I break fast as I can run
I feel it breathing down my neck
Its gaining ground but I canât let it pull me down
No, it wonât happen again
This wretched curse I will escape
Once and for all
Standing tall
Face to face
Free for all
Eternity

Oh God itâs coming around again
I feel the heat upon my flesh
This unrelenting thirst inside of me
Never satiated
My lips tremble as I say
âI know I said never againâ
But still the need to quench my thirst
It outweighs the demons
I hold inside of me

Living Water
Cleanse my soul
Make your Grace
All I know

I feel the wretched in the air
And I see it follow me
I feel the wretched in the air
And I see it follow me
I feel the burning inside
Calling me again
I feel the wretched in the air
Feel the wretched in the air

Living Water
Cleanse my soul
[4x]
