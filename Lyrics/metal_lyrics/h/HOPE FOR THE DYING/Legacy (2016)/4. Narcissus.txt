It stands to reason
A mans worth is the sum of all his wealth
Possessions he has gathered up

Living it up for the moment
and never slowing down

Lost in the dream
building life on a
foundation of fame,
notoriety
without any shame

Most never knowing
That we were built for so much more

Iâd write my name in stone
standby and watch the world crumble to the ground, crumble to the ground
It wouldnât have any meaning
As even stone is ever fleeting

Like carving your name in the wood of a ship thatâs long been sinking
Our life is lost and forgotten at the bottom of the sea
Selfish, heartless
Constantly searching for our eternity

Build it up till it all starts falling down
and build it up again
Engineers of our own fate
Weâre not giving it up
I am the king of
What I want to rule
But itâs dragging me down
Itâs dragging me down

Build it up till it all starts falling down
and build it up again
Engineers of our own fate
Weâre not giving it up
I am the king of
What I want to rule
But itâs dragging me down

Burn it down
Tear it down

Silver and gold
Valued at nothing
When we are gone
Interchangeable with dust

To regard our souls
Lacking empathy
Will end inâ¦
