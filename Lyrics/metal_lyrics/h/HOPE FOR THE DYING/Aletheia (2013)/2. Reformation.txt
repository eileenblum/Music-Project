Light the torches
Begin the gathering
Lift up your voice
We will be heard
We will be heard

March we as one
The reformation has begun

Across the face of the earth
No mountain too tall
Until our last breath escapes our lips we will not falter

March we as one
The reformation has begun

Our hands have been trained for war
Our fingers prepared prepared for battle
Our shield and fortress our fortress be known
Our only stronghold and our deliverer

March we as one
The reformation has begun
March we as one
The reformation has begun

Go ignite the fires
The eyes of the universe
Have never seen
Lift up the signs
The signs of tomorrow
Behold a message
Soon to be known

The heavens may fall
And the earth melt around us
But we will continue
Marching on

The reformation has begun
