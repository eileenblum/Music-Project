I walked alone
Alone
I walked alone
Alone

The ever approaching horizon
My endless friend and tormentor
My battered skin betrays my convictions
My destination still unknown
I walked alone

How I long for rest
And for the sake of my weary eyes

I am the barren traveler
I am the wayward son
I am the faithless warrior
I am the abandoned one

The ever approaching horizon
My endless friend and tormentor
My battered skin betrays my convictions
My destination still unknown

Oh! Lift me up!
Oh! Lift me up!
And carrie me, carrie me home
I no longer, I no longer wish to walk alone

For so long, I thought I'd walked alone
You were there, You were there all along
You were there, You were there all along

I never walked, never walked alone
I never walked alone
I never walked alone
I never walked alone
You carried me
