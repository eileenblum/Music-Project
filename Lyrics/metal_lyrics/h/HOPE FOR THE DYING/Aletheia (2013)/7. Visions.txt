I wake from sleep
Another morning like any other
Unaware of the events I'm destined to witness
As I fall to the ground
And destruction surrounds me
I am blinded
I am deafened by the blow

Oh how was I to know

I wipe the dust from my eyes
And through the haze
The barren ground where a city used to stand

As smoke makes way
For suffering
Can I believe what I am seeing

Is there nothing left at all

Oh how the earth
Is laid to waste by the touch of your hand

I've walked the streets
Looking for someone, searching for something
And I've only found
Nothing is left for me, nothing here is left for me at all

The stars lose their shine
While nothing but darkness encloses the sky
Then I begin to see
A light in the distance that's calling for me

Oh how the earth
Is laid to waste by the touch of your hand
