I've seen the lost tread the fiery path towards no tomorrow
And I've watched the dead burn a generation to the ground
I saw them burn it down, watched them burn it down

Breathing the smoke as it arrives
Fire reflecting in their eyes

And as the flames slowly burn away any revocation
We face the last chance to turn away from these fallen times
This is our time to rise

We stand by our delusions
We rest in our denial
Who will rise
Who will rise

We can't ignore the writing on the walls
Can't ignore the writing on the walls

And as the ash begins to fall
With final judgment on us all
Nothing left but silence now
Time to reconcile our doubts

We stand by our delusions
We rest in our denial
Who will rise
Who will rise
