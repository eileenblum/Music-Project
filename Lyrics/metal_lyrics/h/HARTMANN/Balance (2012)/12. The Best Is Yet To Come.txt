Come on, dry your eyes
'Cause it's not worth to hold on
No longer sacrifice yourself
For everything that is long gone
Don't cry
For something that ain't worth to keep
I've been through this before
It doesn't matter anymore

I know that life is tough
But you are strong enough
To keep on waiting for the perfect one
And leave the past behind
And someday you will find
That someone waits for you
The bet is yet to come

Some things in life just come and go
They're not meant to stay
But wheels roll on and time goes by
And your pain will fade away
No, I can't tell you how to lead your life
The only thing I know
That in the end it's gonna show

Don't cry
I know that it's not worth to keep
I've been through this before
It doesn't matter anymore
