No one but you and me who's to blame
When the silence comes
Though we tried and tried it's not the same
Though we still holding on

No more we and us, it's all yours and mine
What a difference words can show
I didn't wanna see what I could divine
It's so hard to let go

Maybe my heart will be breaking
Maybe I'll never get over you
Who knows why we both can't stop faking
And it's time to face the truth
To face the truth

These pictures in my head, once so beautiful
They all seem to fade to grey
But I can see clearly now
That these shades of blue
No, they were not meant to stay
