It's been your own decision
Which side to choose
To help was my ambition
But you've refused
So many times that you've denied
My helping hand
And your world's so full of things
I just don't understand

Your soul is growing weaker
Your will just fades away
I see your heart is bleeding
Why do you throw it all to waste

Where is the strong believer
Where is your faith?
And who broke your heart to pieces?
Why did you lose and fall from grace?

Now the die is cast you can't turn it around
Train is running fast, you won't slow it down

So many times I've begged you
To change your ways
But no, nothing seems to stop you
To leave the maze

Oh, you're so close to madness
And I feel your inner fight
A frown so full of sadness
This desperation in your eyes
