Don't speak - I know what you want to say
'Cause all your words are calculated well
There's no leak - incontestable and waterproof
Though all your phrases leave a bad bad smell

You love to keep control, you live to pull the strings
You're silver tongued so you seem to know it all
With a perfect poker face you tell me I'm the king
To just play the ace and see the poor jack fall

I'm growing weak, I'm giving in
Does anybody hear me now?

Can someone save me and take me away from here?
I'm tied down to the track, the train is slowly coming hear
Help me, is there anybody out there who will lend a helping hand
And save me from the fire burning me?

Iron will - you never do give in
You carve the edge no matter who you raze
Go for the kill, not a care how fairly you may win
But the house you built could end up all in flames

And I just don't know why I can't let go
Does anybody hear me now?
