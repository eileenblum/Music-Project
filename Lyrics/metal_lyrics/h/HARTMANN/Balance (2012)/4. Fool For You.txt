When I close my eyes
I see your face still smiling at me
It's hard to understand
But there's nothing else I see
These words you said to me
Have the sweetest sound
Maybe you're no good for me
But it's too late to turn around

No, I cannot turn my eyes from you
No chance to resist - there's nothing I can do

Maybe I'm crazy
But I can't deny I'm a fool for you
And it could be that lately
I'm not the same I used to be
'Cause I'm a fool for you

No matter how I try
I just can't come down
You make me feel so high
That my feet are losing ground
My reason's telling me
Not to lose control
But I'm in too deep
With my heart and soul

No, I cannot turn my eyes from you
No chance to resist - there's nothing I can do
