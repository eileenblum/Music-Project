[originally by Tears For Fears]Shout, shout, let it all out, these are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you, come on

In violent times, you shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white, they really ought to know
Those one track minds that took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye, you shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to

Shout, shout, let it all out, these are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you, come on

They gave you life, and in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice, I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale

Shout, shout, let it all out, these are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you, come on

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind, I'd really love to break your heart
I'd really love to break your heart

Shout, shout, let it all out, these are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you, come on
