Here comes the rain
Walk alone down the sidewalk on new years day
Once beautiful smile
All the memories are fading, fading away

Life comes with pain
And you got lost in the moment no one cheering your name
All the high hopes
They were crashing down the high rope
No one to blame

The memories will bring them back to life
The yesterdays
Applause still ringing in your ears
No one can take it away

From a star he's falling
When the lights go down and out of the dark
There's an audience calling
Take your bow and say your last goodbye

Last curtain call
One more night in the lime light saying
"Love you all"
Show must go on
There's a new name on the marquee
'Cause the world needs a song

And the memories will bring them back to life
The yesterdays
Applause still ringing in your ears
No one can take it away

From a star he's falling
When the lights go down and out of the dark
From above there's a calling
Take your bow and say the last goodbye

I see you then when all the streets end
And no one knows the hour or day
I'll see you there where all the streets end
Wait for me some miles away...
