When I opened up my eyes
I knew that something's gonna happen today
It felt so different than before
All my worries blown away, away

Like earth and time were standing still
Although I know it never will
Now it's time to realize - to come alive

I cannot stop, I can't slow down
No, I don't want to turn around this time
I've been waiting for this all my life
And I have never been so far
Though I was close I never touched the stars
But I was reaching out for all my life

So many chances passing by
Thinking about what is wrong and right
And now I'm really wondering why
Why the hell is took so long to decide

Whatever comes and goes - we'll see
What remains is you and me
The time is now to take the spark
And light up the dark
