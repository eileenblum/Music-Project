You're somehow near but far
And it sometimes feels like watching a stranger
I don't know who you are
But it's plain to see you're suppressing the anger
Can't stand my own resistance
This certain feel of anxiety
You're longing for independence
You're reaching out for liberty

I'm searching for the words
But how could I explain
Although the pain still hurts
I know that something bitter sweet remains

After the love is gone and the heartache is over
And will I be moving on or will I be missing you?

How could it come to this?
What began as spring is now permanent winter
Hour to hour It's hit or miss
And the ice that we dance on is starting to splinter
Could this just be a phase
Or a testament we're bound to fail?
I'm longing for better days
And I wonder what will tip the scales

And if I close my eyes, I feel that we have changed
And something slowly dies - ain't it bitter sweet? Oh, isn't it a shame?
