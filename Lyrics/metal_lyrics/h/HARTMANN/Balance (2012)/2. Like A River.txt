She cries at night trying to let it go
The pain inside it will always show
Apologies are all in vain
And the tears keep falling cause
All the same

One day her time - it will come

Like a river she flows
And hey, here she goes
The end of the show, she's waving
To all your beautiful lies
Like a river

She'll make it right and the end will show
She's gonna take over cause it's her way to go
Yesterday's dreams are all in vain
And the rain keeps falling on her window pane

One day her song will be sung

Oh, oh, here she goes
Here she's coming, keeps on running around
Oh, oh, river flows
Times are changing, river's flowing down
