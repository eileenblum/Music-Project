No doubt, no doubt
You live your life on the edge
But slow down, slow down
You're much too close to the ledge
You know that it's too late to turn around
And now you're standing there
Alone with a frown

You're building your castles made of sand
And it seems you don't ever get tired
And though your personal earthquake is close at hand
You still dance on the wire
You still dance on the wire

Come down, come down
Though you believe you can fly
Shut up, shut up
Why can't you never be quiet

It's hard to understand - you really don't know what I mean
When I tell you that you're living in a dream
You better wake up
Now can't you hear me calling
Don't you see you might be falling down
But you just can't stop
It's hard to keep cool
'Cause you're dyed in the wool
And I bet you won't change
Some things will never change
