Out of reach and out of sight
Running down the streets tonight
And our heds won't turn around
Can you hear the speed of sound
Just believe in me, don't fear to take my hand
You and me are here, this moment's right
We won't get another chance

'Cause you are the one
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
For you - that's true
And I can't go on and on and on
Without telling you that you belong to me
'Cause you are the one

We won't stop to run tonight
Faster than the speed of light
Look inside my heart and you will understand
Why we are here 'cause the time is right
We won't get another chance

Whatever you want me to do for you
Whenever you'll need me - I will be there
