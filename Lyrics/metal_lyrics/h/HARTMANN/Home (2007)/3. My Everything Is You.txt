We started out such a long long time ago
Been up been down I still feel you need to know
Feels like a fantasy you're a fairytale come true
Unlike a world where love can hurt it's another one with you

I may not always say that I love you
But you've showed me what it really means
By giving me every part of you

Everything I ever wanted, everything I ever need
Everything I could imagine, you gave everything to me
I'm nothing without you, my everything...my everything is you

Still can't believe after all that we've been thru
You're all I need, sounds, crazy but it's true

Can't imagine my life without you
It's nothing without you here
I wanna build my world around
You to show you how much I care

I may not always say that i love you
So let me show you how I really feel
By giving you every part of me

Everything I ever wanted, everything I ever need
Everything I could imagine, you gave everything to me
I'm nothing without you, my everything...my everything is you
