It's late at night
Many miles apart from you

I've been out on the road
I didn't know just where it would lead me to

Still I see your face
Smile and waving me goodbye
Oh yeah

Cause I can hear your voice
And it's telling me that
you been waiting, anticipating
Feel my heart is beating fast
The day is coming near

So many places I have been
Felt so lonely
Theres so much I gotta say
That I'm coming home to you
So many things that I have seen
