I see all the pain in your eyes
On the things you've been Through
Your heart is been broken I know
It's not easy for you

But please tell that I'm the one
who will save you from tears
That I'm the one who will blow with all of your fears
All of you fears

So I say come on
lay all your love on me
I say come on lay all your love on me

So soft and warm when I'm laying here touching your skin
So strange but true yes it fells like a new life begins
so please belive me I won't let you fall let's go..never
Belive me that I'm the one who will hold you forever
Forever and ever

So I say come on
Lay all your love on me
I say come on lay all you love here on me

forever and ever

So I say come on lay all your love on me
Yes I say come on lay all your love here on me
So I say come on lay all your love on me
Yes I say come on lay all your love on me..yeah

Uuhhh..uhhh...

And I say come on lay all your love on me
