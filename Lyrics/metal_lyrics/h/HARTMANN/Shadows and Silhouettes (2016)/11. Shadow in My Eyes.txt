I still remember all those long walks, summer days
Time was on our side
We're dreaming through the day, chasing stars at night
No need for anything to say

The days we had together never seemed to end
Time was running slow
The golden grass of a golden fall
We believed that we already had it all

I don't know how this could end
No warning has been sent
These pictures I have, they all start to fade
But your silhouette is still a shadow in my eyes

Now all these years I'd gone to lots of different worlds
Time is passing by
Still chasing through my days, dreaming in the nights
Searching for the reason what went wrong

No I won't forget those endless summer days
And time won't change my mind
In the golden grass of this golden fall
Somehow we already had it all

I don't know how this could end
No warning has been sent
The pictures I have, they all start to fade
But your silhouette will stay a shadow in my eyes

Your silhouette is still a shadow in my eyes
