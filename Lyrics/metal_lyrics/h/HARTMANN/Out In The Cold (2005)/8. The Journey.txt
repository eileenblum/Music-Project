So hart to explain the reasons
The way that I fell
I'm so scared you would change through seasons
Leaving wounds that won't heal

Soft be your wishper
That your love won't change
But words are forever make me fell so strange

How can we stay for this moment
And make it last
Cause maybe it's just an illusion
And I close my eyes for the journey
From future to past

Feeling so soft and warm
When I'm here by your side
I never do you harm no
So don't steal my pride

Staying as one frozen in time
Hold on forever and never melt the ice

How can we stay in this moment
And make it last
Cause maybe it's just an illusion
But I close my eyes for the journey from future to past
We're staying as one
Frozen in time
Hold on forever never melt the ice

How can we stay for this moment
And make it last
Cause maybe it's just an illusion
But I close my eyes for the journey from future to past...

From future to past
From future to past
