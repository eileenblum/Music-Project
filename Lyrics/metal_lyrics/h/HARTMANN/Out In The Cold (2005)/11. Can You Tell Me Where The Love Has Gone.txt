Another night, another day
And in the end there's nothing left to say
There's is no wrong, there's no right
And now we've given up and end this fight

A feeling slipping out of my hands
It's running through my fingers
Like a castle made of sand
there were times when I promissed you the moon
Now it seems like eternity ended much too soon

Can you tell me where love has gone
Where is the felling that used to be so strong
Can you tell how to go on
And the felling
And the felling
All love it has gone

I can't hear the words you say
Though you're close to me I'm far away
I can't see I fell so blind
I'm searching for the reasons I can't find

I can remember how we used to touch
But now we have to face the truth
The truth that hurts so much
There were times when I promissed you the stars
But it seems like infinity
Wasn't very far

Can you tell me where love has gone
Where is the felling that used to be so strong
Can you tell me how to go on
And the feeling
And the felling
Has gone

Can you tell me where love has gone
Where is the felling that used to be so strong
Can you tell me how to go on
And the feeling
And the felling
All love it has gone
