I'm sitting here wasting trying to fight this barrel hagging in my head
Its not for the first time I should have known, should have known

Forever and ever will still true your words still echo in my ears
I was a fool to trust in you...in you

I had learn the warning I saw the sings but look too away
How could I be so depth dumb and blind

It's the same and the same and the same again
I'm drowning in my tears again
But I knew... I knew
And the things I hear will never change theres is no chance to hear again
but I knew... I knew... I knew

I'm so sick and tired listen to you cause ever truth still a lie
And didn't i hear this all before... all before

I'm running in circles each steps run closing to the end
I don't know why I just can't let go

It's the same and the same and the same again
I'm drowning in my tears again
but I knew... I knew
And the things I hear will never change theres nothing we could hear to raise
but I knew... I knew...yes I knew

It's the same and the same and the same again I'm drowning in my tears again
Yes I do... I do
And the things I hear will never change theres nothing we could hear to raise
but I knew... I knew

It's the same and the same and the same again
It's the same and the same and the same again
