I Walk down to the river through ice and snow
But it won't make me shiver despite the cold
I feel the,I feel the fire
Cause I just can't still this burning desire

It's burning under my skin
This feeling that I never Knew
And I won't stop this sin
Cause the reason,the reason is you

I've been searching for you
All through the night
I'm out of the dark into the light

And I follow the moonlight down the stream
It seems I walk on the inside of my dreams

Once I drifted endlessly
I through I'd never stop to roam
Now this sweet voice is calling me
And it feels like,like I'm coming home
