Another morning when you raise your weary head
Your eyes keep staring at the wall
So tired of all this thoughts that seem to drive you mad
And no solutions coming on

All this questions bother you it seems so hard to make choice
If you want to find the answer
You have to use your inner voice

When you're lost in all your doubts
And you think there's no way out
Try to close your eyes and listen to your heart
When you can't tell wrong from right
And you think that black is white
Open up inside and listen to your heart

Your head is humming cause you don't know what to do
No chance or way to make it right
And everybody talks and know what is best for you
And they all have some great advice

All this questions bother you it seems so hard to make choice
If you want to find the answer
You have to use your inner voice

When you're lost in all your doubts
And you think there's no way out
Try to close your eyes and listen to your heart
When you can't tell wrong from right
And you think that black is white
Open up inside and listen to your heart
