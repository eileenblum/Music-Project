The promise is broken
Cause you have been gone
Truth has been spoken
And the damage is done

It's the thinking by this moment I beg you to stay

Now I'm standing here in the rain
With nothing to say
Cause you just ran away

Why did you leave me here out in the cold (out in the cold)
And why do I feel like my soul has been sold (out in the cold)

It hurts me I don't get
You out of my head
And maybe you won't remember
Things I never forget

Its so hard to get over you, day by day
The only thing that were last is pain
Price you won't pay
Cause you just ran away

Why did you leave me here out in the cold (out in the cold)
And why do I feel like my soul has been sold (out in the cold)

Why did you leave me here out in the cold (out in the cold)
And why do I feel like my soul has been sold (out in the cold)

Why did you leave me here out in the cold (out in the cold)
And why do I feel like my soul has been sold (out in the cold)

Out in the cold
