I called you brazen, called you whore right to your face
And watched you silently in publicly disgrace
I didn't notice that you strike for like a vice
That you were trembling and burned beneath the ice

Why don't you weep when I hurt you
Why don't you weep when I catch you
You don't bleed and the anger fells up inside

Why don't you weep when I hurt you
Why don't you weep when I catch you
You don't bleed and the anger fells up inside

You said a prayer I betrayed you with a kiss
You never realized that all are come to this
So keep you dignity don't throw it all to waste
Strong your feelings than you've ever learned to face

Why don't you weep when I hurt you
Why don't you weep when I catch you
You don't bleed and the anger fells up inside

Why don't you weep when I hurt you
Why don't you weep when I catch you
You don't bleed and the anger fells up inside
