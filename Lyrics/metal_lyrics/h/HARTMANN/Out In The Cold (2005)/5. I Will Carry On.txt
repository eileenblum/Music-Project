I see the sunlight fading away
And I know this is no place to stay
Guess it's time to leave

I'm never running on to the past
Cause the good times and things never last
To some sweet sweet memories

So I will run fast as I can
Even this long road never ends
And I will carry on until I know where I belong
And I will carry on

The price that you paid and love that you chose
Sometimes I'm not sure or to win or to loose
When I'm leaving all behind

The love that you give and tears that you bleed
I don't wanna hurt you but I'm not what you need
You stay forever in my mind

And I will run fast as I can
Even this long road never ends
And I will carry on until I know where I belong
Yes I will carry on
Till my time has come

Run fast as I can
Even this long road never ends

So I will run fast as I can
Even this long road never ends
And I will carry on until I know when where I belong

So I will run fast as I can
Even this long road never ends
And I will carry on until I know when where I belong

I'll carry on oh oh
