Was addicted on endless poison
Day by day
Love was like a distant shore
A million miles away

I couldn't hide away this shadow
Hanging over me
I think I lost my faith in everything
That I once believed

No where to run
No where to hide
I only wish that I could die
But then you came and turn my darkness into light

And I'm alive again
I fell it running trough my veins
And I get high again
Yes I'm so alive again

Like a stranger to myself
Numb and empty inside
I thought it might be destiny
To let my senses die

But now I'm looking into these eyes
I see the love that I never knew
All my life I have been waiting
For someone like you

No mountain high
No valley low
No river seems to stop me now
I know that you're that one to catch me when I fall

And I'm alive again
I fell it running trough my veins
And I get high again
Yes I'm so alive again

And I'm alive again
I fell it running trough my veins
And I get high again
So high again
