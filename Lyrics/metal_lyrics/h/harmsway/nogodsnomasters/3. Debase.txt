Confined to my own mind. Waiting to die with every breath. Every second that Iâm alive, the more I hate the world around me. Inflicting pain, my mind is racing. Tie the noose born to lose, All the good in my life does not outweigh the pain I feel. I didnât ask to be put on this earth, but now I suffer hoping for the end. I want to watch the world burn to ashes as long as I live in misery. Wipe my hands from this. Iâve had enough. Wipe my hands from this, this is hell. Cover pain with hate. Cover my pain I canât take it.
