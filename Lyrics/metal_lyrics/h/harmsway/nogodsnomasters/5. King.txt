I wonât bow to a king or god. I do what I want when I please. No laws, no morals will stop me. Nothing will cage me. I wonât follow the sheep. I wont ever be shackled down. I live for myself and no one else. No master will rule. Destroying those who claim me or hold me back. I wonât follow follow the sheep. I wonât ever be shackled down. It will wear the crown.
