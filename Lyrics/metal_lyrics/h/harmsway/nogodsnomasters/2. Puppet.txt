Religion: the downfall of man. Do as they do, do as they say. Reciting a book of lies. Mold them to fit your life. Living slave, masters reign, living not to die in vain. Deny truth and you donât know why. Heaven and hell is what you live for. To pray and save, we all die anyway. False god, youâre just a puppet to faith. Born to die for him. You were told to worship so you would be free from sin. Never question. You chose your path rotting your mind. Itâs too late to turn back.
