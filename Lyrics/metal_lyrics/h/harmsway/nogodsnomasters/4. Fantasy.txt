Ideals plaguing every thought, skewing your view of reality. You try to save the world, but itâs too late. The books that weâve read are filled with lies. Go ahead and protest and waste your life. You think youâll change the world but unfortunately, you wonât change a thing. I believe in nothing. This world has failed. Your world is just a fantasy. To it you are nothing and thatâs not hard to see. Your world is just a fantasy.
