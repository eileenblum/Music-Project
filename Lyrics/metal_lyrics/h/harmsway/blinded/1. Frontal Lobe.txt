something's wrong
no place to turn
who can help
watch it burn
i've hoped for life
to rid all my pain
what do i have
i'm doomed, insane

am i selfish
is this real
i'm in denial
of how i feel

i'm cold and alone
search to be free
i never wanted this
guilt in me

torment builds
it takes its toll
broken hopes
broken soul
i did it right
with nothing to show
as i fail
my hate grows

falling, to an end
falling, i descend
falling, to an end
falling, i descend

save me from this hell
free me from my cell
