suffer

war in my mind
failed human kind
haunted by the past
can't escape this mess
strive inside to be
the world's enemy
what's good is left
nothing but regret

failing me
ease the guilt
pain will stay
live this way

the difference was in me
to be a better man
forgive me as i plea
i'm down on my knees

failing me
ease the guilt
pain will stay
live this way

look around at all this waste
another roach, another face
subhuman acts, can this be
live to loathe

stupid minds, a disconnect
clean the streets, of this mess
they never learn
my cycle ends
live to loathe
loathe this life
