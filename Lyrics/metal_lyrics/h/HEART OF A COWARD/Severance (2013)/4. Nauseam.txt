One second more of this
And we will lose our minds
Walking the path amidst the snake
And the vultures

I'll skin their words alive
To see what's deep inside
Manipulation and a breakdown
Of cultures

You'll point the finger
But the failure is your own
You'll bit the hand
That fucking feeds you

Been disconnected from your heart
For far too long
Now you're feeding up
The poison

Where will you go
Cause every bridge fucking burns
There will no sleep tonight
A life worth living
A lesson learned

Regression
Confusion

You'll be the very thing
That you make out to despise
You'll turn your back on the
Truth you need to see

And to be hated is your
Deepest
Darkest fear
But that's exactly what you'll be

Where will you go
Cause every bridge fucking burns
There will be no sleep tonight
A life worth living
A lesson learned
Where will you go

Cause every bridge fucking burns
There will be no sleep tonight
A life worth living
A lesson learned

Look for wolves amidst the sheep
As they pray upon the weak
The enemy lives inside of
ME

All victims
Of a common mindset
