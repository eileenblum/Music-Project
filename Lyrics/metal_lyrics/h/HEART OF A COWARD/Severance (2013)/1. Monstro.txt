We won't be stopped

This place is no longer familiar
A stranger to all that you see
Trying in vain to conceal the cold fear in your eyes
Fear that strengthens me
We are the thorns in your spine
The voices that whisper in the back of your mind

We walked the circles of hell
No turning back now, we've come too far to fail

We won't be stopped

(Strength)
The strength that flows through me
(Flows)
Is flowing endlessly
Through all of the years it's only me that stands over you

Weakened by our anger, we were dangerous and on the edge
Beaten and broken with barely a breath, but alive (we are alive)
Moving like shadows at night
Patiently waiting in darkness, to embrace the light

We walked the circles of hell
No turning back now, we've come too far to fail

This shift cannot be denied
You can feel the imminent change
Now we are coming of age
We'll never fade away

I know we won't be stopped

No we won't be stopped
