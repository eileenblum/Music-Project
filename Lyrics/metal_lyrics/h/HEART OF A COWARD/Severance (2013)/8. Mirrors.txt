We will overcome
We will scream from the top of our lungs
This the end

Our anger will not be extinguished
Their ignorance fanning the flames
No justification for their existence at all
So much to prove
Nothing to say

A collision of faces and names
Your social position - words on a page
Baring ourselves without shame for hollow friends
When will it end?

And through this war
Weâve lost the way
These mirrors now bear no real reflection at all
But youâll know my name

We will overcome
We will scream from the top of our lungs
This world is ours

Such satisfaction to see us go under
Just the reaction of fools
What matters most to you?
Look in the mirror and ask yourself

Who am I?

Do you have the will to fight
For what you believe in?
Waiting the rest of our lives
Is our only weakness

[Chorus]

And through this war
Weâve lost the way
These mirrors now bear no real reflection at all
But youâll know my name
