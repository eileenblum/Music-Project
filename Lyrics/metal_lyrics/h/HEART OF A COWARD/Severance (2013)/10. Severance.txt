To live this flagrant lie any longer is insanity
Weâre falling right into a trap we laid ourselves
In a false sense of security
And now weâre paying the price
For all our foolish transgressions
Cowering away from the light
Leaning toward the depression

But now itâs clear that all those days are far behind us
This is the turning point where we will finally witness
The day our futures are no longer in question
Donât say a word, just stay the fuck out of our business

All hope we had was slipping away
All we are has started to change
Severance
From this world

And now the time has come for us to be stronger
This life is more than just survival of the fittest
The day the weight of our regrets will be no longer
Be the weakness that will make all the difference

And now itâs clear that all those days are far behind us
This is the turning point where we will finally witness
The day our futures are no longer in question
Donât say a word, just stay the fuck out of our business

All hope we had was slipping away
All we are has started to change
Severance
From this world

Worlds apart
Where no-one knows where a change of heart begins
Alone
Carry on,
But no-one will know which way to go ahead

Walk into the dark, where the nightmares are becoming so real
Where the air doesnât quite taste the same, where the shadows are speaking our names
Is a stranger a friend that just hasnât arrived in our lives, or maybe theyâre just another cold face to despise
Time passes slowly by- our light begins to fade
Make the choice to live or to dieâ¦.we must not fail
We must learn to look further than inches in front of our withering eyes
Now this failureâs no longer an optionâ¦we are strongâ¦we will rise!
