Why try to hide, what's inside your heart
When it's written all over your face
The very sight of you a burden to me
I long to break from your cycle (of deceit)
What is really even left of you?
Is their any decent person left?
Your very presence is a haze of disdain
You're like a parasite eating away.

Now answer me thisâ¦
Are you happy with your life?

How do you live with yourself?

How do you sleep at night?

No-one to call on when you're left here alone
You made your bed here now this hell is your home
Nothing to do now but just curl up and die
Psychophant -Your life is a lie

Now I know that you cannot be helped
Your life's a car crash and you won't wear a belt (go to hell)
Your obsession with your status and wealth
You make a mockery of yourself.

Did you think this day would come,
Did you think the past would fix itself,
Now your future lies in ruins.
Did you think this day would come,
Did you think the past would fix itself,
Now your left here alone.

Now answer me this - Are you happy with your life?

How do you live with yourself?

How do you sleep at night?

No-one to call on when you're left here alone
You made your bed here now this hell is your home
Nothing to do now but just curl up and die
Psychophant -Your life is a lie
