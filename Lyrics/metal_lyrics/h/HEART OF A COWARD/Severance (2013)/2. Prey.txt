We have failed in such countless ways
All the memories, all of the wasted days
Another life spent, another regret
Another heart full of blind hatred
Held back by resentment we shared, now our torment is over
Face our fears and learn to reflect
We're better than this, than drowning in human nature

There is no chance to redeem ourselves
Nothing to say when the damage is done
It's time to move on
Reclaim our lives again

We have become the new breed of slave
Our obsession the respect that we crave
In the end we're only wasting away
So let's learn to live this life for today

Live!

This is our time
Our time to rise up

We can be all we want to become
We can be all we want to become

Rise up!

There is no way to deny our crimes
Nowhere to run when the truth is right there
And it's staring you, glaring at you
You tried so hard just to walk away

And there's no chance to redeem ourselves
Nothing to say when the truth is right there
And the damage is done
It's time to move on
Reclaim our lives again

We have become the new breed of slave
Our obsession the respect that we crave
In the end we're only wasting away
So let's learn to live this life for today
