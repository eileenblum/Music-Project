Looking back
Tell me what the fuck are you
Expecting of me, filthy betrayer?
What youâve done, time wonât heal or pacify
for this is time Iâll never relinquish

And every scar from you
Falls away with every layer of skin that Iâm shedding
âTil the flesh and bone has been hardened like this heart of stone
Get up, look at me, tell me what do you think you can see
Is it the person that you knew, or am I stronger than youâll ever know
And if you want to know why
Just look in my eyes

Fear is nothing tonight
Iâm still alive
I know soon I will be one with the thunder
One more second of light
Cos Iâm still alive
And now nothing will keep pulling me under

Looking back
Thereâs no doubt left in my mind
You arenât the same as regular people
Outcast.
What youâve learned, can be easy to define
âThe pain that youâll remember foreverâ

Fear is nothing tonight
Iâm still alive
I know soon I will be one with thunder
One more second of light
Cos Iâm still alive
And now nothing will keep pulling me under

Beneath the waves
Gone forever
