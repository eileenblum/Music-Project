Lay this on me
Hear my secrets
Stay here with me
Close this distance

I give it all to you
I'll raise my guard
The only one who ever
Knew me at all
I've waited for so long
I've tried so hard
I've lied to you but you can see right through me

The consequences of my actions
I'd do anything to take it back
I hope you understand
Your wish is my command
I give my life in your hands

There's a promise that I made to you
That we'll last forever
Just know that when you're alone
We're in this together
And I will be there right by your side
When your heart feels like breaking
There is nothing to hold us back
This is ours for the taking

You shift from me
To deep waters
When you reached for my hand
I felt your strength subside
I pulled you up, but the life had nearly left your eyes
And for a second, I thought you were gone
But you were there, all along

I face the aftermath of my attacks
But I'd do anything to take it back
I'll take you to the end and bring you back again
I leave my life in your hands

There's a promise that I made to you
That we'll last forever
Just know that when you're alone
We're in this together
And I will be there right by your side
When your heart feels like breaking
There is nothing to hold us back
This is ours for the taking

In the face of failure,
Things will all fall apart
Find your inner strength
Search inside your heart
