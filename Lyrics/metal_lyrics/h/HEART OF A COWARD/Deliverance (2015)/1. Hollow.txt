Welcome home
And dive into a world so blind
Your life decided since the day you were born
All along you felt the dark presence
So hard to believe your conscience was torn
And with each passing moment itâs becoming even harder to breathe
You remain on the path you have chosenâ¦as an oxygen thief
Force it down
Swallow your prideâ¦embrace the sadness
Force it down
The architect of your own madness
The world is ash and dust
(Burn, burn)
We are so Hollow
And when tomorrow comes our dreams will die with us
(Burn, burn)
We are so hollow
With dead eyes
You lie to friends and to family
You wore the badge of your decline
To blind to see the way you spread your fucking sickness over everyone you meet
We built foundations on friendshipâ¦now we are nothing but strangers
Your degradation is just sickening to behold
A product of your failures
Our world is ash and dust
(Burn, burn)
We are so Hollow
And when tomorrow comes our dreams will die with us
(Burn, burn)
We are so hollow
A shallow life riddled with holes
Whoring yourself as you bare your soul
Head in your hands
Questioning why no one cares when you lose controlâ¦
Hollow
