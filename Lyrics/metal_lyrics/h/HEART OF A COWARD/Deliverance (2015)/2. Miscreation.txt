Now thereâs nothing left
Weâve spread ourselves too thin
Crawling at the walls
The darkness closing in
A cage within a cage
Weâre left to rot in this cerebral maze
Forever lost
Deafened by the silence of our own restless minds
Servants of damnationâ¦no will to unify
A perfect miscreation
A perfect lie
Blind to the grave
Nothing can change that now
Blind to the grave
No one can save us now
Sickness
We breathe it in tonight to witness our decline
Final transformation
Pure hatred will arise
Breath in this pestilence under these blackened skies
A perfect miscreation
A perfect lie
Blind to the grave
Nothing can change that now
Blind to the grave
No one can save us now
Denial of our existence
We fabricate the path to least resistance
Repopulateâ¦
Born to sow the seeds of hatred and procreate
This, the mirror of our nature- to devastate
Crushed beneath the waves
