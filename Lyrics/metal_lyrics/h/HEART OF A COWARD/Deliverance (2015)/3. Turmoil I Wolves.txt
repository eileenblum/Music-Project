Our time has come
Weâve come undone
The ground that shakes beneath usâ¦stained red with blood
A grave of many secrets charred by the sun
Weâll show no signs of weakness
We are amidst the wolves
Brace your fucking selves
Barely alive
Nothing but another drone in a hive
You stand alone upon the wreckage of a broken home
We are reborn in the eye of the storm
Weâll gather up the strength to try
But again and again weâll fucking fail
And this is all that we know
The malnutrition of a dying soul
We are the chosen ones

Now you will come undone
Sacred hate
Take the weight
Bear it on your bones
Sacred hate
Fill the graves
Fodder for the crows
Our resistance led to where we are now
We are amidst the wolves
And we wonât back down
Weâre counting down these numbered days
Weâll try and try
Yeah again and again weâll fucking fail
You smile as you watch us suffer
You will behold your downfall with horror
We are thirsty for perversity
We laugh in the face of adversity
We are the chosen ones
Now you will come undone
Sacred hate
Take the weight
Bear it on your bones
Sacred hate
Fill the graves
Fodder for the crows
Our resistance led to where we are now
We are amidst the wolves
And we wonât back down
A grave of many secrets charred by the sun
We are the chosen ones
Now you will come undone
A grave of many secrets charred by the sun
Weâll show no signs of weakness
We are amidst the wolves
But you must die before
you can be born again
Sacred hate
Take the weight
Bear it on your bones
Sacred hate
Fill the graves
Fodder for the crows
Our resistance led to where we are now
We are amidst the wolves
And we wonât back down
