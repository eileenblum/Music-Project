Dark circles around the eyes
Open wounds that you can no longer hide
A matter of the heart that splits you in two
Itâs starting to unleash the demon in you
Oh Godâ¦something is very wrong
I feel it in my bones and now I just canât seem to decipher
Though I knew it all along youâd find out on your own
The fear of being alone is what drives you on
Open up the mouth of madness
Open it up
And is this what you want?
Is this what you envisioned?
I donât know who you are anymore
And is this what you want?
To remain in your prison
Where you wont see the light anymore
A different day but youâre still in the same shit
Youâll resist but you can no longer take it
A matter of the heart that splits you in two
Until thereâs nothing fucking left of you
Oh God...how can we start to win
And where do we begin to figure out what weâre meant to fight for
When all sides are just the same
They play the same old games and when you canât tell one from the other â¦
Now somethingâs wrong
Open up the mouth of Madness
Open it up
And is this what you want?
Is this what you envisioned?
I donât know who you are anymore
And is this what you want?

To remain in your prison
Where you wont see the light anymore
