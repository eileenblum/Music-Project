Morning repairs
The woe from yesterday
(And when weâre)
Scared to awaken
To all that should remainâ¦
Itâs all we know
With one step forward thereâs always two to take back
I know thereâs always something
An itch Iâll need to scratch
Oh when will life
Feed my desire
Rise up
Walk in this fire
The barely beating hearts
Now so polluted
Our veins with poison swell
The stench of suicide
We forged in our own hell
Now we piss on skeletal remains
Forsake our forefathers for our worldly gains
Mistrusting
Disgusting
Walk in this fire
