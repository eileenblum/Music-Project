This planet is on a different frequency
Our minds are tuned back into insanity
With every means of perversion, the human lifeline recedes
An epidemic of blindness
Seduction and spreading of seed
The Devil pulls on the strings that make us dance
This human plague is insignificant
Weâll fail like those before
The rabid bite of these dogs of war
The hopes of every man
They are lost forever- like a grain of sand
No weâll never understand
How it slips through our hands
Like a grain of sand
Resplendent retaliation
The spiral of life now unwinds
The poisons that we all depend on
Our love and our hatred entwined
The Devil pulls on the strings that make us dance
This human plague is insignificant
Weâll fail like those before
The rabid bite of these dogs of war
The hopes of every man
They are lost forever- like a grain of sand
No weâll never understand
How it slips through our hands
Like a grain of sand
Our minds are tuned back into insanity
Into insanity
