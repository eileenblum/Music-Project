We will give way to abandon
The weak inherit the earth
A hurricane of pollution
Weâll choke on every word

With a smile we are disarmed
Weâre seduced by horrorâs charm
The temptation of the strong is the downfall of the human swarm
We will give way to abandon
The weak inherit the earth
Well if youâre gonna destroy, then destroy this
Then weâll do it againâ¦Bleed you again
The mark of the iron fist
Yeah if youâre gonna destroyâ¦.gonna destroyâ¦.destroy this
And we will seal it with a bloody kiss
Iron Fist
Pledge allegiance to the voice in your head
To the words that will end us all
Raising the black flag of the dead
The demise of the human swarm
We will give way to abandon
The weak inherit the earth
A hurricane of pollution
Weâll choke on every word
We thought we had control
We were wrong
Well if youâre gonna destroy, then destroy this
Then weâll do it again
Bleed you again
The mark of the iron fist
Yeah if youâre gonna destroyâ¦.gonna destroyâ¦.destroy this
And we will seal it with a bloody kiss
Iron Fist
We will give way to abandon
The weak inherit the earth
A hurricane of pollution
Weâll choke on every word
