Here we make our stand
With heads buried deep in the sand
This cross is ours to bear
But hope is always there
When will life
Feed my desire

We arise
Walk in this fire
When will life
Feed my desire
We arise
Walk in this fire
Walk in this fire
When will life
Feed my desire
We arise
Walk in this fire cos we wont fall at the last step that we take
Our bodies wont break
Weâll end this today
Live like itâs our last
Itâs within our grasp as the final breath enters our lungs
When will life feed my desire
Rise up, walk in this fire
