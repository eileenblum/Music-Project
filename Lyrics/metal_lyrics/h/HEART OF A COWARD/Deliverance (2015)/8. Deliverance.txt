Youâve finally realised what this has done to me
A black horizon stretches as far as the eye can see
I walked away from usâ¦left you to bear these scars
I canât imagine what it must be like inside your heart
And after Severance will come Deliverance
Now your existence is no longer making sense
Iâm getting past the obstacle of your belligerence
A picture of unrest
But I wont ever let it show
Iâll keep it close to my chest
âCos this is pain that youâll never know
If you could see what I can see
It would make you cry
A vision now has come to me
Of the day we die
The day that we die

And I can see it in your eyes
Youâve finally realised what youâve done to yourself
Deal with your pain by inflicting it on someone else
Youâll never have my love
I know you want my life
Patiently waiting for the time to come and twist the knife
And after Severance will come Deliverance
Your existence is no longer making sense
Iâm swimming in the endless filth of your maleficence
A picture of unrest
But I wont ever let it show
Iâll keep it close to my chest
âCos this is pain that youâll never know
If you could see what I can see
It would make you cry
A vision now has come to me
Of the day we die
This is the day that we die
