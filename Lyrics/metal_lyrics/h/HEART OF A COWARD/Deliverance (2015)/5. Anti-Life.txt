This is not what you areâ¦partyâs over son
Take a good look at your life
Take a look at what youâve become
Masochistic
It seems youâve missed a trick
Iâve wasted too much precious time on this bullshit
I can smell the filth that seeps from your skin
You try to hide it but your mask is paper thin
God, you must be thickâ¦you make me fucking sick
You only brought this on yourself
Learn to live with it
You stumble blind
Wasting your time
Living the Anti-life
The world is bearing down
Slowly dying from inside out
Youâll be searching for another to blame
And when they find you I will revel in your pain

Shut your mouth, save your breath for someone who cares
A walking contradictionâ¦your words just make no sense
No one gives a fuck
Just know when to quit
You only brought this on yourself
Learn to live with it
The world is bearing down
Slowly dying from inside out
Youâll be searching for another to blame
And when they find you I will revel in your pain
You stumble blind
Wasting your time
Living the Anti-life
You stumble blind
Wasting your time
And I wont waste any more of mine
You stumble blind
Wasting your time
Living the Anti-life
