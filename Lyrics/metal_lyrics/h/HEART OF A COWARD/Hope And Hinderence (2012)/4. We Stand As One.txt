We're the ones that chase the sky take everything from this life!
We're the ones that'll never die.
Nothing's closer to our hearts.
We're the ones that sacrifice everything for this one life.
We will never fall apart.
I know this will last.
We've come this far we'll not let go.
We've built this world on hollow ground.
We've come this far we'll not let go.
Awaiting a better tomorrow.
Nothing can touch us.
We stand as one!
We're the ones that chase the sky take everything from this life!
We're the ones that will not die.
Nothing's closer to our hearts.
I will stand by you forever.
With this smile I'll walk on.
And I'll stand by you forever.
With this simile I won't turn back.
