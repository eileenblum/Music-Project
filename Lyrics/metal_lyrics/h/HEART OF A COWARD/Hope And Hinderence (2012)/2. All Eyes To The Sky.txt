Show us what's real.
We are waiting for you.
As we call out to the sky tonight, put reason behind us.
We can't see through.
Watch will all eyes to the sky.
Just remember where you stand.

As we call out to the sky tonight, we believe that you're there.
But we can't see you.
We can't fail.
Living in fear, we cannot make sense of this.
Such emptiness eating away.
The shivers you've put up our spines, like walking over our graves.
Bound by the shackles of faith; religion's the oldest of trends.
We're always too frightened to face the truth at the end.
How can we progress from here?
Promising an afterlife.
How can we see things so clear?
We can't even see past tonight.
If only we had inspiration to press on.
Must press on.
