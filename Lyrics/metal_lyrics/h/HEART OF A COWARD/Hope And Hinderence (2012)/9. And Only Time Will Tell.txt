I Pray this time you're gone.
I will ever forget your face turns cold as you fade away.
They will find you broken and alone.
I'll take this life to rise without you.
And only time will tell me who you really are.
Besiege my fucking trust and see this through my eyes.
This time will be your last.
I watched you crash and burn and now you feel my pain.
You put me through this shit.
Forever you'll stand alone.
This time will be your last.
