I can't believe you would treat me this way.
I found you out!
I hate the ground that you walk on.
Don't fucking look away.

You think I'm not going to cut you out?
Don't feel pity upon me 'cause I will end this now.
I've got nothing to say to you anymore.
I want to bury your face into the floor.
God, you're testing me I want you fucking dead.
You should have listened to me.
Should have listened to me!
I tried to forgive you for taking away my wings, I tried to forget you.
Your tricks won't save you now.
I tried to forgive you.
I tried to forget you.
Forget you.

You tried to bring me down, this time it won't be the same.
You tried to bring me down, but you will never be found.
You tried to bring me down, this time it won't be the same.
(Your world is breaking and everything's changing)
You tried to bring me down, but you will never be found.

And so we end this now.
I walk this road alone.
I left you buried deep where all your thoughts will drown.
