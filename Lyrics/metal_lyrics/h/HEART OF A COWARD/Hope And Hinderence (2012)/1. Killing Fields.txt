Rage!
These streets are a battleground.
With every second counting down to extinction and this world will be cursing
our name,
'till the final head will role.
This place is a killing field.
We won't get out alive, here's a picture, of your perfect fucking world.
So stand up!
A plagued race of tear-aways.
Powerless.
We stand and face wave after wave.
Is this all that you wished for?
To be one with the herd?
Is this all that you dreamt of?
This is the end of the world.
Cold shivers.
Smoke.
Mirrors.
Blood Rivers we won't get out alive.
No, we won't get out alive.
We'll never be the same again.
Time to find strength in numbers before this life will end!
We are the fuel to feed this fire.
We'll find ourselves again.
In this, our darkest hour, brothers in arms arise!
And all we need to live is right before our eyes.
