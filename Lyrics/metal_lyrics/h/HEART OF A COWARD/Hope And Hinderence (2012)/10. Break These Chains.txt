Hold this thought this is for everything.
I am awakened.
I am free.
This is where I am, no faded memories.
With this you cannot defeat me.
I will never look back in regret.
The things that left me here are still standing.
This second of silence mirrors the way to push forward.
And in this moment I will break free from these chains.
I am free.
This distant day has only brought you closer to where I am.
To where I'll be.
This is where I am.
This is where I'll always be.
With broken chains, I am free.
And If you think you're taking a single thing away from me, you're fucking
wrong!
I will overcome.
This distant day has only pushed you further from where I am.
Where I'll always be.
This is where I am.
This is where I'll always be.
With broken chains, I am free.
Hold this thought this is for everything.
With broken chains I am free.
