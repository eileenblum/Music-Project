So where are you now?
Hiding behind another masquerade.
Your deception, stripped you of all you ever loved.
You lie awake at night, afraid to even dream.
'Cause when you close your eyes, all you see is me.
There's no disguising your true nature.
You're nothing but a fucking traitor.
Suffer, bitch!
Drown in waters of depression.
Your pain is purification.
This hatred's building up.
Take one last look above.
The pressure's all too much, say goodbye to all that you love.
You know I bore you no ill will, And that you brought this upon yourself
You know I meant you no harm at all, but now I'll bring you hell!
What have you become?
You're fading.
What have you become?
You're nothing.
I will rise up to tear you down and no one will stand in my way.
I will bring you to your knees.
Our dreams were one and the same, but no more, no more!
This is nothing but a waste of emotion.
You are nothing but an insect I stamp on.
Vindication, through an onslaught of violence.
Living manifestation of nightmares.
