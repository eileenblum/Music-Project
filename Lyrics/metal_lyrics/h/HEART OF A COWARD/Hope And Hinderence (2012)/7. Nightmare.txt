Our lives will flash before our eyes.
Stripped of all absolution.
Predestined to worship what we should despise, only then to have our senses
arrested.
An endless cycle of the same old mistakes.
Living hand to mouth and counting the days.
When surrounded by such negativity, it's impossible for us to break free from
degradation of all sanity.
To live and die with the world laid at our feet.
We must rise, realise, purify.
Rise, and realise we're born to die.
Next in line.
Born to die.
End of life.
Is it to late to start again?
Or is this just the start of the end.
