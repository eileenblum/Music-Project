Suddenly I realizeevery hero pays the price,and with no hesitationI give her the kiss of life. Dry land, don't cry on me,how could I know?The sky forgives no oneand the worst has yet to come. Soaking right down to the bonein your eternal rain,I give in to temptation.She was never meant to be saved. Dry land, don't cry on me,how could I know?The sky forgives no oneand the worst has yet to come. Dry land, don't cry on me,how could I know?The sky forgives no oneand the worst has yet to come.
