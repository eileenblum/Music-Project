[STREAMS] Oooh, now that I am free,swimming with the many fishes of the stream.Yeah, and I am welcome here,we all just connected swimmingly. Streams of life digresslike water running through my veins. I'm learning how to breathe,living underwater,I am deeper than the eye can see.Yeah, it was meant to be,now I'm flowing with the current of the stream. Streams of life digresslike water running through my veins.Running through my veinsRunning through my veins. I start my life again,just as well this ain't the first stream I have swam.Cold water rushing to my brainis thicker than the blood that's flowing through my veins Streams of life digresslike water running through my veins.Streams of blood like liquid loveis rushing to my brain.  [VEINS] It suddenly hits me in the heat of the sun,a product of fear, far from human.It suddenly hits me and crushes my worldlike a tidal wave trapped in my shell. It suddenly hits me, what have I become?Searching for answers in my aquarium.It suddenly bites me and poisons my veins,lost and unable to find my way.  [DIGRESSION] My chosen path, the direction that I takeis the consequence of your greatest mistake. When that day arrives, it's decision time.Which way will I turn?Will I ever really learn? If I'm shown the way, I will never be alone.The choice is mine in deciding where I'll go. All our souls digressed, we started as one.All our journeys will end at the same destination. Streams of life digresslike water running through my veins.Streams of blood like liquid loveis rushing to my brain.
