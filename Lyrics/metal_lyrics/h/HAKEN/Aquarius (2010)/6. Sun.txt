Without a reason left to live,lonely air I breathe.And as she takes her final breath,yesterday becomes a memoryas I am learning to let go of the dead. "Goodbye" she criesas she slowly disappears into light.She vaporized peacefully. The silence resonates beyondnow that she is gone.Wish I could turn back hands of timeand die to save a thousand lives. With fear in your eyes, the time has come,reveal the sun you hide.Tears melt the ice, the time has comewhen death and love collide. My savior, I wait for her to return.Forgive me, I killed you to save us all. One final look into her eyes,I watched her vaporize,merging with the light. With fear in your eyes, the time has come,reveal the sun you hide.Dry tears of mine, the time has comewhen death and love collide.
