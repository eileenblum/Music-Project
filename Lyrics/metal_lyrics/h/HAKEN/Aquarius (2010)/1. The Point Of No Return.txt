Until the ice has melted
into tears of pain or fear,
pure anticipation.
In hope we are, patient for a cry.

A child is born tonight
and love has come to life.

Listen to her heartbeat, the sound of life,
an angel's song, pure anticipation.
In hope we are, patient for a cry.

A child is born tonight
and love has come to life.

Living in this nightmare,
falling further to his knees.
The purest disappointment.
In hope we're not patient for a lie.

A child was born tonight
at the point of no return.

We can't raise this child,
this precious circus freak
with fins for arms
and a tail where legs would be.

There's no turning back:
our decision is made.
If we don't let her go,
we cannot love her as our own.

"The water is thicker than blood
and we can't look her in the eyes.
Release her to the stream!"

At the point of no return,
the point of no return.

Let me go, I don't belong here.
I'll be free, I won't return home.

It's no wonder that she's out there all alone.
It's no wonder that she is soaked to the bone.
It's no wonder water is thicker than blood.
Wonder if the storm will come for us?

She'll find a way to the point of no return.
She's on her way past the point of no return.
