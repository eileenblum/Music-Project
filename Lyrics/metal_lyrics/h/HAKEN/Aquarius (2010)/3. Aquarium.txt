Just another day sitting by the riveras February fades.I was fishing for my dinnerwhen something caught my eyein my peripheral vision.Have I lost my mindif I believe in what I'm seeing? Eyes from around the worldstare through the glassof my aquarium.Line up to see the girl,blessed by the curseof the aquarius. Freak of nature, pay to see herEyes surround her like a fever.Free me master, see me shiver,put me back into the river. I won't tell a soul,but I could make a fortune,all those empty years of staring into my reflection.I could bide my time, but I can't keep a secret:she's the great discovery of the 22nd century. Eyes from around the worldstare through the glassof my aquarium.Line up to see the girl,blessed by the curseof the aquarius. Fortune and fame,she's the freak of the day.Only you made a name for yourself,then fell in love. After all that he's doneto her plan that is destined to fail. Oooh, they hit it right off.(She freaked you out)Eyes from around the worldstare through the glassof my aquarium.I've seen the girlblessed by the curseof the aquarius. Freak of nature, pay to see herEyes surround her like a fever.Free me master, see me shiver,put me back into the river.Eyes surround me like a prison,heart is beating, you have listened.Free me master, see me shiver,put me back into the river.
