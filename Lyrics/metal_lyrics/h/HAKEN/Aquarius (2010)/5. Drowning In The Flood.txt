Calling S.O.S in deep despair.
Please, teach me
how the hell do I breathe down there?
Waves crash on me, I can't hold my breath,
there's no coming up for a gasp of air.

And as the tears fall on us now,
the chances are that I will drown.
I've sacrificed all that I love and care about
drowning in the flood.

Speak or forever hold your face,
mourning in the sunken city weeps.
Steal my thunder in your tempest hail,
we'll surrender when the levee fails.

Human corpses floating side by side,
washed up with the distant moonlit tide.
Only she can save our sorry souls,
priceless freedom coming at a heavy cost.

But I can't turn back hands of time,
she knows her purpose is to die.
I've sacrificed all that I love and care about,
I'm drowning in the flood.

I'm sorry, I'm sad with a sense of regret.
It fills my lungs.
It's not too late to suffocate.
The price I will pay for what I've done...

We are trapped under the sea, 
but we made this ocean in one day.
It takes my breath away.

We were drowning, she was free,
now she's gone forever.
I will pay, she takes my breath away.

Will we live to tell the tale?
Is it worth the price we paid?
Are we praying for the sun,
or are we drowning in the flood?
