Oh, I still hear the angels' songwhispered by a child that once belonged.With tears of joy so white,the colour of a restless night,more than a faint memory can provide.If years go by,fear and pain will sustain in your eyes. She may never return, but I can wait forever.If we can't make amends,I'll chase your rainbow till the end... Find us a cure for your disease,spare us your ancient remedy.If this is all I ever ask,emptiness is all I ever had. Our lives are scarred from deep within,scales grow all over our skin.A miracle is all I'll ever needto cure them all,holding onto my amphibian dream. She may never return, but I can wait forever.If we can't make amends,I'll chase your rainbow till the end... Find us a cure for your disease,spare us your ancient remedy.If this is all I ever ask,emptiness is all I ever had. The calm that comes after the storm,the tide that never reaches the shore.So heavenly your remedy.When love prevails,swallowing the blood of enemies. She may never return, but I will wait forever.If we cannot make amends,I'll chase your rainbow till the end... Streams of light unite with waterrunning through our veins.Streams of blood like liquid,love is running through our veins...
