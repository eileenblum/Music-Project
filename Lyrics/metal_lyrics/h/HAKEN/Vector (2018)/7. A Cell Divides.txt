Preserved in time
The insect comes alive
The amber falls away

The vector strikes
How can such a tiny wound
cause me so much pain?

It's the beauty in the flaw
the grace of imperfection
Now I'm twisted out of form
By unnatural selection

A horrifying
Violation
Of a human form

A cell divides, multiplies
A strange mutation overrides
And carbon copies into four

It's the beauty in the flaw
the grace of imperfection
Now I'm twisted out of form
By unnatural selection

Alien
Imposter
Pretender
I'll keep you safe now
Close to my heart
