"Calling Dr Rex to cell block two"
The nurses cry
Twenty inmates scream in their beds but one
One is silent

An unusual case
Deluded, psychotic then catatonic
The good doctor looks him up and down and smiles
"It's time for a game"

Electricity is the prescription he needs
Bring him back to society
Electricity is the cure that he really needs
Bring and empire to its knees

Inside his mind
Sparks fly
Vague memories of a caved in broken life

Electricity is the prescription he needs
Bring him back to society
Electricity is the cure that he really needs
Bring and empire to its knees

Make sure his arms are bound
And all his pills go down
Make all his secrets drown
Render his mind unsound

Inside his mind
Sparks fly
Vague memories of a caved in broken life

Electricity is the prescription he needs
Bring him back to society
Electricity is the cure that he really needs
Bring and empire to its knees
