Through the fog
The scent of myrrh prevails
Cleansing all our sins

Through the clod
The worms caress my head
Take me to the fifth sun

Curtain call
My scene is ending
All I hear is silence

Where I end you'll begin
When I fall you will stand

Sail away, goodbye
I've been left down here to die
Never mind what's near
There's nothing left to fear
I'm fading, I dissolve into the ghost
I'm waiting for the earth to be my host

Save me, teach me,
Hold me, guide me,
Leave me fading, dying

Elevate
Transcend
Leave my grasping human bones
Every vein yields rain
Satiates the ground below
Elevate
Transcend
I disperse into the loam
Every vein yields pain
I've been left out her to rot

Curtain call
My scene is ending
All I hear is silence

Where I end you'll begin
When I fall you will stand
