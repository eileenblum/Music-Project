Latent memories forming deep inside of me
Dormant barren visceral senses now subdued

No escape. I navigate through my cave
Beneath the skin. They keep us in night and day

Parasite - Leech upon the guilt from all my wrongs
(Lead me on a pathway to the core)
Paralysed - Staring through the shadows on the wall
(Unable to solve this puzzle box)

The journey's long, the shadows dance around
The answer lies beyond the fourth wall
My future days are etched into my skull
Hanging ever by a tethered body, mind and soul

Parasite - Leech upon the guilt from all my wrongs
(Lead me on a pathway to the core)
Paralysed - Staring through the shadows on the wall
(Unable to solve this puzzle box)

Truth or deception? I lose all perception inside

A fleeting sense of self worth evaporates into nothingness
A tepid grip on myself melts away to oblivion

Shadows on the wall dance around
Reflections in the amber to be found
A puppet on a string soon unwound
The truth inside the cave soon to be unbound
The path beyond the mountain led me here
The answer crystallised in history
But now the cracks of time begin to show
We lift the veil on what the future holds
The torture of entrapment ever grows
And now I'm waiting for the afterglow
A beast inside of me awakening
Alas the consequences of my sins
Shadows on the wall dance around
Reflections in the amber to be found
A puppet on a string soon unwound
The truth inside the cave soon to be unbound

Parasites as thick as thieves
Paralysed my golden wings

Bouncing off the walls
Latent memories erupting
Pulling at the cord
Earth beneath my feet is trembling
Lightning cracks the sky
'Wakening the beast inside me
Rawness in his eyes
Reeking stench of fear and regret

Cause and consequence
Show me reverence
Fate or circumstance?
I feel severance
Lightning cracks the sky
Eyes intensify
I will stay trapped inside

How can truth set us free when lies are all we have?
How can time heal us when our days are running out?
