Love and pain
Engage your senses
And let them carve the way

Give me
(Give me)
Focus
(Focus)
Sharpen
My view
Initiate

Live here and now
And forever or never

I observe a world jarring in turmoil
A million people waging war at the hands of a god
And I can hear them crying
Cold fires blazing before me
An affliction fast consuming and fascinating me

(Drifting)
You'll be
(Deeper)
The life and the death of me
(Into)
I
(The unknown)
Initiate

We'll make this dream last forever and ever
Tears will run dry
From my ever wandering eye
But I'm prepared to stay
'Til my dying day

I'll see things you won't believe
In tomorrow's memories
I'll do things you can't conceive
There'll be no strings on me

Open the floodgates
Form the colours and the shapes
Let there be a light
Initiate, all my senses are engaging
Open the floodgates
All the love and all the pain
Let there be a light
Initiate, all my senses are engaging

(Distance)
Tell me
(Stretches)
How does it feel to breathe?
(Further)
(From home)
Initiate

I'm drifting
(drifting)
Deeper
(deeper)
Into
(into)
The unknown
