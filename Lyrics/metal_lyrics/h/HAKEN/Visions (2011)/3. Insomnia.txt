Over the edge
Falling in and out of time
History is always repeating

Day in day out
I wait to confront my fate
Mystery is never revealing

I will wait
I will wait

Night after night
Shrouded in secrecy
The harder I try to decipher this symphony
It pushes me closer to death
I begin to see alternate realities surrounding me

I am dying to get back to sleep again
I lie in my bed but I've seen the end
My days are numbered
In death I discover

Insomnia
Insomnia
I will wait
I will wait

Dying to get back to sleep again
I lie in my bed but I've seen the end
My days are numbered
In death I discover

Insomnia
Insomnia
