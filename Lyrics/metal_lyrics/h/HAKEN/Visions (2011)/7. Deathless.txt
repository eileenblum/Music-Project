Dying hope visit me in the flesh
Another noose wrapped around my neck
Your helping hand is all I need
To pull the ground out from underneath

No will to live
I'm tempting fate
I feel most alive
Confronting death
But life goes on
With no escape
Don't wait for me
I'm here to stay

Point that gun, press it to my head
Deathless blood, suck it out from my neck
No one's gonna miss me when I'm gone
I'm killing time but I'll live on

Nowhere to run
It's not too late
I'll end my life
At my own pace
Holding on
I take the pain
Don't wait for me
I'm here to stay

To the afterlife i will never know
With a fixed blade knife held up to my throat
On immortality I will overdose
All this you can read in my suicide notes

Kiss my scars, taste them on my breath
Stealing time from the great suspense
Come Judgment Day I've one last request
Please hold my hand as I harm myself

No will to live
Nowhere to run
I'm tempting fate
It's not too late
I feel most alive
I'll end my life
Confronting death
At my own pace
But life goes on
Holding on
With no escape
I take the pain
Don't wait for me
IMPATIENTLY
I'm here to stay

To the afterlife I will never know
With a fixed blade knife held up to my throat
On immortality I will overdose
All this you can read in my suicide notes

Still I wait
