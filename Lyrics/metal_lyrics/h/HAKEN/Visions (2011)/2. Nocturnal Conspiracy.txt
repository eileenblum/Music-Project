No disturbance could wake me
Observers are captivated
By nocturnal projections
Of my vivid imagination

Try as I might to recall the events of the night
Yet the deeper I hunt, the further away they run

Moon rises
I shiver, confiding in the mirror
My ghost in the reflection
Just witnessed the resurrection

Lights flashed before my eyes
With scenes from someone else's life!

Nothing is quite as it seems
Something died inside of me
By powers that be
A man will live forever
In paranoia

I believe your conspiracy
When they're after me
For what I revealed could change your life

Scenes from someone else's life
Have they been placed in our minds?

Never have I ever taken a life
But it seems overnight I've become a killer
On the run 'cause...

I believe your conspiracy
When they're after me
For what I revealed

I believe your conspiracy
When they're after me
For what I revealed will change your life

Tonight I hang by a thread
As the voice in my head takes control
Of this pain that I have felt before

On trial my confidence weakens
I'm close to defeat
But tonight the verdict will be televised

Calling no witnesses to the stand
Clearing my name with no evidence
Knowing this could be my final chance
No one is coming to my defense

Inside the truth is suppresses
With unlimited access denied
To all the things you wish to hide

The lies, the sex and the secrets
Will tear us to pieces in time
When no one can tell wrong from right

Calling no witnesses to the stand
Clearing my name with no evidence
Knowing this could be my final chance
No one is coming to my defense

Nocturnal conspiracy
Nocturnal conspiracy
