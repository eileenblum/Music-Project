Ghost
Host of decay
Carrier of mediocrity
All your surroundings will eventually fall
You are not worth it
The air you breathe
Carrier of mediocrity
See your past
Kneel down and die
Die of regret
The knife that rest on your face
Everyone will have a grin on their faces when they realize your rotten skull
Armageddon of hypocrisy
Parallel to an ungrateful sodomy
Filthy scum is what you always were
Hopeless
Not able to breathe again
Leecher of treachery
Rattus
You were born dead in your mothers' tongue
Making the sewers a perfect home
I sever your limbs upon your god
So you can crawl as the worm you are
Filthy scum
No resting in peace your ankles chained in
Chaotic disgrace
Filthy scum is what you always were
Hopeless, not able to breathe again
Leecher of treachery rattus
