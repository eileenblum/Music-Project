Its our last wine

We have been destroying
And fighting in too many wars

Two opposite sides
Defeating a worthless cause

Trying to kill each other
Taking lives
Running over blood

Burning souls
Taking lives
Running over blood

We lost friends
Everyday feeling alone
Nothing to loose

God sake
Forsaken
Maybe tonight
Its our last wine

I cant wait to be face to face
I saw you a few times
God sake
Forgive all my mistakes
Because maybe tonight
Its our last wine

I see myself in your eyes
Closer to you

Tomorrow it's a good day
And one of us could die
Confronting us
Will make us realize what we are

Just the victory is what matters
Take this bullet
Carbombs and cannions

Its hard to believe
That i found death
In my brother hands

Tomorrow is a good day
And one of us could die

Closer

Tomorrow it's a good day
And one of us could die
Confronting us
Will make us realize

I cant wait to fight
Face to face

I saw you a few times
I hate you but i cant kill you
I see myself in your eyes
I see myself in your eyes

I cant wait to fight
I saw you a few times
I hate you but i cant kill you
I see myself in your eyes
I see myself in your eyes

God sake
Forsaken
Maybe tonight
Its our last wine
