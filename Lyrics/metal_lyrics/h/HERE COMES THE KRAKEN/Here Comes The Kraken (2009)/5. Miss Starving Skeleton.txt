She cant stop
Everytime, everything, everywhere
Always spread all around
What she ate
It burns, it hurts,
Its her blood whats she spits on the floor

Trying to look good
But what it seems its a monster
At the other side of the room
She thinks that she looks like a monster

She thinks that she looks like always wanted to be
Minwhile everyone see bones stick on her skin

She thinks that she looks like always wanted to be
Minwhile everyone see bones stick on her skin

Loosing hair everyday
Strugling to stand up
Its dificult to breath
Cause her breath smells like
Fucking shit

Closer to death
She keeps walking straight
Inside she is screaming for help
But nobody can
Dope on the floor
Her hand doesnt respond
Her head is about to explode

Dope on the floor
Her head is about to explode

She got skiny legs
And the eyes like a chihuahua dog
God bye blue eyes
You will not suffer again

Closer to death
She keeps walking straight but
Inside she is screaming for help
But nobody can
Closer to death

Dope on the floor
Her hand doesnt respond
Her heart i sore and is about to explode
She got skiny legs
And the eyes like a dog
The bucket of barf below your bed
Goodbye

Good bye blue eyes
You will not suffer again
In heaven a chesse burguer
Is waiting for you.
