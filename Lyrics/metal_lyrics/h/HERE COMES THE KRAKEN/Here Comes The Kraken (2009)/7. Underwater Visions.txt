Not again

Images of the endless
You..'ll never understand
Until you see what i see

It has been like a year under water
Everyday i feel im dying
Im numb
I cant tell you until it hapends

It has been like a year under water
Everyday i feel im dying
Im numb
I cant tell you until it hapends

10,000,000 visions
Have drained my life
Sometimes i don't want to be me
To you could be a gift but
For me has been a nightmare

I cant hear
I cant sleep
I cant breathe
I cant think
I cant feel
Anymore

But this pressure on my chest
All this shit has been overwhelming

Please tell me
What could i do
To stop this pain

Please tell me
What could i do
To stop this pain
This pain

Kill
My thoughts
This is the only way
To get away
I feel the end
Knocking at the door

The end
Knocking at the door

I feel the end

God the end is knocking at the door

Images of the endless
You'll never understand
Until you see what i see

It has been like a year under water
Everyday i feel im dying
Everyday i feel im dying
