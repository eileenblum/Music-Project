It's comming
I'm here now

They gave me a new mission
Blood and bones that's for sure
Obey me

I know it's wrong
I'm running away from the hospital
They come for me

Once again, confusing
Kind of fun
Awaiting the moment
Why to feel regreat?
I don't care your fucking fake

Distorted visions and dope

Despite your bad taste
I will bite you forever
And tear your skin
Your pain is my pleasure
Despite your bad taste
I will bite you forever

Despite

Confusing

That's right
I know it's comming but i can't stop my desire,
Now in jail they are not here anymore they can not hurt me

They, they gave me
They gave me a new mission

They gave me a new mission
Blood and bones that's for sure
Obey me

I know it's wrong
I'm running away
They come for me

Once again,
Confusing

Kind of fun
Awaiting the moment
Why to feel regreat?
I don't care your fucking fake

Once again,
Confusing
