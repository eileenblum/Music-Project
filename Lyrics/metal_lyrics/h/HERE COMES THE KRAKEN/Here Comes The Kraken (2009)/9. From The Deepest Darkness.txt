From the deepest darkness
It's staring at us
The silence in the shadows is broken
Theres no hope

Nobody knows when it's coming
Cause thousands of years have pasted
I wonder when it ends
I wonder when it ends

Let's just say goodbye
To everything you love
Cause hate is just the path we..ll walk on

Everybody is guilty cause we fed it with
Ages of hypocresy
And sins

Its face is breaking through the fogh
And you can see pure evil
Into its eyes
I still don't recognize
Whats coming to my way
I fear the end but i don't want the pain

Claws sting my back,
Feel shivers down my spine

I don't want
To look back
My fear becomes real

I don't want
To look back
My fear becomes real

Becomes real

It's raining
Peaces of my loved ones
Why am i alive?

It's raining
Peaces of my loved ones
Why am i alive?

Does my taste is bad?

Why am i alive?

Does my taste is bad?

It brings dead to everything
Around it nobody can scape
Nobody can run
Nobody is safe
Everybody dies
Everybody dies
Everybody dies
Everybody dies
Dies

It's breathing down my neck

I guess this is the end
I only colse my eyes
And let the attack strike
Goodbye
If someone find this
It means im dead
This is the fucking end.

It's breathing down my neck

I guess this is the end
I only colse my eyes
And let the attack strike
Goodbye
If someone find this
It means im dead
This is the fucking end.
