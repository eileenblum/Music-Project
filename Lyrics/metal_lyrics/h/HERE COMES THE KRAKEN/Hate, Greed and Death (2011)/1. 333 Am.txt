[Lyrics by Alexa]

This curse it's coming soon
Come stand beside me
Embrace my mind whit your delicious pride
letâs do this quick so fuck your promises
how we get a new life
how do I? Cannot see
Fear is the founder of the church of Satan

How do I?
Tell me how can, how do I?

Reach my own dead soul
Worship me, just find me, now honor me
Just hate me
Soon, as you sing believe
You wonât regret it

Will you be prepared?
To feel all my rage
Over and over again

Now I, now I can see it
Join Now I can feel pain
Join this side clean, your mind
We are in

Now that you reach out
What we believe, itâs our own fate
As soon you sing believe, you wonât regret it

How do I? Tell me how can, how do I?
Reach my own dead soul

Now I can see it, join
Now I can feel pain
Join this side, clean your mind
We are in

Bring a paper and your blood
Thereâs no way back
Bring a paper and your blood

The devils waiting
Promises he brings
Bring your fucking blood, itâs all I want
Now that you failed too much
Fill my veins with your hate whit hate
Whit Hate, join

Now I can see it (join)
Now I can feel (pain)
Join this side clean, your mind
We are in

Now I can see it, join
Now I can feel pain
Join this side clean, your mind
We are in

Now you're mine, forever a slave
Now you're mine, forever a slave
Now you're mine, forever a slave
