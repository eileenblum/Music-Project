[Lyrics by David &amp; Tore]

This is an evil place be prepared
There is no choice, you cannot run away
Seduced by a nameless power
This is an!
There is no choice, you cannot run away
Seduced by a nameless power

You will be one more in the shade
Something is there
That makes people change!
Money, cars and girls
The lifestyle of death!

Power, Abusing!
Party, 6 am!
Pretty, youâre so fake!

Surrender to his word confer your soul
Forget what you were before
Come back to the place you belong
Forget, Today, Obey!
Forget what you were before
Come back to the place you belong
Forget, Today, Obey!

There's no turning back,
If you want everything you must give everything
There's no turning back,
If you want everything you must give everything
That's the pathway to hell.

Beverly hell,
If you want everything you must give everything!
Beverly hell,
If you want everything you must give everything!
Beverly hell,
If you want everything you must give everything!
Beverly hell,
If you want everything you must give everything!

Get down!
Embrace the malice!
Get down!
Embrace the malice!
Get down on your knees!
The price is surrender to the king!
Embrace the malice!

Something is there,
That makes people change!
Money, cars and girls,
The lifestyle of death!
Surrender!
Get down on your knees
Money, cars and girls,
That's the pathway to

Beverly hell 90666!
Beverly hell 90666!
Beverly hell 90666!
Beverly hell 90666!

Surrender!
Confer your soul

Surrender to his word, confer your soul
Surrender! Surrender! Surrender!

Forget what you were before!
The place you belong
Forget Today, Obey the Lord
Come back, Come back!

Surrender to his word,
Confer your soul
Surrender! Surrender! Surrender!

90666!
