[Lyrics by David &amp; Tore]

We told you already not to fuck around,
It seems like that you need to refresh
What you learned from us.
Every time you word denies it your sentence
Has been told

Time to let go everything gone
He is rising up
Your last trial has begun
Time to let go
Everything gone
He is rising up we came here to take your soul

Say your prayers (say your prayers)
This is your new beginning
We are the monster of the six tentacles
This is the path you will have to follow
Say your prayers (say your prayers)

We are the army of the soul possession
Rise your hands up
Let us to see your horns
Say your prayers (say your prayers)
We are the monster of the six tentacles
This is the path you will have to follow

!!Here we GO!!

Ripping the past, this is your new beginning
Say your prayers (say your prayers)
This is your new beginning
We are the monster of the six tentacles
This is the path you will have to follow
Say your prayers (say your prayers)

We are the army of the soul possession
Rise your hands up let us to see your horns
Say your prayers (say your prayers)
We are the monster of the six tentacles
This is the path you will have to follow

The end STANDS
In front of your fate
Ripping the past
This is your new beginning; this is your new beginning
The end STANDS in front of your fate
This is your new beginning

They want FEAR
We gave them FEAR
They want FEAR
We gave them FEAR
They want FEAR
We gave them FEAR
They want FEAR
We gave them FEAR

We will brake in the city
Over all
We will Brake!!
In The City!!
Over all!!

Say your prayers; this is your new beginning
We are the monster of the six tentacles
This is the path you will have to follow
Say your prayers (say your prayers)
We are the army of the soul possession
Raise your hands up let us to see your horns
Say your prayers (say your prayers)
We are the monster of the six tentacles
This is the path you will have to follow

Ripping the past, this is your new beginning
Ripping the past, this is your new beginning
The end STANDS in front of your fate

Take everything
Kill everything
This is your new beginning
