[Lyrics by David &amp; Tore]

Listen the sound, a crowd screaming loud
The one we want, your name has been called
And tells you to sit on the throne
Your thoughts has been given to us
Our leader âtil the end, come and guide us

We are the loyal followers of what you order
No matter what not asking questions
We are going to serve
You must choose to take the place or not

Will you be our leader? Will you be our leader?

Iâm never gonna say anything to you, our leader
No one is going move a thing
Unless you take theâ¦Unless you take the Place

Donât be afraid to take control of this disorder
The hard way sometimes, Is the way it must to be
All are looking down

You are the god that we want, that we want
You wonât see us from the top

Iâm never gonna say anything to you, our leader
No one is going move a thing
Unless you take theâ¦Unless you take the Place
Iâm never gonna say anything to you, our leader
No one is going move a thing
Unless you take theâ¦Unless you take the Place

You are the god that we want, that we want
You wonât see from the top
So whatâs your decision? Youâre the chosen one
Will you be our new leader?
Youâre the chosen one
Will you be our god? The God we always wanted
Will you be our God? God? God?
Will you be our God?

Iâm never gonna say anything to you, our leader
No one is going move a thing
Unless you take theâ¦Unless you take the Place
Iâm never gonna say anything to you, our leader
No one is going move a thing
Unless you take theâ¦Unless you take the Place

Listen the sound, a crowd screaming loud
The one we want, your name has been called
And tells you to sit on the throne
Your thoughts has been given to us
Our leader âtil the end, come and guide us
