[Lyrics by Alexa]

Now regret what you did!!!!

As this light approaches whit a thousand eyes on me
I wonât fail sir.
I will bring to all those who glorify what we came to crush
The rising abyss of possessed and damned
I will bring now
Your life belongs to this circle of dead
I will bring dead to all those how glorify what we came to crush

Hate greed and death, this is my prophecy
Hate greed and death, my prophecy!!!
Iâm never going to regret, I promise I will never fail

This is the end my soul is condemned
Condemned like you all, eternal whispers of a entire legion

Hate greed and death, this is my prophecy
Hate greed and death, this is my prophecy
Hate greed and death, this is my prophecy
Iâm never going to regret
I promise I will never fail
I know I would never regret
Condemned you all
You all

You burn in my mind, begging me)
You breed my hate, begging me)

When you see what I have become
Promises keep you away from me
Cause I know that you have pray for
You better pray for this shit you have become

Hate, greed and death, this is my prophecy
Hate, greed and death, this is my prophecy
Hate, greed and death, this is my prophecy
Hate, greed and death

The demons are going to eat you alive
The demons will turn evil
The demons are going to eat you alive
The demons will turn evil
