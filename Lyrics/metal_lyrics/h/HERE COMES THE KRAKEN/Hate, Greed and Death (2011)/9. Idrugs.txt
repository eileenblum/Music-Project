[Lyrics by David &amp; Tore]

Thereâs no bright in a light
Itâs dragging me in down there, deeper
Conducting through this wrong track of life
I feel like now my time itâs about to die

This day starts so dark
Awake itâs hard I canât stand
Cause smoke embrace me
Wasting the breathing air
Contaminating everything
Everything, contaminating everything

This light isnât bright
It drags me down
Itâs getting darker and blurry

Tonight my nightmares will come true
But Iâll enjoy âtil death takes me
Tonight is the time to lose it all, lose it all
Tonight is the night Iâm falling down, falling down
No, why?

Take me for everything
Everything, I have been threw away was my choice
Love, life, friends, life, love
I see them all acting as somebody else
Like somebody they are not
Life itâs mean to be
How do you want it?
If it means darkness
Why I would be a slave?
Everything, contaminating everything

This light isnât bright
It drags me down
Itâs getting darker and blurry

Tonight my nightmares will come true
But Iâll enjoy âtil death takes me
Tonight is the time to lose it all, lose it all
Tonight is the night Iâm falling down
Falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down

Tonight is the time to lose it all, lose it all
Tonight is the night Iâm falling down, falling down
I say why? Iâm going to die
Why? Why?
Iâm going to die
