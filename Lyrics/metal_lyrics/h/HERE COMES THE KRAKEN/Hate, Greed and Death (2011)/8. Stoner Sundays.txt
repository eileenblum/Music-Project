[Lyrics by David &amp; Tore]

This body itâs getting worthless
With out sight, with out eyes
I never thought will happened
This are the consequences, this are
No where to run
See me laying

No where to go, my place is suffer
Canât start all over, everything is broken
I feel like Iâm not breathing, I feel like star all over
All my parts starting get numbed
Canât help you itâs all the say, I canât help you

Come here and save from this nightmare, find my solution
Every part of me it feels like perish, find my solution
Come here and save from this nightmare

How does it feel? How does it feel?
To waste your life and kill yourself every single night
Overdose, how does it feel?
To waste your life and kill yourself every single night
Be proud of it

No one can help me anymore, anymore
No one can help me anymore, anymore
How does it feel? How does it feel?
To waste your life and kill yourself every single night
Overdose, how does it feel?
To waste your life and kill yourself every single night
Be proud of it

My clock will stop very soon
I lost the sense of touch
From head to toes, itâs really cold
Iâll try to erase all what I said right now

And you forget what I did
Itâs my reflection, I tried to tell you
But you donât even care about it
Was my intention and now I donât care anymore

And you forget what I did
How does it feel? How does it feel?
To waste your life and kill yourself every single night
Overdose, how does it feel?
To waste your life and kill yourself every single night
Be proud of it

No one can help me anymore
No one can help me anymore, anymore, anymore.
