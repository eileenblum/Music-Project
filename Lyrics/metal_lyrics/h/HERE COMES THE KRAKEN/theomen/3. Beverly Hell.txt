[Lyrics by David &amp; Tore]

This is an evil place, be prepared
There is no choice, you cannot run away

Seduced by a nameless power
This is an, there is no choice and you cannot run away
Seduced by a nameless power
You will be one more in the shade

Something is there that makes people change
Money, cars and girls : the lifestyle of death
Power (abusing)
Party (6 AM)
Pretty (you're so fake)

Surrender to his word, confer your soul
Forget what you were before
Come back to the place you belong
Forget, today, obey
Confer your soul
Forget what you were before
Come back to the place you belong
Forget, today, obey

There's no turning back
If you want everything you must give everything
There's no turning back
If you want everything you must give everything

That's the pathway to hell

Beverly Hell
If you want everything you must give everything
Beverly Hell
If you want everything you must give everything
Beverly Hell
If you want everything you must give everything
Beverly Hell
If you want everything you must give everything

Get down, embrace the malice
Get down, embrace the malice
Get down on your knees
The price is surrender to the king
Embrace the malice

Something is there that makes people change
Money, cars and girls : the lifestyle of death
Surrender, get down on your knees
Money, cars and girls : that's the pathway to

Beverly Hell 9O666
Beverly Hell 9O666
Beverly Hell 9O666
Beverly Hell 9O666

Surrender, confer your soul
Surrender to his word, confer your soul
Surrender, surrender, surrender

Forget what you were before
To the place you belong
Forget today, obey the lord
Come back, come back

Surrender to his word
Confer your soul
Surrender, surrender, surrender

9O666 !
