[Lyrics by David &amp; Tore]

Worthless splattered blood
Fucking beliefs always kill stupid people

You are not supposed to die
Because faith isnât real
Because faith isnât Real
Faith isnât real

You poor slave

Whereâs your king now?

Past
Centuries didnât change a thing

We are fighting this battle again

Hell is
Coming to you
Heaven is falling for you
This is the omen
Aware from the
Omen

Dreamers are dying
And thinkers are fighting
Trying and
Screaming
The truth of life
The truth of life

Deaf legions running
Afraid
From realizing that what they live is a lie
Your black book of
Trash
Is full of fear and lies

Deaf legions running afraid
Of
Truth
Liars!

Someday everybody is going to die
And thereâs nothing after
Life

What do you fight for?
What are you going to
Win?

Omen

Prophecy

The calling of death

Prophecy

What do you?
Fight for?
What you?
What are you going to win?

What do you fight?
For?
What are you going to win?
In the end thereâs nothing next to
Life

Taking lives is the only way
The only way
That you can reach the
Sky
You can reach the sky
