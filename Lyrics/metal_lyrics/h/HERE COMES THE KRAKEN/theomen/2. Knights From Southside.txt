[Lyrics by David &amp; Tore]

We live to die for in the shadows
We only exist to protect
What the man has always feared
This is the duty of the kill
Battle to cleanse everyone
Shut the Light from the sky

This is the duty of the kill
Battle to cleanse everyone
Shut the Light from the sky, sky!

We will ride through the valley of death
We will ride over corpses and flames
Cause we are Knights from Southside, Southside

Riding thousands of miles
In the omens way, in the omens way
Riding thousands of miles
In the omens way, in the omens way
This is the oil that contaminates
The water you drink

We will ride through the valley of death
We will ride through the valley of death
Over corpses and flames
We will ride, we will ride
Through the valley of death
Over corpses and flames

Now is the time for our kingdom to rise
Where the evil Means freedom
Now we own the head of your leader
Now is the time for our kingdom to rise
Now is the time for our kingdom to rise

We will ride, we will ride
We will ride, we will ride
Cause we are knights
We are knights
We are knights
We are knights
From Southside!!
