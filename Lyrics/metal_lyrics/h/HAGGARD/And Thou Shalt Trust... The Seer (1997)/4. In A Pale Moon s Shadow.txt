Hostem repellas eternus
[May you forever repel the enemy]
Pacemque dones et protinus
[And give us peace, and from then on]
Ductore sic de praevio
[With you, our leader, in front of us]
Vitemus omne noxium
[We shall evade all evil]

Hostem repellas eternus
[May you forever repel the enemy]
Pacemque dones et protinus
[And give us peace, and from then on]
Ductore sic de praevio
[With you, our leader, in front of us]
Vitemus omne noxium
[We shall evade all evil]

A dream deep in the night
As the firstborn awakes with the sign
A little dreamer... but are dreams always to define?

"Do not fear, my son! Awaken the dragon inside
For he may guide you, being the world's hidden eye
Through a dark time, when mankind is bleeding within
Oh little dreamer..."

[We shall evade all evil]

Analyzing the midnight sky
And in the early morninglight
He just feels the warming heart
Beating in his head

To declare the reason why
Should I survive this sadness
"God reality back in my mind" - beating in his head

It's a very dark night
Nobody outside
Silence wraps up the land as suddenly:
Hoof beats destroy all sleep

And a wooden coach loaded with innocent ones
Accused and sentenced, their end has begun
And their eyes can't cover their fear... can't cover their fear

And he thinks he must be dreaming
Lifts up his head, sees the sky is gleaming
Heaven burns as red as blood

And all they have caught, they won't return
The sky reflects, from superstition they burn
When will they ever learn... They never return!

Ein drohendes Pochen in tiefschwarzer Nacht
[A threatening rapping in pitch black night]
In TrÃ¤umen geseh'n und nun wahrgemacht
[In dreams foreseen and came true]
Die Diener der Kirche sind hier, sie zu holen
[The Church's servants have come for her]
"Brennen sollst du mein Kind! - Der Herr hat's befohlen!"
["You shall burn my child!" - It's the Lord's command!]

Do not fear my son! Awake the dragon inside
For he may guide you, being the worlds hidden eye

Als am Pfahl sie brennt, nun schwarz ist ihr rotes Haar
[When on stake she burns, now her red hair is black]
Niemand mehr zweifelt, daÃ des Teufel's Weib sie war
[No one doubts anymore that the Devil's broad she'd been]
Geschlagen, getreten, bespuckt und belacht
[Beaten, trodden, spat and laughed at]
Die Flammen dem Leiden ein Ende gemacht
[The flames made an end to the suffering]

A scream deep in the night
As the firstborn awakes with the sign
A little dreamer... but are dreams always to define?

Die Flammen dem Leiden ein Ende gemacht
[The flames made an end to the suffering]
Die Flammen dem Leiden ein Ende gemacht
[The flames made an end to the suffering]
Ein Ende gemacht
[An end to it]
Und wieder pocht es in tiefschwarzer Nacht...
[And another rap in a pitch black night...]
