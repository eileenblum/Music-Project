Born through astral constellation
Those pictures are now getting clearer
Inside his head
And sent by the highest god
They start to rise from the deepest depth

"My King - dead - no!!!!!
Dying by the lance... so slow..."

He wipes the tears
Away, and tries to think
As clear as the falling rain
But his hope begins to sink
But his hope begins to sink...

.. down to this point
Do you fear? Yes you do, and you always will!
The bleeding of another part
Crawls into your mind and still...

Es kam zu erinnern
[There came, to remind]
An des Menschen BuÃe
[About Man's repentance]
Die Maske des Vogels
[The mask of the bird]
Nickt hÃ¶hnisch zum GruÃe
[Bows for a mocking salutation]
In Schwarz gehÃ¼llt
[Clad in black]
Auf schwarzem Rosse getragen
[Carried on black steed]
Die Menschheit zu knechten
[To subdue humankind]
Kam der Herr der Plagen
[Came the Lord of the Plagues]
Pest regiert mit strafender Hand
[The plague rules with punishing hand]
Und Leichen bedecken das Land... das Land
[and corpses cover the land... the land]

Out of the sorcerer's chamber?
Or do they come straight from the hands of the goat?
This roses' leaves seem to be magic
And saved all the poor population below
"My wife... sons... no!!!!!
Diphteria creeps, and no one knows..."
