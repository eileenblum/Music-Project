As the evening breaks
The night awakes
And the land is mournfully wrapped in silence
Sorrow last
And remains the past
cause this will be my ending day

Then the moonlight dies
And torches rise
See the crowd longing for the ritual burning
Holy rhymes, as the churchbells chime
cause this will be my ending day

Silent thief
Take me away
Let my soul rest in the realm of fairytales
And as the fire enlightens the dark
I see the face bewildered with guilt
And nobody's speaking a word

As the dark night enters

See the soul that's coming out of darkness into light
Pictures, I can't fight
Appearing in front of my eyes
Like silhouettes in the night

Like they give bread to the beggars
They get ready for the feast
Cruelty absorbed by their eyes
Within this midwinters breeze

Silent thief
Take me away
Let my soul rest in the realm of fairytales
And as the fire enlightens the dark
I see the face bewildered with guilt
And nobody's speaking a word

As the dark night enters
As the dark night enters
