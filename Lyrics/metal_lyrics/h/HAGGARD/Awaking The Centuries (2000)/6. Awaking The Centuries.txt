Awaking the Centuries

In the books of what will be
Written by the demon lord?
Never lift your head up to the east
'cause darkness wakes the best!

Der Kerzen Schein
[The candles' light]
Er leuchtet fahl
[Is palely shining]
Als das Sonnenlicht er stahl
[When He stole the sunlight]
Und nur das grosse Himmelszelt
[And only the great sky's tent]
Bezeugt das Ende dieser Welt
[Is witness to the end of this world]

So feed the spark
Welcome to the land of dark
Death in all the centuries is what I left behind
Take my hand
Forgotten in the promised land
Death in all the centuries is what I left behind

The knowledge, brought to the world
Is growing with a bitter taste
In a dream I saw things that will be
Centuries away

Des Mondes Schein
[The moon's glow]
Er leuchtet fahl
[Is palely shining]
Das Herz der Finsternis er stahl
[He stole the Heart of Darkness]
Nun gleiÃend Lichte ihn umgibt
[Now glistening light surrounds him]
Und doch des Menschen Hoffnung siegt...?
[And so Man's hope prevails?]

So feed the spark
Welcome to the land of dark
Death in all the centuries is what I left behind
Take my hand
Forgotten in the promised land
Death in all the centuries is what I left behind

The night when evil steps out of the dark
And the cross is rising again
And fires are keeping the light
Burn, my friend...

And the sign of humanity is burning tonight
I can't escape from this ritual silence
Humanity's burning tonight

When I open my eyes
I see soldiers in the fields
Dead bodies on the ground
There are children inbetween
Explosions shock the land
And the evil shows its face
The one called Hister rises
This is the fall of grace...

Beast ferocious from hunger will swim across rivers
The greater part of the region will be against the Hister
The great one will cause it to be dragged in an iron cage
When the German child will observe nothing

In the books of what will be
Written by the demon lord?
Never lift your head up to the east
'cause darkness wakes the best!
