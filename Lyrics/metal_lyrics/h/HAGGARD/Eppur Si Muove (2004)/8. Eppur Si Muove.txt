[However, it (the Earth) moves]

[Music: A. Nasseri / Lyrics: A. Nasseri]

Aside the one in sorrows
To release my darkened mind
And the ones whoÂ´ve pathed my way to thee
(With) a light that blinds the blind
God, end this suffering
My blood and tears that flow for you, my king

My Son, beware...
... of all that your eyes cannot see
Trust your mind
And strengthen your abilities

Did you ever touch the starlight?
Dreamed for a thousand years?
Have you ever seen the beauty
Of a newborn century?

And now's the time to enter
A new way, things to see
Man is just a weak reflection
In evolution's history

And in the hour of darkness
It will guide your way:

La bellezza del paese di Galilei [the beauty of the country of Galilei]

E nella mia ora piÃ¹ buia [and in my darkest hour]
Loro splenderanno [they will shine]
Per me [for me]
All'infinito [forever]

Aside the one in sorrows
To release my darkened mind
And the ones whoÂ´ve pathed my way to thee
(With) a light that blinds the blind
God end this suffering
My blood and tears that flow for you, my king

Geboren im flackernden Kerzenschein [Born in the flickering light of a candle]
Verfasst in dunkler Zeit [Enscripted in dark times]
Ein altes StÃ¼ck von Pergament [On an old parchment]
Sich mit der Feder vereint [The pen slides]
Der Zeichnung seines Arms entspringt [And from his arm borns]
Der Universen Zelt [The tent of the universe]
Es ist der Zeiten Anbeginn [It is the beginning of the times]
Und Ã¤ndert diese Welt [And it will change the world]
Des Universums Zelt [The tent of the universe]

Nato al lume guizzante della candela [Born in the flickering light of a candle]
Scritto in tempi oscuri [Enscripted in dark times]
Sulla vecchia pergamena [On an old parchment]
Scorre la penna [The pen slides]
E dal suo braccio nasce [And from his arm borns]
Il disegno delle volte celesti [The design of the celestial times]
Ã l'inizio dei tempi [It is the beginning of the times]
E cambierÃ  il mondo [And it will change the world]

My son, take care...
Of all what the cross wants you to be
Trust your eyes
And strengthen your abilities

Did you ever touch the starlight?
Dream for a thousand years?
Have you ever seen the beauty
Of a newborn century?

And time has come to doubt
About the holy verse
It's just a weak reflection
In our endless universe

And in your hour of darkness
The beauty guides your way:

La bellezza del paese di Galilei [the beauty of the country of Galilei]

Loro splenderanno [they will shine]
Splenderanno per me [shine for me]
All'infinito [for ever]
