Mundane thoughts calm down
The presence of His holiness
Makes solemn seems so right
Both elderly and young
Are reaching up towards the sky
To feel Him passing by

There are no words, there are no songs
The silence grows, we want to hear His voice

He is the Lord of lords
Yet he calls each one of us by name
He made us for Heaven
To be loved as sons and daughters
It's all that truly matters
He wants to fill our hearts again
And give eternal life

He is the Lord of lords
He has all the nations in his hands
Yet he reaches out for you
When you thought no one was listening
He heard what you were whispering
He's here to meet you face to face
And give His warm embrace

Heavens gather down
As angels rush to testify
The greatest sight in creation
When God Almighty meets a man
Even the dried out bones arise
And stand tall for His glory

There are no words, there are no songs
The silence grows, we want to hear His voice

He is the Lord of lords
Yet he calls each one of us by name
He made us for Heaven
To be loved as sons and daughters
It's all that truly matters
He wants to fill our hearts again
And give eternal life

He is the Lord of lords
He has all the nations in his hands
Yet he reaches out for you
When you thought no one was listening
He heard what you were whispering
He's here to meet you face to face
And give His warm embrace
