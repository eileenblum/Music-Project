Thereâs no way to hide, as my very mind is
Invaded by an army, thereâs no help to find
It holds me so tight
So how to survive in this fight.

God he owns my life
Dear Jesus Christ I know it well yet it is hard
The enemy knows how to recall
And In my past I am his slave.

I think I just served today the prince of darkness
I was much more faithful than Iâve been in ages
How could any faithful one
Do the things that you have done
Straight to hell, straight to hell,
You are surely heading straight to hell.

Step away Satan
For I know your every lie by heart
Iâm aware of your power as you
Blame me for whatâs done
Iâm a sinner from birth, and so what?
Hell is my due fee
Yet in Jesus thereâs sanctuary
And thatâs where I may be

In this dying corpse with many faults
Deeply in love with myself
Iâm not of this world yet in the world
And in worldly ways Iâm living

My spirit bears fruit rotten to root
Even the swine wonât eat them
Such pathetic being, hypocrite being,
Unholy being..
(Born unholy, Die unholy!)

Please forgive me Jesus Christ
I did not understand
Jealous and a thief am I how can I mend it?
You are my possession now
To me you shall always bow.
With me eternally, you cannot break free.
