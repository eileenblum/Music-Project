Many nights I can find no rest
As my conscience puts me on test
It is certain: if your hands are dirty
You cannot live in peace
You can let go for just one day
Gaining debt youâll one have to pay
All the world has fallen for the same illusion and
Crying while itâs suffering.

If you are the almighty God,
Why let evilness reign
Smiting men and fighting faith while
You could have stopped this.

Itâs time to chose my side, live as I am
Taking tiny steps in the wrong and
Saying what I know I have said before:
Iâll turn back, just not today
The other option: deep from my heart I can find you
Where I left you, God of my childhood
Jesus still has hope for the hopeless,
He can make me fearless and free.
Amen

Itâs a tough school to start and see
What I guess he has always seen
Though I thought I was the wisest one
But my sin had blinded me
I was seeking truth from the skies,
Every mountain, every peak up high
Till I found him
In the depth of my pit
Jesus in his mercy

Should the Lord remove all evil,
Iâd be first in the line
He would have to wipe out us and all of the people.

That is why the almighty God lets evilness reign
Smiting men and fighting faith wile
You could have stopped this
You could have stopped this
