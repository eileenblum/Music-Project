If you think, being someone different
Could make you feel somehow more complete, be more loved
You're so wrong, keep walking on hand in His hand

Hand in hand, hand in hand, keep walking on hand in His hand

If you see, all need taken from you
There's no treasure greater than which, you received
Hand in His hand, He's holding all things in His hand

In his hand, in his hand, keep walking on hand in his hand

Beauty light up by grace
I see in your face, I see in your face
You who are, so broken by all those people who define
what of Godâs creation has been made well
all of Godâs creation is made well
all that our God created He made well

People have, trampled down as worthless
all that God once created perfectly
people are, so evil
but we can be restored in His grace

In His grace, in His grace, you can be graceful in His grace
