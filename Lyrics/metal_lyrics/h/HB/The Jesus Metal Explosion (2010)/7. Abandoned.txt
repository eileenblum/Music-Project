They heard it all, all those who knew me
when I recieved Your holiness
when You gave me new freedom, took me to Your kingdom, I spent all my
time around You

They all could see as things kept turning
and I returned to my old ways
to the weakest and the dearest all my nearest
[?]

Bowing down again, i have no strength, to live in today
Jesus was I left behind or have you no space in my heart
Trading in for slavery, a freedom dearly bought
I can't rip the shackles off me
Jesus would you take me home now
I have no more strength to care
I can not and i will not
I leave all this behind me
There is no way returning
There is no God left for me

You made me empty, guess to fill me,
but sin was able to survive
I lost my faith, in strength that is found in repentance
allthough i wish to find your face
I guess this world needs someone wretched,
reminder to blessed ones
the wish of our creator was to cease my failure
and to cure this twisted nature

Where's the strength to go on?
I have no friend to comfort my soul
Tell me what kind of a hero,
stumbles on the smallest rock,
dies on the way to battlefield
ends up a laughing stock,
achieving nearly evil
Maybe i was duely judgefull
mugging God's own Holy Ghost
this mighty warrior of the lord,
shall in flames of hell be lost,
where there is no way returning,
there is no God left for me
