If I told you that you're truly loved
How'd it make you feel, my one?
'fore your birth I knew you
If I told you that you are unique in me
I designed your very being
You're the only one who's you
I made you for a reason

Oh, Lord, look at me
That you love me doesn't matter
When no one even sees that I am here

Do not consider yourself so futile!

You're a hundert percent King's design
A model made in Heaven
Always top rate, no mistakes
But sin makes life so deeply burdensome
I know what people can be
They devalue and despise all life
Can't you trust in me?

I just wish I could be loved by someone
My pleadings are uncomplicated, you see

Trust me, I am working all things out just for your good

[spoken Isaiah 43:1b]
"Fear not, for i have redeemed you; i have summoned you by name; you are mine"

Untalented is my name
I am never smart enough
Plain and boring kind of guy
Not a social butterfly
I'm so tired of being the odd one out
And even you seem so very far away, can't you see?

You cannot see things the way that I do

You're a hundert percent King's design
A model made in Heaven
Always top rate, no mistakes
But sin makes life so deeply burdensome
I know what people can be
They devalue and despise all life
Can't you trust in me?
Trust in me for I trust in you
