How can we guard our faith in the loving Lord
There is too many people who have not opened the Holy Word
So we stumble, fall down, losing Him and all control
And our souls, they fade, soon our love is cold as stone
Here are the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
There you read what Jesus did and how He made a lame man walk
How He conquered the universe and made the world as one
And the Father God sent His Son to show His love

[Chorus]
There are four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
Book of Acts, Romans, Chorinthians, and Galations,
Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians,
Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, and James
Two PetersÂ´and three Johns' Jude and JohnÂ´s Revalation

Here is a Pharasee an angry man from Tarsus
And later on it is known that heÂ´s called Apostle Saul
He suffered very much and went through so many trials
And his letters tell how we should live worthwhile lives

[Chorus]
There are four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
Book of Acts, Romans, Chorinthians, and Galations,
Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians,
Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, and James
Two PetersÂ´and three Johns' Jude and JohnÂ´s Revalation

There is in store for us an old testament:
The creation, bloodlines, rules, poems, and prophets
All those children of man walking with the God of Word
Reading through these books you will learn to trust the Lord
Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus,
Numbers, Deuteronamy, Joshua, Judges, and Ruth
Samuels, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra and Nehamiah
Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastis, Songs (of Solomon),
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel,
Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah,
Nahum, Habukuk, Zephaniah, Haggai,
Zechariah, Malachi, and in the new:

[Chorus]
There are four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
Book of Acts, Romans, Chorinthians, and Galations,
Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians,
Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, and James
Two PetersÂ´and three Johns' Jude and JohnÂ´s Revalation

ThereÂ´s pride in knowing all sorts of tiny facts:
All my brothers seem to master many complicated knacks
So I will learn by heart what in Matthew, I can find:
ThereÂ´s a bloodline from Abraham to Jesus Christ
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, and Perez,
Hezron and Ram, Amminadab and Nahshom,
Salmon, Boaz, Obed, Jesse and David the king,
Solomon, Rehaboam, Abijah, Asa,
Jehoshaphat, Joram, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon,
Josiah, Jechoniah, Shealtiel,
Zerubbabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Sadoc, Achim, Eliud, Eleazar,
Matthan, Jacob, Joseph,
Jesus, the Christ, GodÂ´s only begotten Son
