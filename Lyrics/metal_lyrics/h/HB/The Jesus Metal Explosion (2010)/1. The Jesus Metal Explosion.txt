Jesus!
The name that makes me frantic,
I'm in a panic!
Need I use His name
or is there any other way to say it?

I talk at ease with you,
the weather's great
And my work is fine ...
We can discuss your
health and my family
But when it comes to that certain name..
I can't say Your name,
need You be called Jesus?
Could I just say God or The Supreme Power?
Even though I know Your words:
"I am The Way, no one comes
to the Father except through Me"

When the Jesus metal explosion hits
I will come to hear and see
My ways, My rights will become
your way, your will
from then on I can't be ashamed of Your name,
Jesus You're so good to me
You calm the storm, now I belong
There's no dead ends in You
Let Your name be the higher

So I'm the greatest of warriors!
I spread terror with my war face
I always reprimand sinners
'Wonder when did I forget that..

God in me loves,
He doesn't hate
God in me gives,
He doesn't take
God in me is patient
Can I say that He is in me?
If He is not in me,
I cannot love you
If I cannot love you,
I talk of Him in vain
For my words will be empty for
the lack of His changing power

When the Jesus metal explosion hits
I will come to hear and see
My ways, My rights will become
your way, your will
from then on I can't be ashamed of Your name,
Jesus You're so good to me
You calm the storm, now I belong
There's no dead ends in You
Salvation is found in one name
For this reason there's no shame
When Jesus metal explosion hits!

When Jesus metal explosion hits!
