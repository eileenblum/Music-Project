Are you saved for real? Now your life is ideal?
Have you made home your prison? What about our commission?
God has given you so much. Do you reach out to the lost?
Do you walk past with no thought, about those who have no hope?

Father in Heaven, help us surrender!
If you don't answer, all our hope is gone!

It is time to renew this covenant. Leave the past; take a step in faith again!
Take his hand, He will guide your way to his glory.
He takes care of everything.
It is time to renew this covenant. Leave the past; let the God be god again.
Take his hand, He will guide your way to his glory.
Jesus cares for everyone!

What are you waiting for? A revelation, the Pentecost?
Why is it hard to see, all you need is to believe.
Do you think that it's enough, just to have faith, then shut up.
If you do know Him, your mouth, it is open to testify!

The Lord is your shepherd, why do you worry?
Kneel down before him. You need His love again!
