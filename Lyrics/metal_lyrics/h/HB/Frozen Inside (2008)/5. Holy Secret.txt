I have a Holy Secret. It's written in my heart.
No one can take it from me. And I can't share my own.
He is Jesus. He is Jesus.
Who can never let me down.

You're my Holy Lord, who has seen my tears and confessions, there's no doubt.
Now I'm here to say:"Thank you, Jesus. You're my salvation, You're my God."

There was a dark shadow and I fell in love with sin.
I was slave to this world. Then you gave your best for me.
Let me feel you. Fill my heart now.
Holy Spirit come on me.
