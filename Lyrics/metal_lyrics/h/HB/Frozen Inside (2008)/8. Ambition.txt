Once I saw a man full of passion,
So brave and so filled with the Word.
He spoke like no other, like thunder
Authorised with great love.

His presence encouraged us all and
We felt that God wants to move.
All troubles just vanished and were gone -
A reason to praise the Lord!

There's a real believer, more than all of us!

Why do we take all your glory, we know it belongs to You, oh Father
And to your Son the Righteous One
He reigns with His love, reigns with His love.

Who are we trying to impress. You are the one who deserves all praise.
Because of your Son, the Righteous One
Your beloved Son, beloved Son.

Once I saw a Lady full of grace,
Thought tired still preaching the word.
She cried out and wept when she told us
That God really loves us all.

"Not everyone will go to Heaven,
Some will face the wrath of God."
At last people realized that they must
Decide on whoms side they are.

Many were forgiven, they were born again.
Jesus was uplifted, the rest faded away.
