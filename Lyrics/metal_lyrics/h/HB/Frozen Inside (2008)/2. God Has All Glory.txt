When I was reborn, You gave your sign to me.
The cross was the way and it says you'll be with me... day after day.
I heard you calling and felt that I had to seek You!
And I finally realized, that your ways are so much higher than mine.

You know everything. Your wisdom and power exceeds all limits

God has all Glory, Power and Honour!
He came to save us. He gave his life for us!
God has all Glory, Power and Honour!
He concurred death and brought us salvation.

You forgave all the things that were sin against you.
It was so outstanding -- my dark heart is so clean -- You love me so!
Now I want to serve you. Whatever you want, I will do.
You have all the Power that's why I can trust in You. Jesus, my lord!

My life belongs to you, You promised to lead me and never leave me.
