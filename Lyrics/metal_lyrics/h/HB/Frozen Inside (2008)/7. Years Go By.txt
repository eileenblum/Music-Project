Once there was a happy time. A little boy and his old father shared true love.
Together they played many games. Any thought wasn't shared for tomorrow.
As time goes by and children grow,
old games are lost, new ones take their empty space.
The son has left his home and the father now waits broken hearted.

Sometimes this happens without any reason.
The blame can be found in various places.
When families are broken to pieces by Satan and
Wounds too deep to be ignored starts to form.
Can any help be found?

Years just go by. Old memories of home fade off.
Still the father cries, he's longing for his lost child:
"Why waste this life? Come home while there still is time.
So long I've been searching for my child. Oh please, hear my call."

Once there was a cheerless time. A little girl looked at the world with a tear.
Her only friend was an old doll, for she did not have a mother to love her.
As time goes by and children grow,
old tears are lost, new ones take their empty space.
The girl has left this world and there's no one to recall and miss her.

Sometimes this happens without any reason.
The blame can be found in various places.
When families are broken to pieces by Satan and
Wounds too deep to be ignored start to form.
Can any help be found?

Everyday you'll face the fact:
It really matters how you build your own future.
The decisions that we make have serious, long lasting effects.
What bases are you building on?
Do you walk each day with the cross before you?
Jesus is the way. May he be the foundation of your life.
