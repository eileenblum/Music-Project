Oh can you hear the feet of him
that unto us good tidings bring:
The latest gossip of the sin of so-called lady Mary

The maiden of so great respect
the bride-to-be of dear Joseph
is with a child and does confess the baby is not of him

Now all can see her holiness
her honor, grace and faithfulness
was nothing but a vain pretense of being above all others

Oh, isn't all this fine
her sin is worse than mine

Oh have you heard the latest news
of how the carpenter would choose
to stay attached and make his wife that infamous girl, Mary

He used to seem a splendid man
we used to think his wisdom grand
Who would've thought that he could stand a filthy harlot by him

Now all can see his holiness
his honor, grace and faithfulness
was nothing but a vain pretense of being above all others

Oh, isn't all this fine
his sin is worse than mine

One night some ordinary men
just average shepherd brethren
gazed at a brightly shining star
and heard the sweetest news

They rushed off to the nearby town
Hear what they found: descended down
from heaven high the holy child
at mercies of plain men

Once they would see his holiness
his honor, grace and faithfulness
by hands of vain religiousness raised high above all others

Oh have you heard the news?
Oh have you heard the news?

Above my soul he'll always shine
for the sins he carried were mine
