You tongue will lead you with a dreadful might
Your mind will travel further from the light
Your thoughts will wonder deeper to the night
They are lusting, thinking itâs their right

Throw so sand in your eyes
If you cannot watch without
Feeling lust for things
You should not even think about
Please, just lift your hands up
So you cannot act it out
See, to whom youâll answer
Sin gains power from your lust

Some old quarrel is digging in your mind
You canât forget it, youâre still asking why
Want revenge for what is far behind
Donât want to do it, nor let it die
