You gave power, made me a beauty
You gave all things I could have holped for
You were better, so much better than others
Yes, I knew, I could not do to you

You were my brother, my lover
Faith, hope, like no other
Companion with strength and wisdom

I will do what you wish,
Change for new,
Even if time has come
To have faith in a different truth
A heavenly angel,
You clear me a way
Till I give my whole world
To your kind of rule

You were holy, formed in different world
Demanded eternal confidence
You were free of responsabilities
At the shame time made me a slave to fulfill your will

Tied my hands, sewed my lips
Wrapped thick chains round my hips
Crushed down the power of my faith
