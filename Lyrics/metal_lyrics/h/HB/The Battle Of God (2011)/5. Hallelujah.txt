My holy God
for all living things that you have created,
thanks for who You are,
I am greatful for the things You have done
You don't look for perfect fit,
heros, mighty metal kings.
Power, glory, majesty,
any momment victory.

Halellujah, halellujah,
all saint's prayes
aim to our God.
Halellujah, halellujah.
There is no greater love than His love.
Halellujah, halellujah.

Go to all the world.
Tell them Jesus is a merciful Savior.
Set your trust in Christ.
Say a prayer and you'll be recognized.
Always seek the perfect thing.
Seek your hero, mighty King.
Power, glory, majesty.
Seek the greatest victory...

Hallelujah, halellujah,
all saint's prayes
aim to our God.
Hallelujah, hallelujah.
There is no greater love than His love.
Hallelujah, hallelujah.
