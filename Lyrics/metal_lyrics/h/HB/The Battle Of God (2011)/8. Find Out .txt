Reason will fail and then itâs all over
Fools have a secret that is worth shouting for
After your death thereâs only one morning
Then you will see clearly, no point in regretting no more

You have to make amends to God
Accept His eternal love

Seek and youâll find out!
Maybe today will be your time?
Could Jesus still wipe out all the tears you cried?
Everything you hold inside?
Thereâs no need to hide now
He can see straight in to your heart
Lifts up your life and brings you close to God.

Millions wake up that terrible morning
Only one lifetime to decide what to choose
The day of your death may come without warning
The itâs too late, no point to complain, you will lose
