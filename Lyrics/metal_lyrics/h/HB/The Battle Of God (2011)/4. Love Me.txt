No, Heaven is not for me.
I cannot give you praise
with tongues I cannot speak.
No, there are hardly dreams for me.
No visions come to me,
no wisdom I could teach

I would prove you
I am your own.
I would fill that
place you gave me.

Don't you love me no more?
I'm afraid I failed.
Would you hold me, my lord?
For days and nights I prayed.
Please God, hear me.

No, Heaven is not for me.
Can't lift your fame up for
my hands are far too weak.
No, there are hardly dreams for me.
Nothing I do shows your
power to those who seek.

I would prove you
I am your own.
I would fill that
place you gave me.

Don't you love me no more?
I'm afraid I failed.
Would you hold me, my lord?
For days and nights I prayed.
Please God, hear me.

Don't you love me?
Don't you no more?
I'm so afraid I failed.
Would you hold me, my Lord?
For days and nights I prayed.

Don't you love me no more? x4
Don't you love me, my Lord? x4
Don't you love me, don't you love me, Lord?
