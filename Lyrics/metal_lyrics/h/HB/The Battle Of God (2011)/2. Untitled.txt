In beginningâs start
At the end of ends
There is only one
Who knows everything
Sees my whole being
Lifts me from de ditch
He keeps walk on
Helping His people

I mustnât steal and I mustnât kill
I mustnât love a master but Him
And I will not, for I have no need
I only trust one Almighty King

Not busy, never sleeps
Just listen, He will speak
The whole world is made of
The Words of His wisdom
In beginningâs start
At the end of ends
Faithfulness can be
A tremendous help
I am safe from all
The evil things, they fall
He takes me along
Helping His people

I mustnât witness black to be white
I mustnât covet what isnât mine
And I will not, for I have no need
I only trust the Almighty King
