Who will take the blame or
who will pay the price for
teaching what is false
in the sight of God

You can be a leader
preaching of a heathen
God without the dull side
of judging us

Don't let the devil rest
do the things you do best
make sure that God
will be glorified

Such things will in you grow
no one can overthrow
ask that in God
you'd be satisfied

The battle of God
needs the strongest of hands
The bravest is he who
declares where he stands
So come all ye faithful,
you heroes of God
Die to the world,
be alive in Christ

Who will take the blame or
take the money raised for
those who do not have daily
bread today

Heaven is for sale in
this life but in the next those
first will be the last like
the Gospels say

You don't bother to resist
temptation, any beast
mercy will cover
all things you've done

Your tree will not carry fruit
it's dying at the root
while there are plenty
of things to do

The battle of God
needs the strongest of hands
The bravest is he who
declares where he stands
So come all ye faithful,
you heroes of God
Die to the world,

You cannot make it without God

Turn to Him in all your want

He forgives you everything

Gives a brand new beginning

The battle of God
needs the strongest of hands
The bravest is he who
declares where he stands
So come all ye faithful,
you heroes of God
Die to the world,
be alive in Christ
