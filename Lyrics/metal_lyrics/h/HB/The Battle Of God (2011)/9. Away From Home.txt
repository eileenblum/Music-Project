Yesterday morning he woke up with no home
Today he saw that he has no tomorrow
With empty eyes heâs starting at a wall
Longing for one, who could love him through it all

Heâs feeling so far away from home
Heâs feeling so far away from home

You may think that all of the good deeds
He has done is enough
But the main thing is to whom he
Gives his soul on this side
Each of us recieves a chance to
set our faith in God up high
Heâs our only hope of true salvation

I saw his eyes gazing up unto the skies
His lips were searching for words that would be right
Wondrous Father, you who live in Heaven high
Give me your strength; I need here by my side

Iâm feeling so far away from home
Iâm feeling so far away from home
