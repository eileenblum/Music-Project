Time of silence come
Tears are swallowed down
Tears that I deserve today
You have heard me speak in untruthful ways
Time of silence come,
You know what Iâve done
So I stay out of your sight
Yet I realize I need you by my side

Save me from myself
I cannot tell whatâs best for me
Save me from myself
For you are all Iâll ever need
Save me from myself
I cannot live without your love
Save us from ourselves
Please help us see what we have done

Time of silence come
At the end of times
I believe and yet I fear
I know without doubt my punishment is near
Time of silence come
I will need someone
Will need help from God Himself
Without Him I cannot save myself
