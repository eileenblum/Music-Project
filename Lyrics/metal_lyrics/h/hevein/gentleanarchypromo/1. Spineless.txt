I don't like what you have to offer
Just shut the hole under your nose
Been listening to the fucking whining
And now I got one thing to say
Found your lack of vision
Disturbing to say the least
You shouldn't be doing what you're doing
When you're cut you bleed, bleed like me

One man's trash is another man's treasure
One man's pain is another man's pleasure

So...
Donât give me that hooker with a heart of gold
Donât give me that hooker with a heart of gold

A gargantuan clusterfuck
Is what you have become
The fucking money corrupts everyone
With it's power destroys all, under the sun
Never surrender(no surrender)
Never submit
Always remember
Never forget

One manâs trash is another manâs treasure
Just like one manâs pain is another manâs pleasure

So...
Don't give me that hooker with a heart of gold
I said don't give me that hooker with a heart of gold

Rip it, shred it
The very fabric of your life

[Cello solo]

One manâs trash is another manâs treasure
One manâs pain...
One manâs pain becomes your pleasure

So...
Don't give me that hooker with a heart of gold
Don't give me that hooker with a heart of gold, no
I said don't give me that hooker with a heart of gold bullshit
