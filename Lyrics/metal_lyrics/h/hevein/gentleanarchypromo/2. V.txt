You own my world
You own a lot of things
You own so many things
But you really own nothing
you really own nothing, nothing
Nothing!

YOU!
The choice you make is the price I pay
Educate yourself

With reason
There are so many things
To fill your shell
disinformation breeds
you are the one I used to need
who informs you?
who feeds you news?

YOU!
The choice you make is the price I pay
Educate yourself

YOU!
Born awake. Die in your sleep
Sense it makes

YOU!
The choice you make is the price I pay
Educate yourself with reason

What you put in; in time, repays.

The choice you make is the price I pay
Educate yourself

YOU!
Born awake. Die in your sleep
Sense it makes

YOU!
The choice you make is the price I pay
Educate yourself

YOU!
Born awake. Die in your sleep
Sense it makes
