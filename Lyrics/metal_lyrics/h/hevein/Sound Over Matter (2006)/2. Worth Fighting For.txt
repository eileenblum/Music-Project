Stop living in the past
What you see is the end
Whatever you're going to do
You better do it fast

I can't deny, what you despise
It's my time, it's my time
Would you fight for my life?

I can feel a surge of, ANGER RISE
Do I need to burn holes, WITH MY EYES!
I can feel a surge of, ANGER RISE!
Do I need to burn holes, WITH MY EYES!

Quit fucking around, quit stalling, quit slowing us down

What you see is the end
Quit raping the sound, quit faking, the pain you cause will topple your crown!

I can't deny, what you despise
It's my time, it's my time
Would you fight for my life?

I can feel a surge of, ANGER RISE
Do I need to burn holes, WITH MY EYES!
I can feel a surge of, ANGER RISE!
Do I need to burn holes, WITH MY EYES!

Is it? Is it? Is it worth fighting for?
Is it? Is it? Is it worth dying for??
