Bleed the day, every and anyway.
Suck it dry. Do or do not, there is no try.
Do what they say, the elite will never pay.
You jump how high they say.

Believe what you see with your own eyes.
In the flesh it will be, not televised.
I know you want something.
The puppets speak with the master's mind.

If I never see you again, it'll be too soon.
No beginning no end, don't let the fool rule.

Mark the sky. Rage intensified.
Impressive, most impressive.
Fight, fight!

Release what you feel on the inside.
No more honesty in this world of lies.
I know you want something. We all want something.
No one speaks for me. No one speaks my mind.

If I never see you again, it'll be too soon.
No beginning no end, don't let the fool rule.

Bleed the day...(x6)
Bleed it!
Bleed the day!
Bleed it! (x3)
