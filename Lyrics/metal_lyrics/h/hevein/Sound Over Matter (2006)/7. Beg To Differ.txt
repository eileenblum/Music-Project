I've perceived my fate.
I control my hate. Enlightened state.
Receive and delete.
Knowledge is power, true power is to create.

I can read you.
Wanting approval and wanting removal of doubt.
You'd take it all away.
I don't agree with you.
Your making of statements and preaching is getting old.

Little by little, you are the cause of my restraint.
This sinking feeling; dragging me down, there's no escape.
Submersed in sorrow, hold my breath till a better day.
Your words are so hollow, I maybe gone but it's not too late.

You've thrown your weight.
Last man standing; now finish, what's on your plate.
I'm alone. No way known.
Free from harsh control.
I'll wear you down to the bone.

No it's not too late!
Now finish it!
