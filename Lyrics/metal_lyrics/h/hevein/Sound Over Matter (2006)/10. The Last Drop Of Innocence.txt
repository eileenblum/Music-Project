It seems, things won't be the same.
Depleted, tolerance for pain.
We see, an eviler day.
The greed, the greed's here to stay.
The greed... tis here to stay.

Freeze, now take a step back.
Please, there's no way out now.
He sees, the skies turning black.
Screams, the violence out of hand.

This last drop of innocence.
Is all that's left to bleed.
Still keeps me burning.
No one can't help me!

This last drop of innocence.
Is all that's left to bleed!
Still keeps me burning.
Help me...

Peace, the forgotten trek.
At ease, the dangers over now.
He dreams, of one day coming back.
Redeem, forgive and forget.

This last drop of innocence.
Is all that's left to bleed!
Still keeps me burning.
No one can't help me!

This last drop of innocence.
Is all that's left to bleed!
Still keeps me burning.
Help me!

Help me..

This last drop of innocence.
Is all that's left to bleed!
Still keeps me burning.
No one can't help me!

This last drop of innocence.
Is all that's left to bleed..Bleed!
Still keeps me burning!
