As far as I can see
You're climbing walls of dependency
Disillusioned and full hypocrisy
Imagine a state of great suffering
Due to adversity
Now just memory

Say you need me, you don't answer
When you were needed, to kill this cancer
The change was needed, love changing everything
As far as the eye can see

Elation as certain as the ride
Poor little creatures still fighting for their last slice of pie
On their knees chanting; second is first last
You got to see beyond the spec of time your on this earth to get a better...
To get a better glance

Say you need me, you don't answer
When you were needed, to kill this cancer
The change was needed, love changing everything
As far as eye can see

As far as eye can see
