It's nice that your here, I've got some news for you.
We came so near, I played my part like a fool.
You believed in me, I've raped your trust again.
See it wasn't enough, the sickest part of me wanted your blood.

Living life like a butterfly.
Speck of dirt that's caught in your eye.
Try to wash it away.
But you can't get inside.
Still you try.

I've taken a step, I tripped over myself again.
And I don't understand what happened to my well-laid plan.
You followed me, that's when things got way out of hand.
You didn't see, that I'm only human but I did the best I could.
I'm doing the best I can.

Living life like a butterfly.
Spck of dirt that's caught in your eye.
Try to wash it away.
But you can't get inside.
Still you try. (x2)

So you fall back on me.
Things are better this way.
This way. (x2)
