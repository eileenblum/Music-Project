Not one iota of thought.
Not one iota of vision.
Just cornered and distraught.
Complimented submission.

No room to maneuver.
No room for mistakes.
Dish the pain out as you wish.
Don't worry if it breaks.

Seeing is believing.
It's the small things that count.
Singing, screaming.
It takes one to know one.

Leave me be, let me go.
You cannot fathom what I know.
Is this real or a show?

My redemption is unknown.
Do you see, do you know?
I need to find an answer within.

Not one iota of envy.
Not one iota of hate.
No need for confusion.
Just mellowed and sedate.
Remove what's not working.
Replace that what's fake.
Create an atmosphere of trust.
On which life is made.

Leave me be, let me go.
You cannot fathom what I know.
Is this real or a show?

My redemption is unknown.
Do you see, do you know?
I need to find an answer.
