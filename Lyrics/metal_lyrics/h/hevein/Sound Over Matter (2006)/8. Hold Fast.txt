Non-compliance is my world.
The lack of information and disregard.
Ignorance festering, digesting the whole.
Brought back to life through quick reaction.
Time to batten down the hatches.
Nobody in nobody out.
Peel away the shadow.

Hold fast, hold strong.
Blind belief won't hold on.
Same shit, different day.
And we go on and on and on.

Now watch the cracks disappear.
Redefine your look at fear.
Desire a change in line.

Hold fast, hold strong
Blind belief won't hold on
Same shit, different day
And we go on and on and on!
We go on. (x2)

The times have changed but I have not.
The voice of reason has coughed.
Exposing what it really was.
Just another opinion.

The times have changed.
The times have changed.
But I have not!

Hold on, hold fast, hold strong.
Don't think that you deserve it.
Hold on, hold fast, hold strong.
Rise, rise rise!

Hold on, hold fast, hold strong.
Don't think that you deserve it.
Hold on, hold fast, hold strong.
Rise, rise rise!

Know you deserve it! (x2)
