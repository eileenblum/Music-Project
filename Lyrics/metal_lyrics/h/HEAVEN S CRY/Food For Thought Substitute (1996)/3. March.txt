To set myself for battle
To defend ourselves from gore
And to kill in the name of god, you see
Is not what I meant to be
So don't ask me
We must protect ourselves from slavery
The desolation army is coming in fury
They'll steal our bread, our wine and our wives

Oh, let him leave
I cannot leave my ways behind
Listen to the words he sings
This is a crime against mankind
Oh, let him leave
In the woods he'll be safe as a king

I can't fight
Why don't you get it
The march isn't right
I'm seeking a sanctuary
To last

And what a funny thing to think of such nonsense
You ask me to erase the ways that I've been taught
To kill a man always been the darkest sin
And now you urge me to be part of the genocide
Forget about the teachings, little man
In times of war we all must compromise
You have to think about me and your mother

I'm leaving this place behind new sanctuary

Don't leave us now
We need you here now
We have to win the final debate
Your father told you
Don't ever make that mistake

Freedom and liberty
He is gone now
Can't stop him now
We have to win the final debate
We must change the scheme
For our own sake
Changes, stagnation, truth, lies
Light, chains, freedom and liberty
In my new sanctuary

Don't leave us now
We need you here now
We have to win the final debate
Your father told you
Don't ever make that mistake

Freedom and liberty
He is gone now
Can't stop him now
We have to win the final debate
We must change the scheme
For our own sake
