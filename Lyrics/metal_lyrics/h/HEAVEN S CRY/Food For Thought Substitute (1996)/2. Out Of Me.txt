Welcome to you, oh mighty one
For the time has come to receive
The clash of the titans is over
And you shall be king
Control over your own cells
Now that you've found this new emotion
What is there to be seen
Reality bites as you open your eyes
Nothing seems to be real

Could it be that you've found
The stranger locked inside your crown
And as you find this inner strength within yourself
Remember, the shift might be too strong
Temptation of leaving this place will occur
Remember, you have to be strong

And as you are proceeding into your mind
Everything starts to unfold
The past, the present and the future are told
In ways which are unspeakable
Your life is an open book
And as you find the inner strength within yourself
Remember, the shift might be too strong
Temptation of leaving this place will occur
And remember the boundaries of disorder

Your head starts to spin
The world starts to turn
Your body disappears
The weight of time's no longer present
Mad comprehension of the world
Is forming within yourself

Now that I know what I've found
A lie buried deep in my mind
I must erase this old sin
Out of me

To read and to feel is what we ought to be
Claim the deep seas and the topless mountains
No longer a part of thee
Nor able to share the dream
I will go on a journey
