The blind man drank the water of reason
His eyes opened suddenly
Through what he is, his soul will be
And who he was, will never be again

I can see no future in here
If we don't take a stand now we'll fall

The secrets of the elder are hidden
By concepts of normality
The sanctuary of a new born vision
Will slowly be held by millions and millions

I belong to no flag, race or religion
Have no stable step to put my feet on
We have to let our need for evolution
Build a bridge to a better world

Hold on creators of this destructive future
Financial angels, you should be sent to hell
You've put us all in this nightmare
There's no way we can reverse this bad affair
Hold on, traitors
You shall all be judged under your god's crime

Hidden knowledge of secret societies
Will all have to be revealed
Stop government control of the media
It's time to claim the information

Circles of truths in all beliefs
Faith is the lie they use to lock one's door
You end up in the middle of the circle
No key to get out, you stay behind the walls.
