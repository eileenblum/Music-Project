Shine, wherever you are
Come on and share the light that is within you
Feel the limitless rise
Completely pass through you and me.

Sights of overwhelming designs
Tap into your memory core, abundance flowing
Unclenching the files
Establishing new points of view
Distortion's been cleared
Of this passenger's field and surroundings .

Fly the wings of life
In places you can't hide
And discover the real you inside ?
