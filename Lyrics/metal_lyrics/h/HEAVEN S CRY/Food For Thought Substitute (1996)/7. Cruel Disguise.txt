There's a chance for a future
A chance for all human beings
Trapped within these altered faces
Hiding behind our disguise
That protects us from the pain
And the truth that's deep inside of us all

I'm the king of your nightmares
The ruler of your despair
To disobey your soul
And I will set all your boundaries
Control your anxiety
And never let you grow

And I will decide what you remember
Despite of what you languish for
Your desperate cries tear the night
And I will close the curtains on your dreams
And all that you'll ever see
Will be obscured until the end

In this world, I'm your cruel disguise
You're just an image, I can decide
You're just a false face of what I am

I am the bringer of all your fears
Afraid of slowly fading away
We won't ever let them go
And I am the mask that you always wear
When you exchange with all your friends
You'll never be yourself

I'm your worst nemesis
No one can be closer to you
I just want to remember

Who will be fading, who will remain
This constant struggle, through all these years
See all that I am, the essence of man
Tearing the flesh suit apart
I'm an invisible scar

I am a leap of faith
In the most desperate times
Release of hooks
From this tortured state of mind

Follow the steps
To the uncharted lands
And unleash the purity of life
The point of no return
