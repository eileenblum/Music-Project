[I. The Alchemist's creation]

In a strange gallery, an old man's work takes form
Illuminated by a candle, his visions light the dome
In a sea of immortals, his soul will be sown
As the universe will be pleased to welcome its new son
Four species were his prey
In the fields of the odds, from the world of unknown
Took the blood out of their bodies
And had the purest goal, to blend it with his own
The alchemist's work is done
To procreate without a form
And his death had been mourned

[II. The valley of confusion]

The creatures are left on their own
In the valley near their father's corpse
No language they ever learn
No answers spoken from the icon
Not a word

The death of their creator left them mutated
A look in their eyes shows the beast inside
Alone they would've built, together they destroy
And duality begins to possess their minds
Soul alike, they will fight until the end of their lives
For democracy, hypocrisy, democracy, hypocrisy
Demon's creation

[III. From one to another]

They're in for war and they set for Vietnam
If they don't try to accept others' differences
In any situation, they're in for religion, inquisition
To live and to kill under new institutions
In any way

The fact the gifts they received from the sage
Are the will to decide of what's wrong or right
And the need to understand through individuality
But they lean towards destruction
Took over creation, became philosophy
A narrow-minded eagle that won't expand its horizon

[IV. The box of images]

One of them created a thought-box
To regulate security
And to create a limited universe
A mentality formed into one's dream
Preventing the last war's doll
Building fences, suppressing thoughts
He trapped the others inside a cage
So they could breathe from the same wind
But the box held the wind at bay?
