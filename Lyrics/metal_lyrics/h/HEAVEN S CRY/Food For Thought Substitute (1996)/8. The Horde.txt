Dreams? I've been having those dreams
Since my birth on earth
The idealistic horde
That could heal the disease of man
Different I have always been
And that's how I'm meant to be
And it hurts to think you're alone
When the crowd is yelling so loud
I cannot bring my thoughts down
The secret places I've reached
Are nothing if I can't let it out

Visions of our wisdom, imagination is defined
The horde is divided in a world of design
Time has come to lead our minds for a change
Memories of the past are gonna seek the world at last!

Lies? that's all I hear from them, lies
Hope insanity won't take me away
Look at what they teach us anyway
It's for us, to never reach a change in our minds
The complex they have put us in
Is a long-lived conspiracy
Well, none of us will stand up for our right
Or will be shot down
By a bullet or their tongues
Every man's mission is to dream
But dreams are dreams
If you don't let them out

Visions of our wisdom, imagination is defined
The feeling of a horde was meant for all mankind
Time is now to lead our minds for a change
Every man becomes a child at the edge of a fall!

I fly through my mind
I can't talk, I can't think
Future is not settled as my part is redefined
Hell is close to heaven as I change the basics in my mind
The sun, the moon and the earth
Are the key to understand the dream?
