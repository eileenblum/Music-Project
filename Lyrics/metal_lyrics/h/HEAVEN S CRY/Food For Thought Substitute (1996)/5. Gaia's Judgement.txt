The game began thousands of years ago
Nations already under their control
They took their places behind our kings and queens
In the name of the power and the glory

Can't you feel it, can't you see it
The time has come to open our lives
For the time assigned to us has come to an end
Can't you feel it, can't you see it
There's no time to play our games anymore
For our mother earth is calling for a new kind of day

We were left alone without comprehension
All alone in this little point of the universe
Living in this world that we still don't understand
We're nothing but a grain of sand in the sea

We might be nothing compared to all there is
But still we have the will to think,
To sense and to create
Together we could be like a ship on the milky way
Oh Lord, how can we be so blind

For our mother earth is calling for a judgment day!
