Silence is all I hear from you
Violence is what you put me through
I wonât stop fighting for my life
I wonât beg until I swallow my pride

All of this time our world is blind

This canvas weâve created
A blueprint of whatâs to come
Forward we are leaning
Backwards the damage is done

Iâm waiting for the healing
To come our way
Anticipating

Wonât be fulfilled if we run away
Responsibility for yesterday
Letâs go the distance
We are all to blame
With no resistance
Work towards the change

Silence, no regrets
I canât wait another day
Accounting for all we have to save
For all the loss big brother cost to date

The world keeps on dancing
Dancing with the fools
Fools who like their ego
A storm is coming soon
