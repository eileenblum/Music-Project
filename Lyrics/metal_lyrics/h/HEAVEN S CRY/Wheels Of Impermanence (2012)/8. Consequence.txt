Your heartâs a mess
And your brain is under pressure
Youâre in distress
The killing machine is grafted on me

You used to care
For the crooked as much as the loved ones
Stuck in this mess
Too many wheels

So many depend on your survival
How can you pretend?
Youâre a lie

The killing machine
My spine is your system
Your vitals fatigued
The people are suffering

From your first breath
A mind game forever
A soldierâs death
For supremacy

Fight, inspire
Of what they made you believe was true
But smite and strike
Reserve the hold they have on you
The signs of time
Your own sense of emptiness
The mind, the line
When action leads to consequence
The wheels of impermanence
The illusion of self control
When your world is crumbling
The action to save your own
Finding your way
Likeâ¦
