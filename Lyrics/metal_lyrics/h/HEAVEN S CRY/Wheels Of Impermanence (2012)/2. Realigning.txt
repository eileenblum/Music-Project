All of this time I could never see
The seeds we planted
Were right in front of me
Too much frustration
The hate was blinding me
The bad vibrations
Slowly killing me

No matter how I tried to fight it
And stop the tables from turning
From past to present in an instant
I seem to finally come to terms withâ¦

All of the bridges slowly burning
All of the pain and all the hurting
All of the shame,
Surely all the blame,
Somehow, in the end is realigning

Life making sense again
Breaking the waves of fear
No use pretending that
You never cared for me

Life found a way, found a way to get away
From yesterday, never never thought Iâd say
That all the hate, all the pain and suffering
Were just a game, never ending game we played
