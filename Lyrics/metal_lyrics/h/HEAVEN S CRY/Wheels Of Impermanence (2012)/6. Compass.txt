The ship is sailing freely and the oceans are maids
We see the sky ahead painted in grey
To seek a world of peace we explore new worlds
Since the flood that washed away our homeland
Yet underwater might be our end

And if we should fail with our lives
It'd be the extinction of our kind
Longing to reach inner peace
And find a shelter
Release the anchor
In this world where only power leads
And no one tends to make sense

Heading forward deeper, far abroad
The prow looks so small
The ship like a shard
Surrounded by water
A wave is coming
Oh, we might never breathe again
Time to say goodbye
To this damn refugee life
Drowned in sand

And if we should fail with our lives
It'd be the extinction of our kind
Longing to reach inner peace
And find a shelter
Release the anchor
In this world where only power leads
To never be lost again on the sea, on the sea
