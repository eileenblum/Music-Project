Save my fatherâs land
Save, the stream is dead
Heavy machinery raping
Forests without a care

Their ways to silence us
Itâs too late to turn the clocks
We lost our ancestral homeland
Expropriate a few hundred men

The need, to face reality
How far, they push brutality
We, but a shadow in darkness
All of us stand up and speak

Thereâs something hidden in the water
Thereâs hidden notions in the air that we breathe
The cruelty of menâs upon us
The mad machine is taking over the wheel
Over

We reach, far and wide
Show our, leaders why
The balance of power is shifting
We are rebellion

The need, to face reality
How far, they push brutality
We, but a shadow in darkness
All of us stand up and speak

Thereâs something hidden in the water
Thereâs hidden notions in the air that we breathe
The cruelty of menâs upon us
The mad machine is taking over the wheel

Over
Itâs over
