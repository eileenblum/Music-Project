As a monarch you have grown
To expect more for your own
And every step you fake
Is to secure this fate

Youâre destined to be
A doll on its knees
Following an aged plan
From your silly elitist clan

EgOcentric doll

Did you really think you were the promised child?
When did you realize you couldnât choose the path?
Following the footsteps of your legacy,
You start to drown in a perverted seaâ¦

All hail to the empireâs doll!
The one watching who minds us all

Your deceitful speeches induce fear
In the elders and the meek
When lies turn to truth
Through your distorted point of view

With your gentle look hiding
Your addiction to power and greed
When your order takes it all
And âvampiresâ us all

EgOcentric doll

Did you really think you could fool us all?
That the play would really establish the norm?
A new generation awaiting for thee
For they see what you have not yet seenâ¦

All blames to the empireâs doll!
The one who enslaved and fooled us all!
Damned cult!

The end of your reign
EgOcentric doll
