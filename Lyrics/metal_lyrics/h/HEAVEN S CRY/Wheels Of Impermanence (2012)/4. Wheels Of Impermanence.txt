Trapped in the gears of insanity
Our societies caught off
Of what life is really made of
The beauty shifts to null
So is the reason of all
We can feel the sadness
Turn into madness

For the sake of us all
The tides are turning,
The winds are changing,
Evermore at the shore
A new cast is shaping
As the offsprings take place
At the core...
The core...
At the core...
The core...

The wheels of impermanence
Forge the world through
Conceive new points of view
Lucidity of the youth
Aims for limitless synergy
Gives a new direction
A release of the tension

For the sake of us all
The tides are turning,
The winds are changing,
Evermore at the core
A new cast is shaping
As the children of the world

So my message to you,
Let yourself be
Lead us to a future
Where we still breathe
No longer an end
To the journey
A visionary dreamer
Not a pity sleeper
And create, recreate
Let the motion flow unexpectedly

For the sake of our own
The tides are turning,
The winds are changing,
For the sake of survival
The tides are turning,
The winds are changing,
Evermore at the shore
A new day is coming
As the offsprings take place
At the core...
