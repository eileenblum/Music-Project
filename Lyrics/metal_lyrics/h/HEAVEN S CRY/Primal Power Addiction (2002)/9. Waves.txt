Breaking the waves of fear through thoughts
I replay in my head cycles of my deepest scars

Come to heal them where they can be found
right here inside, you touch what I hide

Breaking the waves of life through dreams
so I mend in my schemes the unnecessary links

The rotten corners are so hard to glide
suppressing the waves that hide all the pain and shatters my intentions
the precious spice was lost to the corpse
I went out of me looking for the keys
closer to insanity

Facing the creep looking at him straight in the eyes

You can't deceive my world
my balance won't be denied
I became enslaved in this world
with my life, left aside?

Breaking the waves to draw at the source
so cold reality is easier to endure

My focus enlarged by so many visions
I'm facing the common wheel of our world
time within a single spark
releasing the same fear of ours

Controls are in my hands once again

Over the edge I stared at the bottom and then
found the beauty of life once forgotten?

You can't deceive my world
my balance won't be denied
I was once enslaved in this world
with my life, left aside
You can't deceive my world
my balance won't be denied
To become the dreamer again
even with the light?
