The child has come of age now,
the newcomer has been forged to deny
the income of an alien world
the acts where his equal is barely found
Rejected for his differences,
rejected he tries to shut, shut, shut them down,
like a desperate clown.

He's lying, he's hiding
the source that inspires him
retrieving imagination to forget his unexpected role

One out of twenty four births,
an insurance to disturb habits, behaviors
preconceived scenes don't suit him,
from outside he perceives the play in all
he projects on all

He's is a viper, spreading poison
waiving his tail
for a change in a corrupted World,
he's in a quest for unexpected roads

One of twenty four,
the healer,
leader, uniting all
you can't deny
your words
your blood
Shaman!
YOU CAN'T DENY!

[CHORUS]
You're the idol, spreading wisdom
through your say for a change
Weaving through the haze,
evolution for all
is surely your only way
your way?
