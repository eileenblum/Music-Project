The hawk, cunning bird of prey
rides the wind to observe
his only predator assaulting his domain

cables, trucks and pavement
left the runaway restless, unsheltered

I say fly, head high
to the mountain top!
avoiding, escaping the city's deadly arms
from sightings to sightings,
the hunting won't withdraw
for the profit of masterdom

On earth, seas and land
we're all bound to meet its demand

As a whale ascends to the surface
It grasps a single breath of air
a ship legally sacks and packages his realm

The last of his entire race,
Sure we know, but it's worth the pay

I say swim, breathe and dive
on the seas around!
avoiding, escaping
the fishing's deadly arms
from sightings to sightings,
the hunting won't withdraw
for the profits of masterdom

Breathing along with nature's perfections
a young native meets a world of magicians
a promised paradise

Left the tribe to work at their command
for 5 cents an hour,
there's no comfort at hand
realized his land has been
spoiled and purged,
thousand years of knowledge gone

On earth, seas and land,
we're all bound to meet its demand
