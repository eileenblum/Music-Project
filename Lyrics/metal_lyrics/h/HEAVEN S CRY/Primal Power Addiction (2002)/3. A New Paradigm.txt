Water!
The flood will wash away the sins of an old disease brought by man.
Revenge, Mother's nature plan!
Sons of the earth, they lost their minds!?
These are the words of the native man
who still has hope to recover his land

And we, from one to last, if we stop the fights,
we could change our world for once
then leave the toys and take a new path that would suit everyone,
and our host may let us survive in a new paradigm

An excerpt in a million to define our differences
in the greedy human race, our own clan is always best
one preach for his country, the other his baseball team
an attitude from Mr. who?? that still won't care the others are slaves

We, all victims, if we stand as one
we could uphold all human rights,
and oppose ourselves to any kind of exploitation of one of us
the Universe may give us a place in a new paradigm?
