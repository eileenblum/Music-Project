Hey, my amnesia
What happened to the dreams we shared?
The colors, the shades,
were they just a phase?
No longer in our heart,
the love thy son's command
was it your vanity that rearranged it all
or misconceptions of the mind?

But under the sun,
there is no distinction we are One
Just like we used to sing,
it would never take our dreams away?

Walk on amnesia,
or you lead me to certain doom
chaos dwells inside my head,
what did you mean to do?
The gaps that I face
a part of it still heals
healing inside of me?
I'll find a way somehow
to remove those dreaded scars
no more hypnotized

In thoughts confidence builds
visions of sacred places
where a holy army rises
at the eve of a hopeless fight
we carry our own pride
illumination is bound to come

And in between our hearts,
lies a shadow in the darkness
that the light has cast away
a spark sowed in a soul
that in time will eventually grow
life is hoping we'll awake
and on goes humanity's crusade
