Colour circles through the haze,
shifts from time to time
spying on one another,
seeking for their kind
to rise, arise

and the man who doesn't belong awaits

Billions of faces,
limitless mirrors of the One
differences embodied our ancestors,
through wars and wars
and the man of mixed colours awakes,
and rises

Living, sharing,
breathing, dreaming

A union of shades
is born from millions of men,
who care not for a colour grey
but to live as a single frame
Now!

We
One
No illusions

Let the sphere lead you on,
Let the Universe feed you on,
And you'll be one

And it's our nature's pace,
seeking peace
in the end we all are
series of sums and negatives
the atom, the stars the galaxies
just live and die in a single breath...
