I'll find my own way
From the start I knew nothing would stay
Nothing has changed, but I'm to blame
I am the product of all your mistakes

Clinch through your teeth
It's always been me
But why is that?
Why am I to blame?
Trapped inside
Trapped inside of this game

So sit back and watch it all fall apart
Knew nothing would stay from the start
I'll stand by, singing to the tune of my reprise
Out of touch
Won't remain

A victim of circumstance is all I would be
Another hopeless soul
I refuse, you won't win
I'm still treading water
I will persist
Odds against me
You shot and you missed

Cast out, a ship with no sail
Born into this hell
Now you'll feel the pain that I felt when I was all alone
You reap what you sow
Karma caught up

Lead by example
You reap what you sow
Abandoned
Cut ties
