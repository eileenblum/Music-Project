Alone inside myself
Desolate betrayed by health

I search my mind for what kept me alive
Tearing at the seams of my inner being
I scrape at the surface
Itching to find true peace of mind
Searching for some sort of soundness
Longing for a form of foundation

Only to discover frustration
Consistent restlessness
This is being the ghost
I built these walls
Trapped myself inside
No pride to swallow

I've accepted what I've become
Forsook myself alone and numb
Muddled thoughts of consciousness as life escapes me

I run from reality
My mind wanders
In a state of seclusion
Agitation
I dig through my mind
No recollection
Misery
I just suffer by my own hand
Victim of consequence
My mind wanders

State of seclusion
A life with no conclusion
Never reaching contentment
Home to resentment
Trapped myself inside
Inside of my mind
