Repetition, the endless cycle
Born by violence
Follow in the footsteps
Walk until your feet bleed

I'm worn out from walking this path
Steady decline, going nowhere fast
In search of a purpose
I give way to rage

Another hole in the wall
Shedding skin, I'll just pretend

I grit my teeth
Worn out
Run down

It runs red, the hate through my veins
Lost my way, convinced I can't change
I am the scoundrel, misled by the hand that fed
Forged into a recluse
Another broken bone

Lost my way
I can't change
Cemented in fury
I can't change

Bagged eyes
Restless mind
Confined in anger
Knuckles burn
I am the host
Harborer of hatred
I'm shedding skin
