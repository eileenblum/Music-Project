Bear in mind
Lost
Heed the warnings
Absent instinct

Watered down with arrogance
Weakened world
We'll destroy ourselves
Spit on by the wealth
Humanity will claim itself

Careless
No regard
Lost intuition

And I'm so scared of what we've become
Hate-driven, selfish, mindless scum
We'll create the end
Albatross
Feeble minds
Careless, we'll create the end

So pry your eyes
Endless reporcution
Bear in mind, this is only temporary
Enstilled with uncertainty
I can't be the only one searching for answers
I question my worth, my own skin
I can't be the only one searching for answers

And I'm so scared of what we've become
Humanity's grown numb
So bear in mind, this is only temporary
Feeble minds, we'll create the end
