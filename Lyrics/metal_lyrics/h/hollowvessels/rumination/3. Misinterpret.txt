I'm consuming myself from the inside out
I've swallowed myself alive
Hoping and praying they'll die

I try to carry my weight
and yet they pull me down
Hate-fed motives
Cold grip pulling me into the ground
I'm tired of pulling away
They haunt me every day

I'm so tired of fighting myself
I remain sunk, swallowed by hatred
Hoping and praying that one day they'll stay dead

Already lost my sight
I'm losing reality
Lost my state of mind
This has become normality

Misinterpret
I question it all
Miscommunication
Will be the reason I fall

I beg these thoughts to fade away
Constantly fighting the pain
I am my own
I am my own worst enemy

Engulfed in their hatred
Dead hands gripping me tightly
I fall victim to darkness

Rid me of my demons
Eradicate me
My mind, my soul, my everything
Just take it all

I feel them crawling throughout me
Maybe I should have listened
I just want out
Let me out of my mind

Maybe I should have listened to the voices in my head
