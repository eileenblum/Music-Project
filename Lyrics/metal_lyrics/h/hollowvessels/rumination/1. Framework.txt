Total control of a nation
Drilled through the skull of population

Misrepresentation has become the constant
And we've allowed ourselves to lose all sight
Lost it all
Divided we'll fall
The same spark that created the flame
Doused in corruption
It's a shame

Blind sheep led by transparency
Trust these faces you'll never see
Count me out
Land of the free
Claimed by greed

So rest your eyes to see the lies
This place has become its own demise
Allowing split tongues spitting filth over unheard cries
Drowned out
Claimed by greed
Drowned out

Robbed blind
Force-fed minds
Blank faces
Ascendancy
Don't tread on me
