Manipulative vampirical prowess
Puling the veil of black leather over their heads
Suspended victims, pleasuring the blood thirsty countess!

Musty smell of attic dust
Candlelight shadows on a floor of blood
Transcendence! in torture they trust
A rite of passage, the agony now floods!

Whispers dance through burning smoke
Submission overwhelms, spiraling inward
Heads sinks backward and then they choke

Tattered pages, the text spoken aloud
Eternal darkness within and without
The book is open, the rancid words are howled
Veins of the serpent, they slither and branch out!

The energies transpose, reincarnation
Pulled within parasitic ghouls
Basking in the truth in mutilation
Determined, unleashing the ancient rule!

The hooks dig in, the skin it rips, the mask is zippered
Your rotting corpse is now sunken and withered

Musty smell of attic dust
Candlelight shadows on a floor of blood
Transcendence! in torture they trust
A rite of passage, the agony now floods!

Whispers dance through burning smoke
Submission overwhelms, spiraling inward
Heads sinks backward and then they choke!

Whispers dance through burning smoke!
Submission overwhelms, spiraling inward
Heads sinks backward and then you fucking choke!
