Imprisonment through cerebral self mutation
Eternal war of ravaging death
Negativity corroding the will
The false need to serve sensation

Self preservation in complacency
Maintaining the comfort zone, to blind to see

A self destructive, hatred it sows
A ticking time bomb, inside of you it grows

The need to release, relieve all of this pain
Avoid the mistakes that imprison and impede
Break the fear of everything to lose,
And nothing to gainâ¦but the pain!!

Dark Desires Churn!
Dying inside, this torture makes no sense
Leaking poison, rage itâs boiling
Dark Desires Burn!

Breathe in the fire and swallow the pill
Suppressing the urge to pummel and kill
These dark desires beckon but produce nothing
Sometimes fulfillment means to bleedâ¦
