Scavenging misery, drag your rage into me
Bleeding down in my heart, consuming the petrified atrophy
Stabbing wounds, replacing my blood with the tears
The tears of the dead! â Behold, the unhallowed unforeseen,
Brooding inside all our dreams.
Subversion of the populace, ravaging our own energies,
For the sake of the smoldering kingdom!

You are the one, who's essence I abhor,
I am the only one, who exterminates your birth,
With no way to unearth.
We are the unhallowed onesâ¦
Our blood will merge as one!

Blistering lungs as I inhale my disgust
Poisoning your aura as I exhale my distrust
Your blood stains me, no meaning to life but decay,
Your flesh deteriorates!

Hammering, drilling and piercing through my cranium
The agonizing dreams, they spill their seeds
Our future scars, the razors edge,
They will arise in a body of seething death!
Our blood will merge as one!

Scavenging misery, drag your rage into me
Bleeding down in my heart, consuming the petrified atrophy
Stabbing wounds, replacing my blood with the tears
The tears of the dead! â Behold, the unhallowed unforeseen,
Brooding inside all our dreams.
Subversion of the populace, ravaging our own energies,
For the sake of the smoldering kingdom!
