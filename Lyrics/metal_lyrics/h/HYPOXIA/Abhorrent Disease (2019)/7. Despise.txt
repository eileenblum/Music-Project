Revenge! I will watch you die!
Pounding through the stab wounds in your mind
My will is power, to recreate your hell
Your following the blind, an ignorant obsession
A shard of steel, I hammer down into your chest

I Despise!
I Despise You!
I Despise!
I Loathe you!

Burn in flames, Inhale your charred remains
I could not wait, no time to watch your body rot
This carnal sensation, to purge the earth
One by one destroy you all!

Digging graves, one for your head, five for the rest, your torn apart
Horrified, choking on tears, feeble god, your prayers go unheard
Grinding my thumbs in the back of your skull, your eyes â they're gushing blood
No remorse, you get what you get. We all shall burn in the end.

Burn in flames, Inhale your charred remains
I could not wait, no time to watch your body rot
This carnal sensation, to purge the earth
One by one destroy you all!

I Despise!
I Despise You!
I Despise!
I Loathe you!
