Ancient ones call me to the grave
Collect their bones, In the cemetery i will roam
Tortured vessel, a murderous slave
Guided by hatred, to the sacrificial tomb

Duct taped children, writhing in panic
Obeying the vicious doctrines
The voices are demonic (and) engulfing in flames -
Smoke reveals the answers
The lord of darkness appeased!
Leaving a blackened soul diseased..
Confused and abused
Paralyzed in torment
Only the whispers remain
They're all against you, kill them now!
Paranoia so true, the vile spirits howl!

Random acts of brutality
Abductions of wandering bodies
Knocked unconscious and dragged into place
Hunched over train tracks and
Watching as they split in two!

Possession consumes
Luciferian control
I proceed to exhume,
A pale rotting corpse with no soul
The muffled world it goes deaf
Twisted tongues spitting death!

Paralyzed in torment
Only the whispers remain
They're all against you, kill them now!
Paranoia so true, the vile spirits howl

These echoes flood, with more visions of bloodâ¦
My minds a haze, these voices collide
Set them ablaze, or skin them alive?
