Prepare! Incinerate the hordes of mortal doomâ¦
Boiling condemnation resides
A flash of lightning foreshadowing demise
Infernal devotion in genocide

Behold the fields of the putrefying impaled corpses
Burn their bodies as we raise our blazing torches
Eyes gouged, mutilation, severed head copulation

Agony! Misery! Calamity, Catastrophe!

Behold the fields of the putrefying impaled corpses
Burn their bodies as we raise our blazing torches
Eyes gouged, mutilation, severed head copulation

Impaled! Forsaken! Burned! And blistered!
Impaled, then cremation! Your burned Alive!

Intense torment, cursing your five senses
convulsing muscles, your body it now tenses
Pelted and blinded by acid rain
Chocking and drowning, in endless pain

Your broken bones, they're pounding on death's door
Tumbling down, to the abyss!
