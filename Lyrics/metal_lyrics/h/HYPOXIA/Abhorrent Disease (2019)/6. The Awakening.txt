Debasement, the flagellation of instinct
Suffocating, the principalities go extinct
Poisonous seeds, splinter inside
Suppression breeds, emptiness resides
Lashing out, defy the hypnotized herds
Ambivalence, question the hallowed words!

Eternal wastelands, eruptions of the molten fire
Behold the swarms of screaming souls in agony

False ideals, false hopes, insanity, confusion
Renege your prayers, hang the prophets
Turmoil amongst chaos, your heart you now uncross!

[Solo]

Failures of the festering flesh
Crashing down, echoes of inherent death
Exploding chest, blood splattered cage
Insipid lust, fuels my rage

Your forlorn corpse it beckons,
The object of repulsion
Abhorrent disease, through decay your mind will Awaken!

[Solo]
