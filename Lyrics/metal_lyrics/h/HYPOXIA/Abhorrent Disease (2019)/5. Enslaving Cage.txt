Sanguine bonds of seething horror
Instincts of a natural abhorrer
Irritating masks, so painful and sore
Clandestine dreams of splattered gore
Passionless shadow, dwelling in pain
Entangled in tendrils while burning in vain!

End this life! Endless Strife!

Overlords grinding internal nerves
Consuming the flesh with none left to preserve
Murderous hunger, I'm yearning to satiate,
These wells of unending hate.
Spiraling webs, mortified with confusion
Chaotic states â a mental contusion
A paralyzing rage, a metal purgatory â enslaving cage!

[Solo]

Never-ending despair, clawing at the skies
A prison of the mind in torturous time
Forgotten pathways through despondent halls
Dissolving consciousness, insanity calls!

It calls to all of us, it calls us inside, it's calling you now!

[Solo]

Overlords grinding internal nerves
Consuming the flesh with none left to preserve
Murderous hunger, I'm yearning to satiate,
These wells of unending hate
Spiraling webs, mortified with confusion
Chaotic states â a mental contusion
A paralyzing rage!, a metal purgatory â enslaving cage!
