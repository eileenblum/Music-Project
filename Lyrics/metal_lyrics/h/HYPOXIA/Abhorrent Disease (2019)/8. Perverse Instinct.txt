Morbid routine, nefarious deeds in overdrive
Rituals unseen, offerings to the lord of night (Night!)

Hordes of corpses, dead bodies buried deep
Through fields of charred ash, at night we will creep
Eradicate all evidence, they will disappear
Black cult for pleasure, the torture is severe!

Severing of the breast, the knife slips in
Make the pain last and revel in sin
Molestation then consumption
Satisfaction then decomposition

Saving the parts for the circle
Eat their flesh and absorb their power
Morbid routine, nefarious deeds in overdrive
Rituals unseen, offerings to the lord of night (Night!)

Perverse Instinct!
Perverse Instinct!

Cauldron of skin and bones, hair and stones
Echoing cries, the victims wale and moan
Burning stench of lingering death
Inhaling smoke, with their final breath!
