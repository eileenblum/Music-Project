Bedeviled womb of a deranged mind
Possessed with murderous visions unkind

Crepuscular urge to kill, the succubus hungers, demands it's fill
Dark shadows whisper their orders, unborn infant commands

Insanity has become a normalcy, clairvoyant force, granting powers to see beyond
Infanticide is forbidden, the life inside must be hidden

Committed before and escaped the unguarded door
On the run to feed, this devilish need, carnage and bloodshed
Appease the infernal child, eat the flesh now mangled and defiled

Insanity has become a normalcy, clairvoyant force, granting powers to see beyond
Infanticide is forbidden, the life inside must be hidden

No one suspects an impregnated wreck, knocks you out with a needle to your neck

Awaken in pain, chained, strapped and tortured
Inhuman acts most insane, the cravings inside, the unholy thirst is nurtured
She rations and peels your skin with a psychotic uncomfortable horrid grin
Nine months gestating to wait, the homicides will discharge the festering hate

No one suspects an impregnated wreck, knocks you out with a needle to your neck
Revolting Apollyon awaits, it's viscous thirst it satiates

Disturbing hallucinations, severing meat from bone
Unholy indoctrinations, the deafening voices when she's all alone
Ravenous for the dead, the copper taste of blood
Countless perished left to stagnate, putrefy, schizophrenic killing
