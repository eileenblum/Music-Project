Alone dejected, rotten and defiled
Mistaken birth, neglected child
Stench so foul writhing in her own piss
She's born impaired with parental injustice

Fourteen years forced deprivation
Psychological and hunger starvation
Tied to a chair in a vacated room
Taught no speech, so only screams are heard at night
Screams!

Paternal sin, secret victim, incestuous rape
A deprived animal to be used and thrown away
No escape! No escape!
Born into a blindfolded abysmal hell
Nonexistent to the world she's kept in her cell

Left all alone, no sense of time or age
Unspeakable despair and primal rage

Alone dejected, rotten and defiled
Mistaken birth, neglected child
Stench so foul writhing in her own piss
She's born impaired with parental injustice

Endless nights locked in constant fear
Emaciated pain, the future is unclear
No concept of death or relief
No prayers of hope only eternal grief

Routine barbaric molestations severe
Impregnations, savage abortions, inflicted year after year
Kept out of sight in darkness filth and disease
This mystery assailant you must blindly appease
