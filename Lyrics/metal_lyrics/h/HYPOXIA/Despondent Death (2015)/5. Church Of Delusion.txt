Terrible laborious stigmas, are all that you receive
You pray for salvation, begging in vein while you rot stinking of disease

Mass delusion for control
Stealing you blind to save your soul
Fabricated lore, disseminate the fear
Screaming, wailing of fools is all I hear

Suppressed populations unable to learn
Shaming logic, we will willingly burn
There's an end to all games, the titans want you dead
Calling them out, refusal with a bullet to the head

Ah

Heinous decrepitude ravages the land
Invisible silence, we welcome the damned
Disguised behind the lies and the piousness
Pedophiliac monsters, molestation sickness

Twisted perversions, unnatural values infused
Crucified and dismembered your gods must be killed! Killed killed!

Ignorant barbaric ideologies still persist
Our blasphemous stance â we eternally resist!

Children dying and starving in misery
You send them scriptures in an attempt to help them "see"
Mass delusion for control
Stealing you blind to save your soul
Fabricated lore, disseminate the fear
Screaming, wailing of foolsâ¦
Heinous decrepitude ravages the land
Invisible silence, we welcome the damned
Disguised behind the lies and the piousness
Pedophiliac monsters, molestation sickness
