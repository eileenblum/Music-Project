On shores of Stygian ocean
The stars beyond are in perpetual motion
Ancient gods of demonic lore
Malicious offerings of an unbaptized whore

Possession infernal, absorb the soul within
Rising of the serpents, favoring the absolute sin

Alignment in Saturnal rules, under inverted obelisk the blood pools
Chained within the tombs, the smoke of burning flesh it plumes
Horrific reflections, oil glazed flesh, unfathomable chambers of boundless death!

Rolling fog envelopes the shore
Within barricaded caverns lie piles of heaping gore
Oh
Rise! The violent and explosive
Expose! The vileâ¦
Eternal devotion to life's uncreation
Revel in the abysmal hollow sensation
Ah
Chanting echoes throughout bleak deserted sands
Crimson wounds carved within our clenched hands

Horrific reflections, oil glazed flesh, unfathomable chambers of boundless death!
Revolting and devastating, the bloodied soil is now saturating
All the truths are now revealed, humanities horrid fate becomes sealed

Eternal devotion to life's uncreation
Revel in the abysmal hollow sensation
Ah
