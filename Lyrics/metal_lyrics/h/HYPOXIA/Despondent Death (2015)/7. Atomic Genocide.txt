Zero tolerance by force I'll break you down
The bringer of truth is always despised
Impalement through your skull invert your rusted crown
Exposing dismal facts, revealing the lies

Your soul is murdered and your offspring doomed
Occasional sun but continuous strife
Inhume the ancient knowledge entombed
Evaluate your worthless wretched life

They scorn the fortitude to see
Foreboding dragon of negative mist
Bleeding out, millions will die
Die!

No hope in sight, relentlessly vexed
Burn it all down, this world and the next!

Poison the air and ignite the oil
Ravage the earth and destroy the soil
Servitude to the psychotic tribune
Obliteration, atomic genocide!

No hope in sight, relentlessly vexed
Burn it all down, this world and the next!
