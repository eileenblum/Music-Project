Twisted corpse of chaos
I clench the intertwined innards of your faith
Hold your hands and pray out loud
Collapse your brain, submit your flesh to loose your mind

Our temples withers away
Disgust in our impairment
Stench of eternal rot
Infirmity our detriment
Horrendous frightful sleepless nights
Blinding, petrified, sterile in the surgery lights

Faces cracked from constant tears
Encouraging words are needles in our ears
Courageless lies to mask realities
In nature's plan, extinction is all it sees

Gazing far â gone now is who you think you are
Lost in these dismal dreams..
Your life rotting in the grave, inferno of morbidity now reigns!

Oh
Targeted outcast, I proudly raise my flag of detestation
I burrow my hate within and watch as you die
Belial! The beacon through storm and fog
Revile! The light of early first dawn

Twisted corpse of chaos
I clench the intertwined innards of your faith
Hold your hands and pray out loud
Collapse your brain, submit your flesh to loose your mind

Our temples withers away
Disgust in our impairment
Stench of eternal rot
Infirmity our detriment
We're rotting dead
