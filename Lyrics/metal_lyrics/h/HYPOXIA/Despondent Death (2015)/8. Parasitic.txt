Leeches sucking the quintessence from your soul
Parasitic vampires, the drainage is taking it's toll
Fake worthless beings just living to survive
Vile monetary structure feeding the blood thirsty hive

Infuriated scowl, my scrutiny perforates your plastic skull
Revealing your shriveled form, as hollow, empty and dull

Depart from me, embalm your smile in my disgust
Banish you from my macrocosm
Obliteration â I'm destroyingâ¦ your reflection into dust

Rip my chest apart, divulge the agony inside
Daily routine of wishing on my birth that I had died
Abhorrence, the grievous tensions upheave
Escalating, I loathe you all, I need to relieve

Beware! They elude the skeletal mirrors
Fearful to interrupt the sanctuary of their peers

Scrambling insects, requiring a pitiful purpose
Reproduce disparity, intuitive truth willingly deserts us
Vehemence â restless, no slumber at night
Yearning to see it all crumble, no end to this fight

Leeches sucking the quintessence from your soul
Parasitic vampires, the drainage is taking it's toll
Fake worthless beings just living to survive
Vile monetary structure feeding the blood thirsty hive
