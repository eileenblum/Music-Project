All pathways lead to torment
Affliction then bereavement
Darkness creeping slowly, oblivion awaits
Decrepit bodies, they cling to superstition, but pure logic it negates

Consciousness awaken to your devastating fate
Seething slow decay, agonizing course of hate
Passage of morbidity, the gateway of calamity!

Chromosomal failures, foreboding genetic cancers
Languishing in sorrow, grieving, crying for the answers
Desolation! Suffering microbial poisons, and corporeal infections, a dreadful destiny awaits!
Ugh

Wasted, and emaciated, collapsing, stabbed and radiated
Spasming, excruciation, yearning for the end!
Inevitable skeletal perceptions arise, that putrid concave sinking in your dying eyes!
