Brooding over the foul decimation
Consuming onward, barbarically avowed

Scouring over moonlit wastelands I now roam

I blacken my mind and heave my burning lungs
Too fresh, too soon, to die, I gurgle and spit in tongues

Disillusion clouds my intuition
Painful bellows over the mutilation

Lunar curse, soul within has died, pungent fumes of rottingâ¦Dead!

Drowning in fire, your doomed to succumb,
Bathing in carnage, I accept my gruesomeâ¦ fate!

Fate! Hate!

Shrieks of suffering shrivel into dust
Blazing stars of bestial lust

Ah!

My impulses for putrescence
Sharp and vivid beneath the freezing soil
Writhing in the fetid essence
Their blood spills cold as mine begins to boil

Ghastly shapes form through steaming breath
Primal instinct of rage and despairâ¦despondent death!

Mutations of centuries past,
Forgotten tragedies, unconscious, suffering to last

Cannot resist celestial pulls,
When it comes to survival, forget the rulesâ¦

Lunar curse, soul within has died, pungent fumes of rottingâ¦Dead!
Feasting on the plasma of the inferior, flesh!
