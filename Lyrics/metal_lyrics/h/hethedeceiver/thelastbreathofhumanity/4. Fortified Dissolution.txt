Security has bounded this nation for years
Held down in shackles by a disconfirming government
Martyrs who shield themselves from the outer world
Never exposed, while they cower in their own prosperity
There's people being killed and raped of their homes
And no longer will we stand for this
The men and women who had gave of their live
To lead a better life have been sacrificed
I will rise amongst the many who have fallen
And put an end to this fucking masquerade

Our dependency on a handful
Should no longer be trusted
Your rights are stripped away from and destroyed
Right in front of your eyes
What's left but desire for the american dream?
Dream...
Throughout all of the shadows, under the pages of lies
I have found something that I can believe in
The simple fact that I can trust no other
WITH THE VALUE OF MY EXISTENSE
It was written in blood long before our time
We're all born into slavery
How can you be so blind to see that we are being enslaved?

Our (dependency) on a handful
(Should no longer be) trusted
Your rights are stripped away from and destroyed
Right in front of your eyes
What's left but desire for the american dream?
