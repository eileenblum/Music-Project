Lying in a pile of her excremental waste
as I grind and decompose every bone she has left
Gnawing on her entrails as I'm emptying the large intestine
Pleasuring myself inside her who knows how much more I can take
Who needs to fuel the fire, we've got her ashes to purge
A human life I have confiscated as my own dead slave of lust

This is your punishment;

I waited silently as they checked her rotted body
The laughter inside me will surely never end; I let it out
My deed has been fufilled and now I shall walk free.
Will she walk, no never again
But this isnt where it ends

TAKE A FUCKING SEAT

A misconceptual grief hauling murderer
has battered and disposed of your loving child
How can you live?

The mourning of a murder will now begin.
