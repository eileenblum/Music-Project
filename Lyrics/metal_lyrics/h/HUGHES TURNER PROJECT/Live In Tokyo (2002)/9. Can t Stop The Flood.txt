[Hughes/Marsh]

(This is rock baby, return to the heaviest of heavy)

Well my mind is free again
And my soul is on the mend
Won't somebody hear my plea?
There is a storm inside of me

Turn back the pages
There lies my fate
My intuition I hesitate
The storm it rages
Sky turnin' black
Hold back the river
No turnin' back

I got my freak flag flyin' again
I can feel the pressure begin
Can you see I'm misunderstood?
Because you can't stop the flood

Live on the outside
Walk through the pain
You know I can't hide 
From where I came
Ain't nobody gonna understand
You're gonna find me
In the promised land

I got my freak flag flyin' again
I can feel the pressure begin
Can you see I'm misunderstood?
Because you can't stop the flood
