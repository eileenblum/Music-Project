[Blackmore/Coverdale]

I've been mistreated, I've been abused
I've been struck downhearted, baby, I've been confused
'Cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated.
Since my baby left me I've been losing my mind

I've been lonely, I've been cold
I've been looking for a woman to have and hold
'Cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated.
Since my baby left me I've been losing, 
I've been losing my mind

I've been mistreated, I've been abused.
I've been struck downhearted, baby, I've been confused
'Cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated, ooh o-o-oh.
Since my baby left me I've been losing,
I've been losing my mind, 
Oh oh oh, [Singing: C'mon Tokyo!]
Baby, woman - I said baby, baby
I've been losing my mind
