[Blackmore/Glover/Turner]

(D'you remember this song? Let me see your hands. I wanna hear some noise!)

It doesn't matter if I'm right or wrong
It really doesn't mean a thing
It doesn't matter if you like my song
Just as long as you can hear me sing
'Cause I'm the thorn in every little girl's rose
You know I cut but never bleed
A shadow in the night, pure delight
I can satisfy your every need

I'm a real smooth dancer, I'm fantasy man
Master of illusion, magic touch in my hand
All the stages are empty when I steal the scenes
A beggar of love, second hand hero...King of Dreams

It doesn't matter what you got
It doesn't matter what you lose
It doesn't matter if you like it or not
Cuz baby I'm gonna change your attitude
All around me there is mystery and wonder
Can't you see it in my eyes
Said I'll crack the sky, make you feel the thunder
You'll never see through my disguise

I'm a real smooth dancer, I'm fantasy man
Master of illusion, with my sleight of hand
All the stages are empty when I steal the scenes
A beggar for love, second hand hero... King of Dreams

All around, all around
Emotional squeeze through again and again
I just have to please you, now your mind is on the bend
Can't you feel the power, surrender to my arms
Beyond the witching hour we're travelling on and on

I'm a real smooth dancer, I'm fantasy man
Master of illusion, sleight of hand
The stages are empty when I steal the scenes
A beggar of love, second hand hero... King of Dreams

I'm a real smooth dancer, fantasy man
Master of illusion, sleight of hand
The stages are empty when I steal the scenes
A beggar for love... King of Dreams
