[Blackmore/Glover]

You don't know what's happening, you want to go home
But there's nowhere to hide
The first time on stage, your first time alone
The crowd's going wild
And you feel so alive
You could stand up and take this all night
They love you but you're in love with the spotlight
You're the spotlight kid
You're in love with the spotlight
You're the spotlight kid

Jokers and women they hang 'round your door
They're all part of the scene
Just like a junkie you've got to have more
It's a pleasure machine
And you fly every night
But the dressing room mirror don't lie
They love you but you're in love with the spotlight
You're the spotlight kid
You're in love with the spotlight
You're the spotlight kid
(Tokyo!)

Your audience died, faded away
Leaving you on stage
It's been so many years since that first matinee
Feels like an age
Encore one more time
For the ghosts of the past in your mind
They love you but you're in love with the spotlight
You're the spotlight kid
You're in love with the spotlight
You're living in a dream
You're in love with the spotlight
You're in love with the spotlight 
(Tokyo!)
