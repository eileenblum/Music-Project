[Hughes/Turner/Marsh]

Kicked to the gutter, pushed to the side
Feels like were hanging by the fringe
Burned down and battered
Fight to stay alive
Out in the cold and left for dead

Keep on believing
We got the faith
So tired of being pushed around
We'll love forever
Make no mistake
Ain't nobody gonna take us down

We want the world to know
We're right where we belong
No matter where we go
Together standing strong

You can't stop rock n' roll
You can't stop rock n' roll
You can't stop rock n' roll
You can't stop rock n' roll

Blood in the water
No turning back
We put ourselves out on the line
You know we oughtta
Get back on the track
You know we gotta let it shine
