[Turner/Kajiyama]

Living on the wrong side of a gun
Out on the street nowhere to run
Situation we can't win
Desperation closing in
Living on the wrong side of a gun

Say a prayer tonight - That the children will be free
Send the world a light - Maybe someday we'll see

Right now it's just you and me
Oh you and me
Right now it's just you and me
And these dark days
Oh dark days

It's suicide here everyday
Out on the streets there's hell to pay
Everything is gettig hazy
Everybody is going crazy
It's suicide here everyday
Say a prayer tonight - That we shall be released
Send the world a light - Maybe someday we will see

Right now it's just you and me
And these dark days
Dark days

Say a prayer tonight - That the children will be free
Send the world a light - Maybe someday we'll see
Right now it's just you and me
Oh you and me
Right now it's just you and me
And these dark days
