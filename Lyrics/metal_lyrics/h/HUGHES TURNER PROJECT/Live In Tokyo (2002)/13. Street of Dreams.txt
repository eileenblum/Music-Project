(Please help me sing. It's called Street: of Dreams)

I heard the sound of voices in the night,
Spell bound there was someone calling,
I looked around no on was on sight
Pulled down I just kept on falling
I've seen this place before
You were standing by my side
I've seen your face before tonight
Maybe I just see what I want to be
I know it's a mystery
Do you remember me on a street of dreams,
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams

There you stood a distant memory
So good like we never parted
Said to myself I knew you'd set me free
And here we are right back where we started
Something's come over me
And I don't know what to feel
Maybe this fantasy is real
Maybe I just see what I want to be
Now it's still a mystery

Do you remember me [Singing!] on a street of dreams,
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams
You are on every face I see
On the street of dreams

Something's come over me
And I don't know what to feel
Maybe this fantasy is real
Maybe I just see what I want to be
Now it's still a mystery

Do you remember me on a street of dreams,
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams
You are on every face I see
On the street of dreams

You can be who you want to be oh yeh
Do you know just who you'll see do ya
Will we ever meet again my friend
I can hear you calling me
On the street of dreams
Do you remember me?
