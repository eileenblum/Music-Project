[Iommi/Hughes]

Cold is the night
Lonely till dawn
Cry for the light
For my love that won't come
Said that you'd never
Leave me alone

I gave you my heart
You cried for my soul
An angel won't come
This devil won't go
Something is wrong
But I just can't get away

Living on the streets, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
Living on the streets, I'm no stranger to love
I'm a stranger in your arms
Yes, I'm a stranger in your arms
Maybe it's right
But I just don't understand
The hurt that I feel
For my love second hand
I know I should leave
But I just can't go away

Living on the streets, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
I'm a stranger in your arms
I'm a stranger in your arms

Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love

I'm a stranger in your heart
