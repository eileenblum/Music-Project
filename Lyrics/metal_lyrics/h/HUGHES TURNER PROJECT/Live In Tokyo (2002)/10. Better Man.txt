[Hughes]

When the sky was turnin' red
When the mountains crumble and fall
And I was outta my head
That's when I heard you call

I can feel a change in the weather
I put my feet on the ground
I had to pull myself together
I'm gonna tell you what I found

Better man - I know
I'm a better man
Better than before
Won't you let me go
And let the river flow

When the sea covered the land
And you did not believe in fate
Came to me and gave me your hand
Only a fool would hesitate

Now you can call me brother
Cuz I've been away too long
There's one way or another
Cuz I never felt so strong

Better man - I know
I'm a better man
Better than before
Won't you let me go
And let the river flow

So walk with me my friend
Cuz I want you to see
And I cannot pretend
Cuz I just gotta be...

I can feel a change in the weather
I'm gonna tell you what I found
[Chorus]

(Hey Joe)
Better man
