[Hughes/Turner]

The time has come again
Throw a kiss and lose a friend
Some things are just better left in the past
Tomorrow never knows
Passes by, comes and goes
Can you tell me how long will love last?

I'll remember you and me
And how it felt inside
I guess it wasn't meant to be
But it's so hard to say goodbye

Why do the winds of change carry us away?
They leave us lost and torn apart
What are we searching for, never sure
Wanting more?
Maybe that's the mystery of the heart

Love is rare and life is strange
Nothing lasts and people change
Memories that time just can't erase

Wish I could go back, I know
How I want to hold you so
I'd give anything to see your face

Lonely dreams of yesterday
Like footprints in the sand
Wish that I could find a way
But I'll never understand
