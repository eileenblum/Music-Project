[Hughes/Turner/Marsh]

I keep trying to talk to you
But I never seem to get no answers
All the things you put me through
I guess I'll have to take my chances

I can't face another day you put me down
This situation there's no way you can be found

I'm always reaching
But I can't get next to you
Cuz you run run run
I move in closer
And I don't know what to do
Cuz you run run run

You always got an attitude
I'm looking for a one on one reaction
Whatever happened to your gratitude
You're always looking for a little satisfaction

Is there a way I can finally make you see
Does it make you happy
When you tear the heart from me
