[Hughes/Turner/Di Cola]

Stare out my window until the light fades
The darkness overcomes me
Someone is lost, someone is saved
I wonder which one will I be
Searching for something
Just what I'm not sure
Some way to change my life
One thing's for certain
Can't take this anymore
I feel like I'm losing the fight

How long have I lived this way
Alone in the atmosphere
I see you but I'm 10,000 miles away 
Gotta turn it around...I'll be walking tall
I'm gonna try and keep my head
It's a long way down...so far to fall
When you're standing on the ledge

A burning heart full of broken dreams
Trapped inside my frozen soul
A desperate man goes to extremes
Before he loses control

Lost my faith in heaven, and my fear of hell
There's no place that I belong
Don't want your pity, save that for yourself

I know what it takes to be strong
