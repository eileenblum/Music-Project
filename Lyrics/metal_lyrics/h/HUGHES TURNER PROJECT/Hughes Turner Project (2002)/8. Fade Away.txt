[Hughes/Turner/Marsh]

I'll be there when the darkness falls
Everywhere when the shadows call
Hear the wind how it cries your name
Don't you worry there's no one to blame

Why, oh why can't I be free
Only emptiness inside of me
Cuz in my heart
I know you'd never stay
Tell me how long does it take
For love to fade away

I let you slip right through my hands
Now I try for a second chance
I never wanted to let you go
Now there's one thing you should know

Why, oh why can't I be free
Only emptiness inside of me
Cuz in my heart
I know you'd never stay
Tell me how long does it take
For love to fade away
