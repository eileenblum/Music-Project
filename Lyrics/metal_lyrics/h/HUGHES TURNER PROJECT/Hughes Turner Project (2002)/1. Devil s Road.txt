[Hughes/Turner/Marsh]

I got my posi-traction
I'm hell on wheels
I'm made of iron blood and steel
I'm always set for action
I'm shifting gears
I'm running faster than my fears

I'm leaving everything behind me
I'm on a race with destiny
I'm going where my dreams can find me
Somewhere I can be free

I can see heaven, it's a long way to go
And I'm riding the devil's road
I can hear angels singing lifting my soul
But I'm riding the devil's road

I got my higher power
He come to me on the seventh hour
Never burn my ivory tower
Now I have been set free
