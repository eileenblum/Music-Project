[Hughes/Marsh/Sykes]

I know there's a place I see
Your spirit keeps haunting me
And I never worry, cuz I do believe
You will find me here

I'm floating through space and time
Your love is all over the line
Why can it be when all hope is gone?
Then you turned around
There without a sound

Baby, heaven's missing an angel
Did you fall from a star like an angel from above
Your moonbeam smile and the warmth of love
Heaven's missing an angel
So much more than a woman to me
Finally love came to set my heart free

I'm high on a silver cloud
I see your face in the crowd
And I know that it's only a matter of time
Your love will come to me
Your love will come to me

Who am I to regret the past
I live and die and I want it to last
But if I was to leave I want you to know
I'll be by your side, cuz you're my soul and pride
