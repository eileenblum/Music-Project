[Hughes/Turner/Marsh]

Night after night, you're out on the street
Just like a stray cat on the prowl
Down in the neon, the hustle and the heat
You got a need to fill somehow

Do you wanna be free, tell me how do you see
You're outta sight, outta mind
Do you feel the same, or are you hiding your pain
You're dying to feel so alive
Are you living it up - Sister Midnight

Taking your chances, checking off your list
You always say your life is justified
Never stop looking, to see what you missed
Trying to fill that empty hole inside

Do you wanna be free, tell me how do you see
You're outta touch, outta time
Now I know your name, are you lost in your shame
Don't you know you are living a lie
Are you living it up - Sister Midnight

Ooh, I'm waiting for the heartache
Ooh, I'm waiting for the day
That you finally see
See what you're doing to me

Are you living it up - Sister Midnight
Are you giving it up - Sister Midnight
Sister Midnight
