[Hughes/Turner/Marsh]

I'm on the train all dressed in black
And you know I'm just comin' back for you
Back for you
I go from town to town
I know just what I wanna do

And I'm not asking you
Something I won't regret
And I don't need no sympathy
Cuz all I wanna do, I hope I won't forget
I can read between the lines

Name, missed your name it's a shame
I musta missed your name it's a shame
I'm to blame, I musta missed your name

I need a little sanity
Or are you just a vision in my head
I want some identity
So we can spill the wine
And taste the bread

And don't want to live
And face another day
I just want you by my side
Now tell me, won't you give me
Something you can't hide
I can read between the lines
