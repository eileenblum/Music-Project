[Hughes/Turner/Marsh]

If I look familiar
It's only what you see
It's your perception
What I used to be
So saturated
I wear a different face
I'm so frustrated
With the human race

No you can't live for me
Don't want your sympathy
The cut's too deep you see
I got your remedy
Do you really wanna go there with me
Don't ya know it's really something to see
Do you really wanna go there with me
Don't ya know it's really something to see

Here comes the change so let's open the door
I'm not the same anymore

Don't want your conversation
Don't need no aggravation
That's when I knew I had a revelation
Don't need no demonstration
I'm in my transformation
That's when I knew I had my revelation

Am I a stranger, am I a friend
But you think you know me
You'd better look again
Feel so infected with all the lies
Get resurrected
Open up your eyes

I got so much to say
You're gonna hear me anyway
Ain't gonna make no big display
So what's up? Get outta my way

Do you really wanna go there with me
Don't ya know it's really something to see
Do you really wanna go there with me
Don't ya know it's really something to see

Here comes the change
So let's open the door
I'm not the same anymore

Don't want no confrontation
Don't need no situation
That's when I knew I had my revelation

Don't want to condemnation
I got my inspiration
That's when I knew I had my revelation
