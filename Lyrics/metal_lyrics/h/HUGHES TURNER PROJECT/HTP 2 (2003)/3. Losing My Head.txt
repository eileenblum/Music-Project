[Hughes/Turner/Marsh]

Six degrees of separation
The space between us, you and me
We live a life of desperation
We will collide eventually

It don't bother me
It don't mean a thing
Just let your mine be free

I'm losing my head
I'm going insane
I heard what you said
Your voice in my brain
I'm already gone
My eyes turnin' red
The damage is done
I'm losing my...
You give me too much information
I'm heading for an overload
We gotta change the situation
We gotta take another road

Now what you say to me?
I don't feel a thing
Let your mind be free

[CHORUS]
