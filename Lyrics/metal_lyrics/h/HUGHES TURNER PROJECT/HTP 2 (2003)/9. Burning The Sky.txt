[Hughes/Turner/Marsh]

Something's lost, and something's gained
In every word
Listening, to hear the words I've never heard

Life goes on, time is not a friend to me
Almost gone, reaching for my destiny

My spirit is off the ground
I know where my soul can be found

I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long to be free
Now I'm floating so high I can see
I'm learning to fly, I'm burning the sky
I'm learning to fly, I'm burning the sky
I'm learning to fly, I'm burning the sky

Live and learn
Who knows what it's all about

Every turn
Leaving me with only doubt

My spirit is off the ground
I know where my soul can be found

[CHORUS]
