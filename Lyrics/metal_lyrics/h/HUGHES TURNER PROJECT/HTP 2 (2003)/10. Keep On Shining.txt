[bonus track for the Japan release]

[Hughes/Turner/Marsh]

Out on the run, down in the street
Living it day after day
Against all the odds, taking the heat
Nothing can stand in our way

Never enough, comin' on strong
I'm gonna make you believe
Love one another, keep moving along
You gotta live to receive

Life on the line, holding on tight
One by one don't you know
Somewhere in time, like a ghost in the night
Take down the sun, here we go

Keep on shining
We're gonna shoot out the lights
Keep on shining
We're gonna burn down the night

The time has come, I want to see
Everyone raising their hands
It can be done, just you and me
Right now we're making a stand

Life on the line, holding on tight
One by one don't you know
Somewhere in time, like a ghost in the night
Take down the sun, here we go

[CHORUS]

Tell me how you feel
Can you see it's real
