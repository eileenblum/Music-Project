[Hughes/Turner/Marsh]

Bad luck and trouble
Always following me

Black rain was falling
That's all I could see

I used to think that the dream was reality

Those days are gone now
I'm where I wanna be, I wanna be

No more mountains to climb
No more runnin' down the lost highway
I found my place in time
The sun is shining on me, everyday
It's going my way

Falling from grace
How did I let myself go?

Tell me, what did it take
For me to know, for me to know

I used to think that the dream was reality

Those days are gone now
I'm where I wanna be, I wanna be

[CHORUS]
