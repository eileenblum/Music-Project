[Hughes]

You got no fear
And you're down in the crowd
You lose your senses and
You let it all hang out

You get so high
And you're too damn proud
Tear down the fences
And you know there is no doubt

What do you want from me?
(You say you wrote it in a letter)
You know I wanna be
(And now you know I'm getting better)
And now it's history

If you really want it
How you gonna get it?
If you really need it
How you gonna keep it?

Goodbye Friday
Operator put me through
Goodbye Friday
Now it's time for something new

You gotta move
Gotta beat the clock
You got nothin' till you
Break down Hollywood

You're already in a state of shock
You got something that will take
You down for good}

[CHORUS]
