[Hughes]

People come and people go
I only wish that they could read the sign
Out on the highway
Levitate to distant drums
They never hear the sound of their own voice
Hidden inside themselves
Heaven is just time and space
I can see the sun shine on your face

I believe in love, and I believe in fate
I will tell you something, I don't live in hate
Hear the rooster calling, hear it call your name
And it sounds so easy, let it burn your flame

So turn up the band and I'm gone
And make no mistake, I'll shine on
So save me some grace, in the pouring rain
Cuz I'll be coming home

Let's talk about it later, until the morning comes
Let's talk about it later, get shelter from the storm
Let's talk about it later, we got to get away
Let's talk about it later, as night turns into day

I'm the midnight flyer, come to set you free
Gonna take you higher down the road, you see
You don't need religion, but you need someone
Indiscreet decision, now the dawn has come

Now I wanna hear the band play
So turn up the music all day
Save me some grace, in the pouring rain
And I'll be coming home

[CHORUS]

People come and people go
I only wish that they could read the sign
Out on the highway
Levitate to distant drums
They never hear the sound of their own voice
Hidden inside themselves
Heaven is just time and space
I can see the sun shine on your face

So turn up the band and I'm gone
And make no mistake, I'll shine on
So save me some grace, in the pouring rain
Cuz I'll be coming home

Oh, people!

[CHORUS]
