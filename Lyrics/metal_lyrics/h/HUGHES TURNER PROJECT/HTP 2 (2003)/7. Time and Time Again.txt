[Hughes/Turner]

Lately you been on my mind
Been so long I don't know why
I guess some memories never fade

We were young and falling fast
We believed that love would last
Whatever happened to the plans we made

I remember the day we met
How we laughed in the the rain
Some things you just can't forget
When you still feel the pain

Oh why, why did we let it go?
I guess I'll never know
How the story ends

Oh I, no matter what I do
I'll always think of you
Time and time again

You went your way, I went mine
Not really sure, what we would find
Funny how our lives have turned round

Thought I saw you on the screen
We were always chasing dreams
I hope that love never lets you down

There's so many years gone by
Way down the line
And I'm always by your side
Here in my mind

Oh why, why did we let it go?
I guess I'll never know
How the story ends
Oh I, I will remember you
And all that we've been through
Time and time again

[CHORUS]
