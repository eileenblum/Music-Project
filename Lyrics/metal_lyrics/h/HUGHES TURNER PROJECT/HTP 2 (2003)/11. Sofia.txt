[Hughes/Turner/Marsh]

There is no master plan
There is no hologram for you

And now I understand
There's nothing else that I would do

Outside your seven walls
There is no peace at all

Sofia - I couldn't stay
Sofia - I go my way

Now all is said and done
You were the only one for me

Inside the picture frame
There is no one to blame you see

So much we had to give, now I don't wanna live

Sofia - I couldn't stay
Sofia - I go my way
Sofia - the rain will fall
Sofia - after it all
