[Hughes/Turner/Marsh]

I don't mean to disturb you
Now dont'cha get me wrong
Although I'll never hurt you
But there's something goin' on
You know I got my suspicions
More than eyes can see
I got a strange intuition and it's haunting me

Now do I have your attention
And do I have your trust
Did I happen to mention
I've seen gold turn to rust

There are some with a power
But they hide their face
And in the darkest hour
They control our fate

We're goin' through the changes
Address unknown, we're gonna rearrange it
And now I see the light
I think it's time to let you know
I'm on my way, so don't let go
Hold on-hold on
Hold on-hold on

Could it all be a daydream
Lies become the truth, nothing is as it seems
I will send you the proof
I don't mean to alarm you
But it's all coming down
You can do what you want to
You can turn it around

[CHORUS]
It's so jaded, let us fall
So related, in us all
