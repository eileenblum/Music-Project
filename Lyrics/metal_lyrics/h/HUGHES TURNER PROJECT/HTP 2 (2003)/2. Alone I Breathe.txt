[Hughes]

I see the rising of the black cat bone
You are so heavy, make me turn to stone
Give information to me next of kin
Roll up the wheels, now let it begin

Now don't you want to hear the words I say?

Alone I breathe, Alone I grieve
Alone I leave, Alone I breathe

Don't wanna live in no battle ground
You see my picture in the lost and found
Don't wanna sleep with no dogs of war
You're never gonna see my face no more

Now don't you want to hear the words I say?

Alone I breathe, Alone I grieve
Alone I leave, Alone I breathe

I know this really is my destiny
We live and die it's such a shame
Life is so strange but it's no tragedy

But you have no respect for me
You scream in tales of mystery
