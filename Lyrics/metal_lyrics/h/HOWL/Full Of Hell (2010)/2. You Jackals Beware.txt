Don't even stare
We'll tear you up
And you think you know pain
How about I fuck the smug outta your smile?

Swastikas spinning
behind beady eyes
Your shriveled ass grinning
but you're covered in flies

Your shit is weak
Being dead is no prize
Do you know how we live?
Take your bitch ass and let's go for a ride

Twinkling like rubies
You think your secrets will die
Just try not to tremble
when you look in my eyes

Grab me
a bucket
You speak
and I vomit

You're in the dark
so be smart
On a self-righteous one
we'll pull the plug
