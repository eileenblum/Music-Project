Thunderstorm heads convene
We want it
but we don't like it clean
Strangers raw but seen
for the first time
shine like Jimmy Dean
And don't be afraid
to show us the bites
We'll lick you clean

The 15th station is here
A wink
from the Big Cheese
Dare to get real
Lie, cheat, and steal

Living our stories
in vomit and piss
Clotted with blood
But nothing is missed

Sitting side by side
Pretending
the world
is not as small
as it seems
