Horns of steel
Eyes wide
Done deal

Stabbing the heads
of the Fathers of shame
Breaking their arms
and wrecking their game
Keeping shit tight

Hear them squeal
Hounds loose
Fate sealer

Black are the brides
that we'll love like a dog
We're heavenless fuckers
Now off come the gloves

We're full of hell

We'll make you feel
the world that you fear
So you think you're a man
I wanna see you dance
with the freaks you damned

We're full of hell
