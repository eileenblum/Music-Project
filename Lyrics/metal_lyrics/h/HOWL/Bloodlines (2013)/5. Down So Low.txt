Come further into hell
A lie will lead the way
Now let your namelessness begin

Underneath a silver gun
Venom fills the air
You'll face the butcher and his blade

Close your eyes as it drags you
Down so low
Slipping away now
Letting go

Jackals stalking you
The thoughts you can't erase
See the swine that dwells within

A silent death, a fevered dream
Slaughter of the soul
You've never prayed like this before

Slay this beast
Burn his flesh
Scream his name
Watch him bleed
