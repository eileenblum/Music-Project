Disguised, a shallow ruse
Twisting of disaster into massive strength
A lost form of self-renewal
Strange twins, a chaotic path

Woman god, black and disfigured
A shock to a system, fraying a lie
Ill-gotten gains from me
A tainted figure rising for my hopes and dreams

Master to serve
Embrace your nerve

Discord, a test of the will
Slashed and mauled, I salute this end
Lost hours in the comfort of dread
Karma waits like a distant fire

Throes of an inner storm
Cheapness of a thrill you can't refuse
A lone move, a loss of a friend
Invitation to conquer all that's left

Master to serve
Embrace your nerve
