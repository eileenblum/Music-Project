A final resting place
For the carnage that consumes my mind
Bliss glows in the afterlight of time
Before my heart grows cold
Take this treasure from my bloody hands
This could be all that's left to save

And when the end is reached
Our souls will sail
Buoyed by the dust and wind
They will know we never failed

The firm grip of emptiness
The conditioning of fear
Dark fires in the catacombs of our lives
Before the screams die down
Take this secret and expose us all
This will be all that's left to save

One last nail
My coffin sealed

And when the end is reached
Our souls will sail
Buoyed by the dust and wind
They will know we never failed

One last nail
My coffin sealed
