Drink up the blood, you maggot
Spit on the open wound
Grin like a manic fool
For paradise awaits

Here inside
The mouth of madness

Kill what is yours inside you
Ravage the heart and brain
Nurture useless fears
Humanity slips away

Here inside the
The mouth of madness

We've boiled our blood to keep our demons pure
Their names carved into our backs
Saints with masks of mist compelling you
May fire and thunder strike them back
How we claw at the distant ruins
Of heavens just beyond our grasp

The mouth of madness
