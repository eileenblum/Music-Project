Slaughter your will
There is no room for thinking
Go on into the almighty void
Surrender your being

They can't protect you from your own head
You'll hear the angels sing songs of the dead

The nightmare you chose
The nightmare you chose is here

Into the abyss
Spend your last moments dreaming
You'll soon be at peace with your dead-end years
The vultures are circling

They can't protect you from your own head
You'll hear the angels sing songs of the dead

The nightmare you chose
The nightmare you chose is here

Flatline your soul
Flatline your soul

The nightmare is here
