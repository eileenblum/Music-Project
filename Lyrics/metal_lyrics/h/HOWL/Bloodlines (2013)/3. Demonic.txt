I am the unforgiven
crusher of your soul
I am the noose
around your neck
I am aligned with every
forlorn child in hell
I am the twilight of your life

I am Demonic

I am the blackened cancer
inside your feeble mind
I am the one
you'll never kill
I am the blissful sin
you yearn for in your dreams
I am everything you fear

I am Demonic

The rotten tone
with which you preach
will turn into a shriek
Deadened eyes no longer blind
to the serpents closing in

HELLFIRE RAINS DOWN
GODS DROWNING IN BLOOD
EVERY MORTAL MAN
DEMONIC I FUCKING STAND
