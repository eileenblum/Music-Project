Tides of fire heralding the storm
In the minds of man, reason is reborn

I will tear
Limb from limb
This is where your hell begins

Shame nevermore, chorus of the pissed
Filthy shallow judgement, buried with the rest

I will tear
Limb from limb
This is where your hell begins

Eyes of knives
Hearts of sin
Years of wounds
We'll end it here

You raised the demons of time
