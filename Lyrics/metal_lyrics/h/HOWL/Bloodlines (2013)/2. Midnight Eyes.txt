Hellbent and crazed, she's not done for the night
Give her dreams, and she'll fill them with fright
Prayers and tears never did you much good
She'll haunt you till dying feels right

Suicide dreams
Forcing you down on your knees
Suicide dreams
Plaguing you like a disease

Midnight eyes
Kill the light

Dead on arrival, your pleas stood no chance
You were the prize in her twisted romance
You can't shake your animal instincts at all
Begging for more, the further you fall

Suicide dreams
Forcing you down on your knees
Suicide dreams
Plaguing you like a disease

Midnight eyes
Kill the light

She's got your fire burning
But you just can't feel the flames
She's got your wheels a-turnin'
But you're clueless to her game

Kill the light
