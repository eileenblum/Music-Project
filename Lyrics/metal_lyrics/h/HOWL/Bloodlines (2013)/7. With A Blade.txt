I carved it out
Then I hung it dripping black
I took your tumor heart
And I never once looked back

You can't kill me
I'm alrady dead
While you sleep
Rivers will run red

Doom shaped my path
Sin drives my hand
Blood brings more pride

I sawed it off
With a filthy fucking blade
So I can do all these things
That your little mind forbade

The hounds of hell
Rest at my feet
As I sing songs
Of your defeat

Doom shaped my path
Sin drives my hand
Blood brings more pride

There is nowhere to run to
In your mind youcan't hide
Beware of the demons
That live by your side

Doom shaped my path
Sin drives my hand
