Preyed on by a pack of hyenas
Treated like a fucking slave
Poison is the power, commandeer the brain
Goddamned to my grave

Constant violation of boundaries
Don't prod and angry beast in a cage
Ignore a man's petition for redress
There will be hell to pay

Goat's head
Death my sacred friend
Goat's head
Death as a final end

The poteney of thought that betray you
Unlocked by a severed hand
Colossal is the will of the desperate
Bigotry your only friend

A truth untold is coming th haunt you
Answers emboldened by rage
A mandate from a sick generation
The war child has come of age

Goat's head
Death my sacred friend
Goat's head
Death as a final end
