These days never end
How has everything emptied itself out
Where did we go wrong
Hear that sound of static
It's the sound of lost hopes
It's a failure
We said goodbye to this cruel world a long time ago
But haven't left
Don't cry
Don't pray
Don't wish
Don't dream
Let your emotions flood the minds
But what's the point
When everyone just sits there silently
Still what's left for us in this world
Even the martyrs have gone home
