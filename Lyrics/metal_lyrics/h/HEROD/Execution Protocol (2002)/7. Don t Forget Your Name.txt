And it will last forever
These days seem to be getting shorter
And people are changing like the seasons
They've all run away for the better life
And forgotten our names
There must be bluer skies
On the other side of the fence
Or maybe my eyes are just closed
Then again maybe you've sewn them shut
If you leave this town
Don't bother saying goodbye
It's hard to wish farewell
When you're already facing the other way
We'll still be here
This is what we live for
And it will last forever
