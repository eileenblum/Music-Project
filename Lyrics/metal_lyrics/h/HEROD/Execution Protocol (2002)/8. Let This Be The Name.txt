She was colored with your apathy
She never had a chance to dream
You broke down the walls of morality
And handed her a knife
She carved a perfect world into her wrists
And laughed at this hell
When the bells chime
Who will be your savior
Lay yourself down
Let these flames welcome you
You are the disease that nightmares grow from
And the sky will never be brighter than the day you die
I'm so sick of decorating tombs
Please let this be the day she smiles again
Let this be the day you die
Please let this be the day
