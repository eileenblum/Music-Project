How much will this distance grow
How long will I be left alone
I'd swing like the silhouette of a defiled angel
And wipe my blood on the walls for just one more day
A chance to separate the loving
From the paralyzed empty soul
We've been down this path
But this time you brought your fate
I know how the story ends
Yet I'm afraid to turn the page
A perfect day ends with a lie
And today is no different
Walk hand in hand with your heartless grin
And I'll do the same
I paint a smile on myself every time I see you
Because I know the day will come
When these incisions will be your own reflections
And the knife will be in my hands
