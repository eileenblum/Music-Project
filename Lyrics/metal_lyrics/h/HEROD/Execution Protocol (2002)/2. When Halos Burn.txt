What beauties can I bestow upon the world today
What does fate have in store for me
I can see a fallen chair
And a golden thread in the rafters
I'm sick at the site of this
Maybe an embrace would have saved my fate
Oh god I'm not smiling
The halo is burned around my neck
But my wish is my command
I'm situated in this reflection like the portrait of a ghost
Another pathetic loss in just under a minute
They don't hang 'em like they used to
