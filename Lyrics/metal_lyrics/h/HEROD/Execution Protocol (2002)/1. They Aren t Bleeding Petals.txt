Could I let this ghost hold my hand
And will your broken petals carve into me
As I'm led across your insidious heart
You let go you walked away from me
Like an angel who abandoned her faith
And it defiles the hearts of gods
This day ends with a swan song
And three black kisses
Crucify what I've become
And hang yourself with this holocaust
Your pedestal was built on sickened dreams
Silence
This wretched life it abhors your blood
Bury yourself in contempt
But be witness to this reality
The tears I once shed for you
Have shattered the stained glass
And i now walk alone with red covered hands
Crucify what I've become
