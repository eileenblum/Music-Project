I left your town and i won't be coming back
You killed the lights and off you ran
Why'd you have to be such a dream
Oh baby i could never understand
How just a kiss could turn a world upside down
And I'm walkin' on the clouds when I'm with you
You had that Hollywood smile
That the highest starlets would die for
But your head is in the clouds
If we ever stood on the same ground
How fast could you outgrow me
It's like chasing after that shooting star
Just to catch your eye
If i had more shades of red to color with
I'd paint us a happy ending
But these days even i laugh at you
Keep your goodbye kiss
