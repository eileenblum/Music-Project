We are but captives. We are diseased. We know that one day we will be free. [x2]
I've seen it again and again.
We just have to close the door and we can't ever let them in.
You got what you wanted.
You got what you wanted so just go.
And now you can't make a single noise.
So what do you have to lose?
You got what you wanted.
Subject to the judgment of a fool.
You got what you wanted so just go.
Am I meant to follow? What is it to lead?
The tone of a steady voice or the sound of a piercing scream?
The dirt under my fingernails tells of the grave I'm digging.
And I know there's something out there that I have to see that's haunting me. (see that's haunting me)
We'll kill the parasite that lingers in our skin.
The loss of appetite.[x2]
But you got what you wanted. [x2]

And I know there's something out there that I have to see that's haunting me. (see that's haunting me)
They'll never know, they'll never know. I'm not exactly what they wanted.
The man they thought I was began to die.
We just have to close the door and we can't ever let them in.
You got what you wanted, now you'll find somewhere to begin.
We are but captives. We are deceased. We know that one day we will be free. [x2]
