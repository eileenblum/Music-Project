I am the one you will call the destroyer
The messenger of my disgrace (I am my own disease)
You sit on your throne of compassion
The charges will fall as we all go marching so helplessly on
We came this far to tear the curtain
Shed light so I can see your eyes
Shed your light on me
What Is this unhealthily obsession, to destroy everything you create?
(I am my own disease)
You, the God of the broken and wretched
The charges will fall
I am my own disease
I carried the weight of this burden I've watch as they all fell away.
It's not just a dream, it's a nightmare

[x2]
We came this far to tear the curtain
Shed light so I can see your eyes
Shed your light on me

[x2]
We wall fall to ruin if we don't bury disguises that we've made
We will see the finish if we would carry ourselves to the end of the race
The charges will fall
I am my own disease
