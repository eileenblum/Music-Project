Cold in panic
Keep me away from this.
In this damp air, there's ignorance in bliss
Have you ever seen when the stars go out and it blackens the scenery.
No way around it.
I'm sorry I may not amount to much.
In secret I'm dirty, and I've chosen to give up.
There's something about your motives that never answer the questions.
The ending of all disasters will invoke reform.
No way around it.
I'm sorry I may not amount to much.
In secret I'm dirty, and I've chosen to give up.
Invoke the progress of a simple mind in a factory.
Invoke the progress when the stars go out and it blackens the scenery.
No where you runnin'
I'm sorry I may not amount to much
In secret I'm turning in
I've chosen to give up
No way around it. x2
(No way around it)
I'm sorry I may not amount to much.
Cold in panic
Keep me away from this.
In this damp air, there's ignorance in bliss
