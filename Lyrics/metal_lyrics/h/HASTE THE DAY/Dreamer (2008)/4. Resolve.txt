Can you feel the tension?
Have you heard the voices of the lost?
Churning up the fire
To reach the dark side of you
When the walls decide to close in
And the floor disappears beneath you
Just hang on to our last words and...Resolve
Touch your hands to water
Place them on the fire
Have faith
The flame will lose it's strength
Just touch your hands to water
Hold your breath for one more second
Soak the torch in kerosene
And light the match and
Watch as it all closes in
Can you feel the tension
Can you hear the voices of the lost?
Just hang out to our last words and...Resolve
Our lives will hang on the words
You have spoken
And we will wait for our God to return
Lift your hands to the Heaven
Let your heart be encased in flames
Touch your hands to water
Place them on the fire
Have faith
The flame will lose it's strength
Just touch your hands to water
Our lives will hang on the words
You have spoken
And we will wait for our God to return
Lift your hands to the Heaven
Let your heart be encased
