This is a celebration of the ones who lost their chance to die.
Will you believe the masses or will you overcome?
We are the sons of the fallen nation.
We hold the keys to our demise.
And grace will kiss your head as you fall asleep.
I'm so tired of always letting you down
Still you offer to turn it around
I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
Still you offer to turn it around
This is your one distraction ,weakening your ability to grow
So you'll push yourself further away.
Eyes of zeros, of nothing.
Still you throw it all away
And you'll push yourself further and further away
I'm so sick of the desire
To throw it away
And I feel so expired
So I'll bury my head and dissolve
I'm so tired of always letting you down
Still you offer to turn it around
I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
Still you offer to turn it around
Sever the head of a snake
Lie there and wait for distraction
Sever the head of a snake
Lie there and wait for the pain to sink in
I'm so tired of always letting you down
Still you offer to turn it around
I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
Still you offer to turn it around
Sever the head of a snake
