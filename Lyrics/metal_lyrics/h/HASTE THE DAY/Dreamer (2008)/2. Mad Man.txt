You said it yourself.
To convalesce from empty sorrow, someone had to squeal.
To dive to the bottom.
You said I know. I know it's not your fault.
Like wire around your bones you would never numb.
I take it I'm a mad man, but I would never squeal.
I never said it was no good.
The innocent will rest in the peace they've been given.
Paintings will sleep on the floor.
Build walls of lonely dreams as beauty fades.
I can't take this anymore.
Lock yourself up like a bird in a cage.
You sing but no one ever listens.
How much were you paid to sell out the mad man?
Like a scientist or a master of design.
I knew exactly what I was doing.
And I heard of your disease, and shots of penicillin barely kept you alive.
The innocent will rest in the peace they've been given.
Paintings will sleep on the floor.
Build walls of lonely dreams as beauty fades.
I can't take this anymore.
I am the clone. I dwell in silence. [x4]
The innocent will rest in the peace they've been given.
Paintings will sleep on the floor.
Build walls of lonely dreams as beauty fades.
I can't take this anymore.
