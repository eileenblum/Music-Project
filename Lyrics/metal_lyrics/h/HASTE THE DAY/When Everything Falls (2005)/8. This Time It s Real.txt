The romance lives on inside
Here I am again
Put this ring around your finger
Can you trust me?
I've hurt so many
I am real this time
I've said I love you
Will you trust me?
Deceived and broken
So many hearts
I'm scared of falling
Failing you, my dear
I know I'm weak
I know I'm broken
Your beauty is in my heart
Your beauty keeps me walking on
I will hold you forever my love
This promise is real
Deceived and broken
So many hearts
It's in the past now
This love is real
I've said it before, but this time it's real
Forget the past, it's gone
Believe me when I say that you're the one
That you're the one now
Forget the past, it's gone
