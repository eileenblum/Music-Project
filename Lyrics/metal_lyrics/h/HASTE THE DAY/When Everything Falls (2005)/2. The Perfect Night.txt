Let's run as far as we can go tonight
We'll leave this world behind and forget the memories
Come on, run with me
Come on, hold my hand
Don't slow down, we're almost there
Shake, shake, shake those hips
And dance with me
Tonight we're going to dance
We're going to run and not look back
Come on, I've never felt my heart beat so fast
I wish this night would never end
No words describe this
Your face says everything
You wish this night would never end
We're gonna run and never look back
We wont stop until the morning light
We've never run this far before
Come on, come on,
Don't look back
Run with me a little further
We can make it
If we stay together
Look at us
We're almost there
Come on, Come on,
Don't look back
I've never felt my heart beat this fast
I with this night would never end
No words describe this
Your face says everything
You wish this night would never end
