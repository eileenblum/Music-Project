I know you
I know who you are
I'm thought with your games
I know you
I know who you are
I'm thought with your games
And ever-changing
Ever-changing faces
Let go
Feel it leave your grip
And watch it vanish
In the distance
Watch it vanish
In the distance
Watch it vanish
Forget the voices you hear
They're nothing now
They never were
Forget the voices you hear
They're nothing new
They never were
It looks warped at first
Only because the tears
But you can still recognize
The definition in my face
We will forever stay united
We won't back down
And we will not stop fighting
We may stand or fall
But we'll never know
Until we take a hand
We've been waiting for a lifetime
And the determination in out stride
And the strength
And The strength of our purpose
We have waited for a lifetime
We won't let us pass us by
We just need to stand united
Then we will conquer this together
The determination in our stride
The strength of out purpose
