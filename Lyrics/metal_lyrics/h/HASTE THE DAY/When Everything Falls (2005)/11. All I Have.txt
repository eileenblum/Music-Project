The beauty in your eyes still sustains me
And I know if I were to spit in your face
You would take me back
I know would love me
You would take me back
I know you would love me
If I were
To stab you in the heart
You would bleed for me if it made me happy
If I were to stab you
You would bleed for me
I am nothing that's of worth to you
Take all I have
Though I may never understand it
I won't stop believing
You offer me another chance
A new solution
I don't understand it
But I wont stop believing
There is nowhere I would rather be
Than in your arms
You've proven time and again who you are
I continue to run away
But you are right here
You take me back, you are right here
I am nothing that's of worth to you
Take all I have
Though I may never understand it
I won't stop believing you offer me
Another chance
A new solution
I don't understand it
But I won't stop believing
