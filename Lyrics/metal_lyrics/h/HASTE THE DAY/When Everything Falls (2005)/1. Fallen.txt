Don't cry tonight, my love
You will not bleed alone
I will stand with you
I will stand with you
Don't cry tonight
I will stand with you
Been alone
Far too long
Time to return
You've been alone
For far too long
So long, return
Don't cry tonight
I will stand with you
Don't cry tonight
I will stand with you
You've been alone for far too long
Time to return
You've been alone for far too long
So long, return
There wounds they will not last forever
You've been broken for so long
So long, return
Dead end becomes your second chance
You've been broken for so long
So long, return
