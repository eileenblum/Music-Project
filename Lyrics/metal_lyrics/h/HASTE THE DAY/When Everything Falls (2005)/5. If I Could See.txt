You are too far from me
I can't see your face
I'm barely breathing
The image of you scattered on my mind
I can't see your clearly
Never thought I'd be this far from you
If I could only feel you near
If I could only see you clearly
Alone, nobody hears my cry
If I could only see you clearly
Feeling you near is up to me
I know these thoughts have made me far away from you
I know I need you
I know I need you
To make me whole
To bring me back
To make me whole
I know I need you
I know I need you
You're my only hope
If I could feel you near
I need you now
Never thought I'd be this far from you
If I could feel you near
If I could see you clearly
Alone, nobody hears my cry
If I could see your clearly
Feeling you near is up to me
Alone, nobody hears my cry
Feeling you near is up to me
Never thought I'd be this far from you
If I could only feel you near
If I could see you clearly
Alone, nobody hears my cry
If I could only see you clearly
Feeling you near is up to me
