Selfishness has brought me to this place
Unreal desires have slit the throat of happiness
Holding on to the memories
That will never be again
Breaking the sacred vow
Taking a thousand times
Lies though the mouth
Of the one who believes
Wears the mask
To cover all of the emptiness inside
I bleed alone
My eyes fail me
I sink
Can't swim
I'm drowning
Can't stay on top
Can't move I'm falling further away from you
I'm only suffering
Because the focus is gone
Selfishness has brought me to this place
Unreal desires have slit the throat of happiness
Holding on to the memories
That will never be again
