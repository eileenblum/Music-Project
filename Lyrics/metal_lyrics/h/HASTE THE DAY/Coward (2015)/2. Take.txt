Coward
I hate your filth
You speak lies
I Choose life
Push aside
The brokenness
You have afflicted
For so long

[Chorus:]
We know who you are
We know who you are
And where you cam from
We will never compromise
Because we know who you are

Take take take
You take it all away
Coward Coward Coward

You take it all away

[Chorus:]
We know who you are
We know who you are
And where you cam from
We will never compromise
Because we know who you are

Take take take
You take it all away

[Chorus:]
We know who you are
We know who you are
And where you cam from
We will never compromise
Because we know who you are

Take take take
You take it all away
Coward Coward Coward

You take it all away
