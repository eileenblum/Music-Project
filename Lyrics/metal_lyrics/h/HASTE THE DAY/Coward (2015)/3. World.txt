To love
A world worth leaving
After all these years
Have we all just given up
Did tired minds get the best of us

To leave
A world worth loving
Is it enoughh
Is it enough to watch the world go by
Or will we just let it die

Or walk around with our eyes open
To all the ones who's strength is waning
How have we been redeemed?
The whole word is waiting to be free

Is it enough to watch the world go by
To turn the page without reading the words
Caught in the afterlight
Just waiting for the right time

To love a world worth leaving
To give it all away

Is it enough to watch the world go by
Or start a revolution

I think our strength is waning
We're all just waiting to be free

Is it enough to watch the world go by
To turn the page without reading the words
The words

Is it enough to watch the world go by
To turn the page without reading the words
Caught in the afterlight
Just waiting for the right time
To love a world worth leaving
To give it all away
Is it enough to watch the world go by
Or start a revolution

I will love
A world worth loving
I won't just give it up
Tired minds won't get the best of us
I feel
I feel it trembling
Quaking in the earth
Are we going to let the rocks cry out
Are we going to let the whole world down
