Have you seen the sun?
Have you seen the sun?
Or has the darkness dragged you further from your door?
Take each other's hands.
Look into the clouds.
Such a beautiful song we sing.
Finally finding our own way back home.
Such a beautiful song we sing.
Oh no, this is no time for excuses.
We've singled you out and the leaders keep running away.
The sound of trumpets will carry you home.
The sound of trumpets will resound and we all sing.
Take each other's hands.
Look into the clouds.
Such a beautiful song we sing.
Finally finding our own way back home.
Such a beautiful song we sing.
Re-break the bone to assure the healing.
So that we might know you again.
Re-break the bone.
Re-break the bone.
Re-break the bone.
Sound the alarm like a vulture on the nation with silver.
Oh no, have we sealed our own destruction?
Walking away from the only thing that matters.
Re-break the bone.
Re-break the bone Re-break the bone to assure the healing.
Re-break the bone.
Know you again.
Take each other's hands.
Look into the clouds.
Such a beautiful song we sing.
Finally finding our way home.
Such a beautiful song we sing.
The sound of trumpets will carry you home.
The sound of trumpets will resound and we will sing.
Re-break.
