Vertigo hits.
Tonight we dance.
What dance has brought us to a disfigured ballroom where we march in fine rows and our heels, our heels touch the ground.
Beauty forsaken.
Our weakness comes from desire for solace.
Tonight we cry.
Trust in the falling walls.
Scars in the face of fear.
Scars on our hearts.
No use screaming when all that hear are deaf ears.
Beauty forsaken.
Our weakness comes from desire for solace.
Tonight we cry.
Trust in the falling walls.
