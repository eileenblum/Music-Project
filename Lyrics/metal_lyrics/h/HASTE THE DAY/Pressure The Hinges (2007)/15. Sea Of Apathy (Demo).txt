[Special Edition track]

Why can't you feel this?
Can't you understand I feel this?
This is nothing
I can see my reflection in your cheek bone
We've been playing out this script in your mind

Here we go with a fresh perspective
Paint the walls with your stone faced tactics
And we'll walk around
Eyes on the crowd
And don't you think about tomorrow

[Chorus:]
Our time has come
Our time has come
We'll watch the waters drown
Out the apathy
Our time has come
Our time has come
We'll watch the waters drown
Out the apathy

Here we go with a fresh perspective
We paint the walls with your stone faced tactics
Here we go with a fresh perspective
We'll paint the walls with your stone faced tactics
And we'll walk around
Eyes on the crowd
And don't you think about tomorrow

[Chorus:]
Our time has come
Our tome has come
We'll watch the waters drown
Out the apathy
Our time has come
Our time has come
We'll watch the waters drown
Out the apathy

Why can't you feel this?
Can't you understand I feel this?

And we'll walk around
Eyes on the crowd
And don't you think about tomorrow

[Chorus:]
Our time has come
Our time has come
We'll watch the waters drown
Out the apathy
Our time has come
Our time has come
We watch the waters drown
Out the apathy

[Chorus:]
Our time has come
Our time has come
We'll watch the waters drown
Out the apathy
Our time has come
Our time has come
We watch the waters drown
Out the apathy
