In memory of losing you
Take it for granted
Do I want to know you well
Do I want to know you well
Sing sweet lullaby's to pass the time
If you only knew
If you only knew

Segways, treachery was all you bled
If you only knew
If you only knew

[Chorus:]
Timeless words
You had the chance
Words
You had the chance to leave
Words that feel so wrong

You had the chance
You had the chance
To leave
Still you stayed
Still you stayed
Still you stayed
Still you stayed

In memory of losing you
Take it for granted
Do I want to know you well
Do I want to know you well
Sing sweet lullaby's to pass the time
If you only knew
If you only knew

By the timeless words
These wanted miseries
You had the chance
You had the chance
Still you stayed

In memory of losing you
Take it for granted
Do I want to know you well
Do I want to know you well
Sing sweet lullaby's to pass the time
If you only knew
If you only knew

You had the chance.
