Chorus of Angels
Destroy my silence
That haunts me
That claims me
While darkness walks beside me

Chorus of Angels
Destroy my silence
That haunts me
That claims me
While darkness walks beside me

[Chorus:]
I saw the Angels sing along to wake up the beautiful sleeping world
Their voices will rise to test the strength of man
Wake up the beautiful sleeping world
Wake up
wake up now, wake up now (ambient)

We will see the fire
We will see
The skies will open up
The sky will open
The clouds will burn red and our sins will forget us
Our sins will forget us
And time will not shake us
Our hearts are made of gold
Made of gold
These walls won't over take us
These walls won't over take us
Over take us

[Chorus:]
I saw the Angels sing along to wake up the beautiful sleeping world
Their voices will rise to test the strength of man
Wake up the beautiful sleeping world
Wake up

We will see the fire
We will see
The skies will open up
The sky will open
The clouds will burn red and our sins will forget us
Our sins will forget us
And time will not shake us
Our hearts are made of gold
Made of gold
These walls won't over take us
These walls won't over take us
Over take us

[Chorus:]
I saw the Angels sing along to wake up the beautiful sleeping world
Beautiful sleeping world
Their voices will rise to test the strength of man
Wake up the beautiful sleeping world
Wake up

Chorus of Angels
Destroy my silence
That haunts me
That claims me
While darkness walks beside me

Chorus of Angels
Destroy my silence
That haunts me
That claims me
While darkness walks beside me

[Chorus:]
I saw the Angels sing along to wake up the beautiful sleeping world
Chorus of Angels, wake me, wake me
I saw the Angels sing, wake up the beautiful sleeping world
Wake up, lay the foundations, the foundations of the earth, of the earth

Wake up now, wake up now, wake up now, wake up now, wake up now, wake up now, wake up now, wake up now, wake (ambient fade out)
