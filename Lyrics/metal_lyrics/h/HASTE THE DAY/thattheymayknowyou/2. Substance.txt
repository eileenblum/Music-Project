We Hear The Words You Are, Saying
The Darkness In Our Hearts, Remains
We Can Only Live So Long Without, The Truth
And The Message You Portray, Leaves Me Empty (x2)

We Have The, Will To Fight
We Just Don't Know, What's Right
Our Hearts, Are Crying Out
For Substance, To Hold To
Can't You See, That We Are Crying
While You're Screaming, Our Hearts Are Dying
Shut Your Eyes Up, Shut Your Eyes
Bliss From The Unknown, Hurt We Bear

I Want You To Know What I'm Going Through
I Want You To Know What I'm Going Through
I Want You To Know What I'm Going Through
I Want You To Know What I'm Going Through
I Want You To Know What I'm Going Through
I Want You To Know What I'm Going Through
I Want You To Know What I'm Going Through
(we have the will to fight)
I Want You To Know What I'm Going Through
(we just don't know what's right)
