You send us out as lambs amongst the wolves
But the lion stands by our side
You will be my guide
I need you to lead me
I am so weak without you
I'm tired of fighting
I need you to fight for me
You will be my guide
Jesus
Your voice is so sweet to my ears
Jesus
I desire to be close to you
Fill me with your Spirit God
You've given me a sword to kill my enemies
Father, take these struggles from me
