A shadow forms in my mind
A vision of a cold forsaken stone
Shaped as an arc in the grass
So calm and left alone

A shadow forms in my mind
A vision of a cold forsaken stone
Shaped as an arc in the grass
So calm and left alone

It could be could be could be who we are
A reflection reflection reflection of what we do

It could be could be could be who we are
A reflection reflection reflection of what we do

His only friend is a quick chilled breeze
Says nothing as it whispers bye
Provides no comfort as the cold stone grieves
So calm and left alone

It could be could be could be who we are
A reflection reflection reflection of what we do

It could be could be could be who we are
A reflection reflection reflection of what we do

You have made me beautiful in your sight
Without you this is what i once was

I remember how my heart was
Cold and empty without life
I remember how my heart was
Cold and empty without life

It could be could be could be who we are
A reflection reflection reflection of what we do

It could be could be could be who we are
A reflection reflection reflection of what we do

A shadow forms in my mind
A vision of a cold forsaken stone
