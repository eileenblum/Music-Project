Red leaves blow in the wind
Leaving home and everything it's known behind
Barren branches wave goodbye
As the red leaves slowly die
Every flower stares and watches
As the wind takes me away
Before the sun shone upon me
Now the wind takes me away
Red leaves falling
Through the branches
Making their way to the ground
Blowing by the flowers sleeping
No one knows the leaves are leaving
