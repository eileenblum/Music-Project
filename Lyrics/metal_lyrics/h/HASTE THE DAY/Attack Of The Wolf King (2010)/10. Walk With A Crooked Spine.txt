He'll bury us all in misery!

Where are you now?
When the world is crashing
And all the creatures are calling
Where are you now?
In the rhythm of the subtle sound
Of them whispering

You are wounded now, I know
You are wounded now
And the world is crashing down, I know
It's crashing down

He'll bury us all in misery
Buried underneath this mountain of control
But I am the white light
In the potters eyes
as you come wandering home

Where are you now?
In this time
I've wandered to find the way out
But I am the spawn
Of the wolf and the jackal
And there is no hope for me
There is no hope for me

Which is why instead of walking upright
You walk with a crooked spine

He'll bury us all in misery!
Misery!

Misery buried underneath this mountain of control
But I am the white light
In the potters eyes
as you come wandering home

I am the spawn of the wolf and the jackal
So hear the sound within me
I am the spawn of the wolf and the jackal
So hear the sound within me
