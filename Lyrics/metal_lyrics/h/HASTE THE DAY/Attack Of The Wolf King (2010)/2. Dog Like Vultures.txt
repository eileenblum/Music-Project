Who will protect you from these dog like vultures?
And I know they're small but their teeth are sharp.

We've been sent with eyes to see them and ears to hear their steps.
Our hearts that are softer than the sheep.

We've been known to calm the storm and silence the ocean
with strength to spare you from their teeth.

Our eyes are upon you
and we will protect you
and be assured that
no fang will breech
your fleece

Because we are called to lead and sent to gather.
So, bare your teeth
and sharpen your claws.

We've been sent with eyes to see them
and ears to hear their steps.
Our hearts that are softer than the sheep

We've been known to calm the storm and silence the ocean.
With strength to spare you from their teeth.

From their teeth.
And their blood will spill like water in a fountain for thieves and liars.
So bare your teeth and sharpen your claws.
Because we hold the keys

And we've been sent with
eyes to see them
and ears to hear their steps
and hearts are softer than the sheep.

We've been known to calm the storm and silence the ocean.
With strength to spare you from their teeth.
From their teeth.
