[feat. Micah Kinard of Oh, Sleeper]Blot out the sun the miserable sun
I'll blacken the sky and you will see no light

Useless, it is all useless
There will be nothing
There is no one to help you out
But I hear the voice of the watchman:
Useless, it is all useless
There will be nothing
There is no one to help you out

Blot out the sun the miserable sun
I'll blacken the sky and you will see no light

You've taught us to feel worthless
But it's in the back of your mind
That we are strong enough
To make it back, to make it back in time

There is no way out
And you have nothing without me

[Micah Kinard (Oh, Sleeper):]
After all these years of my pleasing and reaching
How easily you can be so swayed
Oh, by that arrogant tongue that pours slow with precision
All those honey-soaked words geared to sink you and keep you
Locked tight in such desperate but anxious grips
Because he fears what burns beneath your skin
And he will fear what I've written

You've taught us to feel worthless
But it's in the back of your mind
That we are strong enough
To make it back, to make it back in time
To make it back, to make it back in time

When you're breathing in, in the place where most deny
You are strong enough
(We can make it back in time)
To make it back in time
When you're breathing in
(We can make it back in time)
In the place where most deny
You are strong enough
(we can make it back in time)
To make it back in time
