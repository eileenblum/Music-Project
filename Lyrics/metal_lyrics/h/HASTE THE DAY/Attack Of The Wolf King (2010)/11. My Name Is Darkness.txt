With grace, we've marched
To the ends of the earth
To search for the hand
And When all hope is lost
It will be found
Where heavens and earth collide

And darkness will show his weary head to the light
And the rich will trade their treasures for life
For something sweeter than honey
Where the earth and the heavens collide

My name is darkness
And I have uncloaked my face to the light
My name is darkness
And I have uncloaked my face
