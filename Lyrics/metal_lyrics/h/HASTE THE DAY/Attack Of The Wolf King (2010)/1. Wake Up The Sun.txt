They came with different names
bore the mark of the old
They came with different names
bore the mark of the old
We've tried to run but it's no use
And all this time we've reached the point of desperation
In these iron walls we hide
But we leave the gates wide open

FOR NOW
We are here and we are one
and hearts are empty
FOR NOW
For the waking of the sun
Is not that easy
FOR NOW
We are here are one

I will never be the same
and I'll burn with a heart of fire
It's never gonna be the same
When I see their faces
They came with different names
and bore the mark of the old
And from their lips came the same strain
That's waking up, that's waking up the sun

FOR NOW
We are here and we are one
and hearts are empty
FOR NOW
For the waking of the sun
Is not that easy
FOR NOW
We are here are one

They came with different names,
bore the mark of the old

We are waking up the sun

FOR NOW
We are here and we are one
and hearts are empty
FOR NOW
For the waking of the sun
Is not that easy
FOR NOW
We are here and we are one

We are waking up the sun!
