[Special-edition bonus track]

Burning bridges burning bridges
Shut myself off from the world
Burning bridges burning bridges
Shut myself off from life

As the ashes fall as the ashes fall
Through the fire through the flame
As the ashes fall as the ashes fall
Through the fire through the flame

Life purified again
I won't look back
To the chains that bound me
I won't look back
To the chains that bound me

And I will lay to rest my ghosts
And cover my footsteps
And I will stand up straight and walk away
Leaving them far behind

Wont look back, chains that bound me!
