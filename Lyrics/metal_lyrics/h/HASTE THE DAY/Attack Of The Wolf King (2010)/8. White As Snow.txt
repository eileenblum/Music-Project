I've walked with the kings and I've marched to the pounding drums
Then you came [2x]

You asked me to change but like a fool I refused
And walked away
Oh, oh

It's not like you would know, would you?
You were white as snow
But still you plead, still you plead guilty

They took my crown as I hung my head and tied the noose
Around my neck
They tied me up and left me for dead
please cut, cut me loose

It's not like you would know, would you?
You were white as snow
But still you plead, still you plead guilty

It's not like you would know, would you?
You were white as snow
Still you plead, still you plead guilty

It's not like you would know, would you?
You were white as snow
You were white as snow
You were white as snow
