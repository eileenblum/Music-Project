When the moon hangs rogue in the sky
I wait for you
With every step you take
I'll wait for you
I will never forget this made me feel alone
So hopelessly alone
Defeated, helpless, with nothing to call home

Open my heart to sadness
It's through the pain that I believe
(It's in the pain that I can see)
Love is alive in darkness
The waters may rise but your hand carries me

I won't let go
and I will never forget
You made me feel alive so I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
We've opened our hearts to sadness
Because we know it wont last long
We know love will live through darkness
Through the darkness we overcome

Open my heart to sadness
It's through the pain that I believe
(It's in the pain that I can see)
Love is alive in darkness
The waters may rise but your hand carries me, I won't let go

When the moon hangs low [4x]

Open my heart to sadness
It's through the pain that I believe
(It's in the pain that I can see)
Love is alive in darkness
The waters may rise but your hand carries me

The world may deny what you choose to believe
I know you're here
So I'll hold on and wont let go
I wont let go
