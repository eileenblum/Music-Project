Crush the resistance!

Storm the halls and all of the rooms
And break resistance
All who'll choose the narrow road
Will be the victims
Crush resistance!
Withdraw the power
Seek to bring down the leader
Devour the smallest of the pride
And wring the blood from your fur
For they are white as the morning
But they are weak from the need to forgive
Cover yourselves with the flesh of their fallen
And dress for the banquet
For they are weak and unknowing
Dress for the banquet
For the rain is falling from the

Grey sky!
Death comes in the
Black night!
We will never see the
Sun light!
In the shadow of your hate

Falling from the
Grey sky!
Death comes in the
Black night!
We will never see the
Sun light!
In the shadow of your hate
Look into the grey sky as its turning into night

Wear the stone down to sand
And weigh them down with your sorrow

Dress for the banquet
For they are weak and unknowing
Dress for the banquet
For they are weak and unknowing
And the rain is falling from the

Grey sky!
Death comes in the
Black night!
We will never see the
Sun light!
In the shadow of your hate

Falling from the
Grey sky!
Death comes in the
Black night!
We will never see the
Sun light!
In the shadow of your hate
Look into the grey sky as its turning into night

As I send you out into the shadow
Lurk the woods and every dark place
