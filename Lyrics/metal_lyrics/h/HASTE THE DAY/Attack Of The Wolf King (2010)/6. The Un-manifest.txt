Right now, he awaits at the threshold
Don't let him in
No, don't let him in
though he is dressed like the rest of us,
He has the jackal's eyes
The jackals eyes
Oh, the immortal is coming
And with him comes the storm
Black smoke fills the air
With anger as black as the cellars of hell
He wears your name like a cloak made for kings
He wears your name like a cloak made for kings

They will come like...
Parasites swarming in
Dressed in lies of normality
To appease the death of innocence
And its growing appetite

Abandon all hope!
Abandon all hope!
Abandon all hope!

Parasites swarming in
Dressed in lies of normality
To appease the death of innocence
And its growing appetite

Parasites swarming in
Dressed in lies of normality
To appease the death of innocence
And its growing appetite
