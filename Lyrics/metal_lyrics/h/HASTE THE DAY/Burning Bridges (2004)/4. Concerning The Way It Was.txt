The shadow cast upon me
Eyes sewn shut with the wires
Lies bound by the lies that pierce my skin
Heart as cold as winter
Although there is no season
In this place of loneliness

I'm drowning
Every day the same
Locked at the ankles plotting my escape
I've tried so hard to remind myself
Life's only what I see
I thought I lost the meaning but I was only finding you

The years without the freedom
Tortured by words of reason
Convincing those around me
That life consists of nothing
And dead the end of all things
You've broken through the darkness
The shadow gone forever

And now I live
And now there's hope
[X4]
