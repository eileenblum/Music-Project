Exchanging beauty
For the ashes
Given my heart
To nothing real
[X2]

I've given my heart away
To so many things
So many times I've failed
Help me stop this endless cycle
Remind me of how it can be

Take me back
I surrender all
Without you
My heart is broken

I never should have let you go
I never should have let you slip
Through my arms
[X5]

As the sun sets tonight
I'll hold you with all that I am
[X3]
I never should have let you go
Promise me
You'll stay with me forever
Forever
[X3]

Forgive me
For running so quickly to the outside
[X2]
