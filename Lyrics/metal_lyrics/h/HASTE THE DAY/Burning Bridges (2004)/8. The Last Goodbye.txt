This is the last of all the last times [x2]
My dear, no more [x3]
Where's the comfort?, where's the end?

This is the last time
This is the last goodbye
You say that you're not sure
But I think you feel the same
Over and over we try to work this out
All this time all I wanted was you
All I want is you
