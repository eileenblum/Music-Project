We Stand Tired And Tested
Our Hearts Resurrected
One Truth This Is What We Live And Die For
We Fight With Conviction
No Time For Excuses
One Life It's Our Only Chance
To Take A Stand

Try To Make A Stand [x2]

Make The Most Of Every Day You Live
Choose The Day It Just Might Be Your Last
No Regrets We Have No Time To Wait
Take Control We've Got One Life To Live

We've Got One Life To Live
We've Got To Make A Change [x6]
