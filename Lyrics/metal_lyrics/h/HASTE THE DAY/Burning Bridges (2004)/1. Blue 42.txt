Burning bridges
Burning bridges
Shut myself off from the world
Burning bridges
Burning bridges
Shut myself off from life

As the ashes fall
As the ashes fall
Through the fire
Through the flame
[X2]

Life purified again

I won't look back
To the chains that bound me
[X2]

I will lay to rest my ghosts
And cover my footsteps
I will stand up straight and walk away
Leaving them far behind

Won't look back
Chains that bound me
