My Words Feel So Empty
My Lips Speak In Vain
Your Face Tells A Story
Of Wounds That Still Remain
Stay True To My Heart
Cast Failures To The Wind
I Hate The Way It Feels
To Know I Slipped Again

Tomorrow Holds Another Chance
Not Just To Smile But Make It Real
For What It's Worth I Won't Give Up
For Whats It's Worth I Won't Give Up

I Won't Walk Away
For What It's Worth I Won't Give Up [x3]
