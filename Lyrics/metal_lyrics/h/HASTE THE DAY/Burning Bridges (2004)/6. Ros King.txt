Your Eyes Caught Me
From Across The Room
You've Always Had Away With Looks
Your Eyes They Tear Through Me
They Tear Through Me And Leave Me To Wish
That You Won't Leave The Same
That You Won't Leave The Same
Theres Something That Isn't There
That You Won't Leave The Same
Something About Your Stare
That Chills My Inner Core

If Only You Had Known
If Only Someone Told You
Without Him Your Whole World
Falls To Dust
And Thats The One Last Thing
I Wanted To Say Before You Died

You're Crying Out For Something More
You're Crying Out For Something More
