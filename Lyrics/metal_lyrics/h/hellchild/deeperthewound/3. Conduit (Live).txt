There was nothing that I ever wanted more
than for you to hold this deep with you heart
To lay beside me as my halo bums deep to cinder
and to the wale me from my tired life
To give this ghost a home again
When you fall short and I fall short
this is where I pretend I'm as tall as the sky
Now there is no comfort in your apology
and no comfort in this shame
This is where I can duck for cover
from the overwhelming, from the forever overhead
For the heart, for old time's sake, I'll stay warm with this
Numb from the neck up
She married me with a sypathy kiss
She married me with her heart shaped tomb
These days daydreams don't burn as bright as they us to
and your broken promises are boiling over
Every syllable my swinging hammer
and every hesitation is a loss to them
In the name of those lost to you
for them this time it is war
For me it's easier to just walk away
