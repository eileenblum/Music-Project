You where once a man of might,
But now you're just a parasite!
You abased me bad, and now you'll play.
I'm out hunting, and you're my prey!

[Ref.:]
I come at night, out your sight,
I sneak up on you when you sleep,
I come at night, out of your sight,
I am your nightmare fucking creep!!

Like a eagre, I'm over you,
I stab you once, and then anew!
I cannot stop, I will nit stop,
before I'm finished shutting you up!

[Ref.:]
I come at night, out your sight,
I sneak up on you when you sleep,
I come at night, out of your sight,
I am your nightmare fucking creep!!

Like a eagre, I'm over you,
I stab you once, and then anew!
I cannot stop, I will nit stop,
before I'm finished shutting you up!

I might hurt you more by letting you live,
But in my ecstasy there is no forgive!
Yeah, you are moribund indeed,
But I will make fucking bleed!!

I exercise manhandling in extreme measures,
a violent encounter with bloody pleasures!
I cut out the eyes in your ugly head,
I cut and stab until everything is fucking red!!

And when I leave, you have breath,
I am The Avengerm I am your Death...!
