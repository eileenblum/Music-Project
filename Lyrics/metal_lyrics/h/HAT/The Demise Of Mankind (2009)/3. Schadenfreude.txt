So satisfying, to see you suffer
All you have believed in falls to pieces
You try to obtain, a normal life
You will not succeed
Sickness has struck your closest ones

Your god will save you from your misery
You always thought you could win
If you obeyed the words of Christ
I think you know better now
I can not describe the joy I feel
When I see the disbelief in your eyes

You are a hallowed shell with no one to turn to
In your hour of despair you scream for salvation
There's none to be found
Your life ends abruptly by your own hands

I praise the misfortunes of others
I praise destruction of planet earth
I praise eternal darkness
I praise chaos

Schadenfreude, I enjoy your misery
Schadenfreude, your life is worthless
