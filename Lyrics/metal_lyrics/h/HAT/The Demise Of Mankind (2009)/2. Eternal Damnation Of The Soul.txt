Wandering in solitude
Finding my path
The forest surrounds me
Darkness, death and despair

My hatred towrads humans
Keeps me alive
I will keep on killing
Till the end of time

I obey my bloodthirst
And search out my victims
My legion with evil
Will be the end of mankind

Glorious massive murder
Leaves blood on my hands
As a messenger from hell
I fulfill my destiny

Embrace hate
Embrace murder
Embrace war
Embrace the eternal damnation the soul
