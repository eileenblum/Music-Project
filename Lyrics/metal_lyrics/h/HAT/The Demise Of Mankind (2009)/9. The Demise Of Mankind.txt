From the second they are born. They are afraid to die
Clinging to their god. Obeying his every word

When the sun turns black
When the trees have died
Warriors stand proud
And witness the demise of mankind

I have chosen a life in darkness. Not afraid to stand alone
Like an unstoppable disease. I bring death without glory

Walking amongst them. Observing their ways
Corrupting their minds. Earning their trust

When the sun turns black
When the trees have died
Warriors stand proud
And witness the demise of mankind

In a furious attack
I will unleash my wrath
Exposing the beast
For all to see
