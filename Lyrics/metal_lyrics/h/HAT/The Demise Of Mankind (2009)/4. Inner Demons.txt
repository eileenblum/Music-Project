I wake up with the hunger. Let the hunt begin
A life must be taken. To silence my voices
The ceremony begins

I savour the moment. The fear is their eyes
Their silent screams. Praying for their life
But my demons command me

Helpless to resist. I sharpen my tools
Only pain await. The ritual is complete

Death is your relief
Death is your relief

You know what to do
Kill in his name
In his name...

My voices has left me
The calmness arrives
I enjoy the silence

Before the dreams of death
Yet again stir the monster that is I
