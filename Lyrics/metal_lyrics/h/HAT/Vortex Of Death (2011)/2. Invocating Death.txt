Place the altar, candles,
red, black and white. A
ritual takes place, we call
upon death. Summon
the forces of primeval
chaos into the triangel,
drawn in black and blood

I commit myself - to silence
and death. Hear our praise
- Our song - The unspoken
word. The code to open
portals - to dimension death

Approach the gate Mal' ak ha-
mashhit, Thanatos, Grimnir.
Enter our world. Turn
the wheels of mankind
Enter - Enter

Give me thy soul - Human
Your call is heard. You
seek destruction of Man,
and a new direction
for planet earth. Give me thy
soul - Human.

Our call is heard Mal' ak ha-
mashhit, Thanatos, Grimnir.
I offer my soul. Turn the
wheels of mankind. Break the
chains of power - release
Chaos. Death. Human.
And now the signs will show
in form of Acts of impulse in 
the circle of leaders. A man
of power Will turn the coin
of the plan - world peace.
Now destruction.

Vengence,
wrath,
murder.
The fall of
civil life.
The poison
breath of moral
lifecodes cease
to exist. In
the presence
of death.
