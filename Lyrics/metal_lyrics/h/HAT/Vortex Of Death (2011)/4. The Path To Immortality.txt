I have walked this
earth for eternities
Explored its
every inch of
devastation.
Searched without
knowing what to
search for. No
hope of escaping
this personal hell.

My three demons
unveil themselves.
My intellect. My hatred.
My insanity.
A vision appear
before me. A world
without friends or foes. 
I am everthing and 
nothing.

Dead and alive in my own
universe. The path to immortality
and salvation. Finally it all
seems clear. I have discovered
the path to immortality and 
salvation. I Praise the dark
forces surrounding my soul.
I welcome the undoing of 
my being.
