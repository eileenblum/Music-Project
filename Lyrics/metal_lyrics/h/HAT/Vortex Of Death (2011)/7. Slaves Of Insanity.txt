I am dead but not finished
Driven by rvenge. Her
dreams consist of panic and
anxiety. Invisible to her eyes

but not to her subconscious.
She feels my presence and
obeys my words. I strive to
break down all humanity.

My orders resulting in chaos.
She's a slave to my dictatorship.
Unable to withstand my
voice of insanity.

My legion of disposable bodies, fulfilling my macabre
vision. The throne of my Empire built with human skulls
