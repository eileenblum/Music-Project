A curse of kindness has fallen upon us
Spells of goodness wasting our youth 
Sleep will redeem us, (Our) eyelids are swords
Thoughts are obscene, dreaming is cure

Watch me now as I cut out your Throat!
Yes Priest, my eyes are fiery cold.
As my soul is sold, black is your own
Devil accept my offer of coal!

Against your curse, against all goodness
WE DREAM 
Against the flow, against your spells
WE DREAM 

Bleed for me you virginal Whore!
We'll dye you in Blood and praise our Lord
Your limbs are Pentagram, your entrails our cross
Devil, taste! This offering of gold!

Little boy, do not hold back
Sweetly you scream. Yes slaughter's such fun!
Sing his name as you fade away
My MASS is almost Complete , I'm gone!

Against your curse, against all goodness
WE DREAM 
Against the flow, against your spells
WE DREAM 

Love of my Life, I creep into you
Love of my life, I'll miss you too

(Do not wake me up, I want to dream the obscene
The elusive thrill of a kill
My eyelids are gates where men are exiled
The point of no return)

Sing his name as you fade away
My MASS is almost Complete , I'm gone!

Little boy, do not hold back
Sweetly you scream. Yes slaughter's such fun! [x2]
