Slow marching procession, a mob carrying their guns
Fast-ascending trio, the Father, the Blade, the Son
Unearthly presence of demons, protecting the One
Come, Chant, Let's Darken All Colour, Atop The Mountain Of Horror

THE MOUNTAIN OF HORROR! WHERE EVIL CLAIMS ALL OF YOU
THE MOUNTAIN OF HORROR! EVERY NIGHT THERE IS BLOOD TO BE SPILLED

God-fearing men, shrouded in Sanctity
The Wraiths have no qualm, they drown them in Misery
The child's black eyes mirror Ecstacy
Father! I darken each Colour, Atop the mountain of horror

Terrified, the puny ones, offer themself to His Light
The demons rejoice "Bathe in his Darkness' Might"
The Vessel grins, "This wretched world is Mine!"
I Drain ALL colour Starting from the Mountain of Horror! 

THE MOUNTAIN OF HORROR! WHERE EVIL CLAIMS ALL OF YOU
THE MOUNTAIN OF HORROR! EVERY NIGHT THERE IS BLOOD TO BE SPILLED
