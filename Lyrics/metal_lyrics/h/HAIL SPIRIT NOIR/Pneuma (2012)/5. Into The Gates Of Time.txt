Watching my clock tick-tockin away
Patiently waiting the time I long for
There, by my feet, my naked, young one
The last time she had me I cannot recall

Step Into the gates of time
Look through the pale Gates of time
Grow Young, Your Life Is Mine, in the gates of time
The world changes but I still am I, through the pale gates of time
I watched daylights turn into nightskies, as centuries went by
The beast roared in tongues unheard, in the strings of time
The fading candlelight marks the end of time

Finally, the hand strikes 3:33
My lifetime of sin bought that for me
Out of the pendulum steps the Horned One
My maiden is trembling as I start to plea

Dealing with Fiends is never Wise,
Mine you know is never a kiss
Are you prepared to slaughter your soul?
I thrive in torture, do you Desire this?

MY DEMONS HAVE WON
I'VE ENDED FORLORN
MY DEMONS HAVE WON

Yes, Infernal Creature Of Hell!
In a lustful, young body I need to dwell!
My soul is yours, do as You please

Step Into the darkest gates of time
Look through the pale Gates of time
Grow Young Your Life Is Mine, in the gates of time
The world changes but I still am I,
through the pale gates of time
I watched daylights turn into nightskies,
as centuries went by
The beast roared in tongues unheard
in the strings of time
The fading candlelight marks the end of time

MOTIONLESS I COULD ONLY WATCH
AS CANDLES DANCED BEFORE
HER CORPSE
