Let your devil come inside
Let your soul fly up to the sky
The golden rod was made for you [x2]

The apple was a lie
Your Eva was a lie
Your dreams were a lie
You are not worth a life

Wake from slumber
The ape should mime the snake
From your ruined shelter the Phoenix will rise
Love is naive
The blood is now in your hands
And you look to the mirror
You are brave, you are brave

Let your devil come inside
Let your soul fly up to the sky
The golden rod was made for you
