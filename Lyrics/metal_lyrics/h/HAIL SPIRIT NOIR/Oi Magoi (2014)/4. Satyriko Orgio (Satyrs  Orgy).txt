Beneath the hide of many a coward
Dance the flames of Lust and Desire
Restless at the sight of every single vice
Eliminating piety, desecrating rites

Merrily corrupting you
The soul just needs to feed
Greedily, weâre granting you
Your each and every whim

Live and learn
To taste is to burn
Deviate and dream
The satyrs again

It is with great abandon
we tear your soul to shreds
Let obscenity within arise
Joyous malevolence emerge

The spring is in our hooves
We march to its beat
Dictating the orgies
We shall begin

â¦to taste is to burn,
deviate and dream
the satyrs againâ¦
