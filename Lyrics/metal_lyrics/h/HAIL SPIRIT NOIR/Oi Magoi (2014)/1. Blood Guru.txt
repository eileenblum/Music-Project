Splattered on the walls
and dripping from ceilings
Where is the bllod?
Tearing flesh apart is soul-fulfilling
It soothes my eyes and stirs my soul 
Strengthens desire to call on my Lord

Gruesome Writings of Devilish Lore
Written in blood
Skinning,sawing their hides in a cloth 
DEMANDING MORE MORE BLOOD!

Where is the blood?
I Shiver and quake,the blood guru game!
WAIT, it can't be mine...
THIS IS MY BLOOD!!
