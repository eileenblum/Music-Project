Thereâs a puppet offering 
Its strings for a pull
A quick little tug,
it will dance to your tune
Make you King of a slave
puppetâs sick embrace
Usher in the Hell
Wish it to dwell

Demon for a day
Just what you need
Just what you crave
Demon for a day
Rape thousand girls
Kill who you crave

Thereâs a sage whoring
himself out to Truth
All wisdom imparted is wasted on you
Furnace of logic now a mere hearth
Logic greets Silence
Intellect meets Death

Demon for a day
Just what you need
Just what you crave
Demon for a day
Rape thousand girls
Kill who you crave

Thereâs this nun on the street
Renting out her priest
Sinning congregation
Is all a man needs
Relieve them of their piety
Revealing all their guilt
Believing in their blasphemy
Words of chaos you spit

Demon For A Day
