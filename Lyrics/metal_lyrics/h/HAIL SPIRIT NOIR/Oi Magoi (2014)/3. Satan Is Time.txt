We float in space and follow the pace
of a clock designed by His Will
Satan shall reap what God has sown
Blackness comes, colors go

You run, you hide but Satan can find the cowards
that live by His side
The needle rotates, a lie it creates,
but then it stands still and kills
If heaven is here, it will stay here
Hell is a place full of clocks

Satan is time

Irreversible time is smooth to the touch
A reaper disguised as charm
The pace Satan dictates, the music he creates
A cycle of death and death

You run, you hide but Satan can find
the cowards that live by His side, eat from His handâ¦

We float in space and follow the pace
of a clock designed by His Will
Satan shall reap what God has sown
Hell is a place full of clocks
