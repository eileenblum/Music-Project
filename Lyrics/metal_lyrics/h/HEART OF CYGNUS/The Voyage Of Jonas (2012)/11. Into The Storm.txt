In the morning they set out
'Neath the mountain's misty veil
Sped on by northern winds
Into the deep they sailed
Standing on the quarterdeck
With leather cloak and steely eyes
'Neath brooding skies
The captain spies the horizon
Coming to the captain's side
She stares into the bleary night
And prays they're not too late
To sound the warning
For the mage's vision told
Of amassing Corsair fleets
The alliance must be warned
Before the land is reached
Thunder clouds are looming lowly
A brooding storm is twisting overhead
Giant waves are roiling, whirling
Up from the deep a terror is rising now
With valiant hearts, the cruel serpent they dared to defy
And many a valley of fiery arrows they let fly
By chance or fate a flaming bolt pierced the serpent's eye
And he hurled himself back to the depths with a terrifying cry
