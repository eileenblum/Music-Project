On a bleak and cloudy break of a misty fortnight's dawn,
We reached the fjords and traveled on
We anchored in the moonlight 'neath the mountain o'er the bay
The fortress, the abyss of the dragon
Beneath the cover of darkness we hastened on our way
For the enemy has many eyes
Climbing rocky hillsides and striding trackless wastes
We headed for the mountain side
On a lonely hillside, hemmed in by stone and tree
With no fire for fear we would be seen
We'll wait until the dawn to see our way and travel on
To the pass, the fortress of the dragon
When the storm has come and wind stands against you
May you find the strength to journey on
When the darkness falls, you can feel the eyes upon you
May you have the courage to stand strong
On a bleak and cloudy break of a misty fortnight's dawn,
We reached the fjords and traveled on
