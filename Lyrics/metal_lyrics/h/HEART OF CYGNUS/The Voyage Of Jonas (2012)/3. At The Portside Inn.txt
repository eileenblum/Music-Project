She came upon a moonlit night
With hooded cloak and downcast eyes
No diadem, no royal crown
A princess in disguise
Sitting at the Portside Inn
Watching moonlight on the bay
A weathered captain sips his ale
And dreams of sailing home
She sits across the table
And they talk into the night
They spoke of danger arising in the east...
Of a summoner whose evil magic grows
They sail on the morrow for the fortress of the beast
The abyss of the dragon, to the mines and the labyrinths below
Then they told of perils, and of great serpents in the sea...
Nightmarish evils, and sorcery hidden in the deep
I sat at the table, and then they called for more wine
With tales of adventure, we drank until the morning light
I'll go wherever you will go and sail out into the unknown
For life is but a winding path that leads us home
