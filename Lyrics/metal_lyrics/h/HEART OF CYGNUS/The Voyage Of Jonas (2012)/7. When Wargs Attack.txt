Silent, we march to the oncoming darkness,
The storm gathers over the plain
The air is static and still, and it's starting to rain
Far in the distance the crack of a thunderclap sounds
And the lightning whips forth
Then in replay comes the sound of deep drums from the north
Fly o'er the pass for the enemy's found you!
Run swiftly and unsheathe your sword! Hear the
Screams of bloodthirsty werebeasts riding their Wargs!

A voice in the dark, mare in the night,
Haunting your dreams, stirring your fright!
Crack of the whip raking your back,
The terror that grips when Wargs attack!
Hammer and tongs, shackle and chain,
Furnace and fire, torture and pain!
Crack of the whip raking your back,
The terror that grips when Wargs attack!

Casting our burdens and gripping our weapons we hurl ourselves over the plain.
The gates of the fortress are shut, now behind us the fell riders blocking escape

Little hares caught in a trap;
One little twist, their necks will snap!
Crack of the whip raking your back,
The terror that grips when Wargs attack!

Completely encircled and all hope surrendered, a shriek in the sky high above
Spewing fire, dragons descend on our scattering foes
