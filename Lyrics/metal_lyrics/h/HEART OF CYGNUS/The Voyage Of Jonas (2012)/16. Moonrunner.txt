Come with me, we'll sail away
To distant lands across the sea; destiny calls you and I
Enchanted worlds of mystery
With untold treasures, yours and mine, there for the taking
We'll ride with the wind in our sails, the stars will be our guide
We'll sail 'neath the light of the moon, and shift with the flow of the tide
Is it chance that brought us here?
Or could it be the hand of fate guiding our paths to meet?
Now's the time to break away,
Leave the past, and take the helm of your destiny
We'll ride with the wind in our sails, the stars will be our guide
We'll sail 'neath the light of the moon, and shift with the flow of the tide
As the Moonrunner rides through the night
We'll ride with the wind in our sails, the stars will be our guide
We'll sail 'neath the light of the moon, and shift with the flow of the tide
And the stars will be our guide... as the Moonrunner rides through the night
