One after one the crew falls under her spell
The sea rises up and the ship's thrown along by the swell
Trapped and marooned on the isle of ice,
Now under control, in silence they march to her lair
He stands aside as the procession marches on
You're a fool, she laughs, to stray outside your hole where you belong
The mage says nothing, staring straight into her eyes
A flash of the blade brings him to his knees as he starts to bleed
And her wicked laughter rings as he falls to the ground and dies
