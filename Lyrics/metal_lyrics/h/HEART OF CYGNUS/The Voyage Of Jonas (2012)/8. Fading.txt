Born on the wind, feels like I'm floating
A dizzying blow, my head is spinning
I'm trying to hold on to the hope and the dreams I had but
Like the evening sun, my hope is fading
When I was young, I saw the beauty
Of the sun and the moon and the world all around me
With the eyes of a child I saw destiny smiling back but now
Like an old moon, my hope is waning, fading
Fading, like the light after mid-winter's moon, my hope is waning
I'm shaken, like an autumn tree stripping by the wind, my faith is shaken, I'm fading
Oh
But I'll try to hold on
Yeah, but I'll try to hold on
Fading, like the embers that glow on my hearth, my life is fading
I'm breaking; a fire once burned in my heart but now it's just breaking
I'm fading...
