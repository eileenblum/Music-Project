Lie down, rest your weary heads, just lie now
Breathe in the smoked scented air, breathe deeply
Nothing can hurt you inside of these walls
The magic is strong, so sleep here in peace til the dawn
Crystal visions in a looking glass dimly
Freezing; an icy touch beckons and freezes
Great sails in the wind being carried along
A soul that's surrounded in stone, yet hope lingers on
Ooh... to your course stay true
The dream will guide you through
The day will come; we'll break the spell and start again, anew
Ooh... to your course stay true
The dream will guide you through
The day will come when our hearts are one
We'll break the spell and start again, anew
And when you awake a new ship awaits
Built with the craft of magical hands
To speed you along from dusk until day
'Neath midnight's veil the moon runner sails
