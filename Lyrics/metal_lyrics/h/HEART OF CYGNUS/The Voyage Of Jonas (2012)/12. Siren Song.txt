Sleepy, lost and adrift on the ocean
Darkness covering all that you see
With courage you raced toward the oncoming night
But now that it's here you're too tired to fight any more
Soothing, a voice on the mist; are you dreaming?
Look now; a gleam in the night lies ahead
Islands of sparkling jewels that shine
An angel alights on her way come to carry you there
