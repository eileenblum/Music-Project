She floats upon the wind and glides above the sea
With supple pale blue skin, her silver eyes are shimmering
She'll get inside your head and whisper fantasies
But soon you'll wish that you were dead; you'd do well to take heed
Imprisoned in paradise, bow down before your queen
None can resist her beckoning
Indulging in her delights and pleasures never ending
Bow down before your queen!
Her wicked heart is black but her voice is so soothing
And in her path lay ruined men; paupers, heroes, and kings
She comes from timeless past to haunt these isles of ice
Abandoned ships adrift are portents; heed the warning signs.
Imprisoned in paradise, bow down before your queen
None can resist her beckoning
Indulging in her delights and pleasures never ending
Bow down before your queen!
