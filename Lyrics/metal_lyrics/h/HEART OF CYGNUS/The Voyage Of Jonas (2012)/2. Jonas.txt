I see the ships in a crystal bay as they wait to reach the shore
I've always lived in this quiet port, but I long for something more
To sail the dark and stormy deep... to ride the wind and waves,
'Til we finally reach the shore of our destiny
We don't live forever
Time's not on our side
Feels like it's now or never
I gotta leave this place
Before I find I've been left behind
