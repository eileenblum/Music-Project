I stare into the water, a placid pool of crystalline...
But a pale and wretched shadow is staring back at me.
It's been so long, I can't recall the man I used to be
Before I heard her siren song, now imprisoned in her isle in the Dead Sea
The White Witch feeds my veins
Her venom dulls the pain
And though her pleasures fill my cup
It's never quite enough
And the more I stay, the more I fade away
When she caught my gaze my soul was trapped in ecstasy
And in her lair we gave ourselves to pleasure, endlessly
But now I see the ghosts that haunt the moonlit rocks and caves
Shifting shadows whispering for her to come and save...
The White Witch feeds their veins
Her venom dulls their pain
And though her pleasures fill their cup
It's never quite enough
And nothing but their shadows will remain...
Looking back in time, I remember days
Though the wind was cold I could feel the warmth of the sun upon my face
And the midnight sky was vast, and filled with endless dreams
But now all that I see are these cold walls of stone,
And I want to go home
But I don't know if I can ever leave...
