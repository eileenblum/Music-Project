Under starlight and moon, beneath blazing sun
The world stays her course, and time carries on
Seasons pass, men rise and fall
And change is unchanging, touching us all
The kingdom in ruins, smoke wisps lace the sky
A flame flickers, then dies, still more will arise
Though dark be the path, you mustn't turn back
For 'round the next bend, your hopes there may lie
