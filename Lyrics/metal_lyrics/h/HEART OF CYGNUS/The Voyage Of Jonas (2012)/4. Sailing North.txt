Climb abroad and cast away the lines, and hoist the sail
For we leave today at the light of dawn
Saying goodbye to everything I've ever known
Is not an easy thing, but I've got to go or I'll never know
See the castle on the hill above the bay
With it's silver spires gleaming in the sun
Carried by the wind and waves we roll along
Breathe the salty air as the life we knew fades from view
Let me ride the wind to the edge of new horizons
I want to see the stars from shores of distant lands
Two days to the north, we laid anchor then built a fire on the shore
And somewhere deep came the call of rolling thunder
And then the rain began to fall...
