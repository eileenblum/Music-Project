In the chill of the night when the moon starts to wane
And shadows shift and silence falls as the darkness awakes
The forest is still
Hide yourself from the trail
You sense a presence, a rider comes with death like a veil

Itâs falling all around you
You can see the shadows grow
The ring, you feel it calling you
Behold, they come
Black riders

Flee from the road
Your cover has failed
Make for the bridge and pray you'll go
Unnoticed from there

The hooves are pounding louder
Theyâre nearly upon you now
You reach the river, a raft awaits
You escape as they howl

They shadow you by land
Their eyes begin to glow
They beckon you come near
And your fear begins to grow

Itâs falling all around you
You can see the shadows grow
The ring, you feel it calling you
Behold, they come
Black riders
