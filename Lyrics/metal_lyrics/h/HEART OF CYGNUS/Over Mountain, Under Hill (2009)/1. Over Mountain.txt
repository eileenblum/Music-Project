Heading up the mountain
In the drizzling black
Weary from the distance but there's no turning back
They need a place to rest

Hiding in a musty cave from the raging tempest
They wait for the sleep to fill their eyes
The ritual death will seal their fate

Sleep tight

Sleep tight
Dream while you have the chance
No sense in anxiety 'til the moment is at hand

Some walls have eyes
All the better to see you with
Some walls have hands
All the better to grab you with

We've caught you off guard
Too tired to know and too tired to care
Welcome to our house
Welcome to our lair

Sleep tight

Sleep tight
Dream while you have the chance
No sense in anxiety 'til the moment is at hand
