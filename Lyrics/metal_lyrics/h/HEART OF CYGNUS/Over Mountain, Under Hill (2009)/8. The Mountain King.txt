The road winds on unseen
Yet I must travel still
Iâve many tales, and songs to sing
Before the Mountain King

And I see the light of a million stars as they guide my way
And youâre standing there; I can see the smoke from the fireplace
And the smell of fall is in the air

Oh loveâ¦ Oh love, itâs been far too long.
