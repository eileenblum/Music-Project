Gazing at the stars tonight from my window sill
Above the circle in the sky a flashing breaks the still
I look up to catch a glimpse, a moment, then it's gone...
I could almost see the sun
Then I thought I saw the eyes of Pleiades

In the sky and across the night
Seven race to meet the dawn
Through the night they soar and dive
And the hunter follows on

I jump out my window, through the backyard, through the trees
In a clearing stands a rocket ship readied just for me
I feel the jets as they break away and I hurl beyond the stratosphere
Soaring high into the midnight sky
I could see Orion chasing Pleiades far beyond

In the sky and across the night
Seven race to meet the dawn
Through the night they soar and dive
Through the corridors divine... on and on
Through the corridors divine... on and on
