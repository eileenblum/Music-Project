Bastard son of noble birth
Bound in chains, a slave at sea
Not but gall to quench his thirst
Not but darkness could he see

Led in chains to isles of ice
His prison, yet his paradise
To hunt with hawk and fight with hand
He wandered wild and jagged land

Captive of a Nordic clan
Scoffed and struck by Einar's hand
His bird of prey would take an eye
And mar the heart of Einar's pride

Thus condemned to die at tide
Neath judgment's veil God's mercy hides
For Providence would hear his plea
As Northern winds rebuked the sea

When ships set sail and ride the wind
You summon storms and stir the sea
When men of courage find the end
They cry out and you guide them to their destiny
