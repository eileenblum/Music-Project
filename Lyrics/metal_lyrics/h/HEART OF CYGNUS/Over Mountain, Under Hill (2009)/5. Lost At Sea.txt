Will you say a prayer for me my love?
When I'm lost, I'm lost at sea
When the waves are far too great, my love
Will you say a prayer for me?

We raised our sail and set out to cross the Northern Sea that night,
Sixty battle hardened men in silence under veiled moonlight
With cloak of darkness, in our ship, a shapeless form
By oars and wind we fly into the waiting storm

Through ice and wind
The nightmare begins

The captain spoke of riches for our taking on a distant land
With promises of wine, wealth and women, enough for every man
Weâd raid the countryside, take the plunder for our own
And we would live as kings, on our island, free to roam

But now the Lord of the Storm rebukes us with his wind and waves
We cry for mercy but no one's there to save us now

The ocean vents her wrath upon our longboat's hull
She hurls us to the depths into the deadly cold

Lying on the broken hull, I awake still in a dream
Adrift now for days and days, floating towards an isle of green
The ship and all her men are gone, taken by the deep
And I alone have lived to tell
My soul, still lost at sea

Will you say a prayer for me my love?
When I'm lost, I'm lost at sea
