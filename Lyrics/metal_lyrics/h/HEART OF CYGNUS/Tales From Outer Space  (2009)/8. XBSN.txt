Soaring through space, traveling the speed of light
I think of your face, then I get sick and start to puke
Dinner comes aâspraying outâ¦
When itâs gone Iâll keep dry heaving âtil I get my mind on something else

Iâm tired of this food, I long for a good piece of steak
But paste in a tube is better than home, girl, âcause you canât cook
You were such a gorgeous woman âtil you made me dinner now Iâll never look at you the same again.

You canât cook.
