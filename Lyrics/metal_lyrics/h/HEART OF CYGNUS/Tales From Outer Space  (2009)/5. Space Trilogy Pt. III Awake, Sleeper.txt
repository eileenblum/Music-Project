Silently screaming across constellations, my Renaissance tearing through space
Lying still in my bio-stasis chamber, suspended and inanimate

Traveling time and space, awake Sleeper, awake.

Hurling unhindered, the void black and shapeless, my shipâs A.I. keeps me on course
Guided by more than precise calculations, an invisible spiritual force

Traveling time and space, awake Sleeper

I donât understand what forces are guiding my way
Still Iâll unfurl my sails, let the winds of destiny blow and carry me where they may

I awake to find my programmed mind imprinted with a new mission
Something stirs âneath the planets surface, but a haze clouds my vision

Could it be Iâve been here before? I sense I have but I cannot be sure
I feel my ship respond to ground control, being pulled toward the celestial shore

A dark planet made of blackened stone hides abundant stores of treasure
But a shadow looms over my soul, fell darkness beyond measure

Find the man with time on his side, his soul decaying from attrition
He will lead you to the depths below and there you will fulfill your mission

In the shadows a child lays still, a surgeon breathes through his mask
In the tray a computer chip, a blade; tools for his task
My vision blurs, the dream swirls into darkness as I drift away
Grasp at thoughts and try to rememberâ¦ hold on one more day.

I awaken aboard the Renaissance wondering where I am
Looking down, I open my fist
A computer chip sits in the palm of my hand
