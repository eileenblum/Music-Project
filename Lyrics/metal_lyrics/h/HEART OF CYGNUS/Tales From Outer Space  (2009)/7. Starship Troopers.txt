High above the earth in the darkest depths of space
On distant alien worlds citizens are dying for us

Just eighteen years old, itâs always been my dream
To take my place among themâ¦ citizens are dying for us

Dying for us
Citizens are fighting
Dying for us
Citizens are fighting, dying for us

Citizens are fighting, dyingâ¦

Dying for us
Citizens are fighting
Dying for us
Citizens are fighting, dying for us
