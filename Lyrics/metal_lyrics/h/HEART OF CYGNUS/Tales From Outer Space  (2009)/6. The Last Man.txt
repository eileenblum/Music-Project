Itâs beautiful, a world so far away
But itâs dark and cold out here in space
And Iâm all alone

Awakening from the long journey home
My mission done, how the light years had flown
And I couldnât wait to tell the world that Iâd found our new home

Then the message came, sent years ago
Of the final war, when all was lost, and now Iâm on my own
And I donât know what to doâ¦
Lord, take me home.
