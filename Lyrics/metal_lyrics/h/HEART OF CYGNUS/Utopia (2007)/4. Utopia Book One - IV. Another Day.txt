Another day, just like yesterday
Just putting in my time
Nobody seems to notice anyway
They can't see inside
But does it matter, Alexander?

They'll tell you how to live, what to think, and what to dream
Till you feel like you're a small cog in some massive machine
Where you live, who you love, every thought you're thinking of
Doesn't matter...

Every night its the same scene
I dream that I can fly
And though nobody will believe me
I know I have to try
But does it matter, Alexander?

They'll tell you what they think you should feel and what is real
But the cut is just too deep, like a wound that doesn't heal
And you try to deny all the pain you feel inside
'Til nothing matters...

You don't even know where it is that you're going...
Yeah, but I know I have to try
Do you think you could live on never knowing?
No, I gotta find the other side

Alexander
Does it matter?
Alexander
You gotta wake up inside...
