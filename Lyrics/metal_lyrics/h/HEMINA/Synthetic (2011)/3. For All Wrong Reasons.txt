[Skene]

For all wrong reasons
Struggling to find identity
Iâve seen each passing season
The basis for my calamity

Oh , Iâve stolen things
Ah, Iâve fought and Iâve killed
There, Have I proved my worth now?
This, itâs all that Iâve known

Oh, weâve circled in rings
Ah, weâve bashed the young kids
There, Iâve proved my worth now
This, to earn your respect
To become a we â to fit right in

[Solo: Skene]
