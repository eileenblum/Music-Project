[Coull, Eltakchi, Skene]

Transcends the known realm
Like angels birthed from hell
Life takes you by the helm
Myself, my soul â you dwell

Itâs yearning to see the light of day
Because of you
Iâm willing to fight to show that I love you
They say all is fair in love and war
Even in Heaven
No one exceeds, not even meets
All that is you

Match made to compliment
Assailed by you, I fell
Our limits I resent
Of relished fears you tell

You wear my heart on your sleeve
Its weight you will relieve
Risk brings reward, so share our common fool

[Solo: Eltakchi]
[Solo: Skene]

I only ever had eyes for you!
Every night in my dreams, I see you there
Blinding my rightâ¦

No one exceeds, not even meets
Even in Heaven
