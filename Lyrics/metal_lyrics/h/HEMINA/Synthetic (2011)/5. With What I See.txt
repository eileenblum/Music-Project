[Coull]

Fight or Flight
Emotions I donât know about
Escaped my world
The one that fate paved out for me
Guilt for leaving mother
But her ways I canât defend
She vested herself in him
For her life I would descend

Whereâs he now?

With what I see
The safety of my family
It was my mother and me
Starved of a paternity
All I ever wanted
Was a woman by my side
I think Iâve finally found her
With what I see she looks fine to me

Patiently,
I visit home of yesteryears
The fragile devout lady
And her two-bit mountain sanctuary
To sate my growing hunger;
To assure her Iâm still there
With what I see
She doesnât even care
