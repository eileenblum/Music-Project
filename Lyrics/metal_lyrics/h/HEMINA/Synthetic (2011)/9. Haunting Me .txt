[Coull, Skene]

I was born and raised
Not the ideal son
Simply lifeâs caesarian
A scar thatâs left to heal
The endâs the only way
Iâd learned how all move on
But if nothingâs really there
Itâs haunting me

Is this all Iâll be
Old, alone, cold and scared
Is this all I am?
Haunt me

Torn from the skin
Of a woman without sin
Only left to be
This hollow shell
And if death is not the end?
Iâll be with her again
With nothing left to see
Itâs haunting me!

Is this all Iâll be
Old, alone, cold and scared
Is this all am?
Haunt me, haunt me
Itâs haunting me!

[Harmony Solo: Coull &amp; Skene]

Is this all Iâll be
Old, alone?
Is this all am?
Haunt me, haunt me
Itâs haunting me!
