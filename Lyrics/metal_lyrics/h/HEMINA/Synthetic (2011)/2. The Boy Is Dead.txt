[Skene]

[Solo: Eltakchi]

He will die
She doesnât know yet
He wants no lies

Have not a friend
More than that which I deserve?
I was defied
Woken from my celestial bed
I was a martyr inside my head
Banish me to here!

He will die
She doesnât know
What heâll become

Itâs quiet, itâs easy
If you donât believe
And you wonât, trust meâ¦

Pious, servant, so sure you
Banished me to here

Know my tale
My scripture, my war
The boy is dead

[Solo: Coull]

Now you know
Now we know
The boy is dead
But his limbs still grow
A man is here
Taunted and tested
The simplest of childhoods?
âGod plays with his best!â

Lifeâs little pleasures like
Shuffling in sand
The gift of a soul
Left youth contraband
His voice of a stranger
Known better than my own
His bidding and judgement
Left me overthrown
