[Solo: Eltakchi]

Like awakening from some lonesome rift
These bones know not of friendship
Iâm a pilferer, No Iâm not, Iâm a liar
Just show my name lit up in lights!

So take a glimpse and have a peer
At the pressure on this humble man
Hear the smashes of glass
Hear the shackles bind him
To the flashing van

Itâs a feeling thatâs inside
A mutuality to find
If this is what one really is
Mother was right

Save your prayers for me
A petty thief, a vagabond
And now to find a friend
If I am how he made me;

A crowned jewel, a baby in a golden basket
Iâm an angel without wings
Find my friend

Like a pigeon to the plague
My mind already made
Just a virgin boy so shy
Who fell at the sight of green eyes

Itâs a feeling thatâs inside
A mutuality to find
And if she closed her eyes sheâd see
Her angel lies in meSave your prayers for me
A petty thief, a vagabond
And now to find a friend
If I am how he made me;
A caged fool, an arrow with no direction
Iâm an angel without wings
Find my friend

If you could turn to me
Then we could share this all
If you would turn to me
Then we could share this all
If you could turn to me
The we could shareâ¦

[Harmony Solo: Coull &amp; Skene]

Lying under stars with you
Lying on the sand with you
Be my angel, show me I can feel
We escaped my life, now this starts our war
Be my wife, crash me on the shore
Be the friend I never needed more
And make the son weâll never love more

Save your prayers for me
A petty thief or your soulmate
Iâm an angel with his wings
Found my friendâ¦

[Harmony Solo: Coull &amp; Skene]

Release me from the cold
And let me learn to love
I live each day in shadow
You sad excuse for divinity!
Let meâ¦
I finally found my friend
