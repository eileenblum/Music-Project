[Harmony Solo: Coull &amp; Skene]

Welcome home
It smells nice
I remember the scent of the gardens
You planted here
I was the seed
Planted in the flesh of old
Where is my mother?
Iâm meeting her here

Itâs yearning to see the light of day
So answer me
Was willing to die to show her
Your boy is here
Show me the door to the holy place
Where divine fears are shed

Welcome home
Iâve been here
The walls are so reminiscent
The photo frames too
Is my father here with us now?
Oh no, thatâs not right
The purest and good die young
Iâm back to where Iâve begun

Itâs yearning to see the light of day
So answer me
Was willing to die to show her
Your boy is here
Wasnât I born in this holy place
Where divine children are led?
Meet my only true friends
Birth and Deathâ¦

Certainty unfolds
Goodbye life of old
Son and Wife were sold
To have my questions answered
Offered them a home
One that fit the mould
Show my mother how I loved them!
Just hope my prayers were answered

What is divine?
God only knows
Whatâs Divine
God only knows!

Why did she die?
And why was I born?
You gave me a friend
But it was too late
Show me your face
And answer for my life
This life was synthetic
And that was your fatal flaw
That was your fatal flaw

[Harmony Solo: Coull &amp; Skene]

Show me your face
And answer for my life
This life was synthetic
And that was your fatal flaw
I read of your looks in books
I knew your voice so well
Angels are perfect?
A halo â no match for a gun

[Solo: Coull]

Welcome home, I grew up here
The walls are so reminiscent
The photo frames too
The pastures through the windows glisten
My answer is here
A golden mirror baron
In the greenest of fields

Itâs yearning to see the light of day
So welcome me
Was willing to die to find out
Why is clear
Why was I born on the earth?
Weâre puppets left to bleed?
Please come out to play
Iâve already paved the way

From this glance, a lonesome beam
Primes the inner one
Reflectionâs cast, the mind to yield
The face is me

And from where I stand, this mirror before me
With what I see â my synthetic destiny
