[Skene]

Family, Gather round
This rustic trip was surely made for us
To take life is precious
Or so they say
To make it is natural
To end it, divine
Or so they say

Find your target, donât lose sight
Grip the handle oh so tight
Shoulders straight and if done right
Hunt your prey in full flight
That is not the only way
People make the choice to stay
She didnât have that chance
To hell with this, I pave my way!

Two of us, two of us, two of us
Made one of him

Three of us, three of us, three of us
Killed wolves and deer

One of him, one of him, one of him
Made everything?
Add it up!

Find your target, donât lose sight
Grip the handle oh so tight
Shoulders straight and if done right
Hunt your prey in full flight
That is not the only way
People make the choice to stay
Think of the son and think of the wife
To hell with this, I pave my way!

[Solo: Skene]

Iâm sorry, my son
For leaving my wife
Blame it on him, blame it on me
She opened our tent to find me being divine
And as quick as she came, she turned the blind eye

Iâm sorry, my son
for leaving this life
Youâll thank me for this
Your forehead, I kiss
So Iâm taking both barrels
Theyâre on my back now
I was no prize game
But Iâll lay on the pack

Jabbed into my ribs
Shoot through the bile
Just another beast on the pile
