[Coull, Eltakchi, Skene]

You ask me these questions
Iâve asked myself for years
After all this to find
This saviour of mine a peer
Down dangled cord of feather
As the bellows of Jacob sung
Bidded, I climb each tattered rung

Is this home?
Is this heavenâs gift to man?
Make me a child, rid me a father
Rid me a man!

To emerge from this flesh, to be born
To violate law â to be unplanned
Why me?

Fresh faced, bright eyed; a believer
A follower of yours beaten to the ground
Her blouse fell to the floor
Before she could let out her roar
I stumbled upon this universe
Itâs catered and fit for me
Its beauty Iâm yet to see

[Harmony Solo: Coull &amp; Eltakchi]

Blood and puss coat these walls
And Iâm ripped out with a glove
Was I plucked out by the one above?
Or just a product of this rape?

[Solo: Eltakchi]

What is this place you call my home?
You call this my home, what is this place?!
