Romance was not manifest
Candor; a lesson learned that

Reaching out has always brought me pain
Whilst darkened thoughts lead to an early grave
You waved goodbye and bought a one way ticket out from
My loss
All earth's light could never feel my loss

I want to thank you for sparing me
The years or empty hope strung
along for what seemed like a legacy

Your face is tightly etched into my mind
Like scar-tissued caligraphy

[Outro solo: Coull]
