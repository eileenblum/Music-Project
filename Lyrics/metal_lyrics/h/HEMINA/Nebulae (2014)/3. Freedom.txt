Set the masses free
And destroy minority
The slate will be wiped clean
And the world will sing of Freedom

Sacrifice control
Worlds will renew

Juggling the options obscuring the view
For thousands have always plundered the few
But what could make this change?
Freedom, is just an arm's length away
