Marching out on the town tonight and standing tall
I picked you out from across the room in this white light, so bright
Come back to mine tonight and we can work it out, lay it out
I catch a whiff of your scent and that porcelain skin
Oh, it reels me in!

Please let down your silk robe softly
And take your rightful place in front of me
My love for you is just consentual lust

Marching out on the town tonight still standing tall
Your shape overwhelms me, I can't breathe, I can't sleep (I can't sleep, I can't sleep)
I've been through women before but I have never ever felt this at all
You're under fire from all of my lust (from all this lust)
Come back to mine tonight and we can work it out, again and again!

Please let down your silk robe gently
And take your rightful place in front of me
My love for you is just consentual lust

[Solo: Skene]

Please let down your silk robe sexually
And take your rightful place in front of me
My love for you is just consentual lust

Lusting for you...
