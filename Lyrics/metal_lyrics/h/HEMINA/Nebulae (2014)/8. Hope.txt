[Solo: Coull]

From the rubble of hardened steel rain
A starfield of wonder awaits
The nebulous warmth of a world far away
The legend where all hope is born
I'm with you my son and I'm with you my girl
The palace where freedom awaits
The nebulous warmth of a world far away
The heaven I've dreamt of is sworn

My world a sphere of ice
And me its cold insides
Stars warm my heart
The distant nebulae
I hope...
Regaining hope to reignite the pilot light
I hope to one day find me

From the wreckage of fusion-faced worlds
A cosmos of promise awaits
The beckoning dust of a world worlds away
The legend where all hope is born
I'm with you my son and I'm with you my girl
Our palace where freedom awaits
The beckoning dust of a world worlds away
The heaven that glimmers today

[Solo: Coull]

Hope to me is a place I can't explain
I bathe in its light, my child, my love
Feel through me, a place I can't explain
Bathe in its light, oh hope is my dream!

I hope to one day find the answers
Why I'm here, answer me
I hope to one day find the answers
That live inside me...
