A hidden trail that opens up a world
One like no other; free of the bounds that rule

Turn your back on something perfect
Promised me forever only to lose this

Through the wormhole and rise to another frame
Frame of reference free of a world of blame

The broken pathway, the road one should never take
Safety first or last? Depends which game we play

Is this happiness or is it hate? Tell me!
Make up your mind, itâs too late? Iâm telling you

Reach down inside and realise what youâve lost
Itâs simple to find, if youâve even got a heart?

You strung me along over this, over
him?!
You strung me along through this
nightmare!

Your turmoil and false-will will be your eventual demise
Your reality and grasp on life â Iâll never sympathize
Your wrongdoings now define you when youâre down from your high kite ride
Youâll not have my remorse
my love or my life

Iâll cross the mountain
You built for me
Your being ephemeral?
Iâll rise ethereal
Nightfall!

We meet in this dim light
Youâre judged on the pain you dealt
Your being, trivial
Iâll rise as night falls
Stand tall!

You cower in the corner
You sob to reel me in
Your being, simply gone
Iâll rise otherworldy

Sliding down, Slipping
Swimming in light, Itâs warm
When I open my eyes, Lights are out
when itâs cold, Black windows
and dampness.
My head is throbbing
it hurts me, I want it to stop
I hated myself
chunks of thorns and dreams
tear my heart away, it bleeds
tear myself away
why do i want these things that cannot be?
Why does it hurt so much
I smashed all the mirrors in the house
Little silvery pieces
I close my eyes, and I want to see light
I want to see light
I want to see light...
