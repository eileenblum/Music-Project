I embrace loneliness with a withered smile
All this sadness in my life will never take me higher
Torment and terror plague my mind
Thoughts slip away like petals from wilted rose

I try to conjure up the courage to face my fear
But I sit there hour after hour
Shadows stir me with the fact that all that once was joy
Has abandoned its fate to leave me in despair

And then it happens, I see you
I float on purity
I breathe again
For the first time (Melting the Ice that once dominated me)

The sun rises through murky clouds
Transparent is my soul through its smile
beams of gold pass through my body
The violent sounds turn to sweet melody
Life has finally caught up with me

I head to unseen waters
Toward a light that is lovingly familiar
A figure glimmers in the distant sunset
The me I'd dreamed of with a little more strength

Before I knew that I could leave it all I'd longed for
Each day with head in hands seemed like eternity
I thought true love would make it easy if we played our parts
Two souls hovering, floating, gliding for a counterpart

And then it happens, I see you
I float on purity
I breathe Again
For the first time and the last time
And then it happens, I see you
Into obscurity
I breath Again
For the first time (Melting the ice that once dominated me)

[Solo: Coull]
