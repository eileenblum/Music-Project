[Harmony solo: Skene &amp; Coull]

Promise me you'll try eternally
I need someone who will grow

I'm not with you just for now
Paint me something grander
So I can dream on...

Gaze into the stream, see the potential inside
And look behind the eyes and into the soul that veils your thinly clad strides
Unwillingly sacrifice your drive to move forth!
What is it you fear?
