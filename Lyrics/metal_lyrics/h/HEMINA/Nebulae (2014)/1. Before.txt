Before I knew that I could leave it all I'd longed for
Each day with head in hands seemed like eternity

I thought true love would make it easy if we played our parts
Two souls hovering, floating, gliding for a counterpart

I imagined hell to be like this except with a little more fire
It takes no brains to work this out
Free me before we die...
