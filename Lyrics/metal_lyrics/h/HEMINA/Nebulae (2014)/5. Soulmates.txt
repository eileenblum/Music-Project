You opened up the door and welcomed me so shyly
A mass of fringe; strawberry tinged and then I knew you
Though perhaps naively you defined a girl to me
All through my teens sans self-esteem, I waited long...

At first I didn't know what this was or could be
But now I'm sure you are the one who holds me tightly
Walking together, growing strong
Amidst this void we found our call

Settle, I had not
For all I dreamed of, I'd got
Though some may claim it's fabled
Tell that to my wife!

Will I ever live my life in a lifetime
With a lioness to share my pride and goals
And I found her from the others
There's a siren in the darkness
With nothing else to be seen
She is all that is there
Her love in the dark
Her laugh is the lightning
She's the only one I call my soulmate

An unlikely pair; fire and earth
The stars would scoff at us, if we dare
An innocent friendship, the start of Him and Her
But I refuse to have my life spelled out
Only we knew what was missing

Only we can make us whole
And I can trust you only
I believe you may indeed be my soulmate
