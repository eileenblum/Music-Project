Like awaking from some lonesome rift
These bones know not of friendship
I'm a pilferer, No I'm not, I'm a liar
Just show my name lit up in lights!

So take a glimpse and have a peer
At the pressure on this humble man
Hear the smashes of glass, hear the shackles
Bind him to the flashing van

It's a feeling that's inside
A mutuality to find
If this is what one really is
Mother was right

Save your prayers for me
A petty thief, a vagabond
And now to find a friend
If I am how he made me;
A crowned jewel, a baby in golden basket
I'm an angel without wings
Find my friend

Like a pigeon to the plague
My mind already made
Just a virgin boy so shy
Who fell at the sight of green eyes

It's a feeling that's inside
A mutuality to find
And if she closed her eyes she'd see
Her angel lies in me

Save your prayers for me
A petty thief, a vagabond
And now to find a friend
If I am how he made me;
A caged fool, an arrow with no direction
I'm angel without wings
Find my friend

Lying under stars with you
Lying on the sand with you
We escaped my life, now this starts our war
Be my wife, crash me on the shore
Be the friend I never needed more
And make the son we'll never love more

Save your prayers for me
A petty thief or your soul mate
I'm an angel with his wings
Found my friend
