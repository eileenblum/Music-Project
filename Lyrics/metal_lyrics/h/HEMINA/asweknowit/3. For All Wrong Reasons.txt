For all wrong reasons
Struggling to find identity
I've seen each passing season
The basis for my calamity

Oh, I've stolen things
Ah, I've fought and I've killed
There, Have I proved my worth now?
This, it's all that I've known

For all wrong reasons
Struggling to find identity
I've seen each passing season
The basis for my calamity

Oh, we've circled in rings
Ah, we've bashed the young kids
There, I've proved my worth now
This, to earn your respect, to become a we - to fit right in

For all wrong reasons
Struggling to find identity
I've seen each passing season
The basis for my calamity
