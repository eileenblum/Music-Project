Fight or Flight
Emotions I don't know about
Escaped my world
The one that fate paved out for me
Guilt for leaving mother
But her ways I can't defend
She vested herself in him
For her life I would descend

Where's he now?

With what I see
The safety of my family
'Twas only mother and me
Starved of a paternity
All I ever wanted
Was a woman by my side
I think I've finally found her
With what I see she looks fine to me

Patiently,
I visit home of yesteryears
The fragile devout lady
And her two-bit mountain sanctuary
To sate my growling hunger;
To assure her I'm still there
With what I see
She doesn't even care

With what I see
The safety of my family
'Twas only mother and me
Starved of a paternity
All I ever wanted
Was a woman by my side
I think I've finally found her
With what I see she looks fine to me

With what I see
The safety of my family
'Twas only mother and me
Starved of a paternity
All I ever wanted
Was a woman by my side
I think I've finally found her
With what I see she looks fine to me
