Iâm runninâ out of lies
Iâm runninâ out of chances
I think we need a break
We both need new romances

Donât treat me like a fool
Or unleash the sleeping fury
Iâm just messinâ with the truth
You will always be a part of me

My passion for you
Was like burning of the sun
But love is like a wind
It needs to run
Iâm playing a dead manâs hand
Now the damage is done

But I know you love to hate â me
For all the things Iâve done
And I know that itâs too late â to change
Where did we go wrong?

Melodramatic fools
On a highway going nowhere
A ghost town in my heart
With a handful of memories to share
Deserted in the heat
Left in the frozen ashes
Abandoned in the fields
A loner without heartbeat
