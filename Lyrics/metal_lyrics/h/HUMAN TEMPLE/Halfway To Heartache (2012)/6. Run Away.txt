As I sat alone that night
Something dived in to my mind
Iâve always been a dreamer
When I lay down I close my eyes
I sense you nearbut you donât mind
I need to keep you safe and awake

My heart is on the run
Youâre playinâ tricks with my mind
I turn to you
Youâre close to me
Knowing youâll never know

Run away, runaway
Canât you see thereâs a world on fire
Run away, runaway
That stranger was the one I desire

Wasted nights and wasted days
Always something more to say
But whereâs the fire
Burning in our hearts
Hard to say were said and done
But love is like a loaded gun
The waterâs getting higher all the time
