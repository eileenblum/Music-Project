Out on the streets
Our children cry
No one cares
If an old man dies
All hope is gone
Our paradise lost
What have we done
To the ones we love most

We all regret some things weâve done
But itâs not too late
No, the faithâs not gone
Just ask from me
And Iâll show you the way
To the house of my father
Where we wait for that day

We just keep on destroying
And fighting against our brother
Why donât we understand itâs not the way
That was meant by our father

Hold on â Iâll give you anything
To live for
Love changes everything
Anâ move on â I live and die for you
Cause we know
Love changes everything

Last nigh I had a dream about the place
We all lived under a saving grace
But thatâs not the truth
By wasting our time
Ones after us suffer
Of what we left behind
