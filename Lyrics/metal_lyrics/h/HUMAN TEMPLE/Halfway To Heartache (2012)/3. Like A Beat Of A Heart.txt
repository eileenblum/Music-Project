Too young to die
Yet not old enough to say goodbye
And in her eyes
Iâve seen the pain of a lifetime
One step away
And you never find your way back home
And deep inside
She knows her innocenceâs gone

Too much those youâs and meâs
Too late for apologies

Hear me calling
Like a beat of a heart
Hear me crying
Your name in the dark
Why does it feel like
Hell is living without you
Hell is living without you

So lost and lonely
Only love can show her the way
By taking the wrong track
Weâll never see the light of the day
And still she waits for
Another beautiful sunrise
And still she calls
For me to see through her lies

Never enough to give
Only she knows were sheâs been
