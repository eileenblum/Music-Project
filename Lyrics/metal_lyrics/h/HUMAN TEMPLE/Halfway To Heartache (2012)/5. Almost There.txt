Heading out to the highway
With the weight of the world
In our backs
Just a two beautiful dreamers
Tryinâ to stay on the tracks
When the sun came up from the distance
We saw the streets of gold
Didnât know our hearts will be broken
In a fallen angels town

Catalina sunset behind our backs
Halfway to paradise
Weâre gonna make it last

We were there
We were almost there
But in the night
We had to say goodbye

Thereâs a reason for every heartache
And a reason why people donât stay
In the middle of the fire
When thereâs nothing left to say
Just around the corner
There might be a second chance
Though they try to put us under
Weâre the last ones to stand
