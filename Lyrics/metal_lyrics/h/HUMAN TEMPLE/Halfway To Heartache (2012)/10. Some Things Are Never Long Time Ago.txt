40 days and 40 nights
Iâm tired of waiting
If thereâs no end in sight
Empty bed anâ heavy heart
Counting the hours
I was a fool from the start

Take a good look at my face and you see
Damage is done and itâs real
Lifetime of pain
Is the price that you pay
So fight for the feeling

Without you
I am nothing
Iâm just an empty shell
Without you
I have nothing
No stories of love to tell

Deep in the darkness
I saw a warning sign
Hollow answers
Of a twisted mind
Weâre only wasting
Our precious time
So letâs go our own ways
And it will be alright
