I donât wanna talk about it
I donât wanna hear what you say
How you find yourself another one
Accusing me of what may come
Iâll never be your shadow
I wonât come in to your way
Cause Iâve found a love of my own
And a place that I can call my home

I donât really care about the games you play
Look in to my eyes
Canât you see these tears are real
Iâm crying

Then she told me âbout the angels
And of love thatâs untrue
But I never noticed in my life
That my savior was you
I donât care about tomorrow
All I need is one night
To hear you in the darkness
And see the lovelight in your eyes

I had myself believinâ
Iâd carry the weight of the world
I was blind for a long, long time
But truthâs like bird, it needs to fly
With this hand on my heart
I swear by all that is sacred
If Iâm not a man enough for you
We find out what true love can do

Like a morning light you came in to my life
And this feeling inside
Makes me cry out your name
