Have you seen a holy man
Have you heard about his plan
To rule the world a thousand years
He donât practice what they preach
Guns were fired in the streets
In the name of higher grace

Come on closer
Leave the dark behind you
Iâll keep you safe in my heart

You donât have to say you need me
You donât have to say you care
We can share this night together
And Iâll follow you one day

Making promises for man
But they never understand
Itâs hard to tame
The seven seas
Spirit is forever free
Come with me and you will see
Iâll take you to the
Land of dreams

Try to slow down
But weâre still running
Take my hand we will survive
