Is there anybody out there
Who walks just like my lady
She was the only one in my world
But there was too many maybes

That girl
Made them all believe in love
She took my heart from her hand
Broken, why do I never learn
Good things they all keep me waiting

Turning in the night
Standing in the light
Dreaminâ it could last forever
But something in your eyes
Not so hypnotized
Made me realize thereâs better

And I, Iâll never be the one
Who will cry for you
Who would die for you
And I, I will never break my heart
Again my love, cause weâre through
Because of you

Hear me, I could never let you go
Iâll be a light in your shadow
One thing, knowing that youâre never mine
Itâs driving me crazy
