Sometimes you just gotta give
Turn around and do the trick
But you donât have to lie to me anymore
Walkinâ down the lonely streets
Caught up in the cheapy sheets
Burning anger fills up
With your shameful heart

What if he lets you down
What if he slaps you in the face
Who will you run to when youâre done

Misery
Born to lose forever
Love machine
Heading for the street of dreams

Fallen angel dressed in black
Shut your mouth donât turn your back
There will never be another choice for you
Heâs the man he tells to you
Youâre a woman thatâs the truth
Helping hands wonât never reach
That far again
