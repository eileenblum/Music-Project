Under the sun, there stands a broken man.
Sending the rage, deep from his heart he cries.
Some say he knows too much of everything,
losing the faith no more these days to live.

[Bridge:]
I'm sending, an' feeling, I'm forever dreamin'
this time I will be on your side.

[Chorus:]
Kings and the slaves, the price that you need to pay.
Forever one, Judas my brother...

Down fallen star, he now needs to stand so still,
nowhere to go, he walked through the darkest world.
Seen all the times, the ages of love and war.
Soul flies away, the empty man feels the end.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
