I'm a man on the run, burning my bridges down.
Never recognized the things that the others found.
An' the lesson I've learned you have to stay with the one you love.
Don't ever give up, don't ever let it go.

[Bridge:]
You know I have to beg you on my knees,
and pray for mercy till' I bleed,
but I have to know that you're not saying goodbye..

[Chorus:]
So leave the light on by the window,
I wont be chasing no more shadows, after all,
I'm going all the way.
And when I have to leave remember,
I'll always be there for you girl,
after all, I'm going all the way.

I was wrong again, I took a trip to the lane of lies.
But you know the truth, you know me from deep inside.
This time I swear I'm coming home and I will stay.
Let's turn out the lights and blow the world away.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge]
