Candlelight, it burns my eyes,
hear my call when I'm slipping through the times of love,
an' times of war, loneliness has been a friend of mine.
It's not your voice that calls me, calls me...

[Chorus:]
" Feel my dreams, like leaves from the trees
I have seen it all before in the fire.
Cold of the night, fades away all the light,
but I'm still sleeping here in the fire..."

Moonlight, is on my side,
a child of night I am the lonely one who loves,
who knows the truth, a clairvoyant of the new millennium.
It's not your voice that calls me, calls me...

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
