Feel me in your sleep, see me in your dreams.
I'm the one you really should scare babe.
I can't say this nice, I need an alibi,
someone has to cover me while I'm eatin' your head,
I'll sleep in your bed...

[Chorus:]
Animal. animal...

Red burning eyes, blood will paint the sky,
I make the rules, and you just shut up.
A bullet in your back, you feel me when I stab,
I'll come to you an' tear out your heart,
you're breaking apart.

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
