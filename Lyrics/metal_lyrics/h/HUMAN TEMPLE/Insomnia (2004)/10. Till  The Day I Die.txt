She was lonely again last night, but she wasn't there alone.
There was someone in her bed she cried, to me on the phone.
I'll be waiting you all my life, I promised you years ago.
You can never find the one with the way you take them home.

[Bridge:]
From the bottom of my heart, I cried for her to stay.
But she went and left a promise, about the better days...

[Chorus:]
I sleep, when you dream, I'll be waiting for you
till the day that I die. An' you feel when I see,
I remember you girl till the day that I die.
Till the day that I die....

You can never choose the way, how to find a deep true love.
There is something waiting on that's sent from heaven above.
Every night you dream a dream there's one night less to sleep.
And the world will always go on,
no matter what's ours to keep.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
