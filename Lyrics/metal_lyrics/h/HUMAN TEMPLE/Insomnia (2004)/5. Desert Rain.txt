You could've told me that you're leaving.
Instead I waited up for you.
After days I still keep missing, all the things you used to do.

[Bridge:]
Thou' I live a million lives, I'll never find another one,
who can heal my heart.
An' then after million miles, there's million more I have to walk,
till' I find my way, find it back again...

[Chorus:]
Oohh, can you feel my desert rain.
Oohh, and my heart just feels the pain.
Oohh, in the name of that desert rain.
Oohh, just please come back someday...

All my years they have no meaning, cause I just keep waiting on.
An' my heart will beat forever, an' it sings the same old song.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
