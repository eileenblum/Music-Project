Love, only love can break your heart, put you down and tear you apart.
It can last for a lifetime or fade, in a blink of an eye.
Like a storm it crashes you down, takes you off from the ground but sometimes it's easy.
Then you know, love is real, and you should fight until the end.

[Chorus:]
Leave me tomorrow but love me today.
There's still some things that I need to say.
If you still feel like you felt before
just walk away an' close the door.

Say, all the things I want you to say, say you decided to stay
hold on to your feelings an' keep, all the bad things inside
an' then, just give me a chance, for a second romance an' see I was
made for you. It ain't wrong, together we're strong,
an' we'll fight until the end.

[Chorus]
