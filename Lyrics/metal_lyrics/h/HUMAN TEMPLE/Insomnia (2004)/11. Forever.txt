I was so wrong, in things I have done.
And maybe I'm not sure this time, about this crazy little feeling inside.
Too hard to say, when two hearts break, it's always something very bad, so sad,
that I don't even wanna say.

[Chorus:]
But then you came into my life and led me to your door.
I've never felt this way before.
And through the years and rainy nights I'll be there by your side.
This time I know..it's forever.

And when she cries, just like a child. I have to hold her in my arms an' tell her,
there's nothing stronger than my love. This time I swear, I send a prayer.
I hope the world wont crush us down like it has done,
at least thousand times before.

[Chorus]
[Solo]
