I walk alone, these empty streets, a glimpse of pain in every face that I see.
Dream again, dream of me, I came to you I'm the man in your dreams.
If it's forever, don't tell me lies, I'll always see the truth in your eyes.
A trip to heaven, that's life with you,
and once you promised that you lead us through.

[Bridge:]
And if I ever do, I do those things for you,
only for you, and sometimes, only sometimes I'm awake...

[Chorus:]
Walk between the shadows, try to never cross the line.
Feel the arms of stranger, reachin' through this heart of mine...

Fly away, fantasy, you'll find in every little thing in me.
Win some, you lose some, love is always like a loaded gun.
What goes around, comes around, in the end you'll always hit the ground.
Why don't you tell me, who's the one, game is over and it's time to run.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
