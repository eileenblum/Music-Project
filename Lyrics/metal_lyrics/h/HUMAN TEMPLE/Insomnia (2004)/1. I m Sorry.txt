One of these days I'm gonna say what
I really feel inside.
I have to get these wheels on the road again.
I feel I've stayed too long but you don't understand,
there's a world outside an' it's screamin' out my name.

[Bridge:]
I don't expect you to understand, you're just a woman.
So I make it real easy, just watch me when I go.

[Chorus:]
I'm sorry but I'm not gonna love you forever,
I'm caught between two women and their lies.
I didn't mean to hurt you but this is the last goodbye,
just like you before, I'm walking away...

From the start there was something wrong deep in our hearts,
we both knew it but we didn't want to see.
Two hearts together always meant to be, yeah right,
I wanna see how you make it work.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]
