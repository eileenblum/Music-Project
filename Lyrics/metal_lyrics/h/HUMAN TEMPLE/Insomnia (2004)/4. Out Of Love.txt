I live in the shadows, and wait for the dawn.
I dream in colors, think of you when you are gone.
I'm losing the daylight, and keep losing you.
I live for the hunger, an' die by the truth.

[Bridge:]
I'm runnin' around in this circle of lies
everyday a part of me just dies.
I think of those nights when I held you close,
an' cry myself to death that I chose.

Just leave me a memory, and I'll always be there.
I loved you a lifetime, you put me thru' hell

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
Out of love, an' out of danger.
Out of touch, without the strangers...out of love...

I'm getting to nowhere, if I'm not with you,
my home's where the heart is, and I'll find it soon.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
