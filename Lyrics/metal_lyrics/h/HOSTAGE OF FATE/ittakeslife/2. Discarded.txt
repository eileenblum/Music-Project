How could you ever leave the man that would have never leave you?
This discarded love, where all the gods of the world were ashamed in burying it
Fuck you death, Iâve never felt so alive
When you came knocking on our door
I hope you truly understand
Donât ever try to kill the spirit of this one fucking man
To bring back the wings I once promised you
To bring back life on the trail you deserve
To trust your abilities, scream
Fuck you, I will never fall again.
You told me to leave you, alone in your world
A world that was the best part of mine
You will not burn your heart, but rather
Every piece of your mind
