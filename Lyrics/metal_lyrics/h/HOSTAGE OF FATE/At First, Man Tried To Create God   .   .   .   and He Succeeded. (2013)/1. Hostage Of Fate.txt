Itâs when you feel, that nothingâs worth
To decide which path you will follow through
This life, your dreams, in the fire thrown
Save yourself, save what is true

In life things are fragile
In life you must accept the fact
That you are trapped, youâre doomed, you are
Hostage of Fate

Memories you hold to throughout your life
Turn them into something that will stand in time

When your life will come to embrace the end
Smile at the sun now, death is your friend

One day remember, you will cease to exist
Again to nothing, case dismissed
Life comes with small fragments, is up to you to build her
