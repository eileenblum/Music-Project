Terror grips your heart, the sky turns from blue to black
Stand in line, its kill or die
Everything seems like a dream, from which you cannot wake up

How can you ever cover up the shame of war?

Fear takes full control, on top of the dead you crawl
A starving body, an empty mind

In blood you take your last breath, in war thereâs only death
Death to the scum who first decides war.
