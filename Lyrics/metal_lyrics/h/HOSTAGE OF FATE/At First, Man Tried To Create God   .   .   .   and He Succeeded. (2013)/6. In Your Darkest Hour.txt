Father forgive me for my sins
Iâm watching the world burn
I let everything slip from my fingertips
Angels are watching, the land filled with pain
A world stripped of hope and our dreams trapped by fate

In your darkest hour, remember the promise you made
To not let hope fade

Angels are chanting, from the skies high above
The hymn of humanityâs fall
So what will you do?
To embrace life,
Will you step forward?
Or will you just wait to die?
