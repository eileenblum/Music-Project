To feel old in your prime,
To become what you despise
The world crashed Atlas spine
He let go the weight
Crushed under the heavy blue of the sky
To give importance to all this precious time
A time you could not afford
Iâm witnessing the world
Crashing Atlas Spine
Atlas, what will it take?
I feel you suffer and you wonât feel mine
Atlas
Stand up
