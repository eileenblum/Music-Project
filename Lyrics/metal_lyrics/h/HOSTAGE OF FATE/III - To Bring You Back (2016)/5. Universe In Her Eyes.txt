Anger of the human race, manifested
I risked it all, to bring you back
And then I never stood so alone
Trying some of your pain to bare
Trying to understand, unlike anything before
Unlike any other time, unlike any other fucking man
To bring you back.
And as hope was lost for humanity
Blessed by the One Grand Reality
Blessed to witness all the spectacles
Of the Universe in Her Eyes
To bring you back.
