A bottomless pit, I searched in the abyss
I fucked that abyss straight to the brain and into your heart
I swore on the shadows of trees cast out from a fake manmade fucking light
That oath turned to nothing, was it all another manmade fucking lie
I almost had it, I dove inside the dream
Thrown out and into the fire
For what is worth, if we don't die
Side by side
