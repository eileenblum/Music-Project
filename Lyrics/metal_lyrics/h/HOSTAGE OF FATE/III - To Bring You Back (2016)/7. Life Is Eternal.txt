If you decide to live again
Remember
If you decide to stand up again
At least try to remember
When you accept the will of fate
Remember
When you will and will face, face to face the pain
Do not forget
I discovered alone the cure
For almost all of my diseases
The path was simple
Best eternal present always wins
Fear is a reflex and confidence a choice
What can you think when you stare at me with those eyes
I will crush your feeble heart
Cover mine with its veins
I will drop dead the sun
And on its light Iâll bathe
