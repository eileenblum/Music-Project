An action that would never get undone 
I drive my corpse through black from the rust nails 
Unpurposely, forever 

On her Deathbed, before the end 
She told me how disgusting i was 

Will things fall into place? Here and now, all that is 
In silence they scream, in silence they die 
Let it be and life would never be the same.
