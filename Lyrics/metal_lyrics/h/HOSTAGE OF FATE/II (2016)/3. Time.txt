Words came out, like the river that searches for that one ocean to cleanse its waters 
Meaningless for some 
A man killed a lion today and on his flesh, he carved the word "death" 
Hypocrite, delusion 
It comes in and out, deepening it more, more and more 
Is it something that you enjoy and drives your every desire? 

Time, this search of you and mine.
