Reminding me of the things i cannot have, 
Is neither greed or gluttony, rather than a sincere fucking wish 
Of a man 

Ten thousand millions of millions of tons 
Purest form of energy to pulverize 
I'll fucking break your atoms 

Human, take off the corpse, Longinus Spear 
Why don't you stop 
after all we are all just stardust.
