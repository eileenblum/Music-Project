Stuck in a blank state of mind, 
Torn between the universes 
When did you last call for help? 
When was the last time, where your knees met the earth? 
And your prayers from a deaf god never heard. 

Demanding the impossible, a sparrow makes it last journey 
The sky cannot be reached. 
Skydive, until the planet's core is breached. 

It burns, it makes my lungs want to crash my bones 

Care, in moments of silence, screams silent 
If heard, would have break the sky in half 
and the sun in pieces.
