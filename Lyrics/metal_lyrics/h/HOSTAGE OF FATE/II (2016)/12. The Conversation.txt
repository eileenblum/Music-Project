Everything that we know and love 
is reducible to the absurd 
acts of chemicals and therefore there is no intrinsic value 
in this material universe. 
Hypocrite that you are, for you trust the chemicals in your brain 
to tell you they are chemicals. 
All knowledge is ultimately based on what which you cannot prove. 
So will you fight? Or will you perish like a dog?
