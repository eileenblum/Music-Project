Red and black, the colors I painted your demise 
Will you scream their name even in your death? 

With a dark shade of blue, I painted inside the still waters your rebirth 
Would you scream to your god, how you were saved from death? 

How did you let all go? 
Alone you are searching for that sky high 
Alone in the streets of marble 
Next to colorless roses 
Who beg the strangers passing by 
To bring back their blue light.
