As brothers and sisters, search hundreds and hundreds of 
thousands of miles to have the hundredth of what you so selfishly have. 

Humanity washed ashore, dead 
Underneath a shameful sun and next to a madman's heaven 

I search with barren hands, miles and miles of deep snow and ice 
Eyes get blind, ears turn deaf and hands cut off.
