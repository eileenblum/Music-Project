An ode to you 
The One, 
Most beautiful of all realities 
The One, 
Where all living beings carefully have their hopes sleeping 
Where all dreams lay with eyes closed side by side 
I pray to you, 
True, above everything and nothing, 
Reality of the real 
The One, 
I thank you with all the strength this flesh and mind can give 
For giving me the chance to exist, a chance to be. 
An ode you 
The One.
