Cacophony restraining
Itâs on their minds
Itâs on their souls
Its on the ground
This epic are about to summons
And in my eyes
The discordance on every scale and every level
Its flaming alive

Burning all remains burning
And now disease is spreading
The fear withering humans
In darkness they engulfing
Divided concealed suffering
The nation drowning in pain
The nation towards extinction
Extinctionâ¦.

Tell me can you see it?
Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you hear it?
Tell me can you stop it?

They will not regret their deeds
They will not regret their greedâs

Violenceâ¦.
Oppressionâ¦..
Carnageâ¦â¦..

Thereâs no chance that you can take
And this is what you wanted

Revengeâ¦revenge savagely
Your moralâ¦.your ordersâ¦your commandsâ¦.
Revengeâ¦revenge savagely
Your moralsâ¦your ordersâ¦your commandsâ¦..
I will defy
I will defy
I will defy your greedâs

Brokenâ¦.
My wings are broken
Your wings are broken
Broken down by human scars

As winter calls our name
My wings are broken
My wings are broken
Our wings are broken
Our wings are broken
As winter calls our name
