Burnâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦
I fix my bayonet onward to enemy frontline
I felt desire to burn
And kill everyone against me
My heart fuelled by desire to kill
And burn all kind of their flags
This is me and my bayonet
And the bloodshed shall reigns by my hands

The hands of enraging revenge
The vengeance of destroyed dreams
The endless hope of greater realm
And these hands will strike

I will be come	straight to your frontline
You better stay down in your foxhole
Cause tonight I will	I will	I will
I will come

The hands of enraging revenge
The vengeance of destroyed dreams
The endless hope of greater realm
And these hands will strike

My bayonet will be come

This is the story of fighting towards freedom
Of life, happiness, the endless hope and
Never ending dreams
I will not stop until the victory is in my hands
I will not stop until the banner of love
Waving inside my heart

My bayonet will be come
This is my bayonet

Freedom	freedom	Iâll fight for my freedom
Freedom	freedom	Iâll fight for my freedom

Bayonetâ¦this is my bayonetâ¦.

Freedom to everyone 
This is not about their politics
Its about my life	its about my family 
And people beside me
Iâll guard you	Iâll take care of you
My fellow ladies and gentlemanâs
The soldiers to the endless dreams
Weâre marching, walking, fighting, to the battleground
Tonight my bayonet will be come
