Hatred breeding on their minds
Carved on their hands
Blood of the innocents are spelled
As they praise their prides

The bloodstains and deviations
Approve your mistaken theology

The prophecy and all the myth remain nothing
The bloods and all the tears
Whispered the false misjudgments
Organized prejudice, bigotry, annihilations
Desolation conveyed their convictions

Bigots	youâre the slaves of cynical ideas
Bigots	youâre the slaves of false misjudgments
Bigots	youâre the slaves of condemned agitations
Bigots	youâre the slaves of your believes

Youâre the slaves

The flame of bigotry ablaze
Segregation outgrow
Annihilation infused
Its crawl into your hearts

Despise the holy name of love
Deceiving the purity
Losing our sanity
So cold and empty
From the passion of loving
