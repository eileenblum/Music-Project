The time reveals the anguish
The hours testify this mistake
And I yearn a glimpse of remedy
The sleepless nights paralyzed me
This eyes thrilled infidelity
The colder heart beating like a dead sirene
Those incurable lines of stories
The silence and impatient whirl
Desperation blinded like a perfect eyelids
This labyrinth consist of unfaithful words
A perfect rhyme of deflection
I fall awayâ¦â¦â¦â¦i fall away
I cut myself away from uncertainties

I cut myselfâ¦..

This draining indifference flaws into our hearts
Cut like a perfect knife of schism and delirium
Caring and hurting collides
In tradition of betrayal
Taking our hearts to an eclipse of compulsion

I cut myself from the way of uncertainties
I fall back down from the story weâve wrote
Recognition of your indecisive hesitation
Has brought me the truth
Recognition of your indecisive hesitation
Has brought me the truth

I burnâ¦..

Iâll be better by daylight
Iâll be better by daylight
I hope i willâ¦..i hope i willâ¦..

The shades of your betrayal
The infliction of my reckoning scars
Of catharsis, of sadness, of silences,
And disappointments

So weak our promises was
The love that binds with hesitation
This is the epilogue of together decadence
The collapse of vulnerable dreams

I entreat the greatest remedy
A perfect cure than your forever 
Ever glitter smile
This is my elegy
The epic of my awaking, whispering, 
Beating wounded heart

I will be better
The nights will end
Iâll be better by daylight
Iâll be better by daylight
