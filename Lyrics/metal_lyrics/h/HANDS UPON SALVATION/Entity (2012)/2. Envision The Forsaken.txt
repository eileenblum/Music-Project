Framed by the mistaken axiom
Betrayed by the unseen fragments
Iâll stand at the forefront of deliverance

Armless hands nearby frozen tyranny
I evoke my theory and I'll have my rhapsody

I wonât drown for mercy
And i wonât drown for resignation
And i wonât drown to treachery 
Iâll awake to forever never surrender

Iâll be release âtill the end i will prevail
This is your hostility faced against my will

I wonât drown for mercy
And i wonât drown for resignation
And i wonât drown to treachery
Iâll awake to forever never surrender

Iâll hold the torches higher and forever never surrender
Iâll hold the torches higher and forever never surrender
Iâll hold the torches higher and forever never surrender
Iâll hold the torches higher and forever never surrender
Iâll hold the torches higher and forever never surrender

My fire
This is my fire
My fire
This is my fire
The epic of this theory
The rhymes of this history
Will be written

I will have my consequences
I will have my rhapsody
In the way of defying your knowledge
Iâll have my hands upon animosity
In the way of defying your knowledge
Iâll have my hands upon salvation

Framed by the mistaken axiom
Betrayed by the unseen fragments
Iâll fight
