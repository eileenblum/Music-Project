Diary of broken promises
Hundred pages of memories

Reveals the pages of this my last memories
Waking all forgotten days of ours
Sinking in a thousands words about you
My mind flying to a fairy land

Back to the grey colored days
Of compassions, dreams, and confusedness
Silences, desires, love, and hurts
Let me drown in a hundreds pages of tragedy

Chapters by chapters
Our fascinations appeared
Desperations and emptiness 
Has brought us together

At the back of your finger i put my promises
In my arms you whispered wonderful words
A verse from your loneliness 
A verse from your loneliness and uncertain feelings
A word of my sadness and heart longing
Together we bind our passions
Together we bind our desires

In your diary 	Iâm drowned

Iâm in forlorn 
Cause the love I had is now been gone
