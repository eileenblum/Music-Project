Iâm awake in a forlorn hours
Iâm awake in a forlorn seasons
Another chapter is schism and hesitation
Words said the memories are not forgotten
The wounds wonât be heal scars are everlasting

Day by day	Iâm awaken in grief
Day by day	Iâm awaken in sad
Distressed	moments
Iâm alive in this alienation

Come on...
This line of stories reveals my endless indifference
All the words you said is the power of my hatred
The view from his eyelids reflecting your theory
Imposing, immersing, imploring
The killing of my mind

Iâll be different with my paradox
Iâll be different with my own thoughts
Iâll be different when youâre pushing me down
Iâll be different with my own gun

This line of stories reveals my endless indifference
All the words you said is the power of my hatred
The view from his eyelids reflecting your theory
Imposing, immersing, imploring
The killing of my mind

Day by day	Iâm awaken	in grief
Day by day	Iâm awaken	in sad
Day by day	Iâm awaken	in grief
Day by day	Iâm awaken	in sad
