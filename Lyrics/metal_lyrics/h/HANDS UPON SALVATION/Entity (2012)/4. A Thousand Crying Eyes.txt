I've seen a lot of changes through my restless eyes
A whole obscurity toward world's delusion
One hopeless nature with burning blue skies
Deluge of insecurity and a vanished devotion

This is not my daydream a prophecy becomes reality
Through a messiah of denial with an outburst of dissension.
Of my consciousness
That i never listen, that you've never listen

Unseen desolation, unlistened confusedness
And my world now has comes to an end
Voiceless dismay, and covered decimation
And now our greed has leads to another path of destruction

I feel myself going numb, my heart drown insecure
I open my hands, Iâm trying to pray
And still asked does i still have a hope to keep myself sane
Hoping for some ears to listen and a heart comes with an answer

This is what Iâve seen beyond their suffering
This is what Iâve heard while you won't hear

There's nothing sensible, there's no hope to wait
This whole obscenities leads to world's depravation
A misdirection act deceasing the nature resources
A beautiful anguish towards onslaught of persecution
I'm only able to see my blue sky been burned
I'm only able to feel my soul been taken
I only stand in silence i can't remove myself
Finally my world is over, and my hope comes to an end
Finally my words still nothing and i'm still not going to cry
