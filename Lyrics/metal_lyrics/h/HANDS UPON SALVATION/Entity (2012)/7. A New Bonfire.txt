The life you took from these everlasting consumptions
Proven to be greed of this violent civilization
A tradition of wickedness less sensible heritage
Creation of supremacy violence and inflictions

Iâ¦I stand in a verge of labyrinth

The murder has become tradition
Decimation continues overwhelming
Unnecessary killing outgrow in every kind
Of annihilationsâ¦of annihilations

I choose the path of dissension
The differences i seek as a solution
Iâve taken a diverse believes
In a common and savage majority

I regain the new strength
And i choose myself release
I starve for a new life

Rebirth with a new hope
I retain to diverge ideas

I wonât fall again the torches in my heart 
Will light a brighter day
I wonât fall again the torches in my heart
Will guide me to the end

The conviction in my hand 
The conviction in my mind
Will lead the way
