Sufferâ¦ Here we are across this millenni-anger
Denied and wasted as Christ always was
Sufferâ¦ Surrounded by dorks piles scorched by time
You razorbladeâs prey, accept your sentence

The scentâ¦ Of leather is drainingâ¦ Your tears

Sufferâ¦ Praying poisons to devour the weakness
Breeding your infant in the cleansing sin

Offensive infectionâ¦
Poor desolationâ¦
Open it right nowâ¦
Defensive reflexionâ¦
As the twink you areâ¦

Choking the dead till he reaches his color
As the frailest Lord dense became a wimp
With that rope of shame you shall die again
With that bag on your head you shall slay the pain

Suffer for me, suffer for me
Suffer for you, suffer for you [2x]
Suffer for me, suffer for me
Cut!

As the twink you are!
