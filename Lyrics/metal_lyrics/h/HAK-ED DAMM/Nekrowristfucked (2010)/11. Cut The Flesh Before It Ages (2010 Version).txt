Choices are rare done - On putrid life my blood boils
Knives sharpened- my flesh sweats - and words are cold
Crushing black - organs die - and void eyelids

Plague - The fear haunts us
And weâre fucking alone in this world

Finally, a sweet deliverance is offered to you
As freedom gates, in this nimble night
Nicely, as the blade is cherishing me
Hey! The first cut will be the toughest

As my tight skin gets easy to slit
As my dose is getting harder to feed
As my blood runs aside on my wrists
Death's carrying me to my last agony

Plague - The shame drags us
And as the true whore filled with hope

It notches from the inside, leaving only piss
Vile memory as hangman to rope
Amazed, thinking that a world exists
Hey! The first cut will be the toughest

No pain can brings me higher than those
With their scalpels move away the morose
And by the pores of their tissues viscoses
Can departure being as soft as stirred a virgin?

Choices are rare done - On putrid life my blood boils
Knives sharpened- my flesh sweats - and words are cold
Crushing black - organs die - and void eyelids

Suicide - The plague helped us
Coz..We were fucking alone in this world!
