My scentless skin is pale &amp; old
A kind of silence in my head
My eyeless shores on iceless cold
A kind of kinky slut to spread

Breathing my ascencion / Deep mutilations

I lied to discover the true pain
My flesh slowly turns to infection
Can my fluids take form as rain?
Drinking hunger of redemption

Breathing my ascencion / Deep mutilations

A skinless Scaphism beholds
A skinless Scaphism beholds
A torso riddled with spearheads
A useless scum in a chokehold
Another bishop unto death
A boneless child begging to old
Self-mutilation to bloodshed

Breathing my ascencion / Deep mutilations

I lied to discover the true pain
My flesh slowly turns to infection
Can my fluids take form as rain?
Drinking hunger of redemption
Bind me &amp; burn unholy tears
My Scaphism.. My Scaphism
