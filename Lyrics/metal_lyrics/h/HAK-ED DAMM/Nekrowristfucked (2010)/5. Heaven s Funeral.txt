Whores!
Spilling my cancer, erasing you porkers
Hundreds of steel fists in the face of the sooks
We strangled the pope in his shitty leak of puke
Mouthfucking their nuns increasing as fluffers

(Burn)

From the lames of disgrace to moronic Christ
Lair of poor glory, weâre fucking up on shotguns
We hellishly hammered but the old priest resisted
By relentless pride you will scream till sunâs tide

As you feel my insane burning hell
As the heavenâs funeral assault I am
As the funeral heaven assault I dwell
As you deadpale captive, Almighty hangman!

Hey! Youâre searching a pure &amp; desired abuse
You Christians are the true &amp; honest desolation
You dumbshit puppets of wretched deadly nation
You can now hunt me, I got nothing to lose

As you feel my insane burning hell
As the heavenâs funeral assault I am
As the funeral heaven assault I dwell
As you deadpale captive, Almighty hangman!

Spilling my cancer, erasing you porkers
Hundreds of steel fists in the face of the sooks
We strangled the pope in his shitty leak of puke
Mouthfucking their nuns increasing as fluffers
