In these fields of drunken corpses
soaked of their own scarlet blood
Floors of billion sins that sleep
a mortal passion born from an oldest
Undisputable human weakness
Soils oozing of venom fears
Squatted cry pure carnage
Your dried ashes we will expend

T34 Domination vengeance - T34 Tormentor death rides
T34 Finishes itself tight - T34 Between fucks without mind
T34 Brings power &amp; glory - T34 Banish your lives

(T34)

A wind which blows a perversion
Almost a comatose perfection
Forthing no law &amp; religion
Violating howls of the battalion
See the cattles &amp; the plague
Softened skin of a dirtied rag
Crushing fathers &amp; young sags
&amp; now fire will light their flags

T34 Domination vengeance - T34 Tormentor death rides
T34 Finishes itself tight - T34 Between fucks without mind
T34 Brings power &amp; glory - T34 Banish your lives...

(You bleed!)

When a kind of hammer
Comes to slit away the skulls
Bloodcleansing is engaged
Squirting the blood of the enemy
Shredded in scraps of pulpit
Sharpened flesh is turning blue
Armored steel is waiting for
Objective is to break you

(T34)
