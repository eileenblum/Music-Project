In my spine I feel as death has taken you
My senses are betrayed by Cancer
A memory of past tears sets back hunger
A fist - A gun - A bombshell on my statue

Infectious vermins, worship &amp; kill yourself

In my spine I feel as death has fistfucked you
On warfare as their blood of Lord
has been brought through inferno
A cunt - A demon - A wrinkle on the shadow of my Inner

Kommando
Kommando! My Kommando!

In my spine I feel as the grey sky has kissed you
With billions ashes of flesh flakes
Reheated by combusting corpses piles
A shout - A whisper - A crackling of torches

Infectious vermins, worship &amp; kill yourself
Kommando!

In my spine I feel as war has disgusted you
The melted skin, the nude intestines &amp; torsos
Women abused by repented dirty basterds
An H.I.V. - A virus - An internal destruction

Kommando!

In my spine I feel as an Inner Kommando
As paleness of the skinless whore
A gun remains against my head
A breeze - A silence - An opened slaughtered throat
