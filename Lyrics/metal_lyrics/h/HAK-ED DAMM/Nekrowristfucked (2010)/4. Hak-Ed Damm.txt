Welcome us! Welcome affliction!
Knives are raising a kind of grotesque addiction
A lifetime of endless birth kills
Wait for the blood of the saint to be spilled
Hail the son! Hail the Angel-Whore!

Marching men! Marching men!
Deathâs clarions open the path of mourning
Marching men! Marching men!
Heartbeats of drums open the gates of boundless

Marching men! Marching men!
A quenchless torture on the holy flesh
Marching men! Marching men!
An embryo vanished under the shreds of solace

Welcome us! Welcome Perdition!
A godless pride by a nameless perversion
An era of shameless birth kills
Wait for the juice of the Christ to be spilled
Hail the son! Hail the Angel-Whore!

Marching men! Marching men!
Deathâs clarions open the path of mourning
Marching men! Marching men!
Heartbeats of drums open the gates of boundless

Marching men! Marching men!
A quenchless torture on his holy flesh
Marching men! Marching men!
An embryo vanished under the shreds of solace

March! Here come the sons of war!!!!

Welcome us! Welcome destruction!
A pesticide crowns a grimness corruption
A stretch of useless birth kills
Wait for the gore of the Lord to be spilled
Hail the son! Hail the Angel-Whore!
