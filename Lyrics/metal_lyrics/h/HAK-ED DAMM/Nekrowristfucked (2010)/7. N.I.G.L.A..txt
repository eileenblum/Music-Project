â¦and as the seventh trumpet was heard
We fooled their prayers into deathcreeps
Weâve fulfilled their lungs with brimstone
Nigla!

Since a burthen of lifeless anno
Proud to reject the holy blow
Since a millennium of infernal duty
By cracking wings dehumanize thee

Profaning the greedy salvations
Hailing crest of the addictions
Blasphemy soars over absolutions
Bleaching credo of confrontations

Nigla!
Draining the stench to
Nigla!
Violating the holy grail to [2x]
Nigla!
Choke up the fools to
Nigla!

Since a burthen oflifeless anno
Proud to reject the holy blow
Since a millennium of infernal duty
By cracking wings dehumanize thee

A cremation of mourning daughters
A graceless havoc of black deity
Laughing of the undressed on embers
Bleaching the earth from the almighty

Nigla!
Draining the stench to
Nigla!
Violating the holy grail to [2x]
Nigla!
Choke up the fools to
Nigla!

Since a burthen of lifeless anno
Proud to reject the holy blow
Since a millennium of infernal duty
By cracking wings dehumanize thee

Profanation of greedy salvations
Hailing crest of the addictions
Blasphemy soars over absolutions
Bleaching credo of confrontations

Nigla!
Draining the stench to
Nigla!
Violating the holy grail to
Nigla!
Choke up the fools to
Nigla!

In my spine I feel, as the war has disgusted you
The melted skin, the nude intestines &amp; torsos
Women abused by repented dirty bastards
An HIV, a virus, an internal destruction

My kommando!

In my spine I feel, as inner kommando
As paleness of a skinless whore
A gun remains against my head
A stench, a grail â¦the foolsâ¦

Nigla!
Draining the stench to
Nigla!
Violating the holy grail to
Nigla!
Choke up the fools to
Nigla!


Die!
