Blankminded, no past, no glory
When the life collapses and burns on your sides
Rags of flesh intoxicated by your pride
..and the scent of embers only abhors my â¦ sigh

Infernobyl
Forevermore
Foreverdead
Infernobyl

The wealth, the poison, the cruelty
Has distorted your vision and your purity
You swallowed the masses of blood infections
â¦and the melting skin flows as a nefarious â¦ away

Infernobyl
Forevermore
Foreverdead
Infernobyl

Sulphurings and bleachings upon
Masses of children begging for salvation
An eternal inferno is on
â¦ and four thousands victims by mutilation â¦ died

â¦the past
â¦the wealth
â¦the children


Blankminded, no past, no glory
When the life collapses and burns on your sides
Rags of flesh intoxicated by your pride
..and the scent of embers only abhors my â¦ sigh

â¦blows my sigh awayâ¦

Infernobyl
Forevermore
Foreverdead
