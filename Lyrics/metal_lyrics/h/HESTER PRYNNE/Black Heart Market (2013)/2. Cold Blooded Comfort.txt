My greatest comfort has always beenÂ  sedation
Fading to black has always been myÂ  escape, for I've long been a sinner and cast myÂ  hatred to the saints

Like weights tied around my legs, yearning pulls me to the bottom of the ocean known as despair
I've often questioned the end as much as I have welcomed it

Withering flesh, all that's left of a buried conscious
I've exposed my bones to the surfaces and stood idly by as I wait for them to break

Staring into the open sky, waiting for answers I don't deserve
I am waiting for answers I haven't earned

I've been left with a vague reflection of the child that I was born
Silence has become his only offer since I turned my back to him, fuck

I keep on digging deeper into despair
Of all the risen angels, why was I left behind to live like this

Teasing the wolves awaiting bloodshed, praying that I can hold my wounds together for long to get out of the woods

Of all the risen angels why was I left behind to live like this
The mirror lies... The mirror fucking lies
