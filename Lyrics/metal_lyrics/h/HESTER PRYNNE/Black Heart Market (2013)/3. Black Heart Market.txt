[Spoken:]
I'm living in America. In America you're on your own. America's not a country, it's just a business. Now fucking pay me

Welcome to the end of our hearts intent
We've been left with a star filled graveyard

We have all signed our name to the grave
We wait for the day we have to watch the skyline burn
Turn your back and feel the blade sinking in as we deem the kind of black hearts

Everyone I know has become a ghost
Lost, lonely souls ever more
Everyone I know has become a motherfucking ghost
Lost, lonely souls ever more

We have all signed our name to the grave
We wait for the day we have to watch the skyline burn
Turn your back and feel the blade sinking in as we deem the king

Deem me the king

You aren't the only one who thinks that life is just a fucking game, everyone plays and no one wins
You aren't the only one with a debt unsettled, rode hard and put up wet

Choose your poison and join the sick
(Fuck it)

You are not alone in this suffering
What do you fucking think it means to have the choice to live your life or lay down and die

You are not the only one who suffers
We are all just as hopeless
Who the fuck do you think you are

I've heard the same sad cries, countless times
"How could you do this to me, God why"
It's just part of the game that you hate but you can't change
Don't bleed out before the last scene
Your pride is worthless if you're dead
So die, fucking die with your boots strapped tight

Die with a smile but rest assured you'll be forgotten
