All I wanted was to watch the world burn out with you when both our hearts began to beat in deadly synchronicity

Like a moth drawn to flame, you can feelÂ  the heat;
you just can not turn away
More lessons learned through defeat than any victory
but the fact remains; I'd give anything to erase all of our history

You lit a fire beneath the most precious wings, just to ignite the sky and see true peril in the light

I will live to love another name, but it doesn't change a fucking thing
My past still carries your disgrace

I'll never sleep again if dreams are made of you
My every dream has turned a nightmare
I'll never sleep again if dreams are made of you
My every dream has turned a fucking nightmare

Should I remind you of just how fickle you are
Should I reveal the truth of all the filthy things you've done
I wouldn't waste my time trying to polish your lies
The truth will surely find its way back to the eyes of everyone that you have fucked

I have no love left for your lying eyes
I have no love left for your wicked tongue
I have no love left for our memories
I have no love left, may you rest in piss

I will love you more when you're feeding worms
I will love you more when you are laying inÂ  a fucking casket

I'll never sleep again if dreams are made of you
My every dream has turned a nightmare
I'll never sleep again if dreams are made of you
My dreams are fucking dead

If I am destined for hell, may heaven hold your place
I'd rather burn alone than ever have to rot by your side
