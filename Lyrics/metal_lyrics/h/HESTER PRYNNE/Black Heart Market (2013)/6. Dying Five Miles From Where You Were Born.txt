There's no escaping this hell, nothing left to tell myself
Every night gets darker, and every morning I wake lifeless
Still breathing, still grieving, still able to feel the pain
Still breathing, still grieving, completely desolate

My eyes are artifacts, watching the world collapse
So long, good riddance
In an open grave I await the end, fucking get it over with now
End this now

All that's left in me are fading memories

There is nothing you can say to try and save me
I'd rather never breathe again if it meant IÂ  could forget;
Every passing of love, all the years in disgust
How could I trust anyone

Scars tie me to the pastÂ 

These open wounds will never heal, only bleed through eternity
There's no room left in heaven for me

All that's left in me are fading memories
Who needs friends with all these demons
