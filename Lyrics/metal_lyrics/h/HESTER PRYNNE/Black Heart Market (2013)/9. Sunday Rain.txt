My scar collection is proof that I've been through hell and lived to tell about it
So let the misery pour down on me like fucking rain

The day I realized where every ecstasy lies was the day my suicide plot slowly dissolved
What's the point in ending an existence before its time
My influence will live on after I die

Save your tears for a day when you can land a river to free them
Save your tears for a better day to drown your fucking sorrows

I've spent countless nights with nothing more than the thought of suicide
There is a battle within that I'm not sure is worth winning

Even if hell is imminent, every thought is aÂ  plague
To everyone I love, just know
I've always wanted so much more

I used to love the rain until it fell everyday
I used to love the rain until it flooded everything

Save your tears for a day when you can lend a river to free them
Save your tears for a better day to drown your fucking sorrows

Bless this mess

Everything I say revolves around this fucking pain
I can't decide whether it's worth the fucking time, to even speak
Everything I say revolves around this pain, I can't decide... is it worth the time to speak

One day I realized where every ecstasy lies
