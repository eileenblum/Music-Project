So sick of this loathsome abyss
All that I want is to feel that I'm alive
My decadence is the reason I'm screaming
All that I want is to say that I fucking tried

Wallow in filth, can you get yourself clean from it?
Wallow in filth that you buried yourself in

It's such a hollowing confession;
That every path you've chose leads down the same road
That everyone you love has lead your heart astray and every hope you've had has landed in aÂ  grave

All I've ever wanted was to somehow find my way out of this darkness and finally reach the light

Wallow in filth, wallow in it
Can you get yourself clean from it
Wallow in filth
All the mess you've made for yourself
Can you get yourself clean from it

The saddest songs play and take me back to better days before I was so scarred, before I was so lost

I've built a tomb within my mind, and locked up all my pride; left to die

All of these voices screaming out
"who do you think you are fucking with"

I know you feel deserted, because you are
I know you feel abandoned, because you should be
I'm fucking rotten, I've been forgotten
I'm not worth the time it takes to change.
I'm fucking filthy
I'm not worth saving
My soul is withered
I'm fucking grimy
