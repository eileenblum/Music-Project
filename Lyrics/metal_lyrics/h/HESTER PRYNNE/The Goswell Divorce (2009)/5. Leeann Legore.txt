Drop dead, you don't deserve to be alive and well
I see your smile as I suffocate
Left hanging high above your head until the day you cut me free
I'll be waiting for you to bear your neck and adore the noose.
We could be so beautiful deceased as we rot in hell
And take our secrets with us to the grave
And mark the lives of the ones we betrayed

Promises mean nothing
All our vows were broken
Promises mean nothing
All our vows were shit
Promises mean nothing
All our vows were fucking lies

I see the western sunset
Has finally got into your head
You'll pay the price to shine
no matter what the sacrifice

Fucking your way up to the top, it's time to shine
Fucking your way up to the top, Hollywood runs through your veins
Is your soul worth fifteen minutes on your knees?

Not every star deserves the sky
All that glitters is far from gold
