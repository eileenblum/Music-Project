Bury the hatchet, sever the ties
Vehement screams forever haunting every dream
Ghosts in silence left to harbour their hatred
I feel my blood run cold

As the angels sing their mourning song, the vultures feed their hunger
Don't waste you breath on me,
I've heard these lies a thousand times before
They're all too familiar

God forgive me, all beauty has died within
There is no hope in forgiveness

Mark my words, my return will bring your funeral
May hell have vengeance on your soul

God forgive me, I feel the end is near
This treachery has assured your fate

My god what have you done?
You put your foot in the grave
That day you stood before me
And made a promise you can't keep

'til death do we part, and may we burn forever
