Break your fucking neck while you're holding your head screaming out
"When the fuck will this curse end?
If I die tomorrow will you leave me flowers on my grave?"
And when your eyes are rolled back in your head, remember what I said
"One day you'll regret...
One day you will regret ever tying your arms onto a burning bridge"

Now you've got a gun and the intention to put a bullet in your head?
Well go ahead, just make it easy
Just make it easy on yourself, no one can help, or so your demons say

With a single shot you say goodbye, and wear the hole in your head as if you're keeping a promise, just keep it to yourself
And when they search the home, their eyes are scarred forever.
