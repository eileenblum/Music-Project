You buried me neck deep in this misery and I feel right at home
So pardon me for trying to speak but I remember before the fire you and I were merely embers

"I'm sorry for running but there's no other way"
I'm jaded, You're wasted, we fit so perfectly
Just trust me, don't love me, we're just a memory
Just trust me, you'll love me much better in a grave

I wanna know your darkest secrets

Tell me, what are you hiding from me?

Always and forever, staring down a barrel
Always and forever, staring down the barrier
Always, forever yours...
Always and forever, staring down the barrel

These city lights and every street still speak your name, they're calling out to me
"Don't look back, close your eyes, clench them tight, there's nothing you want to see looking back.
Close your eyes, clench them tight, there's nothing you want to see."

As the skies part ways, so do we

So pardon me for trying to speak but I remember before the fire you and I were merely embers

I see the light to heavens gate before me, and I can hardly wait
And I can hardly wait... Open up the gates
As the skies part ways, so do we

Lover, hunter, feeder, tell me, what are you hiding from me?
