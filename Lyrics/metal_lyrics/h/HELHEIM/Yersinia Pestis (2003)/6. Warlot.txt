Born in fire and ice
Pure of heart, mind and soul
I crush the walls of ignorance
Never to betray my heritage

You can kill my body
But my ravishing moral I'll keep for myself

WARLOT

I seek none but my own bliss
Grasped through the paragons I choose
Self-righteousness one can say
But in the end you have to choose your own way

None stand before me
None can mock my ways
I quench my thirst through my own artistry

Memories -
Fields of gold
Life -
Shades of grey
Walls-
Built to punish
Pride -
Never imprisoned
All is all -
In the middle earth
That is where -
I've laid my peace
