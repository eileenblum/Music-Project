Touch the fire and get burned
Plead for mercy and never return
Stare deep into the darkest abyss
Until the abyss stares back at you

It is all but irony
When they claim sovereignity
Stranger ways is hardly found
On this poisened earthly ground

SINNERS WAKE

Save the sorry and fool yourself
That is the of the blind
Infinite dreams of an infinite realm
Where no heathen tread

The cross points black
The words are silent
All is in the end
Part of the sinners wake

Death is more than death
Life is no more than an illusion of this
I cannot forsee myself crawling
And kiss the cross of self deceit
