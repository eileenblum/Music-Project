I lay the final weight to your shoulders
I make your life tip over
Life is a slow sadistic torment
I only increase the speed

Am I really that cruel
Am I really the reason
Just slit your throat
Increase the speed

Painfully aware of the lot
The sinister slumber in me
I unveil the darkest of all
Into the abyss you fall

Pitch the faith
To dead silence
Turn the key
To open the gate
Increase the speed

I am the mentor of pain
I am the caster of stones
I've laid the final weight
The burden is you
All alone: dead
