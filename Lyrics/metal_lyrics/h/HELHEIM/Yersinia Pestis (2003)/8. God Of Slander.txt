I am the god of slander
The one that leads you astray
I am born among the highest gods
But I never forsee myself
By their side
I take the forms of many
A beast my words for the hypocrisy

I am the reason of betrayal
I alure the purest to fall
These are not deeds of evil
But ways to own amusement

I am the god of slander
Mockery is my state of being
I give birth to the beasts
Who dwell in their chains

God of slander

I choose myself above all
Even though pain is my fortune
The poison that hits my body
Won't make me change my ways

In the end of day I'll lead my children by fire and ice
The world falls apart chaos among the gods
Death to us all
