Eyes of damnation
An oxen with the stare
Death surrounds it
Birds and beasts withers

Behold the march of the undead
Claws of death around each neck
Tears of ice ? bewitchment
Dead to the ground ? bewitchment

Coal black bodies lifeless
Bones hammered to dust
Buried beneath stones
The ground is recking

Around every corner
In every empty street
Look over your shoulder
Eyes of evil is omnipresent

Sorrow and pain
Paranoia and confusion
Ghastly presence
Death itself into the dead of night
