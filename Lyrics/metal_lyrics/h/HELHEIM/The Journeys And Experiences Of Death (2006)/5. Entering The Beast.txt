Miserable animal wandering alone
Without logic, logic can't prevail
Instinct of primal needs
Licking the ashes so futile

Burn a bull dapple ? grey
Three times risen from the grave
The face if evil is unknown

Entering the beast
Of decay
Entering the beast
Of decay

Gored master
Mind left behind
Left to sink in a marsh
Silence in hereafter
