The death of a brother
A withstanding trust
Hail the one who left us
Soon to gaze beyond

Clear is the sky
The stars to guide
Oaken dragon sail
Our bond of blood is sealed

Your trust is laid with me
Your journey won't fail
The dawning of a new world
The old one takes you in

Spiritual journey
On a spiritual path
Rebirth and death unite
The eye in the sky
Energy of nature
You're dead but never fallen
