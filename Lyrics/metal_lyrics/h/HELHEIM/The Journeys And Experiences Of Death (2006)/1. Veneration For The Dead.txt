Cults of death, many is number
Those of death and those of slumber
The grave has more than one name
Burned to ashes or staying the same

Life goes on even when dead
On earthly ground or beyond
Thus have the mighty fallen
And so the one was gone

Trust to gain wisdom from beyond
Fear to prevent the deceiving tongue
Veneration for the dead
Or neither nor

Glorification of the ancients
Upon the threads of the ancestors
Whether gone north or south
The dead will live on
