The shroud of darkness torn
By funeral night sky
Far away and beyond
Floating ashes and dust

Hooves across the heavens
The spirit rose from watery dust
The horses flesh to feed
A journey without time

To bid farewell
Godspeed on the hereafter
Body to feed, spirit to ride
13 to the perished

Sacrifice and pagan prayer
Oaken dragon and flames
Flesh to feed, hooves to ride
13 to the perished
