I et helheimsk brak
Tordnet Tor
Tre udyr fÃ¸des
Noen har drevet hor
Avguder ler godt i natt
Hyller jotunmor Angerboda

Ãye for Ã¸ye
Tann for tann
HÃ¸st hva du sÃ¥r
Hvis du sÃ¥r din egen grav

Verg deg for nord
Vokt deg for den urskog
Skapninger i ulvens ham
Fenris har blod pÃ¥ tann

[English translation:]

Ironforest

In a hellish crash
Thor thundered
Three beasts were born
Someone has committed adultery
Demigods laughs tonight
Hailing the Jotunmother Angerboda

An eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
Reap what you sow
If you sow your own grave

Defend yourself against the north
Guard yourself for the primeval forest
Creatures in the guise of the wolf
Fenris has blood on teeth
