At the edge of global destruction
Victory for the hazardous powers
Hunger, darkness and frost
cause massextinction
The cosmic spacerock-shower

Scene of apocalypse-lifeless
As the impact takes its toll
Behold the nightmare scenario
Nuclear warheads can't
ease our distress

Starfallen spacerocks
Cause monumental havocs
As we fail
the cosmic winter will prevail

In far future milleniums
a past alien order will arise
A new dawn will break
from the cosmic winter rape
Recite and behold
Revival of the gods of old
