The winds speak of dismal names
long forgotten by time and life
the antropomorphical ones
reduced again and again to nothing

Mocked by man of false belief
a distance to the heathendom
look beyond and rage
find within the northern forces

Rituals of a higher meaning
bonds of blood of our kin
fallen down to entertainment
weak stories to ridicule

Sense the cult of old
breathe the air of the elder
the energy of singularity
summon your northern forces
