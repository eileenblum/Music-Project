Who am i when time is old
devil entity or tools of faith?
my face is getting paler
do you know who i am?

Still i am pure essence of nature
though man himself corrode in doubt
trickster God or innocent fool
do you know who i am?

Without cult or function
the impulsive intelligence
breaking the old world order
the new one is at hand

Parallels to define
but am i really to be understood?
i change through ages
though constant in time
