Birth and death are the same; they are the two sides of one door.
To enter one room always means leaving another.
It depends on which room or which life we are in as to whether we say "entrance" or "exit," life or death.
For he who understands it, death holds no terrors.
But he who did not go his proper way in life and sinned will see his guilt in death.
But there is after death no place of torture, no hell.
To see one's guilt is the severest judgment and at the same time the greatest penalty.
Judgment and punishment are within yourself.
Neglected work can only be made up by double effort.
It will once more be your choice, either to work toward the world plan, or to be its enemy.
That is the only death that there is, to become a force for destruction rather than for creation, and this death is not physical.
It is your free choice to decide on which side you belong, on god's or, to use an old term, "the devil's."
What we call birth and death is only the door between two worlds.
There is no birth and no death, only change, and we can go confidently through the door, for all the worlds were created by one hand.
