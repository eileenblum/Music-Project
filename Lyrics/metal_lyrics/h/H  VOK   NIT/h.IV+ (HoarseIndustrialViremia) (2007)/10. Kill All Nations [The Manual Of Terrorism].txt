Crawl under the stone
Await the time of fear
Split the flesh from bone
Cry the rivers of million tears

Blind lead the blind
Just one step too far
A life to rewind
Get back to the start

Silence is golden
Ignorance is bliss
Fell down from heaven
In a shower of piss

Build up a wall
Brick by fucking brick
United we fall
Under a flag of shit

Rise up - Burn the flags
Rise up - Erase the tags
Rise up - Rape the days
Rise up - Kill the nations

Crawl under the stone
Await the time of fear
Split the flesh from bone
Cry the rivers of million tears

Blind lead the blind
Just one step too far
A life to rewind
We're back in the start

Rise up
Rise up
Rise up
Rise up

Silence is golden
Ignorance is bliss
Fell down from heaven
In a shower of piss

Build up a wall
Brick by fucking brick
United we fall
Under a flag of shit

Rise up - Burn the flags
Rise up - Erase the tags
Rise up - Rape the days
Rise up - Kill the nations
