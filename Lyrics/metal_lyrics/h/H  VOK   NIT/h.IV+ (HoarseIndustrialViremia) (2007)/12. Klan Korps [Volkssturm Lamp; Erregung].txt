I've seen the fields of snow
All bodies frozen row on row
All blue marble forms lying
Not breathing nor dying

Chaos and disorder - Let the storm break loose
Chaos and disorder - Kill nations, don't refuse

I've seen a rotting sun
All burning in sweating venom
A fine chorus of worms
And millions of flies swarm

Chaos and disorder - Let the storm break loose
Chaos and disorder - Kill the nations, don't refuse

Refuse - Resist
Abuse - Insist
Refuse - Resist
Abuse - Insist

I've seen the fist of man
All powers undone in hand
Burn the flags of victory
Hail the art of killing spree

Chaos and disorder - Let the storm break loose
Chaos and disorder - Kill the nations, don't refuse

Control - Collapse - Confuse - Conflict
Control - Collapse - Confuse - Conflict

I've seen the eye of the storm
The error of human germ
Live to rot among the bones
Face the death of frozen souls
