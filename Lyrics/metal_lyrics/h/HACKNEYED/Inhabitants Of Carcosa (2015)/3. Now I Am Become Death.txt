Day and night they live in sin 
Wolves to us, no sheep to Him 
Let them feel the wrath of God 
Take their lives and let them rot 

Annihilate the filth 
Benevolence is dead and gone 
We make examples here of every one - for everyone 
And when the fire ceases, 
Corpses will be fertile ground 
We rid His sacred realm of every one - for everyone 

All of them He will condemn 
Wolves to us and snakes to Him 
My own son, I hear him shout, 
Watch him burn, rejoice aloud 

Annihilate the filth 
Benevolence is dead and gone 
We make examples here of every one - for everyone 
And when the fire ceases 
Corpses will be fertile ground 
We rid His sacred realm of every one - for everyone 

For he only speaks the truth 
My trust eradicates all ruth 

Annihilate the filth 
Benevolence is dead and gone 
We make examples here of every one - for everyone 
And when the fire ceases 
Corpses will be fertile ground 
We rid His sacred realm of every one - for everyone 

We make examples here 
We make examples here 
We make examples here 
Of every one - for everyone 
We make examples here 
We make examples here 
So may His Kingdom come 
For us alone - the chosen ones
