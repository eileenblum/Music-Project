In our head, rage and dread, 
Everything is doomed 
Never able to forget, 
By hate we are consumed 

Now it's the time to confess 
The need for equity, 
Just a flaw of all flesh 
Praise your lord for opening your eyes 
And safe you from demise 

This will become a bloodbath 
Every one of you will pay 
Every one of you will pay 
And you will draw your last breath 
As I take your soul away	
As I take your soul away 

See my throne 
I live it through and through 
I am the one 
To kneel before 

This will become a bloodbath 
Every one of you will pay 
Every one of you will pay 
And you will draw your last breath 
As I take your soul away	
As I take your soul away 

If there's something - 
Only one thing to die for 
It is me, worthy of more 
Only one thing, 
Just the one thing in this war 
I am your God, and you are my whore 

This will become a bloodbath 
Every one of you will pay 
Every one of you will pay 
And you will draw your last breath 
As I take your soul away	
As I take your soul away 
This will become a bloodbath 
Every one of you will pay 
Every one of you will pay 
And you will draw your last breath 
As I take your soul away	
As I take your soul away
