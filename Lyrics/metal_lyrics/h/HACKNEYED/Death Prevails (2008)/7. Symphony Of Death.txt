Mess - Behold!
He tears my skin - tears my skin
Into several parts
Cuts my face - Cuts my face
Beyond recognition
And peels my flesh - peels my flesh
Chews it off my bones
It is his brand - It's the brand
Specific for the Symphony of Death
Protects from dearth
Symphony of Death
Enjoy bloodbath
Now it's the war within him
Mind and body and the things he does
I want to fly but his hands are faster
Orderly they demount my corpse
Symphony of Death
Mass of limbs bones and guts
My mind begins to bail
He tears my skin
Into several parts
Cuts my face - Cuts my face
Beyond recognition
And peels my flesh - peels my flesh
Chews it off my bones
It is his brand - It's the brand
Specific for the Symphony of Death
Protects from dearth
Symphony of Death
Enjoy blood -BLOODBATH!
Symphony of Death
