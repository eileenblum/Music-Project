It busts my brain to see
Myself's the empire
Of my hated enemy
The hated enemy
Eruption, frustration
Corruption, elimination
This is the time, the time
The time when worlds collide
I'd crossed the slim line
Which bewared me
From death to destruction
It was the time, the time
When my own world collides
WORLDS COLLIDE
Worlds collide
It busts my brain to see
Myself's the empire
Of my hated enemy
The hated enemy
Eruption, frustration
Corruption, elimination
This is the time, the time
The time when worlds collide
I'd crossed the slim line
Which bewared me
From death to destruction
It was the time, the time
When my own world collides
WORLDS COLLIDE
Worlds collide
Collide
I murder, kill and slaughter
To weak to stop this order
Rape, demount prepare
Until I eat human meat
WORLDS COLLIDE
