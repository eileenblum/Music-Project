Violent flash
Pain drills in your brain
After times of darkness
Light burns your
Nerves to realize
Which had died after your hope
You're to weak to fend
To rough to disclose
Gagged and trammelled
Your veins are full of drugs
Rife with wire
Neon sun laughs at you
Bound stubs
Once there were your limbs
Amputated
No one heard your scream
Neon Sun
Bright but cold
The place you'll mold
Faint anoxic
The bag over your head
Bluster lungs like toxic
Blood gets hard as lead
Neon Sun
Bright but cold
The place you'll mold
Place you'll mold
Place you'll mold
Neon Sun watches you die
Neon Sun watches you
