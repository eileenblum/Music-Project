He rapes you
Cuts your face off
Cause it abates his pain
He enjoys brutal freedom
Cause his conscience enchain
He carves you
Tears your skin off
Cause it allays himself
He erupting
Erupting - erupting over you
He's got no place for sorrow
He still prevents his pain
No mind to plague with pictures
No pictures to engrain
He's got no place for sorrow
He still prevents his pain
No mind to plague with pictures
No pictures to engrain
It's the savage
The savage from within
It's the savage
The savage from within
He rapes you
Cuts your face off
Cause it abates his pain
Cause his conscience enchain
Tears your skin off
No mind to plague with pictures
Cause it abates his pain
Cause his conscience enchain
Tears your skin off
Cause it allays himself
He chips and slits the bowels
And reaches his final end
