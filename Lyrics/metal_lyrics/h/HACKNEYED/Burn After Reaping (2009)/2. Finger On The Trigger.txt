Shortly after Dawn
I'm out for some Kills
I still play my bills

Can't be awake and still can't sleep
My needs are hard, my wills too weak
My soul is bared, my mind will bleed
My Finger on the Trigger

I still hear them Scream out mercy, scream loud, one shot, burst head
I'll pepper you with lead.

Can't be awake and still can't sleep
My needs are hard, my wills too weak
My soul is bared, my mind will bleed
My Finger on the Trigger
With my finger on the...

Can't be awake and still can't sleep
My needs are hard, my wills too weak
My soul is bared, my mind will bleed
My Finger on the Trigger

I still hear them Scream out mercy, scream loud, one shot, burst head
I'll pepper you with lead.

You'd felt the pain of my misery
No voice to scream
No legs to flee
No soul to save
No eyes to see

My finger on the trigger
Mental breakdown
Your mind falls apart
The day your dead
You'll hit the road
And bathe in black
You'll feel the death and taste the mold

Can't be awake and still can't sleep
My needs are hard, my wills too weak
My soul is bared, my mind will bleed
My Finger on the Trigger
