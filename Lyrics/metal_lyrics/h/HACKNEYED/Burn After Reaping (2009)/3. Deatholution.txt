Deatholution
Return to primeval mud
When S turns to the C
We're suffering in blood
And loose all humanity
Stumble over the screens
People without sanity speak with primordial screams
New act on discovery

The Deatholution begins
Spreading out like a virus
Released from all our sins
Destroy us.
Deatholution
DEATH

Return to primeval mud
When S turns to the C
We're suffering in blood
And loose all humanity
Stumble over the screens
People without sanity speak with primordial screams
New act on discovery

The Deatholution begins
Spreading out like a virus
Released from all our sins
Destroy us.

They tasted blood
Within a pit of gore sleeping all over
They wanted more
They're never satisfied
And they keep sinking lower
Deatholution

The Deatholution begins
Spreading out like a virus
Released from all our sins
Destroy us.

They tasted blood
Within a pit of gore sleeping all over
They wanted more
They're never satisfied
And they keep sinking lower
