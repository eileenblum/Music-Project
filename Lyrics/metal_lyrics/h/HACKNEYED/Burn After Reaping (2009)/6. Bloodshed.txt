...Inhale.
Want to lick it
We're passing
Face to face on streets.
Blood drenched thoughts of wars and battles past
White eyes stare out of faces red and I need, want to lick it, out of my face, and to smell the sweat

One for the others... and the others for blood
This is the day of reckoning.
Days of greed, don't you hit me.
You fucking hasty cunt
...and it always goes like breath, breath
Like I'm gonna suffocate
Breath, breath
Like I'm the reckoning.
Like the others of the bloodshed generation once.
Like the others of the bloodshed... years ago

Hit me and I'll rise to...
Fight again and will shed the blood of you
All against all.
All against one
Till life ends
Till life is gone
Till life is gone..
We're passing

Face to face at war.
At war.
Blood drenched thoughts, fighting for a bloody cause
White eyes stare out of faces red and I will, want to lick it out of my face, and to smell your fear.

One for the others and the others for the blood
This is the day of reckoning
Days of greed
Gonna lick it
It's fucking tasty

Blood
Like the days before
The days until you rot
And it always goes like breath, breath
Like I'm gonna suffocate
Breath, breath
Like I am the reckoning

Like the others of a bloodshed generation once.
Like the others of the bloodshed...
Are against all, are against one
Till life ends
Till life is gone... is gone
Hear me, I am the lord of death and suffering to you
Hear me, I am the lord of...
Hear me, I am the lord of death and suffering to you
Hear me, I am the lord of... exhale...
