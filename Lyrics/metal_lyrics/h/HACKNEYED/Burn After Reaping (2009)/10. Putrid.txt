We are the face of carnage
Hurdle for the poster nation
Reason for the constipation of this frightened world
The lights obscured
The night brings fear
Nightmares flames are coming near
Fire is getting out of control

Keep sinking in the stench of fear
Helpless in their search of freedom makes them hate
I am the one
I am the one to dominate
I deny my teachings in my inexperienced
You'll deny yours in your inexperienced youth
Inexperienced youth

We are the face of carnage
Voices for a generation
Reason of the suffocation
Of this blood drenched world
Their lives erased
The days are unclear
Nightmares rage is coming near
People are getting out of control

Keep sinking in the stench of fear
Helpless in their search of freedom makes them hate
I am the one
I am the one to dominate
I deny my teachings in my inexperienced
You'll deny your dreamings in your inexperienced youth

Like an empty grave
Learned too late
Burnt by hate
I am the one to dominate
When my memories erase
