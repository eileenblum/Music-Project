Meat
In a plane
Locked in chains
High above the trees
Roller coaster, ground gets closer
Had to hear their screams

Weed flavoured
Weed flavoured meat

I've got it
I've got it
It sounds a bit perverted
To get my meat
Most of my mates had to bleed
I've got it
I've got it
Bridged a gap in the market
Had to stoop deep the coin the weed flavoured meat

My eyes open
I'm not broken
There's nothing here to eat
Lots of trees
Lots of greens
I've got to have my meat

Weed flavoured
Weed flavoured meat

Die Meat shouldn't cry
Stop asking why
Just die

I've got it
I've got it
It sounds a bit perverted
To get my meat
Most of my mates had to bleed
I've got it
I've got it
Bridged a gap in the market
Had to stoop deep the coin the weed flavoured meat

I've got it
I've got it

It sounds a bit perverted
But now i have what i need
My sweet weed flavoured meat
Weed flavoured meat
