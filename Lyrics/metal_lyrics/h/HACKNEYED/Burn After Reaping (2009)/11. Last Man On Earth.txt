I'm the last
I'm dying
I've left no one behind
Lived with open eyes

But no I'm old and blind
Can't see the desolation
But my old bones can see
Sit on a wasted planet

It's my last memory
I'm the last man on earth
I'm dying
I'm the last man on earth
I'm dying

I've wiped them all away
Scoured them from this world
No one left to play
No one left to plague

In flames of immolation
The last of them is gone
In the race of survival
I'm the one who won

I'm dying dying
I'm the last man
I'm dying dying
I'm the last man on earth

Desolation
Contemplation

I'm the last man on earth
I'm dying
I'm the last man on earth
I'm dying

I've wiped them all away
Scoured them from this world
No one left to play
No one left to plague

In flames of immolation
The last of them is gone
In the race of survival
I'm the one who won

I'm dying dying
I'm the last man and I'm dying dying
I'm the last man on earth
Desolation
Contemplation

I'm dying dying
I'm the last man
I'm dying dying

I'm the last man on earth
I've left no one to flee
On a waste planet
My last memory

I'm dying dying
I'm last man on earth
