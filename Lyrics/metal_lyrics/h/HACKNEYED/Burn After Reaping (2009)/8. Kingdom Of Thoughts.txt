For all in hell
For a long time I suppressed my desire to find a place a refuge with impenetrable walls
For this I'm locked inside my inner tower, inside my kingdom
My kingdom
My kingdom of thoughts

Driven by this desire, we're only plague each other
Burn like a wire
Shit like yours I don't require
My survival is certain, but yours is not

In my kingdom
My kingdom of
I'm burning with desire
To wipe you from my dreams
For this hour I'll wallow in your pain filled screams

My survival is certain, but yours is not
In my kingdom
My kingdom
My kingdom of thoughts

My kingdom of thoughts
Raping
Kill
Go

Driven by this desire
We're only plague each other
Burn like a wire
Shit like yours I don't require

My survival is certain, but yours is not
In my kingdom
My kingdom
My kingdom of thoughts

Kingdom of
Kingdom of thoughts
From the ancestors to me
I'm not the one they wanted me to be

Feel my fire
Feel my blade
Now I'm the one who's going to escape
Escape

My kingdom
My kingdom of
