[Vers 1]
All we want is to survive
defend our land and our life
In our hand a metal blade
to fight this force of (raging) hate

Brave at heart we'll face the end
united we must stand
For our kingdome we will die,
raise our banners high

[Refrain]

Riding through Hell
For freedome we fight
in glory we're.
Riding through Hell

[C Part]

For all our people, who are praying for us
For all the victims, who believe in us
They must know: We'll be always there!
To protect our land
forever!

[Refrain]

Riding through Hell
For freedome we fight
in glory we're.
Riding through Hell

[Vers 2]

Now the battle comes to end
Down on their knees the enemy will repent
Now the king retakes his crown
never let it down - again!

[Refrain]

Riding through Hell
For freedome we fight
in glory we're.
Riding through Hell
