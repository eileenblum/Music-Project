[INTRO]
I' m lost in a sphere
what am I doing here
the time machine
my ultimate dream
back in time
the gateway now is mine
should I stop at last
and never see the past
tonight it will be done
and I will be the one
to discover to the core
like no other did before

[VERS 1]

I just stepped into a time
when man fought to be alive
the only thing they wanted
the right to choose for their life
to leave as free men their own style
but the time moves on and we're here
just for a while
then we die

[VERS 2]

I'm going even beyond
the ancient traces of man
a paradise so divine
will never come back again
we'll destroy it in the end
but time moves on and we're here
just for a while
then we die

[BRIDGE]

WHOOHH
what is next to see
whatever happens to me
I have no fear, ready for more
on my mission to seek and explore
but I am lost and all alone
but some day I will get home

[CHORUS]

but now I need to go
cause I need to know
what the future will be like
I want to see a new horizon
that's why I must go on

cause I need to know
about the future of mankind
I need to go

that's why I am here
that's my destiny
there will be a time
peaceful and divine

and I do believe in tomorrow
tomorrow will be so sweet
and the time moves on
but we can change our fate
it's not too late!

[SOLO]

[BREAK]

I 've been traveling the vast
of time to see at last
a gateway to a land
to be free in the end

but I'm lost and all alone
but some day I will be home

[CHORUS]

but now I need to go
