[Vers 1]

So many things
I could bring to the world
I would give my life
to save the human race
of a possible danger
I watch the land and sea

[Bridge 1]

Then I wonder
where are the bad guys
who want to destroy me
There's no work tonight
but I need some practice
Where's the challange in the streets
Where hides the devil's hand
I wonder where did the killers go
I don't need to break free

[Refrain 1]

There's no need tonight
to defend the world
Ohh Lord,
why did you send me here
From far beyond
I came for everyone
Who needs to be saved
someday.

[Vers 2]

You gave me my powers
but I can't use them
What's wrong with this world?
I will search for a million years

[Bridge 1]

Then I wonder
where are the bad guys
who want to destroy me
There's no work tonight
but I need some practice
Where's the challange in the streets
Where hides the devil's hand
I wonder where did the killers go
I don't need to break free

[Solo]

[Refrain 2]

There's no need tonight
to defend the world
Ohh Lord,
why did you send me here
From far beyond
I came for everyone
Who needs to be saved
someday.

[Refrain 3]

There's no need tonight
to defend the world
Ohh Lord,
why did you send me here
From far beyond
I came for everyone
Who needs to be saved
someday.
