[Vers 1]
Somewhere there is a land
made of the highest mountains
and golden sand
Only one man can find this place
and they chose me to save our race

[Bridge 1]
Heavens, help me to find the way
to freedome before judgment day
But I'm worried if we don't be in time
The evil comes to cross the line

[Refrain 1]
Where's the promised land -
up in the sky
Where is the promised land -
Until I've found our freedome
I will not die

Where's the promised land -
my destiny
Where's the promised land -
I need a guiding light
to make my clouded eyes see

[Vers 2]
Now I ride and I feel it's right
going faster than light
through the night
Once in a while I'm closing my eyes
and dreaming of the promised land

[Bridge 1]
Oh Lord, you gave me my faith
We're getting closer
reaching this magic place
I open my eyes and realize
we are free
turning my head
they're still after me 

[Solo]

[Refrain 2]
Where's the promised land -
up in the sky
Where is the promised land -
Until I've found our freedom
I will not die

Where's the promised land -
my destiny
Where's the promised land -
I need a guiding light
to make my clouded eyes see
