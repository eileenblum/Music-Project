[Vers 1:]

Day by day
we become man
in this world
in all the nations
take your time - no regulations

[Bridge 1:]

I'm not ready yet
how to life my life?
I'm afraid of the wind, of the sun, to be free

[Refrain 1:]

No, I won't go far away from home
There are my frinds, my family
I need to stay
When I feel the time has come
I will find a power inside me
to leave what all the others left behind

My turn will come - My turn will come

[Vers 2:]

I will trust my inspiration
I'm not like the population
We will see the new generation

[Bridge 2:]

I won't take the risk
to miss my life
I'm afraid of the wind, of the sun, to be free

[Refrain 2:]

No, I won't go far away from home
There are my frinds, my family
I need to stay
When I feel the time has come
I will find a power inside me
to leave what all the others left behind
