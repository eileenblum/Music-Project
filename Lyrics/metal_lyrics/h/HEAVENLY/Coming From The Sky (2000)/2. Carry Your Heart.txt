[VERS 1]
I work all day to get harder money
nothing that can make me high
drivin' a fast car I live in a castle
but tell me why I wanna die

[BRIDGE 1]
I need a miracle, spirit of my life
somewhere, someday I will find happiness
my dream today is to leave my lonelyness
but finally it's you to help me to be a better man
like a rainbow in the sky
this fairytale is mine

[CHORUS 1]
I can fly to make my life with you
climb the mountain touch the sun
and I know inside me I'm the ONE
to carry your heart ...to the stars

[SOLO]

[BRIDGE 2]
I need a miracle, spirit of my life
somewhere, someday I will find happiness
my dream today is to leave my lonelyness
but finally it's you to help me to be a better man
like a rainbow in the sky
this fairytale is mine

[CHORUS 2]
I can fly to make my life with you
climb the mountain touch the sun
and I know inside me I'm the ONE
to carry your heart ...

I can fly to make my life with you
climb the mountain touch the sun
...

I can fly to make my life with you
climb the mountain touch the sun
and I know inside me I'm the ONE
to carry your heart ...
carry it for our life
OH to carry your heart to the stars
