[Vers 1]

If there is something wrong
you go away
There is no reason to stay here
you must leave

On your way - far away!

[Bridge 1]

When you're alone
when your life belongs to you
You just take it now
without thinking

[Refrain 1]

And I believe
you don't forget the hard days
And I believe today
you can find your way
You'll be there
when everyone needs you
and your love
forever

And I believe
you don't forget your home
And I believe today
you can find your way
Therefore we life
and so you must change your life
forever

On your way - on your way!

[Solo]

[Bridge 2]

When you're alone
when your life belongs to you
You just take it now
without thinking

[Refrain 2]

And I believe
you don't forget the hard days
And I believe today
you can find your way
You'll be there
when everyone needs you
and your love
forever

And I believe
you don't forget your home
And I believe today
you can find your way
Therefore we life
and so you must change your life
forever
