[Vers 1]
Tomorrow - the century
what will we find
the fall of mankind?
Milleniums are calling
is this the end
should we repent?
Nobody knows
what will happen tonight
will there be darkness
or will there be light?

The fututre - uncertain
Heaven or Hell
no one can tell
The fury - the fire
mankind must learn
or we will burn
Nobody knows
what tomorrow will be
who can forsee our destiny?

[Bridge]
Why are we so scared
to step into a new time?
It's not the end ot the world
the end of the line
Step by step
we're moving ahead
there's a force with/in us
No one can change it,
no one can change it

[Chorus]
Ready to face life, to carry on
look straight ahead
- ohh - togeather we're strong
Lord, tell me that I am wrong
and that life will be the same
give us the power, a single glance
for you are our only chance!

[Vers 2]
The Evil is coming
to seek and destroy
and we are it's toy
The Kingdome of freedome
we must defend until the end
Nobody knows
what will happen tonight
will there be darkness
or will there be light?

Mankind - wake up
Ohh, we have made
so many mistakes
Rich man or poor man
tell me, who is to blame?
Nobody knows
what tomorrow will be
who can forsee our destiny?

[Break]
[Narrator]
My son, attend to my words
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge:
but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet
from fear of evil.

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Why are we so scared

[Chorus]
Ready to face life, to carry on
