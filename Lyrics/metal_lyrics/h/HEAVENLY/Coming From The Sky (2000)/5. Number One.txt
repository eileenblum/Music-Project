[Vers 1]

When the fate is on our side
When the finish is near
you rise up to the sky

A part of him is born to ride
to be the best - to pass the last
Fast as hell - he will give his life
he will do everything to win and
to be No. 1, to be No. 1.

[Bridge 1]

He's ready now
soon the race will begin for him
His life's passing by in front his eyes
No one knows what's going on in his mind
But I know and he know's
that he might burn and will not return

[Refrain 1]

No turning back
,cause the race is all you need
Don't try to stop him
he loves to take the risk
No turning back
,cause the winner's inside you
Don't try to stop him
Let his dream become real this time

[Solo]

To be No. 1, to be No. 1.

[Bridge 1]

He's ready now
soon the race will begin for him
His life's passing by in front his eyes
No one knows what's going on in his mind
But I know and he know's
that he might burn and will not return

[Refrain 2]

No turning back
,cause the race is all you need
Don't try to stop him
he loves to take the risk
No turning back
,cause the winner's inside you
Don't try to stop him
Let his dream become real this time
Refrain 3

No turning back
,cause the race is all you need
Don't try to stop him
Let his dream become real this time
