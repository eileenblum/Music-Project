[VERS 1]
There're sometimes when I'm far away
and fight so hard to save the human race
I want you to be by my side
if you're not here I can't fly

Take my hand and come with me
I'll offer you everything you need
I'll show you that love is not a lie
and I'll always be with you until I die

[BRIDGE 1]
Now it's time for you and me
to find the words and to break free
how long could you wait
you are my fate

[CHORUS]
But before you know what you feel
you must know that you light up my life
and make me real
but before you know you let me dream
and I drawn in your eyes so divine
and I hope soon you'll be mine

[VERS 2]
Once again you're on my mind
if you're not there i can't survive
but I can change the world and make it bright
on the quest for love I will fight until I die

[SOLO]

[BRIDGE 2]
No time for strangers
who try to separate us
cause you know
my life depends on you
and you can make my dream come true
I'll guarding you anywhere
I will be there

[CHORUS 2]
But before you know what you feel
you must know that you light up my life
and make me real
but before you know you let me dream
and I drawn in your eyes so divine
and I hope soon you'll be mine...

[CHORUS 3]
But before you know what you feel
you must know that you light up my life
and make me real
but before you know you let me dream
and I drawn in your eyes so divine
and I hope soon you'll be mine
