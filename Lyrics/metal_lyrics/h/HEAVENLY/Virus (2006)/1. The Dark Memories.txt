After the nightmares
Weak is our mind
It could be the devil hiding inside everyone
Throughout these visions, it's reality
But now it makes me wonder should I
carry on my way

[Solo: Olivier]

So close to the edge
Black is the night
From here to madness there's only a short step to die
Lost in the trouble, eternally
I am crawling in the fire and reaching eternity

Far away
Beyond the sky
I come alive again
Screaming in the wild
Resound everywhere
The light is in the air

I still believe
Cold is my way
I'll do all in my power
To leave the pain
Just behind me, use your mind
Relieve your soul

Head into the wind
Cold is my way
Make my mind go blank
To leave regrets
Just behind me, use your mind
To rise above
With all your might, use your mind
And relieve your soul

[Chorus:]
As we know time is a great healer
Salvation and hope set me free
My joy of life and happiness returned
I'm still fighting against relapse
But the light will shine forever
The scares will never leave me
Laugher kills time whereas tears seem long
We're not controlling our ways
Within living memory
Salvation

[Solo: Olivier / Charley]

Head into the wind
Cold is my way
Make my mind go blank
To leave regrets
Just behind me, use your mind
To rise above
With all your might, use your mind
And relieve your soul

[Chorus]

Memory, memory, memory
