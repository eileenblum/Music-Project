I try to enter deep inside
And devour everything
All I need is power
"To take control till destroying"

To see the light of the seven signs
And reach the prophecy
All I feel is anger inside
"To take control till destroying"
To break down till the end

Just hide away into your mind
There is no place for me to die
Call me invincible spy!
"Fear and panic everywhere"

You can pass away
I'll keep your soul and all remains
I'm vicious caller
"Tears and chaos everywhere"
"End is not so far away"

The dark side of the realm, Get behind
The secret of the beast, Get behind
You will find my hideout
It's too late all is done
I just bring bloodshed and cries...

[Chorus:]
And the day will come here below
When the light will cross my destiny
Domination to succeed to the crown
Just remember the man you used to be
Cause when the virus comes
It's time for victory

Just die, And bring me all of your mind
"To crush the fierce inside"
Just die, And bring me all of your mind

[Solo: Charley / Oliver / Oliver]

That's right we run into the wind
No way out as long as you dig the grave
To crown we created by human beings
Drop in the wild and all over the world
We will cross the seven seas
The reign of terror, rule supreme...

And the day will come here below
When the light will cross my destiny

[Chorus]
