Don't close your eyes in the darkness
You know men you can rescue mankind
Look in the past and tell me what you stare
Through the fire, the flesh explode
Open your mind in this high fever
And reflect to steer clear of the worst
This could be heaven or this could be hell
Beware of tomorrow
We are close to the edge

I believed it for a while
But disaster is not far behind
Donât you hear the cries
Rising up all over again
To save what the entire human race
Had left

Letâs talk about fight
Letâs talk about misery
Letâs talk about hate
Thereâs no way
Take over of power
While forgetting reality
Spill blood on fire
For life and beyond grave

[Solo: Olivier]

Sin after sin the damage is done
And the countdown has already started
May god forgive us to look away
And still left the sadness grow
So you can feel the loneliness
As if in a dream out of time
Just cling to power or just cling to life
And care about tomorrow to care for the past

I believed it for a while
But disaster is not far behind
Donât you hear the cries
Rising up all over again
To save what the entire human race
Had left

Letâs talk about fight
Letâs talk about misery
Letâs talk about hate
Thereâs no way
Take over of power
While forgetting reality
Spill blood on fire
For life and beyond grave

Letâs talk about fight
Letâs talk about misery
Letâs talk about hate
Thereâs no way
Take over of power
While forgetting reality
Spill blood on fire
For life and beyond grave

Now ride out the storm
And take the chance
To find inner peace and to repent
We still carry onâ¦

[Solo: Charley / Olivier]

Letâs talk about fight
Letâs talk about misery
Letâs talk about hate
Thereâs no way
Take over of power
While forgetting reality
Spill blood on fire
For life and beyond grave

Letâs talk about fight
Letâs talk about misery
Letâs talk about hate
Thereâs no way
Take over of power
While forgetting reality
Spill blood on fire
For life and beyond grave

[Solo: Olivier]
