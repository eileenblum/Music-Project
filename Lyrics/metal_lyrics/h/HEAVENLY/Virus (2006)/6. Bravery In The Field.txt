Alone in the dark
When silence is reigning after victory ride
Carry on, along the way
Faithful to your dreams
To reach for the stars and proudly attain glory
Rising up out of the flames
To raise your armours high
Face to face with your destiny

There are so many things
Cling to the past, hard are all your memories

Carry on, along the way
But don't falling down
Long is the road leading to earthly paradise
Rising up out of the flames
To raise your armours high
Face to face with your destiny

[Pre-Chorus:]
Forward to survive
Without leaving the fear appear
Fighters ones for all and brave out with courage
To the death we still repent

[Chorus:]
We are glorious, glorious
Mighty is right again
Bravery in the field all everyone
Unity is getting number one
So glorious, glorious
The enemy has run away
It's victory when all is done
Unity is getting number one

[Solo: Oliver / Kevin / Charley]

There was a time
Riding across the way
Lost and tired
In the cold light of day
Resounded in the wild
We were the chosen ones
Soldiers for better or for worse

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
