[Korea bonus track]

[Solo: Charley]

Find the flaw in my hand,
The Joker on my card,
Find the way for me to hide.

Find the wound in my head, cos' he's tryin'
to break on through,
No order for the Joker,
Still wild and cruel.

Try to enter the game,
To carry on the fight,
Try to save me from his claws.

Fight the demons of hell, and we'll
keep searching for the truth,
The survivors of a dead world,
Free, strong and proud.

[Chorus:]
I'm still playing without turning the rules,
I'm still standing despite these fields of doom,
Cause he's crawling in the night,
And snaking my heart.

Find the flaw in my hand,
The Joker on my card,
Find the way for me to hide.

Find the wound in my head, cos' he's tryin'
to break on through,
No order for the Joker,
So wild and cruel.

[Chorus]

[Solo: Charley / Oliver]
