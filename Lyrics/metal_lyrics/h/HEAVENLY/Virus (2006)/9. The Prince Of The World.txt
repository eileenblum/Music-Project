Don't be afraid
Go straight on
Cause no one knows what the future holds

Past regrets
And loneliness
I gave it a lot of thought to see the light

I must go on
For all time
And never return

[Chorus:]
I have to say goodbye
And it's breaking my heart
Forever
I wish to carry on
But there're so many places in this world
I'm following my destiny
Crossing the valleys
The seven seas all over the earth
And I'm swearing on my honour
To dethrone the prince of the world

[Solo: Oliver / Charley / Oliver]

[Chorus]
