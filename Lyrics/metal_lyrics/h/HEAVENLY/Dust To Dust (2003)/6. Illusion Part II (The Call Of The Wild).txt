Running through the times
I have touched the misery
There we got no smile
People lived in poverty
But still the nature grew
Riding in the night
I have killed my enemies
Bleeding to survive
Breaking down technologies
To see the nature grow
Fight for freedom
Let's unite to carry on
it's time to defeat
not run away
or on the other side we will cross
victims of our past we got no failure
never return oh we got no no return
then we can
rise up the universe to give
to the world a glimmer of joy
rise up the universe and tell everyone
to hear the call of the wild
riding, riding for tomorrow
saving, saving the kingdom crown
silence is reigning with sorrow
guilty we are eternally.
Fight for freedom
Let's unite to carry on
it's time to defeat
not return away
or on the other side we will cross
victims of our past we got no failure
never return oh we got no no return
then we can
rise up the universe to give
to the world a glimmer of joy
rise up the universe and tell everyone
to hear the call of the wild
rise up the universe to give
to the world a glimmer of joy
rise up the universe and tell everyone
to hear the call of the wild
