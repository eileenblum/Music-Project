Welcome to the dark side
Suffer the wound i inflicted upon you, as a vampire now you shall be
damned. Fear you shall forever fell and induce to human heart, on your
quest for blood. Thou shall not tempt to find me, the master of all, the
bringer of your tragedy. But alone in darkness you shall dwell for
centuries to come. The night will be your friend, and you sakk hide from
daylight. It's the end of your human soul, but the beginning of your
eternal doom.
