Sun is going down
Replacing the sleep
fight will carry on
tonight, tonight
I have to run away and
Find another place to go
And still feel alone.
I'm in this world
To be alive
and I can give
All they'll never find.
Something I dream to cross the freedom way
"But now you are powerfull"
Master guide me
Dragon's fire, prayers an thunder
Will not change my mind
Cross and weapons, thousand peoples
Will not save your life.
Cause no one,
Can you believe me
Will steal my Victory, Victory.
Hole water, stakes and hunters
You're loosing you time
Violence's calling me from hell
And I will make you die.
Cause no one,
Can you believe me
Will steal my Victory, Victory.
Suddenly fear is within me
Visions of horror I will see
And the evil crossing horizon
Doing a mission
Changing the world
Forever more
Now the corpses're bleeding on fire
Screaming in higher
Forever more.
And the evil crossing horizon
Doing a mission
Changong the world
Forever more.
Now the corpses're bleeding on fire
Screaming in higher
Forever more.
I'm the fear, through the times
I'm the creature of the night
Look at me, pain goes by
I'm the creature of the night
I have no choice
To use my force
And carry on my way in the wild
I got a mission,
it's to be free
Revolution of liberty
Victory.
And the evil crossing horizon
Doing a mission
Changing the world
Forever more.
Now the corpses're bleeding on fire
Screaming in higher
Forever more.
I'm the fear, through the times
I'm the creature of the night
Look at me, pain goes by
I'm the creature of the night
I have no choice
To use my force
And carry on my way in the wild
I got a mission,
it's to be free
Revolution - Nation
I fight you to live
And my victory appeared
