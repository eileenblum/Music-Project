Fear, fear's reaching my heart
When silence's reigning in the dark
Powers are in my hand
To fight to deliverance
I know that the time has come
to try to kill him, here I come
revenge's falling on hell
I fight for deliverance
Oh I'm riding through the night
Searching for the way to come back to life
But it's so far
So long to cross
The quest is hard
Hard as my force.
Right now till kingdom come
From here from far beyond
Shadows are guiding me on my way
To fight for freedom and life
Fight for right
Mirror, oh mirror
Reflect me once again
Mirror oh mirror
Can't you see my face
but the anger and fire
carry on my way
master, oh master
I'm calling you away
to defeat my pain
Illusion, illusion.
Mirror, oh mirror
Reflect me once again
Mirror oh mirror
Can't you see his face
but the anger and fire
carry on his way
master, oh master
he's calling you away
Oh I'm riding through the night
Searching for the way to come back to life
But it's so far
So long to cross
The quest is hard
Hard as my force.
Right now till kingdom come
From here from far beyond
Shadows are guiding me on my way
To fight for freedom and life
Fight for right
