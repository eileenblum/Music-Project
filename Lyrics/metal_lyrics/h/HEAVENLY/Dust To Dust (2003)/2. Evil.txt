Running across the dark way
Bleeding but still alive
Carry the mark of demon
Suffering through the nigh
Is it the end when all is done
When soul climb in the sky
Fighting to carry on
on the other side of the life
there is no world
screaming to break the silence
the divine light is on your way
the fear, the pain, the violence
defeated me in hell
is it the end when all is done
when soul climb in the sky
fighting to carry on
on the other side of the life
appear a world
here through the light
there's a land where I'm staying alive
it's not real i was killed
by a beast now i belong to heaven.
Glory to the miracle
I was damned, now I'm living again
Glory to the miracle
And the heaven gave me back my soul
Back to my mind
Full of mist
Rising up to the sky
Safe and sound
On the ground
I am here to ride into the sky
Glory to the miracle
I was died and buried without blames
Glory to the miracle
And the heaven gave me back my soul
Tonight - Strong and awake
Awake - saved by a light
Light - I believe I am the chosen one
The chosen one - Close the edge
Edge - I saw the sign
Sign - Is ti hell or is it paradise
Is it paradise - So far away
Away - into the sky
Sky - There's a star which is shining in my heart
Shining in my heart - Back to the end
End - I knew my guide
Guide - I am the son of evil
The sun's shining in my dreams
The light is getting hot
Saved by eternity
I have seen death so close
Away, awhile the angels crossed the sky
But I'm condemned to stay here.
Tonight - Strong and awake
Awake - saved by a light
Light - I believe I am the chosen one
The chosen one - Close the edge
Edge - I saw the sign
Sign - Is ti hell or is it paradise
Is it paradise - So far away
Away - into the sky
Sky - There's a star which is shining in my heart
Shining in my heart - Back to the end
End - I knew my guide
Guide - I am the son
of evil
