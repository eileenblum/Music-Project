Now it's time to get my life back
Stolen years ago
I have ridden to see you dying
"Are you insane to cross my way
Me, the king of doom
I've never seen someone talk to me like you"
Bravely, still alive
There's a place for you in hell
"Hell is on your way"
Ready to survive
Cause I will fight again -  again
Deadly was the road I've followed
To find your hideout
I have sworn to kill you through the night
"I am the evil
I've crossed all the ages
Between you and I"
Bravely, still alive
There's a place for you in hell
"Hell is on your way"
Ready to survive
Cause I will fight again -  again
Time has come
To bring power to my soul
all my wasted days
Dive into dreams
Will finally try to pay
To rise from the ashes
Time has come
To bring power to my soul
And the sun will shine
Its rays warm up my skin
To see the light of day
I carry on to blow him away
To kingdom come
Battle takes a while
Our powers light up the sky
So close to steal the crown
Gods are by my side
So I shall avercome
Time has come
To bring power to my soul
all my wasted days
Dive into dreams
Will finally try to pay
To rise from the ashes
Time has come
To bring power to my soul
And the sun will shine
Its rays warm up my skin
To see the light of day
For life and beyond the grave
Carry on to blow him away
To kingdom come our final destiny
