After the rain would be the sunshine
And all the same I feel weak
The heroes win and never die
In all the fairy tales
Memories growing in my mind
I'm bringing it all with me away
So now I Have to regain the sky
The way of light, the land of braves
The heroes win and never die
But I saw the victory
The wounds are stronger am I
My life is over again
And I'm bleeding inside
Crawlin on the road
That Leads to the paradise(the sky)
as a human as am I
rising up with head held high
cause I defeated master
the nightmares creatures
I am free
flying beyond the stars
dust to dust
(I'm) leaving with (a) human's soul
printed on my mind
the life I passed away
look to the sky
you'll see me again

[Solo]

high up in the sky
I watch the universe
the land called paradise
is far away from earth
but I would love to remain
I bid you farewell
I am free
flying beyond the stars
dust to dust
(I'm) leaving with (a) human's soul
printed on my mind
the life I passed away
look to the sky
you'll see me again
look to the sky
you'll see me again
