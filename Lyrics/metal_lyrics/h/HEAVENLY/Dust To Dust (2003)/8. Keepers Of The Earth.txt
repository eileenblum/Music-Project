Can you believe me
if I tell you the truth
I live eternally
Death is just for you
Power and glory
Are invading your thoughts
Meanwhile misery
Is killing too fast
I'm looking the sky
I am waiting for more
Many people are dying
Again any more
I'm wondering if we will find
Solutions to be close
We are free to decide
Make your choice
Mad is human's pride
To defy paradise
Cause we are here
The keepers of the earth
Raise your armours high
Our land is so divine
And we will stay here
The keepers of the earth
But time is running out
Holy wars victims
Are sending to their doom
Dictators are reigning
thinking they are gods
The last century
Was deadly more cruel
Bombs were atomic
Million live have gone
I'm looking at the sky
I am waiting for more
We are free to decide
Make your choice
Mad is human's pride
To defy paradise
Cause we are here
The keepers of the earth
Raise your armours high
Our land is so divine
And we will stay here
The keepers of the earth
But time is running out
I'm looking at the sky
I am waiting fore more
We are free to decide
Make your choice
Mad is human's pride
To defy paradise
Cause we are here
The keepers of the earth
Raise your armours high
Our land is so divine
And we will stay here
The keepers of the earth
But time is running out
Running out
