Illusion, salvation
I have no destination
Just illusions, forever
No future, no more nature
We're going to the wrong direction
Illusion, forever
I crossed the edge
I follow this kind of fairytale
Ride on my way
I have appeared mother nature
Suffering and waiting for a miracle
But there is no miracle
I have been to heaven
Where the sun is shining
Forever
