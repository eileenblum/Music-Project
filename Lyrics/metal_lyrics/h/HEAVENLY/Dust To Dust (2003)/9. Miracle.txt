Freedom is calling me
From the kingdom of humanity
I dream to see the sunlight once again
cause i live through the night
On my way
I'm guilty to regain my life
Or insanity will invade my mind
The realm of darkness is under a curse
Memories of past I regret
And I dream of a forest
Which'll be bigger than the world
I am carried by the wind, to fly
a fairy's passing by away and calling me
to join our destiny
when I saw your face
I've crossed the heaven's way
now we ride together
separated by daylight
man I feel with you
wishes can be come true
since the dawn of time we believe
that love can change our sight of reality
freedom I will fight again
to be number one
oh Lord, I need help
the beast inside me is controlling my soul
condemned to eternity
proudly I will get away
and I'll find the mystery
to enjoy again
until my dream become reality
I'll carry on my way to get power
" I'm the lord for everyone
I am coming from your heart
what you are searching for is on you
can you believe me
I'm the lord for everyone
I am coming from your hearth
what you are searching for is on you
can you believe me "
time has come to fight to become one
rainbows of sky
show me the way
in my heart
love is getting higher
flying like an angel into the wind
by my guide
from here to the road of paradise
till the end
And I dream of a forest
Which'll be bigger than the world
I am carried by the wind, to fly
a fairy's passing by away and calling me
to join our destiny
when I saw your face
I've crossed the heaven's way
now we ride together
separated by daylight
man I feel with you
wishes can be come true
since the dawn of time we believe
that love can change our sight of reality
when I saw your face
I've crossed the heavens way
now we ride together
separated by daylight
The miracle
