[Ben Sotto]

It is the year 3030, machines and androids, 
which have become too perfect, revolt against mankind. 
Men fight to protect their own existence, threatened to perish. 

[intro :]
Fight goes on with victory in our mind
Carry on to keep the earth for human kind

[1st verse :]
It's time for rebellion
Androids are living
Fantasy or nightmare
Human against his machine

[2nd verse :]
Science is the future
That men believed to control
A punishment or a madness
Is falling on earth from beyond
But fight to keep the earth for human kind

[bridge :]
Pray for a destiny where humans will be free
But I wonder if eternity will give a chance to live

[chorus :]
Still believe - land of tomorrow
Still believe - and our nation will be free
Like a dream without war and machines
Still believe - way of tomorrow
Still believe - a dream became reality
Can't you see, imagine we are free and glorious

[solo (Fred)]

[1st break :]
See, do you see the fear turning around us
But I know that we can find the force inside us
To cross the world with future of mankind in our hands
And our dreams to reign all around the world
All over heaven

[2st break :]
Hear, do you hear the tears all around us
Which fall, falling on the ground
Which don't belong to us anymore

[solo 2 (Fred)]
Fight goes on with victory in our mind
Carry on to keep the earth for human kind

[bridge :]
Pray for a destiny where humans will be free
But I wonder if eternity will give us a chance to live

[chorus :]
Still believe - land of tomorrow
Still believe - and our nation will be free
Like a dream without war and machines
Still believe - way of tomorrow
Still believe - a dream became reality
Can't you see, imagine we are free and glorious
