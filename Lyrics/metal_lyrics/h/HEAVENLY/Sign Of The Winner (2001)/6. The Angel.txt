[Ben Sotto]

The sequel of "Condemned to die". 
The man is crossing the line between life and death.

[verse :]
Lord, oh my Lord
Why this place, magic place
The mist is everywhere
The light is in the air
I hear in the sky 
The whisper of the time
I need an answer
A reason to my prayer

[chorus :]
You're the angel
White as the winter
You're the angel
Forever 
You're the angel
White as the winter
You're the angel
Forever 
So far away
Through the light
Through the sky
Til the end of time
You're the angel
White as the winter
You're the angel
White as the winter
White as the wings of life
