[Ben Sotto]

Feeling like an outcast of society, a man meets an alien, 
who shows him that his destiny is not to live on Earth, 
but to accomplish great things on another planet. 

[intro :]
The future is nowhere
It comes to you like a divine star

[1st verse :]
One night when nightmares invaded my head
He appeared to me from the sky
Floated in the air, it dazzled my eyes
And he carried me for a flight

[bridge :]
too tired to understand
I crossed the galaxy
Universe of fire I saw
Showed me so many ways
Then I felt lost in time
I'm a hero, an alien is a friend of mine

[chorus :]
By a fantasy I have found my destiny
Then I knew, that all over the clouds of human kind
Exists another destiny
A world where is growing all love

[2nd verse :]
IN his machine lights surrounded me
Flashed on my face so bright
Left behind me my memories and griefs
Run away after the past 

[bridge :]
So tired to understand
I crossed the galaxy
Universe of fire I saw
Showed me so many ways
Then I felt lost in time
I'm a hero, an alien is a friend of mine

[chorus :]
By a fantasy I have found my destiny
Then I knew, that all over the clouds of human kind
Exists another destiny
A world where is growing all love

[solo (Fred)]

[chorus :]
By a fantasy I have found my destiny
Then I knew, that all over the clouds of human kind
Exists another destiny
A world where is growing all love
By a fantasy I have found my destiny
A world where is growing all love
