[Ben Sotto]

Is there something more beautiful than the world ? 
So why do we keep on destroying it ? 
Look around you, 
you will see that we need to protect and enjoy the world we are living in. 

[intro :]
I have a dream where I saw the earth
Where nature was so glorious
Take the time, look around you
And the world will be better
And the world will be better

[verse :]
Try to understand that it's our land
And we have a chance to become better men with a better way
Try to understand, to become friends
To raise our hands to heaven and regret, a long regret
Then we will realize that world is a gift of the sky

[1st bridge :]
Just look at the rainbow
And the stars are shining so high
Beauty of sky, give me wings to fly
There's so many lights you are between the heaven and life

[2nd bridge :]
Just look at the rainbow
And the stars are shining so high
Enjoy the sky 'cause we live then we die
we have so little time we can't wait

[chorus :]
I have a dream where I saw the earth
Where nature was so glorious
Take the time, look around you
And the world will be better

[solo (Fred)]

[break :]
The pollution is invading the earth
Nobody moves they're closing their eyes
Now it's the time to do something right
Fighting for our progeny to protect our land

[1st bridge :]
Now just look at the rainbow
And the stars are shining so high
Beauty of sky, give me wings to fly
There's so many lights you are between the heaven and life

[2nd bridge :]
Just look at the rainbow
And the stars are shining so high
Enjoy the sky 'cause we live then we die
We have so little time we can't wait

[chorus :]
I have a dream where I saw the earth
Where nature was so glorious
Take the time, look around you
And the world will be better

[chorus :]
I have a dream where I saw the earth
Where nature was so glorious
Take the time, look around you
And the world will be better
Better!
