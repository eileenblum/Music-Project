[Ben Sotto]

When you are a child, you have great and fantastic dreams, 
where you feel so powerful that nothing seems impossible. 
As an adult, you sometimes wish to call the Sandman to go back to these dreams.

[intro :]
Do you remember when
When the sandman came at night
To tuck you child
Read the book of the night
Took you away to the sky

[1st verse :]
I lived many stories
So many ways, so many suns
I knew some mysteries
Where I was killed or glorious

[bridge :]
And I rode against the wind of time
I saw where heroes die but why ?

[chorus :]
I wanted to stay in my world forever
The sandman's magical power can't work forever
The dreamland was my destiny

[solo (Fred /Alex)]

[2nd verse :]
I lived many stories
So many sad, so many fun
I knew some mysteries
Where I was king or one of us

[bridge :]
And I rode against the wind of time
I saw where heroes die but why ?

[chorus :]
I wanted to stay in my world forever
The sandman's magical power can't work forever

[chorus :]
I wanted to stay in my world forever
The sandman's magical power can't work forever
Sandman
