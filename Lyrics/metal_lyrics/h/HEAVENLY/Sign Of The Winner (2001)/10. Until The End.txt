[Ben Sotto]

A man's reflections upon war. 
He tells about what he had gone through during the war, 
and its consequences.

[intro :]
Fires and fear
Are engraved in my brain
Now it's time to realize
That war destroys the Earth

[1st verse :]
There's no words to say what I lived in this war
A game which hurts you and your desires
Alone in this world you're feeling so sad
Wrote the last letter and implored the sky

[bridge :]
Waited for the end
Or waited for the chance
To find the right time and run away
Take the risk to die
To save my life and my country
Carry on my way
To fight for a new destiny

[chorus :]
There'ss such dreams inside me
Which'll never know the glory
Oh Lord of victory
Defeat the misery

[solo (Fred)]

[break :]
Silence
Way of light
Future of the world will depend on the fight
It's time
To become wild
For one peace and for one love
I have to go to say goodbye
Future of mankind will depend on the fight 
The stars shining so high
For one peace and for one love
Until the end, I will fight
For the universe, the rich and for the poor
Tonight is the night
For one peace and for one love
Will reign into our hearts, into our minds
Until the end

[2nd verse:]
There's no words to say what I lived in this war
A game which hurts you and your desires
Alone in this world you're feeling so sad
Wrote the last letter and implored the sky

[bridge :]
Waited for the end
Or waited for the chance
To find the right time and run away
Take the risk to die
To save my life and my country
Carry on my way
To fight for a new destiny

[chorus :]
There's such dreams inside me
Which'll never know the glory
Oh Lord of victory
Defeat the misery

[chorus :]
There's such dreams inside me
Which'll never know the glory
Oh Lord of victory
Defeat the misery
