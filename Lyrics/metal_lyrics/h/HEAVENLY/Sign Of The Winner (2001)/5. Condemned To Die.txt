[Ben Sotto]

A young man, suffering from a disease, is afraid to die. 
Knowing that the end is near, he asks to be guided towards death.

[1st verse :]
Sick in a white room
The disease is invading me
The countdown has begun
My consciousness disappearing

[2nd verse :]
Where is my way
Should I wait for my turn
I have to contemplate the world
A last time in my life

[bridge :]
Then I cried again and I cried again
Running into the wind
Under the sun, fighting the pain inside of me
Step by step my body'll leave my brain
Running into the wind
Under the sun, crossing the edge turbulants of life

[chorus :]
Time will not wait and my future feels so strange
Turning back to live once again
But I know
I'm condemned to die

[solo (Alex/Fred)]

[break :]
I'm getting weaker
My heart's feeling fragile
Lord you let me down
Please before I'm going on
Be my guide

[solo 2 (Fred /Alex)]

[bridge :]
Step by step my body'll leave my brain
Running into the wind
Under the sun, crossing the edge turbulants of life

[chorus :]
Time will not wait and my future feels so strange
Turning back to live once again 
But I know
Yes I know

[chorus :]
Time will not wait and my future feels so strange
Turning back to live once again 
But I know
I know
