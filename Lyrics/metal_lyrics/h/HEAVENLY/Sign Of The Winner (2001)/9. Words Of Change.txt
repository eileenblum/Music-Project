[Ben Sotto]

When you are feeling depressed, 
you must find a force within you to carry on, 
to start a new period of your life. 

[1st verse :]
There's sometimes
when something passes through my mind
And my dreams it looks like real and true
Comes to me
A vision of my life, my story
Can't you see my loneliness and fear

[bridge :]
Like the wind my spirit is flying in the air
Suffering's sharing my nightmares
Until I find my way
Until I find who I am

[chorus :]
I'm waiting for my pride
Chance coming from desire
The future is by my side
Yes I know
I'm waiting for my turn
For my dreams not realized
The last crying for me tonight

[solo (Fred)]

[bridge :]
Like the wind my spirit is flying in the air
Suffering's sharing my nightmares
Until I find my way
Until I find who I am

[chorus :]
I'm waiting for my pride
Chance coming from desire
The future is by my side
Yes I know
I'm waiting for my turn
For my dreams not realized
Last crying for me tonight
I'm waiting for my turn
For my dreams not realized
Last crying for me tonight
