And if the world wasn't made for us
And if life get wrong for you and I
Oh where I should go
Feel so high and low
I am just trying to make my way
When life begins
So we muster all the courage
There's nothing else at all
You and you alone

Nothing matters anymore
I am still here to carry on
To find a reason to believe in me again

Make your dreams comes true
To attain the paradise
Your passion grow
You should open up you heart

Set me free
I am trying to be somebody
Set me free
One step forward to build a better me

Now it's time to use your mind
To be a real man will take a while
I can't wait
I think it everyday
My mother guide me everywhere
She said you should realize
Don't behave badly like a child
I can prove it
Achieve it
Before she become's crazy, crazy, crazy

Make your dreams comes true
To attain the paradise
Your passion grow
You should open up you heart

Set me free
I am trying to be somebody
Set me free
One step forward to build a better me

Leading up the victory
Bleeding deep inside of me
To live on my own
Singing your worries away
Relax still concentrate
Till I reach my goal
What can I do
To find the way

Slowly down the river
If I make a wish tonight
Thinking about yesterday
All memories will clear up the sky

Make your dreams comes true
To attain the paradise
Your passion grow
You should open up you heart

Set me free
I am trying to be somebody
Set me free
One step forward to build a better me
