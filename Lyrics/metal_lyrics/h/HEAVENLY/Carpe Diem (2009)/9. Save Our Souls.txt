From trashes in the rivers
To nuclear devices
Acid rain, hurricanes
Many disquieting signs

Toxic gas factories
Are we living in a brave new world
Here from over there
It's hell on earth

So I can fell the anger
We're all breaking the rules
This wrath of our empire
There's nothing we can do

Too powerless to save
Our sick and fragile mother earth
One step in the sky
And pray for us

I know we won't change
We throw our chance away
Someday somehow
We face a dark destiny
And we all face the same

Life in fear
Life is gold
There's nothing higher will help you so
Take my hand
Enjoy life again
Time is running out
Save our soulsTime is running out
Save our souls

[Solo]

I know we won't change
We throw our chance away
Someday somehow
We face a dark destiny
And we all face the same

Life in fear
Life is gold
There's nothing higher will help you so
Take my hand
Enjoy life again
Time is running out
Save our souls
Time is running out
Save our souls

Life in fear
Life is gold
There's nothing higher will help you so
Take my hand
Enjoy life again
Time is running out
Save our souls
Time is running out
Save our souls
