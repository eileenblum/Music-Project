Can you hear me my lord?
I send you my words,
Through the night to go home.

This battlefield will be my tomb,
A fight without sense,
Thrown me to the ground

Don't want to stay here like a stone,
I beg you a chance,
Are you waiting for...

A reason to save me?
I just need your help,
To pass through the storm.

Carry out, carry out on my way,
Carry out on my way, now,
Scary nights in my head,
Scary fights in my brain I'll...
Hold in your mind,
Hold in your soul,
Your innocence... now

[Speech:]
I'm feeling like never before,
My life comes to end,
Are you searching for...
A reason to save me?
From this sound of hell: the heavy metal

[Solo: Lapauze]

Is reasoning in my heart again,
War is an endless sin,
For those who make a game with our lives

Carry out, carry out on my way,
Carry out on my way, now,
Scary nights in my head,
Scary fights in my brain, so deep down inside...
Holding my mind,
Touching my soul,
He gave me his hand... through the night

[Solo: Corbiaux]

Carry out, carry out on my way,
Carry out on my way, now,
Scary nights in my head,
Scary fights in my brain, so deep down inside...
Holding my mind,
Touching my soul,
Help me to stay... for a while.
