Don't be afraid
Come cross the line
Sliding your hands below
I can't wait
Take my body close
I got something waiting for you

I am still ready
I am still fired up
Show me the way you move on
Sharing the night together oh baby
Take the lead and here we go

Staying in weightiness honey
As long as endless story
Tell me now what's in your head
Tell me what you prefer
Slowly or faster

Making love over and over
Tasting new pleasures again
Life is short so going ahead
You won't regret that!

Let desires out of control
Enjoy the chances of living
Take it now and forever more

Let all your troubles go
Clinging to the joy of living
Take it now and forever more
