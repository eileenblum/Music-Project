Master now we wonder
If you can hear our pain
Do we live this forever more, As long as we breath
Guilty and condemned to fall as far away from the sky
Welcome to this hidden place called Ashen paradise

Bring me back the faith, the way to heaven
Redemption of the past,
Human's disasters
But how did we come to this?
How to resist alone on my own
(we should) All realize a world on the wane
So color the realm to cover our rage
Last to die

We gonna set the world on fire
Humanity's race against time
A little runaway will lead us to demise
Remember child we used to be
Awakened by the miracle of life
There's nothing higher than the sky
Out here in the cold

Find the way to regain the land
"Land have mercy on my soul"
Hold tight, better watch out
"It's coming through the light"
Together here we go, stronger than before
"I hear the darkness call"
Ride for life (to) attain mankind
We all give the best forever more

[Solo: Lapauze / Corbiaux]

Ride up and break the spell
The reign of terror
Victims of witchcraft
(and several) reasons to die for
(united) nations soldiers screaming loud
Reach for a better future
Just fight to rule then
Fight to rule them all

[Solo: Corbiaux / Lapauze]

Find the way to regain the land
"Land have mercy on my soul"
Hold tight, better watch out
"It's coming through the light"

Find the way to regain the land
"Land have mercy on my soul"
Hold tight, better watch out
"It's coming through the light"
Together here we go, stronger than before
"I hear the darkness call"
Ride for life (to) attain mankind
We all give the best forever more
