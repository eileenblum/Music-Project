In the sky
Slowly we are heading for
God's master plan
Decide if you start or done
The holy realm
Soon or later take my heart
No more time to lose before eternity

So now I have to find the way
Leading up to victory
Carry on and don't be afraid
Don't risk to miss your life
And searching away
To attain the force
Somedays better and
somedays worth
Make life easy
Don't waste it
Deep down inside of your eyes:
bright with desire

Life can get better if you take time to realize
Just keep the best let your worries out of your mind
Trust in me my brother then I really show you how
To make your dreams come true
And hear the ode to joy

[Solo]

Life can get better if you take time to realize
Just keep the best let your worries out of your mind

Life can get better if you take time to realize
Just keep the best let your worries out of your mind
Trust in me my brother then I really show you how
To make your dreams come true
And hear the ode to joy
