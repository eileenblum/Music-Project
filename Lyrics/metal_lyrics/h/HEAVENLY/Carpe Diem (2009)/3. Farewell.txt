And there's no easy way out to flee the pain
Still hold a place for you in my heart
I'll go somewhere on my own
Just somewhere I belong
Somewhere out there for me

I sometimes felt that my life was a misery
I couldn't find my place here ending my destiny
Don't say a word, don't try to step me
So do you realize that I am already damned

Towards the land of far away
Lighting up the sky
There's nothing here to celebrate
Silence's reigning in the wild

So I am a vagabond riding the universe
Diving into eternity
I am biding you farewell
Cause I will never back again

And if the night belongs to lovers
The twilight belongs to me
I carry on all alone but my soul still remains
Singing loud to save my honour
Delivery is near
Passing through the stars forever we are free

And there's no easy way out to flee the pain
Still hold a place for you in my heart
I'll go somewhere on my own
Just somewhere I belong
Somewhere out the for me

[Solo: Corbiaux / Lapauze]

And there's no easy way out to flee the pain
Still hold a place for you in my heart
I'll go somewhere on my own
Just somewhere I belong
Somewhere out there for me
