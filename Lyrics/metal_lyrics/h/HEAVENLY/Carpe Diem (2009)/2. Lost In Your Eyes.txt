I've been waiting so long
Bring the past and turning forward
Can you hear me calling you on and on
Our love break my loneliness

In my guest no way to get back
Still brave I'll find her at last
Can you hear me calling you on and on
Our love leading the way

Ride ride ride across the pitfall
Ride ride ride just screaming loud
Ride ride ride watch out of evil
So many things to give you with enough time

Fly, fly so high
Float in the wind
Somewhere for you and I
Close to you I am getting
Lost in your eyes

Light up the sky
Cling to your dreams
Forever begins tonight
I come alive when I am
Lost in your eyes:
Lost into you eyes

[Solo: Corbiaux / Lapauze]

Ride ride ride across the pitfall
Ride ride ride just screaming loud
Ride ride ride watch out of evil
So many things to give you with enough time

Fly, fly so high
Float in the wind
Somewhere for you and I
Close to you I am getting
Lost in your eyes

Light up the sky
Cling to your dreams
Forever begins tonight
I come alive when I am
Lost in your eyes:
Lost into you eyes
