All alone late at night
You never know who you meet in darkness
Hidden in a secret place
Being watched from every sides

Be my guide before succumbed to the desire
How to look away the fallen angels
Crawling here below
I still resist once and again

Find the way out, it's not easy
Find the way out
That's what I am trying to do
Slowly gain ground
I'm struggling along one more and more

Find the way out
Life is a game
Slowly gain ground
Just give me a reason to go
If I taste it, should I love

When it's full moon at midnight
Turning off the light
They are screaming wild
Give yourself over to absolute pleasure
To attain the highest top

So carry on holding my name
Tonight you belong to me
So climbing higher all together
And sailing the seven seas

There's nothing better here on earth
Beware addiction is near
Falling down or glorious
Faced with desire shall we kneel

Coming closer to myself
I see the devil in your eyes
The dark still remains
A last temptation out of my mind

Rising up from the ashes of my own grave
Too many ideas for you and I
Relax or restrain
Try to resist once and again

When it's full moon at midnight
Turning off the light
They are screaming wild
Give yourself over to absolute pleasure
To attain the highest top

So carry on holding my name
Tonight you belong to me
Climbing higher all together
And sailing the seven seas

Nothing better here on earth
Beware addiction is near
Falling down or glorious
Faced with desire shall we kneel

[Solo: Lapauze / Corbiaux]

Just give me a reason to go
If I taste it, should I love

When it's full moon at midnight
Turning off the light
They are screaming wild
Give yourself over to absolute pleasure
To attain the highest top

So carry on holding my name
Tonight you belong to me
So climbing higher all together
And sailing the seven seas

Nothing better here on earth
Beware addiction is near
Falling down or glorious
Faced with desire shall we kneel
