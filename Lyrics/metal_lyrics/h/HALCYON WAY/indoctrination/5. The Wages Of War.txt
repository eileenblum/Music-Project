If we knew then what we know
Weâd have raised the swords and shields
With faith deal the fatal blow
And send the pigs to potterâs field

Slaying devils made from sand
Crushing golems made of clay
As the kings of Persia bleed from
The rolling thunder, the bringer of fate

These are the wages of war
The price of liberty
These are the wages of war
The wolf is outside, and itâs hungry and cold

Red eyes glare hungry in the dark
White gleaming teeth tear you apart
A predator armed with a judas grin
Distracting you while the threat is within

You can live as the free, or die as a slave
The battle is to the strong and brave
You can live the dream and decide to change
Resolve will send them to their grave

These are the wages of war
The price of liberty
These are the wages of war
The wolf is outside, and itâs hungry and cold
These are the wages of war
The price of liberty
These are the wages of war
Our daughters and sons will take up arms for the cause
