I won't take no for an answer
I will not retreat or concede
I will embrace the struggle
Crushing all that impedes me
I will not waste my chances
They will not pass me by
I will seize the moment
Until the day I die

[Chorus:]
March through the adversity
Break through the walls
In torment we're conceived
We climb; you crawl
In time it'll be revealed
We won't take the fall
In torment we're conceived
We climb, you crawl

Born from pain - this is my proclamation!
Born from pain - we will not be denied!

You can never stop me
I will not be denied
As the sun will rise tomorrow
And the certainty of tides

This is my proclamation!
We will not be denied!

Born from pain
Conceived in torment
In faith and flames
With blistered hands we engage
