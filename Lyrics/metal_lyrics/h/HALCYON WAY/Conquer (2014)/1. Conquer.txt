When faced with tribulation
You can accept the chains
Or proclaim your liberation
And see your life regained
In clutches of affliction
You will feel the strain
In agony of separation
No words can ever explain...

The cords of desolation
Determined to abrade
Second chances handed out
Wake up, for you remain

You've got to burn it down!

[Chorus:]
When your flesh betrays you
You've got to rise above
When your blood forsakes you
This fire will be enough
When your cup runs over
This is not a drill
Prepare for battle
You go in for the kill

You've got to conquer
You've got to burn it down
You'll make it suffer
You burn it down to the ground
You've got to conquer
You've got to burn it down
You'll make it suffer
You burn it down to the ground

I know it's cold outside
And I've seen the signs
These days are all that's left
So cling to what you find
