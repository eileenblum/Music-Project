My home I run to
Where all my dreams were born

Is this the final moment of which you're tethered to?
Broken dreams out of focus
Is this what's left of you?

In the camera eye you're drifting
Your will is severed through

It's not enough
You fade to memory
It's not enough
You crown the fool

My home I run to
Where all my dreams were born
I hope I find it
Before I lose my faith

Blood shot eyes and weary whispers become your trademark form
Conquered mind with no spark
Is this what's left of you?

The fool with scorn is crowned in worship
Fires once burned bright are dim

It's not enough
You fade to memory
It's not enough
You crown the fool

[2x]
My home I run to
Where all my dreams were born
I hope I find it
Before I lose my faith

When the path is washed away
Into a crowd of weary souls
Hearts of stone, the truth untold
Fools crowned in worship

When the path is washed away
Into a crowd of weary souls
Hearts of stone, the truth untold
Fools crowned in worship and scorn

[2x]
My home I run to
Where all my dreams were born
I hope I find it
Before I lose my faith

All my dreams were born
