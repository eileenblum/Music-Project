You revel in your misery
Bathe in the sympathy
You long for attention
In your tragic comedy

[Pre-chorus:]
Beg for intervention
A vow of tragedy
Sell us your infection
Spreading your disease!

[Chorus:]
Save your tears for another day
Sell it to the world but I won't pay
Save your tears for another day
The parody concludes and we clear the slate

Save your tears - save it for another day
Save your tears - save it for another day

Enveloped in self loathing
Adorned in gilded pain
Brainwashed for a purpose
In dissonance you reign
