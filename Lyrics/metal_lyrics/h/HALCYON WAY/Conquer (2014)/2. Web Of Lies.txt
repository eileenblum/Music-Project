With winded souls they seize the day
Beaten men will speak in shame
To bitter end they seek defeat
To crush and tear the weak

[Pre-chorus:]
You speak and the emptiness escapes
You speak and you spread your stain
You speak and open fire again
You speak, but your words are blanks

[Chorus:]
Every time that I arise
I scale that peak with my mind
As you spin the web of your lies
(but you won't hold me back!)
Every day I start again
I will climb and not descend
You spin the web of your lies
(but you won't hold me back!)

With dirty hearts they spread disdain
Hollow men with marks of Cain
They try to purge their souls of blame
Scorch the earth and tap the vein

You will - You will not hold me back
You will - You will not hold me back
