You think that I'm a fool
Cause I speak my mind
But you're not fooling me
Use your weakness as a crutch
For everyone to see
Look deep inside yourself
Gaze in the mirror and you'll see
Why I hate you so openly

Hate in one hand, fist for the other

[Chorus:]
Hatred is my cause
Through the flames I carry on
When the ravens fly
Your kingdom will crumble
Hatred is my cause
Through the flames I carry on
When the ravens fly
Your kingdom will crumble down

I'm not sorry that I called you out
Or made you cry and weep
Your life's a tragic game
A sad story
Never been the one to cast a stone
But baby that's just me
Cause I hate you so openly

Hate in one hand, fist for the other

I am the underdog with fangs out
I am the underdog
