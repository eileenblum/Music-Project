In weakness you assert your strength
In blindness you see the way
Of desolation you sow the seeds
You will harvest them in vain

[Pre-chorus:]
Teach them with your fists
The future repeats today
Hide your violent struggles
Instruct them on your pain

[Chorus:]
You wrap yourself in sorrow
You shelter from the shame
You - you're the king of ruin
On your throne of pain

In bleakness you, you project your shame
Reassessing you, you shift the blame
In damnation, terror displayed
You will gather in the flames

You could wrap yourself in sorrow
You could take shelter in your shame
We could crown you king of ruin
You can sit on your throne as the king of pain
