With every breath some strive to control
With every thought some plot to escape
With every fear we fail to hold
Small deaths suffered every day

[Pre-chorus:]
You try to tamp it down
You have to stomp it out
They fight, they speak, they will not listen
They want to tear it down
They want to burn it out
You look away and then dismiss them

[Chorus:]
What is this that we have done?
Empowered the feeble man
Eviscerate the morning sun
Embrace of the new day to come
What is this that we have done?
We feast on the ashes of man
Obliterate what you've become
And wait on the new day to come

Some blame the ones who call the shots
Some blame the ones with hands held out
We've lost grip on reality
And the way we used to be

Hate - Lust - Take
Eviscerate the morning sun
