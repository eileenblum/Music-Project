There is strength in numbers
In this world the count is one
Seize all the days you're given
Where the wounded souls are lifted up

In our hearts we seek out heaven
With our wings we fly above
We deny the reasons given
Which keep our souls bottled up

[Chorus:]
So consume the poisoned apple
Eat from the tree
Repair the broken dreams
Offer up the failed promises
I'm broken and sorry
Sacrifice your everything

When hands shake and shiver
When our fears prove too much
When our minds are pushed to the limit
Our wounded souls are lifted up

You've got to stay alive
You've got to stay awake
This is your do or die and this is the choice you make
You've got to realize
There is a price you pay
Cause if you wave the flag then it'll be your last mistake

Anything to kill the pain
A bitter pill to feed the dream
Sometimes the poison is the cure
So eat from the tree
