You are the saint and I am the sinner
As I dance in the fire of your betrayal
The lines are drawn no more will I suffer
You are the saint and I am the sinner

[Chorus:]
You want us broken but we stand tall
With the strength of a thousand we hold
In the shadows you shall recall
And when you kneel then you will know (I am the sinner)

You are the saint and I am the sinner
In perfect existence, you're left all alone
It was you who lived in my world
You are the saint and I am the sinner

When it's over and gone
And I reach the end of all my trying
I'll carry on, living out what I believe
As the stage is set
The whole world is laid before me
There nothing could ever pull me away
