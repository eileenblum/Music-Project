Unto this conviction
Unto this state of mind
Unto this decision
A new kingdom will arise

[Pre-chorus:]
In force we move ahead
With steel in our spine
We will forsake these times
Which seek to destroy our lives

[Chorus:]
Militant - Where there is will, there's strength
Militant - I've come to realize the path is straight
Militant - Where there is will, there's strength
Militant - I've come to realize... you are the one!

Warlike - No peace
Militant, we shall be unleashed

When there is attrition
When there is only one
When there is recognition
You will embrace the gun
