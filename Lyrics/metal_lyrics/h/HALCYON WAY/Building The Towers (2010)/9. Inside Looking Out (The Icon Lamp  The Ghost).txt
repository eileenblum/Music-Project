[Music: Jon &amp; Zane; Lyrics: Jon]

[The [Ghost:]]
What would our fathers have thought?
What would they say right now?
Our house is burning down
Burning down
This is not what we bled for
This is not why our sons have died
Our house is coming down
And we are still inside

[The [Ghost:]]
I'm in the air you breath
I haunt the halls of history
You can sense me all around
I'm the one who denied the crown
I'm the one who shed a tear
When our sons and daughters died right here
On blood-soaked lands, with dirty hands
We grieve yet raise the flag

[The Ghost (Chorus):]
I watch over you
I see the evil that you choose
We fought and died for truth
That you twist and the abuse
I am watching over you
I shed a tear for what you do
From inside looking out
I am the ghost inside your house

[The [Ghost:]]
When threatened from the east
To defend my soil I'll give up peace
Half a million of my children dead
On sands of foreign lands
Now sterile to this day
So with all who dare betray
When men stand tall â with steely eyes
Liberty will guide the way

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
[The Icon:] Do you hear them?
[Ghost:] I can hear them marching
[The Icon:] Do you see them?
[Ghost:] I can see them massing
[The Icon:] Listen to them
[Ghost:] Hear the soldiers marching
[The Icon:] Hear them coming
[The Icon &amp; The Ghost:] They're coming, they're calling

[The Icon, The Ghost &amp; The Exile:]
What would our fathers have thought?
What would they say right now?
Our house is burning down
Burning down
This is not what we bled for
This is not why our sons have died
Our house is coming down
And we are still inside

[Chorus x2]

[The Icon &amp; The Ghost:]
What would our fathers have thought?
What would they say right now?
Our house is burning down
Burning down
This is not what we bled for
This is not why our sons have died
Our house is coming down
And we are still inside
