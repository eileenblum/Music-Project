[Music: Zane &amp; Jon; Lyrics: Zane]

10 o'clock, let's watch the news tonight
See the world burning itself alive
See the people suffering, a third world mentality
Elect another warlord to come and set them free

[Chorus:]
You keep on talking but you're never making sense
Trying to convince me of your high intelligence
But I've heard that faith without works is dead
Just a voice without a face, or a mouth without a head

Too many fanatics looking for a Christ
To be the one who makes the sacrifice
But their own blood must be too high cost
So it's our soldiers lives are lost

[Chorus 2:]
You keep on talking but you're never making sense
Trying to convince me of your high intelligence
But I've heard that faith without works is dead
Just a voice without a face, or a mouth without a head
The words you spit scratch the itch of my ears
But it seems to be enough to stave off everybody's fears
But two weeks later you change what you said
Words without a voice from a mouth without a head

[Bridge:]
All we see â scenes that confirm our darkened fears
All they do â suffocate us through our TV screens
Burn my eyes with their lies and deceit
Take us down to where liars feed...

[Chorus 2]
