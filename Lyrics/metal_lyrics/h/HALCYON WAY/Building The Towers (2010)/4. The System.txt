[Music &amp; Lyrics: Jon]

Leverage on leverage
The engines of wealth
Fuel for the fire
It consumes itself
System collapses
Bodies fall from the sky
Death's angel passes by
Leaves you asking why

[Chorus:]
A spike impales your soul
All your worth has been inborn
The fall from grace so hard and cold
The system â you've lost control

Stepping off the cliffs
A striking leap of faith
Economies built on nothing less
Than belief and the will to create

System collapses
Bodies fall from the sky
Light of the world enters in
She reaches for the sky

[Chorus]

Building castles upon nothing
Building towers on the sand
Chasing phantoms through the hall
Waiting for the axes to fall

[Chorus x2]

The system â you've lost control
