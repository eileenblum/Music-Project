[Music: Jon, Zane; Lyrics: Jon]

The cold white light of sorrow
The burning black ice of night
It's darkest before the dawning
On our desecration day
Forging our tools to weapons
Bring to bear on everyone
Horsemen ride across the land
On the desecration day

[Chorus 1:]
You can see the towers falling
Watch them crumble to the dust
You can feel the nations burning
On our desecration day

The devil's on the horizon
A fiery gale at his feet
"Build your towers unto me"
All your tears, your pleading denied

The threat of war was foreseen
The fist of heaven cracks the sky
Broken souls lie in defeat
Nothing lives when the horsemen rides

[Chorus 2:]
You can see the towers falling
Watch them crumble to the dust
You can feel the nations burning
On our desecration day
You can watch the bridges burning
See them blackened into ash
You can feel your fear returning
On our desecration day

[Chorus 1, Chorus 2]
