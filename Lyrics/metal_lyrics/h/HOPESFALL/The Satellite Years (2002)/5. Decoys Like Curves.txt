we drove these streets heads to shoulders
existing to tell the tales of letting go
and now we're strangled to tears on the fallback farewell 
its all in our heads 
the faint whispers
i tried to tell myself when its already over
that the reasons found decoys
and this is holding me back
as if to say what you thought you heard
i wish i did
i don't want to feel this pull as this city becomes home without you
