these faces have fallen here before
tired and blue
a light that bleeds unforgiving shadows
her olive eyes repeat failure in every glare
a failure that mirrors itself with a foriegn stare
hold it together you'll find your peace
but the pieces are burnt shells that frame regret on every wall 
reflections of olive eyes pierce hole through her haunted heart
she hates that stare
her smiling face defense to the world 
a world filled with olive eyes that fram regret on every face
