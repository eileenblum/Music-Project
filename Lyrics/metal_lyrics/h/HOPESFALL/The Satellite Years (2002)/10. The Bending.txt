this is just the in between
the point where worries can shatter dreams 
this is that look like i'm going to throw it all away 
this is infatuations best kept secret
and those are the hovering eyes that glide and glare
so not another word of this conscious bending conversation 
i'll find it before i revolve around the tips of their tongues
