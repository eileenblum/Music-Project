please baby not another stare
i've been in that trance before
those burning eyes half glazed with tints of fury and resentment
fighting not to look back
and still tasting the dust from the last time we did 
we sift through the crowds without a care
only to leave the burnt pattern of a waking nightmare
lonliness finds us beneath dim lit lights 
where pen and paper spell out confusion 
failing to escape those nights of solitude
the echos of today's misfortunes linger
its then that you realize 
you're the one that wants to cry something
because you feel nothing
