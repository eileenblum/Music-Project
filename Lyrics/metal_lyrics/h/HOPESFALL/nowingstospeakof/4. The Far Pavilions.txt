How could I endure one more sunrise in this cold and unfamiliar place?

Where friends pass by like autumn leaves only stay for a season.

My heart dead to the smallest act of compassion

It gave them no reason to break the cycle of
The passers by.
Their actions made trust a failed practise

So here I stand on this hill alone, never turning back

In hopes that the past will fade.
