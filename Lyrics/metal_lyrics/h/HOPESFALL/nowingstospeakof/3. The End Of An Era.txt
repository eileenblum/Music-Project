My searching eyes have never been so intrigued to see you,
I guess, you found a way to make ten minutes last forever,
With each passing moment we drift further away...
Closer to our chosen paths

But I can't help remebering what was... what might have been
But I have been warned by those who have passed this way before,
And to them I am grateful
And as for you I am hateful
And I pray that you find the peace you have been longing for.
