Silence.
Silence was the last words we spoke
It filled the air heavy with forevers
And the failing smells of yesterday
"this wasn't my intention..." is now a haunting...
The ghost of wispering thougths
Ive bled these nights dry with tears
So, here's to sleepless cold and dreams of insecurity
And like before, I'm left with silence
And the sound of a heart breaking

It's pieces crumble to the floor, promise falls quiet
Between stillness and silence, I hear your voice say
"my child I will pick up the pieces"
Promise falls guiet between stillness and silence.
