in the wake of our denial the world
turns over. and we're dressed up to
lay to rest a feeling from the
inside help us get back to bashful eyes
so beautiful when we're gravestones
away from feeling beneath the ground
is there comfort, a meaning oh we're so
dangerously close to falling feel the
fall of forlorn lovers and just think if
we were made to settle for each other
that's how we designed it and hide
behind it. and stay close to those like
they are to us anomalies of our own
thinking.
