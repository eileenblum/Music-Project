I want to sing into your eyes, your
dilated eyes die criminal die
are you the kind of man that would
hold your breath to part with your
lungs
are you the kind of man that would
cry fake tears to save your eyes from
the sight of your own blood
because now's the time with torso high
you gave a brave look but you're not
so high anymore now i pulled the
trigger once so i could see you dance i
guess there was just enough gunsalt to
ricochet up and and put a hole in your
head ...because now's your time.
canto funebre forever we march
you've made a sea of calloused hearts
to loathe.
