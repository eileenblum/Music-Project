you target ones with a loose tongue
through your fingers you find ways to
make us turn inside if i lose my ground
i will stand by to navigate the escape
for the silent ones.
so take it to the back of the bar you
make me think what you want to tell
me. first i will say anything to make
sure you don't. you act less blessed you
are sympathies great deceiver ...oh the
taste of your teeth after you sneer.
by the accident of approval we'll take a
shot in the dark to kill the buzz in the
room I'll take the side of the ones
whose feet touch the floor you'll take
the side of the ones approaching lines
to create of life.
for starving eyes i know you will
never make a proud home.
