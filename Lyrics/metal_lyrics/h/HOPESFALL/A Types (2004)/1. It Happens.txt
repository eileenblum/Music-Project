The bodies collide to the beat
The spilt wine takes us to new heights
She said I was her captain out of town swinger
For a night we parade the conquest for the careless
I am motionless and coma
Ready for this
Watch the blood she makes
Shine flows to the head
I remember the first time a tall tale told heroically
She's got the best of what I'm waiting for
We feel the distance
The sleep await to be the call to action
Or the intervention of something out of this world
We don't live to last forever
We feel no second chance
There's just a primal need to release and never let in anything but the skin
From here to the moon she tries to take me to the starbeams in her eyes
And from here to the moon she tells me I'm good for patient eyes.
