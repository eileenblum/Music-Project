I'll put you back in your place
We'll ride a thousand miles to find out we are empty
And if I wrote out our sins
It would read a thousand lies and show us we are empty

Youth spent and still so young
If you could have her, where would you be tonight?...Tonight

Standing at attention
Dreams cascading around you like rushing water
Every pore is filled with hope

Oh, Icarus tempting fate again
Altitude sickness setting in
Oh oh, Icarus tempting fate again
Altitude sickness setting in
Tradewinds bury fire from broken wings into arms below
The ocean

I'll put you back in your place
We'll ride a thousand miles to find out we are empty
And if I wrote out our sins
It would read a thousand lies and show us we are empty

Losing atmosphere
Eyes full
Eyes full
Eyes full of stars

Standing at attention
Dreams cascading around you like rushing water
Every pore is filled with hope

Oh, Icarus tempting fate again
Altitude sickness setting in
Oh oh, Icarus tempting fate again
Altitude sickness setting in
Tradewinds bury fire from broken wings into arms below
The ocean

It chills you to bone
Paranoia translates the new tone.
It chills you to bone

Oh, Icarus tempting fate again
Altitude sickness setting in
Tradewinds bury fire from broken wings into arms below
The ocean
Oh, Icarus tempting fate again
Altitude sickness setting in
We're burning up meet us there

Oh, Icarus tempting fate again
into arms below the ocean
We're burning up

Oh, Icarus tempting fate again
Altitude sickness setting in
We're burning up meet us there

Oh, Icarus tempting fate again
into arms below the ocean
We're burning up
