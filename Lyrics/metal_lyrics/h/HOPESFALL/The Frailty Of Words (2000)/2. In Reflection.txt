summer of evidence the lights never lie yet so long a delay sparkling from in and out of the clouds. i will relay the message sent... to all that matter for i am a messenger... to find the lost and make them whole this comission i have taken to my heart... to the world the curl is spent darkening through this day but lasting for a thousand, and many more in reflections of You
