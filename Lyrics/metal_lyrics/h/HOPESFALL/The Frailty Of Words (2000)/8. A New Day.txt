in the bright morning my courage falls weak no excuse for my actions, no where to run consequence comes like raining fire, burning every part of me... showing no mercy the day that i thought would never come, has arrived here i lay, a victim of my own decisions i've exchanged the wisdom of God for selfish pride...thus my down fall my appreciation is laced within apologies, for not becoming Your plan grace is where i lay my head for this is where the angels sit... and she spreads her silver wings to offer shade for my pale skin from the blinding sun of consequence consequence...no where to run, but to Your arms in all my shame...reconciled as i weather the storm, i fall to the ground i look to the sky, then His hand reaches for me....alas a new day my appreciation is laced within apologies i'll never understand this grace bestowed upon me... alas a new day
