why is it that some are always learning, but never come to the knowledge of the truth? and their ever open minds refuse to hear a reasonable offer.. humbly i extend the hope i have received careful not to pass judgement or impose my beliefs... but i can no longer apologize for what i hold most dear and with humility i attempt to live my life with a sincerity that can bridge gaps... and know that by abstaining from things of this world, i am not condemning you but i'm choosing as you choose, to follow what i know to be true
