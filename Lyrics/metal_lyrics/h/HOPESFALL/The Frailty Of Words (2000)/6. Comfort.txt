i've found, this new life i dwell, in His peace my existence, follows after, His eyes everything is content...everything is content for this love You've given me but as the sun and moon turn and my path becomes troublesome, weak for me on my unsure journey... i strive day by day for something i've never seen down this road there can be no end in sight for me will You abandon me in my time of need? God don't let me doubt, show me Your way out... my eyes have never seen you, but my heart wants to know you it's all clear now, my fall is a product of my impatience now i know the truth put me through the fire, test me to the end, for my faith is solid my faith is solid in Your unchanging love prove Yourself true to me will You fill this place with Your saving grace? my life is in Your hands, Your wisdom helps me stand Your love comforts me, given me eyes to see through the lies of this world to show Your glory
