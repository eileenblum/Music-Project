where there's a chance to fall through
the devil will find you

history has shown
generations buried by their secrets
awaken to naked bosom in bed,
empty bottles on the nightstand,
and parachuting ways to quickly numb and satisfy
oh what pride
I'll have her waiting
can I beg of myself the blame

I can be a man
show no mercy
I'll accuse myself
please, please no praise
I am overbold

there's long sleeping in the living and the thinking
that devil may care
like these harlots surrounding
at night I'm a mad man
by day I'm a sad man

all day I'm like a thief that wants to get caught
so please someone don't you be proud
all day is like a misfortunate soldier thought
oh please someone won't you be proud
