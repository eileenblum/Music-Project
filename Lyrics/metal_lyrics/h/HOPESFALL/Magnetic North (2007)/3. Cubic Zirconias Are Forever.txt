patience never our foreplay
dizzy people floating in the same flood lights
that we'll be sinking in the stars in the sky
are diamonds promised to the ocean floor
we'll fake first and leave a reflection of what they're searching for

there are cities we have not found
with underwater cavemen minds
and suddenly we're curious
for we found the secrets to
a black diamond left in the sea
a prism with a hopeless color scheme
and we are one step... . .

if we're (when they're) out tonight
we'll leave the lights alone
cause if they're out tonight
they'll leave their lights low
(let's go!) let us go before we're doomed

take care
take it to the ocean floor

let us go
let us search beneath the blue
we are one step close to never knowns
