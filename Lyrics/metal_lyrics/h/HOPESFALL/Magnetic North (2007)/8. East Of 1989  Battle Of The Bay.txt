caught force looked over
courting gravity we're older
we all found out we're weightless
and leaden with potential
water fileters that screams of dead sailors
lift off a bridge
swim left of Sacramento
the last thing we see
is tai lights with strings
and time is spinning out a way
one photograph back
a tunnel is shrinking
no flash no love nothing involved
at the start of it all

donât even try
to maximize these plans
I steal
I catch this wind
after all of my lies
donât you dare fall for
how I could be depends
on the cold you bring
donât even bend down to the world
donât even try to

the image you cast over me
is just a subterfuge
I can be a ghost
or the hero that says...my darling
why don't you save yourself
if we die
we'll leave some behind
to lust for what seems like the performance of a life
we've incriminated hesitation

in bending (been) down tot he world live(d) it all
the earth will follow through
like we give love
for a chance
to make capital
they said bend down to the world
if we could see more than we believe (...
...) then we believe
the earth would swallow you
