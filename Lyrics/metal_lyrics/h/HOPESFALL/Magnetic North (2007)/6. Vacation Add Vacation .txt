can you feel it crawl
something has mastered our insides
connecting our thoughts
with each others' body parts
in all sorts
there are networks keeping watch
over our state of mind

this is how we'll carry on

have we been led
have we wandered
in everything we're moving on to
I think we made a great escape
it's been said
you inspired
in all those things I'm looking on to
your greatest day

we prefer to pretend
there's no animal inside
but there is a sting
we can chose to hind
who waits for who?
when nothing tells us we might still be alone

we send transmissions to bridge the synapse
we're put together and organized
