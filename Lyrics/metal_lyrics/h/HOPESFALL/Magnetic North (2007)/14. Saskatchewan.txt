[Bonus Track]There's a hole in the sun
And no one's awake to it

We're predisposed
It's casting it's shadow
All fault lines are signs of it

So, where do we go?
We've been fed unconscious purpose
Of all that remains
Is a quake and a fall
The sun has a mind
The earth acts as it's muscle

You see, how right where we stand
There's an attraction to sorrow
We are a mind chasing shadows

Like the hole in the sun

No comfort is sweet for the unsolved part of grief
There's a sober hum to the ground,
And you can be so far from
From the land of the living sky

There's a hole in the sun,
And no one's awake to it

Part the earth to it's core
Lives a beast to this world
Glorified by the time
Our mouths close out all hope

For you see, right where we stand

While I wither away
I'll try alone
While I wither away

So, right where we stand
There's an attraction to sorrow
We are a mind chasing shadows

Like the hole in the sun

No comfort is sweet
For the unsolved part of grief
There's a sober hum to the ground,
And you can be so far from,
From the land of the living sky
