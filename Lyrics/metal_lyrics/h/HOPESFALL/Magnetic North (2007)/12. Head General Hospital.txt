we'll kick you
and your devotion to sloth wonder
in a caveman style
you are only crawling faster
your eyes indent your oblong head
canonized in REM rhythm

you're not standing upright yet

sitting guilty in a spirit
of a passive sinner
oh look
you're ahead
it's like a hospital hosting hypochondriacs
you got yourself uptight
are there anymore
facts or fiction fit for further alliteration
you seem so safely spoon-fed
and we can't operate on
oblivious

we're not partners in
or paramedics for

this whole world's going to make you a part of it
the whole world is going to leave you out
call someone to alleviate the senses
never let
ever let your body feel
how your mind could leave it

you can see it on our faces
for we have traveled far
your mind is a long divide
a simple fraction of our time
deduct your logic
we'll lock up
or maybe just unlatch it
and throw yourself off
if you were meant for the wealth of the applause
would a first window floor have a lock

there are no bleachers by bedsides
people build in their (your heads)
