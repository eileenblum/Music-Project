It's hiding.
Sheltered away.
Waiting for the time to betray.
Suck my life for all it's worth.
Turn your back.
You get hurt.
Try to forget.
Try to save.
You can't cure your cancerous ways.
Time after time you let us down.
Friendships die to protect myself.
Who's to blame?
You failed to see.
To gain my trust.
There's no love lost.
Try to forget.
Try to save.
You can't cure your cancerous ways.
Free them.
