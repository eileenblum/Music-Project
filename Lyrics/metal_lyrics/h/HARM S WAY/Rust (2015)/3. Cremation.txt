Silent death, plagued by life.
Distorted fear, plagued my life.
All alone, plagued by life.
Human kind, plagued my life.
Turn away from Father Time.
The clock will strike the end.
Now we wait beneath the sun.
Disappear one by one.
Incinerate the masses.
We turn to ashes.
Incinerate the masses.
You turn to ashes
