All my life I wait.
Wait for my life.
Lift this burden.
Hope a false dream.
Tear my eyes out.
Give me a sign.
Search, to be deceived.
Hope a fairy tale.
Tear my eyes out.
Make me blind.
Tear my eyes out.
Give me a sign.
Being young, you could dream.
As I grow, there's no hope for me.
This world.
Not what I thought.
Not a surprise.
Just a fucking let down.
