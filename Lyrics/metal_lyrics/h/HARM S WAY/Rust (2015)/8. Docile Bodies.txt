Social conflict controls me.
Silent pleasure.
Internal need.
I don't want.
I don't need.
Human contact.
Human disease.
Need for love.
I live astray.
By myself.
Please stay away.
I don't want.
I don't need.
Hum an contact.
Human disease.
You're killing me slowly with your words.
Anxiety fills me.
I trust myself.
Anxiety fills me.
No one else.
