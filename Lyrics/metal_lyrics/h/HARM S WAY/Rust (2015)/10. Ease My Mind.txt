I'll deny until the end.
Bless the sickness to dull the pain.
I am pure and I refrain.
Suck the life right from your veins.
Fear my thoughts.
Fear my life.
I'd rather die than ease my mind.
Sick depression killing me, but I don't need to rid the pain.
Fear my thoughts.
Fear my life.
But I'd rather die than ease my mind.
I deny.
