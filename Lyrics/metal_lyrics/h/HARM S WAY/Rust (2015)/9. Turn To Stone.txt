The evil you hold so dear.
I'll give everything I swear.
I'll give my heart.
It's turned stone.
I can't feel.
Forever alone.
I can't give.
I can't see.
I have tried.
Nowhere to hide.
Dying.
Slowly inside.
Broken.
The rest of my life.
I've tried to feel but I only feel pain.
Search myself but I only feel pain.
Numb to love.
One true love.
Fall to your knees.
Help me, please.
Pain.
Dying.
Slowly inside.
Broken.
The rest of my life.
