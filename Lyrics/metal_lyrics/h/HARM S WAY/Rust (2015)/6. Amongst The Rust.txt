Why is life so complex?
Figured out that I'm not blessed.
All I see is trouble.
Seems to come my way.
Why does life have to be this way?
All I wanted was to be a simple man.
Something to love, but I'll never understand.
I've been searching, for a heart of gold.
It's hard to find amongst the rust.
When you realize you can't escape.
Why would I not live to hate?
All I wanted was to be a simple man.
Something to love.
I'll never understand.
In time you realize it must end.
What a relief.
It won't last forever.
Let us Rust.
