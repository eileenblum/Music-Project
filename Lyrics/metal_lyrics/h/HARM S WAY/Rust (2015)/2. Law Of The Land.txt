Failing humanity.
As the humans rape this land.
Deplete every source.
As greed takes our hand.
Prey on the weak for capital gain.
You better obey the law.
Enforced at all costs.
Feed the need.
Consume the world for everything we've got.
We won't stop, until the last drop.
Consume the world for everything we've got.
It's in the hands of a distorted world.
Feed the need.
Obey the law to survive.
See it in their eyes.
Obey the law to survive.
Disguised in their pride.
Disguise their pride.
