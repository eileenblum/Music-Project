lack of intelligence
as you pray
concentrate
on the afterlife
when your life
is in disarray
count on your religion
to cover up your lies
letting go of sin
although you did wrong
moral dysfunction
how can this be
bury your mind
in the filth they feed
the more you believe
the more they succeed
confused minds
all around
fear of death
so you turn to them
