bow to me as i rise
blackened earth
all i hear are cries
when damnation comes
i will be on top
watch me take over
i will never be stopped
pulling the lord down
punishing his weak soul
a new leader
is upon the skies
your savior
will suffer again
no tolerance for this
puling the lord down
punishing his weak soul
a new leader
is upon the skies
the final damnation
is here
and i'll make sure
it's me
you forever fear
