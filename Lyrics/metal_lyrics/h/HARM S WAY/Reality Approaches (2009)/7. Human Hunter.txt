so many targets
who do i choose
plenty of ammo
no way will i lose
the crosshairs
reach your head
the slightest movement
and you'll be dead
no remorse
for what i'll do
as i take your life
the people are running
no where to turn
as they look up
it's only black they'll see
one by one
they will understand
i will bury them
with my bare hands
human hunter
