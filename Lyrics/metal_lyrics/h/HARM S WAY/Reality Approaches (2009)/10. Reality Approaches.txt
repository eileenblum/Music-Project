my purpose in life
becomes more unknown
what are we doing here
confusion
through experience
right or wrong
there's no use
because in the end
you won't get out
searching for answers
as i seek for the truth
nothing but false hope
failure the only feeling
right or wrong
it's no use
because in the end
what does it matter
i try to think differently
but this is what life
is to me
it hits you hard
as you fall
reality approaches
you can't escape
