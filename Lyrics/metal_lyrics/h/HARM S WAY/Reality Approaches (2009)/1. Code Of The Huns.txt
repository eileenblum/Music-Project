battle ready
marching to exist
weapons drawn
no way out of this
the strong will survive
my hate is released
we must kill
standing for our beliefs
the enemy tries
to bring us down
as they attempt
they will learn the code
nothing will stop us
forever we will rule
destroying the opposition
as we take over the world
the enemy tries
to bring us down
as they attempt
they will learn
the code of the huns
