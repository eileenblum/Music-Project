wait blame what is my fate
afraid ignore digging deep
stuck in time can't look past
anchored confused soul torn 
my eyes are sealed when i hope
for something to change
all alone again, im free
take me away
cold, and fragile, i cannot move
caught i stare when will i break 
im right, im wrong, im everything
shame insane world to blame 
life death all for nothing
