faint confusion
buried in mud
master plan to escape
slow breath, as i weep
cold chills as i grow
clouded eyes i die
slow decay the more i know 
procreate i die
hear i hear the reaper
crack the weakness inside
salvage what is left
becoming a man
cold chills as i grow
clouded eyes, i die
slow decay the more i know
procreate i die 
sucking my soul
to an end
destroying my mind
as i descend
