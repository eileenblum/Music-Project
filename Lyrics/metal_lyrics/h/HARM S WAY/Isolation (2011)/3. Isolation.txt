piece together
greater being
think alone
its here i roam
bitter wastleland wretched earth
isolation leave me be
lay upon these frozen plains
heads in hand born to be
separate myself 
separate my soul
common man is not me
common thought i question
separate myself 
separate my soul
break free
separate my soul
there's a place for me
separate myself
away away away
