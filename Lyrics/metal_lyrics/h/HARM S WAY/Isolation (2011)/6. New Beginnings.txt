wash away the gutter
cleanse the earth and mankind
starting over now
the filter rise again
blame us all
the future is grim
coming to power
destroy as it spreads
desperate efforts
desperate thoughts
no solution
at what cost
work together
to erase the past
sentenced to this
mindless wasteland
desperate effort
desperate thoughts
no solution
at what cost
new beginnings
creation again
we let this happen
take it back
dig spread
punish decay
