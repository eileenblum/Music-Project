hide your lies
greed you feed
guilt your need
cry you leech
you looked me in the eyes
youre worthless to me
you looked me in the eyes
slithering away
fear betrayaed
truth refrain
free this mess
torn emposed
youve shamed your way
for so long
we figured it out
who you reall are
honest a word of fear
no regrats
just confess
