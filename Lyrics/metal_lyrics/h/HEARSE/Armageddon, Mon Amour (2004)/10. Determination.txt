What I saw in your eyes...
Gave me - Shivers down my spine.
Like a thousand years of rage...
Lurking - Somewhere beneath

[Chorus:]
This time I will be gone and you will be surprised.

Now feel the anger burning higher - 
Reborn through hate.
Look out! - Bullets sweep... My head - On a silver plate.

You call me a non-believer...
Well - You better think again
