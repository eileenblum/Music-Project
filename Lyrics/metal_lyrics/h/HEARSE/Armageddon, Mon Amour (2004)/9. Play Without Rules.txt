Here I am in front of you, begging on my knees.
A conscience soaked in torment, making me so weak.
Never meant to turn away, and you know it too.
Words may be so useless, still I'm telling you the truth.

Silence seems to be a golden rule they say,
Forever in the long run it wouldn't work, anyway.

[Chorus:]
Now we play - without rules
It is me - versus you

It strikes me that the world we live in is cruel and unfair, Destiny was meant to guide us as good as anywhere.
But when ambushed by surprises
on and on until this day.
So pressured from all sides and corners - 
What the hell am I to say?

We reached the point of no return,
we had to draw the line,
This game that we were playing, escalated all the time.

Soon enough we'll find a way,
but I really don't know how.
The reasons for what held us in the shadow of a doubt.
Silence seems to be a golden rule they say,
But forever in the long run it wouldn't work, anyway.
