Well he was thailand based 
She was an airforce wife 
He used to fly weekends 
It was the easy life 
But then it turned around 
And he began to change 
She didnt wonder then 
She didnt think it strange 
But then he got a call 
He had to leave that night 
He couldnt say too much 
But it would be alright 
He didnt need to pack 
Theyd meet the next night 
He had a job to do 
Flying to cambodia 

And as the nights passed by 
She tried to trace the past 
The way he used to look 
The way he used to laugh 
I guess shell never know 
What got inside his soul 
She couldnt make it out 
Just couldnt take it all 
He had the saddest eyes 
The girl had ever seen 
He used to cry some nights 
As though he lived a dream 
Ans as she held him close 
He used to search her face 
As though she knew the truth 
Lost inside cambodia 

But then a call came through 
They said hed soon be home 
She had to pack a case 
And they would make a rendez-vous 
But now a year has passed 
And not a single word 
And all the love she knew 
Has disappeared out in the haze 
Cambodia - dont cry now - no tears now 

And now the years have passed 
With not a single word 
But there is only one thing left 
I know for sure 
She wont see his face again
