Here I am on the verge of sanity.
Yet another curse haunting me.
Never felt such emptiness before,
In the void of love and war.

Two worlds colliding in the dead of night,
Fate is smiling and you're so blind.

[Chorus:]
I could've sworn to this very day,
In love and war losing is the price you pay.

Here's my life slowly falling apart,
An early grave or a soul for sale.
Don't surrender now we're not done
Another chapter has only just begun

Cast another spell to catch "the one"
In heaven or hell, into the sun.

Two worlds colliding in the dead of night,
Fate is smiling and you're so blind.
