You don't know what to do, don't know what to believe
Evil eyes are watching you like in some vivid dream.

-Human clay, to my dismay.
you know there is no other way.

Take a look behind your back, you're turning paranoid,
It is a wave gone out of control

-Human clay, to my dismay.
you know there is no other way.

[Chorus:]
We are gonna use - You
You are the tools you fools.
Behind a caravan of disillusioned fools
What have we become now, a herd of human tools.
What went wrong inside of me,
what went wrong inside of you?

-Human clay, to my dismay.
you know there is no other way.
