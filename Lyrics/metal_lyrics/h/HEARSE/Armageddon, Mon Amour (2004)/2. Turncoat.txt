we are the chosen ones yo have you saved
you are now to be enslaved,
we will seek, we will destroy,
contaminate your cultivated soil.
you are nothing but a wheel
in our killing machine.
you have yourself, yourself to blame
you have joined - enjoy the game.

[Chorus:]
Missing link - Incomplete

we are the symbols of all your guilt
here to keep you on a leash.
are you prepared to pay the price
your independence circumcised?
no other opinion's there for you
no matter what, you're gonna lose
you have yourself, yourself to lose
you have joined - the game
