the final ecstacy, last dance in agony,
no place to run or hide, no matter what you try.

along a trail of tears, remembering the wasted years,
under the ice and snow, greif burns deep in your soul

[Chorus:]
this is the ultimate failure, this is the fall from grace.
this is the ultimate failure, this is the crops of waste.
