this ain't the stair to heavn for sure,
it just takes you to the devil woman's door.
this might just be the seventh gate,
yes, we're talking oppression, destruction and hate

[Chorus:]
A reign of terror behind that white door, mental destruction, you satan, it's war!
sadistic intentions and nothing but lies,
principal of evil, the devil in disguise

Companion of Satan - principal from hell,
she's the force of evil and you know it so well.
bet she was born with 666 in her neck
one day someone better check!

this ain't the stair to heavn for sure,
it just takes you to the devil woman's door.
Companion of Satan - principal from hell,
she's the force of evil and you know it so well.
