Falling deeper into despair
No way out to flee this nightmare
Trapped inbetween life and death
If this is the end, well so be it

In my heart all alone
When you turned it into stone
The isolation tears me apart
Now when you are gone

Split in half, divided I fell
A sign of heaven is a sign of hell
Ashes, debris - a spiritual hoax
Eating its way down to the bone

In memory of the rising sun
At the break of dawn I wipe off the dust
Let us forget, let us forgive
Turn the page or burn the last bridge
