A fallen angel with a loaded gun
Crusader from vengeance found
A king a son of a king
A flame a son of a flame

My only wish my one desire
Is to see my name in fire
I know my had forsake of a wish
A life of what"s been fallen to bits

You will remember my name
I"m gonna start a fire
You will remember my face
I"m gonna start a fire

Tomorrow will be yesterday
And you"re the one who has to pay
You did some things you will regret
I will forgive but not forget

I"m gonna get you for that
I"m gonna start a fire
You will remember my name
I"m gonna start a fire

I"m gonna get you for that
I"m gonna start a fire
You will remember my name
I"m gonna start a fire

The taste of shame is bitter, sour
And (coalition?) make a fool out of me no more
Oh i really get my kicks
On route 666

You will remember my name
I"m gonna start a fire
I"m gonna get you for this
I"m gonna start a fire

You will remember my face
I"m gonna start a fire
I"m gonna get you for this
I"m gonna start a fire
