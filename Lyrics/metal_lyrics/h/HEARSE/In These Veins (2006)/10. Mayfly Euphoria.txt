[Bonus Track]Overwhelmed, Oh yes I am, by the blood on your hands
How impressive, how very humane
When dignity is being washed down the drain

Here to reign supreme
A man-made machine
Here to reign beneath
Under your skinâ¦

You invade and you violate
You were simply born to kill, not hesitate
Engulfed in the euphoria
Triggered by the pure hate

To do as you're being told
For each time sell a piece of your soul
No transparency, secrets well kept
All the lies, the things you never said
