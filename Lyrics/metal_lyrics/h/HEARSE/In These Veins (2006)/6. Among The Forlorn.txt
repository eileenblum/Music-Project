Hey you, so lost and astray
Are you the one for me?
Once we've shared our sorrows
Won't hear from you tomorrow

My grief could soon be yours
Or vice versa yes of course
No time for compromise
All dissolving before my eyes

Anxious to the bone
Out of proportions grown
Trembling with fear
What the hell am I doing here???

I found you ripped and torn
Among the forlorn
Today you had my heart dethroned

So far, so soon it all became
Just another dramatic charade
Didn't see the signs of time
A veil of passion covered my eyes

Found you ripped and torn
While among the forlorn
Used to share our sorrows
Now there's no tomorrow
