My armour is corroding, my skin now burning
Fading away, away...I'm cursed

It is my damnation
Awakened by
Nocturnal torment
Still haunting me

Fresh blood for your gods

This is never ending, an endless tunnel
Lost alone, my fate...I am doomed

It is my damnation
Awakened by
Nocturnal torment
Still haunting me

A day will come when I'll return
Armed to my teeth, yes you'll see...

It is my damnation
Awakened by
Nocturnal torment
Still haunting me
