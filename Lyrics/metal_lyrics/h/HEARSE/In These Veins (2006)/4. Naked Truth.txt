As you crawl along with the slime
Carry a soul as dark as the night
Fear to tread the grounds unknown
Instead, inside hatred grows

Devoured by agony
Yearning for clarity

Open your eyes, embrace the world
Absorb life's treasures, flee this curse
On a path most winding, narrow and mean
Your life has been one long dream

Inside your fist there's still a paw
Your cold heart soon ready to thaw
Fear no more, farewell anxiety
A new day breaks for the sake of humanity
