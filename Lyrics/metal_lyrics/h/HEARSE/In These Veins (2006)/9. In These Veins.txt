Reaching for the last boi
On the seven seas of hell
My despair is killing me
Life in review, the memories I dwell

Demonic lunacy
On the verge of sanity

In these veins...

Now just a shadow of myself
Raped, windswept by oblivion
The perpetual cycle
In the emptiness I once embraced

Remember the times of innocence
Flashing by, goodbye - in remembrance
