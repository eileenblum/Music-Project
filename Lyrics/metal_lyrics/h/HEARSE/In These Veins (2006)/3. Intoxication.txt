Poisoned within to cope with each day
To tell you the truth there's no other way
Agoraphobic and paranoid
No longer in charge of my very own soil

Nowhere to go, nowhere to run
Losing my soul - what have I become?

Scared to hell by the world outside
Friend of foe from you I can't hide
Aware of their presence lurking in the dark
Life as I knew it now torn wide apart

Living in terror for "the big parade"
Life has turned into this masquerade
Shivering, trembling, set me free
From these chains of anxiety
