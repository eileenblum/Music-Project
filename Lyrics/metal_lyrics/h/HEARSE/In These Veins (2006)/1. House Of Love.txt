Lightning strikes from the skies above
There's another game in the house of love
I was told not to step inside
Four walls of deceit, heartache and lies

Promises of devotion and of trust
A void to avoid at any cost

Show me the way out
In a shadow of a doubt

Once again speaking to deaf ears
Can you ear me - are you really "there"?
Yes I know, it is the same old song
About pathetic battles long since gone

The pressure increased somewhere in my soul
Just had to escape to achieve other goals
