There seems to be - A price on my head
Who could it be - That wants me dead?

The more you chase me - The faster I'll run
Soon face to face - Eager to get it done

This mountain was too high
For a mortal to climb
Risking it all now, falling down

You claim my soul to be yours
You crave to own the very source
Just leave me ripped and torn

None of us were told - What it'd be like
Sometimes in a role - Of just being polite
There's a basic need - Significant to human nature
A will to proceed - No matter what it takes

For each breaking dawn - New strength is gained
I am no longer a pawn - In your wicked game
