Trapped in a maze, known as life on Earth
A sinister place of everlasting rebirth

Universal contemplation
Final stage of aggravation

Soon it would show - We were "blessed"
To be a part of the perpetual test

The questions arose over all the years
An urge to know the purpose of being here

The harder you try - The more it won't make sense
So hollow it echoes inside - How am I to ever comprehend?
