Why do you avoid me like the plague
This alienation drives me insane
Was it just a case of overreaction
Is everything now to your satisfaction

Dissolving - Memories of you - Down the drain

Why bring me nothing but shackles of guilt
For me to wear to remember all this
There is no need and you know
You will reap what you sow

Do you believe in animosity
As the only way to handle our fear
So why avoid me like the plague
The alienation remains
