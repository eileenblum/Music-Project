Cold and grey
These colours of deceit
Swept away
By a flood of grief
The pictures
In broken frames
I couldn't see
The change

...But now I know

You live - You learn
You give nothing in return

Scars won't heal
That easily
Hard to feel
Nothing but pity
The words
You spoke
Severely hurt
Just another heart broken

All the pictures
In broken frames
I couldn't see the change
You live, you learn
And you give
But get nothing in return...
