What have you done to earn the right
You killed the sun and turned day into night
How can it be you're unleashed
To keep on spreading your disease

You have no mercy, no regret - Just have to do it
Just have to find another feast to satisy your needs

A twisted mind most unique
All empty inside as if your spirit leaks
You lost all sense, the sense of compassion
To kill again has become an obsession

So did you choose to play God?
With your own rules to stay in control
Great deceiver you're being watched
This will be your final call
