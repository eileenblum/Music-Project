Hey, who are you to lecture me?
A smell of envy, I sense jealousy
My spirit grew strong from the pain
To suffer is the key, there's no other way

I found the essence - I found the truth
A hidden message inside of you...

I wish you would be here now
Would mean the world to me
I wish you could see me now
If you were for real

So, tell me now I am all ears
Where did you hide for all those years
I turned every stone looking for you
Moved every mountain in search of the truth
