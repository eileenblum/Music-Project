The only thing I see, the only thing I know
My intuition - My destiny, the way for me to go
All the sleepless nights and restless days
A wish to make it right once gone astray

I feel - Inside of me
I'm soon to be free

A brighter sun is waiting out there for me
Somewhere, somehow - Finally
Out of the abyss to the surface again
Time to put an end to all the suffering

Inhale exhale
I breathe fresh air
New day, new dawn
The pain is gone
