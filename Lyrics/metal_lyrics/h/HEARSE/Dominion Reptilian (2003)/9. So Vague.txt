Half alive I wander the winding road to nowhere
Destiny is leading me, sigh no more - soon to be free

Angels fear the dark, watching every step I take

[Chorus:]
How could we end like this?
Look at us now, so vague but all so clear

After all I've been through on my way out of here
Destiny is leading me, sigh no more I am now free
