Kneel to your icons of masters most divine
In the name of God you'll surely die
Turning their backs once you've failed
Upon their cross they'll have you nailed

[Chorus:]
Oh, glorious saviour
Where are you now?
We'll die at your feet
Anyhow

Participation in the ultimate sacrifice
Living in sin or living on a lie
A holy crusade to wipe them all out
Nothing remains apart from doubt

A cry of war, we're all doomed
Armageddon - mon amour
