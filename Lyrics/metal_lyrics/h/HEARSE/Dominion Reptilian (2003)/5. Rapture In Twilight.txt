Swept away into eternity
Did I fail when leaving obscurity?
Just couldn't take a darker phase
My life continues, the past will be erased
So cold and mean, my friend the enemy
Seems so inborn almost beyond remedy

[Chorus:]
I am lost in the crimson sky
Rapture as I enter the twilight

You try so hard to drag me down
But I tell you now that there's a new sheriff in town
Always knew what you were looking for
Can't have me fooled there is no place for you here anymore

So cold and mean, my friend the enemy
Seems so inborn almost beyond remedy
Just couldn't take a darker phase
My life continues, the past will be erased
