The silence and the darkness
Seem to be so safe
The future looks so endless
When exploring outer space
Self-confident, so ignorant
As gravity is all we know
Taking life for granted
Prepared to reap what we've sown?

[Chrous:]
Are we prepared to pay the price
of our mistakes?
Are we prepared to even try
to save the human race?

There's a hole gaping wide
To have us all devoured
Nowhere for us to hide
From the corrosive showers
Running out of solutions
Now we're all on our own
Is it a dream of an illusion?
A world falling down

The parents of eternity
Brought us the daughter
A place for us to live
Of earth, wind, fire and water
To have us all devoured
Nowhere for us to hide
From the corrosive showers
