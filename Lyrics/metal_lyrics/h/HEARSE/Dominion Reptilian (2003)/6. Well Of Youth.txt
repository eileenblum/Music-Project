In my hands I held the Holy Grail
The most precious thing I've seen for decades
No one knows how to and where to find
The key to immortality and eternal life

To maintain the will to live
Even if there's nothing more to give
Artificial espiration - plastic surgery
A way of life and to survive in the 21st century

[Chorus:]
To live forever - nothing but a dream
A poisoned well of youth and eternity

Seize the day or die tommorow
The grief was yesterday so forget your sorrows
Lost in space from what galaxy do you hail?
A twisted life-form is all that on earth prevails
