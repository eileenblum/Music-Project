Show me the way and I will follow
Guide me through your world invite me into your soul
Lie to me and I'll believe every single word
As we gaze into the sun our journey has just begun

Darker than the backside of the moon
My past and present state of mind, a chaos of mental wounds
Spiritual poverty - feeding off this misery
Covered by these wings of guilt
For how long - eternity?

[Chorus:]
You are the torch - the guiding star I need
I keep the torch inside - to shine within
