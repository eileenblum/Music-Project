In times of war and death
Mankind seems so lost
The hour has struck to regret
Better hide behind the cross
Yet constantly reminded
By the atrocities abroad
Your conscience keeps denying
That a heart could be this cold

[Chorus:]
The future of our dreams
We cannot seem to reach - to reach
To contemplate our sins
And realize in the end no one wins

I see no sign of peace
Not a soothsayer am I
Keep my predictions on a leash
Inspired by the blood red sky

The end is drawing closer
It's been said so many times before
"apocalyptic revelation"
Yet this time it is for sure..
