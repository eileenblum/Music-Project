In a state of mourning, grieving those who died
A ceremony for the deceased, the caskets open wide
We're aware that life goes on in these darkest of times
Secure the existence of mankind

[Chorus:]
Dominion reptilian - this star is shining bright
Dominion reptilian - a sign in the sky
Dominion reptilian - devouring the light
Dominion reptilian - another era now dies

A land of milk and honey beyond the unknown
A hidden galaxy a distant future world of stone
We'll create our destiny and tear down the walls
Once the prisoners break free - dominions fall
