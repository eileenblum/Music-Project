When the time has come nearly five to twelve
Have to find a way how to save ourselves
A downward spiral taking us so deep
Into the planets core all Hell's unleashed
Taken by surprise, wouldn't realize
They've now found a way for us to die

On the meadows of afterlife...

[Chorus:]
No one knows who's in control
We have now reached the end of days

The sole survivors, their fight's just begun
As all their dreams turned to dust
Another world - another breed
In the afterlife - who will see?

On the meadows of afterlife - who will see?
