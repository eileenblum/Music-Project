There is no hell for me
Thereâs no pardon for my sins
I will drown for eternity
Iâll burn once and over again

I returned to a fetal state
where I was free from guilt
where the damage I caused was never meant to be

I was pushed towards hate
I was dragged into pain
Blood lust filled my guts
I had no desire, no desire to escape

Now I look forward and pray 
to a god I donât believe in
for the carnage not to end
for this hatred to begin

There is no hell for me
Thereâs no pardon for my sins
I will drown for eternity
Iâll burn once and over again

I returned to a fetal state
where I was free from guilt
where the damage I caused was never meant to be
