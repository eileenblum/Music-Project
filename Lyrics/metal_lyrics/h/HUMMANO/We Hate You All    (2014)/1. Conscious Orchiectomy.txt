Your fight means nothing, it's a pointless crusade 
for which you struggle and defy everything
that you've ever believed in, that you've ever believed

You seek for one single gasp of air to relieve all the pain that you suffer
All the bullshit you see on your fucking TV, how they lie, how they cheat, how they cover
You don't feel anything but a rageous infection invading your brain
It's the truth of a liar. Homicide they inspire

All hope for any sign of honesty is nonexistent
We're lead by crooked thieves corrupted by a failing system
Expecting us to absorb and believe
the fucking lies that they make us conceive
We're getting sick of your foolish ineptness
Our thirst for murder is becoming relentless

We're fucking sick of your foolish ineptness
Our thirst for murder is becoming relentless

How long will it take for us to understand that we're nothing but rats in a corner?
We sit and watch how they gain all our trust while we live in a world of disorder
Get up and fight for whatâs yours, there's no time to waist now
We shall decease with our honor while they shall perish through chaos and horror

They shall perish through chaos and horror

Your fight means nothing

All hope for any sign of honesty is nonexistent
We're lead by crooked thieves corrupted by a failing system
Expecting us to absorb and believe
the fucking lies that they make us conceive
We're getting sick of your foolish ineptness
Our thirst for murder is becoming relentless

We're fucking sick of your foolish ineptness
Our thirst for murder is becoming relentless

Welcome to your death row
Death, murder, kill
Killing you is my rapture
Death, murder, kill
Impaling your cracked skull
Now I feel relieved
