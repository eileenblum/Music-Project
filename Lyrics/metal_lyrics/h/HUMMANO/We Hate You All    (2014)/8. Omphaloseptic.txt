Take a single moment, any given moment, to think about everything you've lost
all the time you've spent on wasting your life away
Take a single moment, any given moment, to think about everything you've lost
all the time that you've spent 

You forgot all your values, you let go of your pride
You set aside the importance of your life
Now you've got nothing left but the hole you dug yourself into
You really fucked up this time dude

Dig out yourself. Dig out tomorrow
Dig out the life youâre seeking
Dig out anything you need to stand up and proceed
to stand up and proceed

Take a single moment, any given moment, to think about everything you've lost
all the time you've spent on wasting your life away
your life away

I took a bullet for you
You gave me nothing at all
I stood there waiting to break your fucking fall
You never thought you would see the day that it would all come back
and you stepped right in the crack

Dig out yourself. Dig out tomorrow
Dig out the life your seeking
Dig out anything you need to stand up and proceed
to stand up and proceed

Don't fucking test me
you'll fucking lose
You've got nothing to do
I'll fucking slaughter you
I'll make you squeal
