So fucking sick of people
So tired of the shit they say
I think Iâm going to dig a hole and
Iâll fake my death today

This hatredâs becoming madness and my mind has gone astray
My headâs fucked, I can't find the calmness
to give a shit about a word you say

Don't take my words for granted
Don't think that I will turn away

Hey! Hey! Thereâs not a single fuck that I could give
Hey! Hey! About your bullshit thoughts or how you live
I just can't stand the pressure of wanting to bash in your face
Convulsing, my nose is bleeding and killing I will embrace

So fucking sick of people
So tired of the shit they say
I think Iâm going to dig a hole and
 I'll fake my death today

I can't see through this scornful aching
I fucked up and Iâm unrestrained
My mind tells me not to damage
My heart says to eradicate

I'm one step closer to the end
I'll never break, I'll never bend
You can't stop me, no, you can't stop me
I'll never break, I'll never bend
I'm one step closer to the end
I'll never break, I'll never bend
I will never break

All I can feel is anger
All I can see is hate
Don't take my words for granted
Don't think that I'll turn away

Detest is my middle name

So fucking sick of people
So tired of the shit they say
I think Iâm going to dig a hole and
I'll fake my death today
