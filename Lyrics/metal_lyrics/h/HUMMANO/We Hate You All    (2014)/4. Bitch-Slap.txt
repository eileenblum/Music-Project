I won't make you try

If you love me you hate me                                                                                           
If you hate me youâre wrong                                                                                          
Canât make the past go away                                                                                          
so just forget it and move on

You make forgiveness your weapon                                                                                    
and you load it with pride                                                                                          
You pull it out unexpected                                                                                          
and make it seem like itâs all fine

Whatâs done is done, so just forgive and forget, the rest is unsaid       
Whatâs done is done, so just forgive and forget                                                                     
Make up your mind and leave your resentment aside

Sail away on this sea of lost forgiveness                                                                           
Youâll never know, youâll never see       
how it feels to be like me

You act like itâs all forgotten                                                                                     
make me believe that itâs fine                                                                                      
If you still hate me for something                                                                                  
donât make me feel like you confine

You make forgiveness your weapon          
and you load it with pride                                                                                          
You pull it out unexpected
and make it seem like itâs all fine

Get the fuck up. Go!

Whatâs done is done, so just forgive and forget
Whatâs done is done, so just forgive

Sail away on this sea of lost forgiveness                                                                           
Youâll never know, youâll never see                                                                                 
How it feels to be like me
