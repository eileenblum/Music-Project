Go waste your time on something
It's not like we're going anywhere
We take our time for granted
We'll never see, it'll be too late

We watch our lives, how they slip away
Just counting down to our final day 
We watch our lives, how they slip away
how they slip away

We never notice how much time we've spent on nothing
just letting everyday go by
Not taking chances, just forgetting that our time will come while we're in denial
We never value what we're given. Day to day is how we're living
Pulling back on everything that we have to do
that we have to do

This is a battle that we are destined to mislay
We're not growing younger
All hope is lost, we won't succeed
It all comes down to our last encounter
Between life or death, and of course death, it always wins

Times running out, the clock is ticking; can't you feel you're rotting?
Your life has blown away and you're pissed for not accomplishing
Tick tock, tick tock, you're only hours away from death and you ask yourself
what it is in life that you've ever achieved

Fucking nothing! 
Nothing!

This is a battle that we are destined to mislay
We're not growing younger
All hope is lost, we won't succeed

This is a battle that we are destined to mislay
We're not growing younger
All hope is lost, we won't succeed
It all comes down to our last encounter
Between life or death, and of course death, it always wins

See the crack in the sky

See the crack in the sky, it takes you away 
You're done, it's too late. You try to remember but nothingâs significant
You're life was a failure and now you're dead
