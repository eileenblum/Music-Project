I am the oppressor that despises your life
Follow my lead, there is no other way
I speak the truth about everyone
Deity is my name, I am the one

Look at me, lackeys and observe while I eat your souls
Bow before my greatness and kiss my feet
You know you want it, you know you need it. I am your God
Iâm never wrong, you losers are filth

I'm a despicable, hateful, human creation
Arrogant, self-centred, greedy abomination
So, where is my dignity? I can't determine my life
yet I'm a master of distrust and disappointment

Wrong is your perception, but not the reality
Question yourself before you question my tyranny
Drooling blood while I sever your fucking throat
No one dares to say shit to a God

I lust. Iâm a winner. My sins are your dreams
I use you and abuse you. Your life is my tool
I lay here, stranded by my own will
I wonât move along. Your future is doomed

Sloth, pride and envy I will embrace
I trick. I deceive. My means justify the end
With a friendly grin I lie to your face
Iâm a self-centred bitch. I have no shame

I'm a despicable, hateful, human creation
Arrogant, self-centred, greedy abomination
So, where is my dignity? I can't determine my life 
yet I'm a master of distrust and disappointment
