We are a powerless race
disabled against faith
consigned to oblivion
This is the truth, this is your fate

No time for second chances
No time to desecrate
1945 the birth of human end
A seamless warfare, itâs time to partake

The first arrival of the blinding mother ship 
brings fulgent death

Deprived of your rights, senseless you stand
senseless you stand
Enclosed in your ignorance. We are bound to fail
we are bound to fail

We are a powerless race
disabled against faith
consigned to oblivion
This is the truth, this is your fate
No time for second chances
No time to desecrate

Our future falls upon us
It's time to designate
They are walking among us
They've been here since day one                            
Our future falls upon us
Punishment of the fourth kind

Blackened lights erradicating constellations
welcome the beast and his seven heads. 
Now we have been led to our own extermination
The horror of war, the destroyer of worlds

We are a powerless race
disabled against faith
consigned to oblivion
This is the truth, this is your fate

The first arrival of the blinding mother ship 
brings fulgent death
