I'm wasting my time 
confronting a feeling that's wounding inside
A trench of regret
Bisecting the obscurity of my rotten heart
I need to get rid of the demons inside that burn me alive
before this grudge thwarts my only chance to survive
to release the pain thatâs holding me down
before the memory dispels in time

I'm wasting my time 
confronting a feeling that's wounding inside
A trench of regret
Bisecting the obscurity of my rotten heart

Iâve been deceived. I've been mislead
Aching the sorrow from inside my head
This is the truth and it hurts
It drives me insane
The enemy dressed as my friend

In solitude I stand against time
Mourning in pain 
The judgment day is at hand
Bemused by the illness of death

The enemy dressed as my friend
Bemused by the illness of death
Before the memory dispels in time
