I see a disturbing face staring straight at me. 
Canât say who the fuck it is or what it wants. 
Itâs the most disturbing face Iâve ever seen in my life, 
And it wonât take its eyes off of me. 

My body paralyzes, my eyes just cannot open. 
My body paralyzes, canât get any voice out of my mouth. 

The fear invades me. The blood rushes to my head. 
My heart starts beating at the speed of this nightmare. 

I canât wake up! I canât wake up! 
Please stop staring at me, looking at me. 
I canât wake up, please wake me up! 
Please stop staring at me, looking at me! 

My body paralyzes, my eyes just cannot open. 
My body paralyzes, canât get any voice out of my mouth.
