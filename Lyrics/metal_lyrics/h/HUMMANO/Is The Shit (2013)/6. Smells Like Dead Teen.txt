The Family! 

Look around, see all of us gathered. 
Granted with the gift of pleasure,
Draining our lungs into laughter. 

Crushing the bones of a scorched bird. 
Sweet blood gushing down my throat. 
Life seems good, life seems easy. 

Damn not those who lay unfortunate, 
Damn not those who live in hell. 

Cherish the time we spend together. 
Thy soul wonât shine forever. 
Listen to my voice, listen to it close. 

This is our feud of depravity, 
Our last chance to immortality. 
Our prose will prevail. 

Life seems good, life seems easy. 

Damn not those who lay unfortunate, 
Damn not those who live in hell. 

A tear scars my face, 
A scar that reminds us who we are. 
A tear scars my face. 
We are the ones that will shine.
