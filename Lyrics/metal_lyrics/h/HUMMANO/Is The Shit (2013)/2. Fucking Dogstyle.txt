With my life in one hand, that is slipping away. 
Youâre strapped to an edge that is shredding to pieces. 
How did you think this would end? 

The thorns in my chest are flaying my skin. 
Writhing in pain, I want to let go. 
My torn insides make it impossible to breathe. 

I donât want need this, I donât need this, I want to let go! 
I donât need this, I donât want this anymore!

Say something you fuck, say anything. 
Youâre going down with me. 

Go make amends of all the things youâve destroyed. 
Youâd better not fucking disagree. 

With my life in one hand, that is slipping away. 
Youâre strapped to an edge that is shredding to pieces. 
How did you think this would end? 

Say what, you say. 
Youâll never be worthy of your integrity. 

Get your shit together! 

All the mistakes you have made in your life 
Are finally coming back to make things right. 
Youâve been so careless over the past, 
Now itâs coming back to you. 

All the mistakes you have made in your life 
Are finally coming back to make things right. 
Youâve been so careless over everything.
