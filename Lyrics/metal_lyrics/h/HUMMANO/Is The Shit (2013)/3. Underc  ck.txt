This will no longer happen.

I can hardly hear my breathing. 
An adrenaline rush gushes through my throat. 
I can hardly believe I've done this. 
It was the right time no crying alone. 

Forever secluded in my own self. 
Hundreds of needles puncturing my skin. 
Brutalized, criticized, mentally abused. 
I can see them laughing right in front of me. 

Compromised, in my eyes, you can feel my rage. 
I can see the objects crush into their face. 

Yeah! But this is now! 
I've got a plan and I'm laughing out loud. 
This is fucking now! 
A straight hate payback from the guy in the background. 

I've been waiting for this moment so long. 
After the bullshit, all the gossip and jokes. 
The way they look, the way they look tonight. 
Trying to put their entrails back inside. 

Brutalized, criticized, mentally abused. 
I can hear them laughing right in front of me. 
Compromised, in my eyes, you can feel my rage. 
I can see the objects crush into their face. 

Merciless! 

This is how I party, covered in your priceless blood. 
Whoâs the looser now? You inbreds. You can ask the worms. 
Smashed and destroyed by the monster you've made me become. 

Beautiful people, havenât you heard? 
The jokeâs on you. Itâs revenge of the nerds. 
Beautiful people, havenât you heard? 
Now the jokeâs on you!
