Heading out on an awesome night. 
Looking good and Iâm feeling right. 
I grab my keys and Iâm on the road. 
Pick up the guys, now itâs time for the show. 
Cause itâs what makes us feel alive. 
Forget the weekdays, nowâs the time. 
Annihilationsâ turn is now. 
Forget the weekdays, nowâs the time. 
Annihilation. 

Letâs get fucked up, letâs be proud! 

You say, today, all you need is a breakaway. 
You donât know what to do, but only one thing your mind is set to. 
You canât ignore it, you just need it, you can breathe it. 
Tonight we're getting fucked up. 

Heading out on an awesome night. 
Looking good and Iâm feeling right.
I grab my keys and Iâm on the road. 
Pick up the guys, now itâs time for the show.
Cause itâs what makes us feel alive. 
Forget the weekdays, nowâs the time. 

Letâs be proud! 

You're wasted, shitfaced. 
Everything seems fucking great. 
Time flies, you don't know why.
Soon itâs time to say goodbye. 
Walk home such a fucking mess. 
But no remorse no fucking stress.
The night consumed through a shot glass.

Letâs get fucked up!
Letâs be proud!
