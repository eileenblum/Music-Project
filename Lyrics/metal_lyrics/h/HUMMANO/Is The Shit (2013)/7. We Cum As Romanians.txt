The blood is rushing up to my head. 
I feel pissed off by the moment. 
And itâs all because of you. 
Because itâs true. 

Canât go on like this much longer. 
My weakness is growing stronger. 
You know it cause itâs true! 

So donât bother, 
Go blame it on your father, 
Go blame it on your mother. 
You know it cause itâs true, 
Itâs all because of you. 

Blame it on your father, 
Blame it on your mother. 
You know it cause itâs true, 
Itâs all because of you. 

Your innocence has been lost. 
Your sweetness is a lost cause. 
You try to make me feel like itâs my fault. 

Canât go on like this much longer. 
My weakness is growing stronger. 
You know it cause itâs true! 

Youâre cowardly disgusting. 
For me you are just nothing. 
You fake what you really are. 

Donât bother, 
Go blame it on your father, 
Go blame it on your mother. 
You know it cause itâs true, 
Itâs all because of you. 

Blame it on your father, 
Blame it on your mother. 
You know it cause itâs true, 
Itâs all because of you, because of you. 

Donât bother, 
Go blame it on your father, 
Blame it on your mother. 
You know it cause itâs true, 
Itâs all because of you, all because of you.
