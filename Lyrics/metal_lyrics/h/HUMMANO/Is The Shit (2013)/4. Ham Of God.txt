I was walking through the darkness of my mind. 
I discovered a place where I could find 
A side of me that would always be broken.

 So I looked in the mirror, 
I just saw it so clear. 
Saw the eyes of a monster. 
Finally faced my own fears. 

I chased the shadows away. 
Admitted what I really am. 
The need to survive made me into what I am today. 
I can feel it inside, making its way out of me. 

The dark passenger. 

I discovered a place where I could find 
A side of me that would always be broken, 
A side of me that would always be... 

So I looked in the mirror. 
My reflection appeared 
As what I really am, 
As what I really feel. 

I chased the shadows away. 
Admitted what I really am. 
The need to survive made me into what I am today. 
I can feel it inside making its way out of me, 
Making its way out of me.
