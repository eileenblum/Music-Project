WARRIORS, UNAFRAID AND WILLING IN THE WARFIELD
RESTING BROTHERS! YOU FELT THE COLD OF THIS DAY
NOW YOU CANNOT FEEL THE COLDNESS OF NIGHT
YOUR SOULS SHALL BE IN THE SHADE OF SKULL MOUNTAIN!

I AM WOUNDED AND LOST ONE FOR DARKEST ONE!!!

BEFORE THIS DAYâS END I WILL TAKE THESE DOGS WITH ME
I WILL LEAVE THIS WORLD IâLL EMBRACE INFERNAL SUFFER
BEFORE THIS DAYâS END IâLL EMBRACE INFERNAL SUFFER!

I SHALL EMBRACE TORMENTS OF DARK SIDE!!!

EVERYTHING SHALL BEGIN WHEN EVERYTHING ENDS
IâD RATHER CLOSE MY EYES FOR REBORN AGAIN!!!
NOW, TIME TO SAY GOODBYEâ¦
