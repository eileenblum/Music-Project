insect stung pin in my stomach
I was masked insane
master of darkness ordered extreme deformity
I was staring to Cronos
gorehunger, I am nightwalker
I am the commander
I am the disciple of armies of fatal darkside
and troops of gore
we serve to Lord Tepes
the king of all goresuckers

the impaler, the Fallen Angel's son come
he is the son of evil, gore time has come
eminent reptile hissed command to me
Vlad ordered:
"Take black cross and free us"
I turned myself into black wolf
I assailed with my flock
howlings fell upon holy temple
all fathers cut like butchered lambs
brutality and cannibalistic deformity
deform upon burning cross
divisive lycansuckers fed
gore of headless fathers
I, Valeck, confiscated
black cross in barbaric night
