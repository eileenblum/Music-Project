cruor in fosam confusum
ut inde manis elicerent
animas responsa daturas

behold the lions of Necuratul
the impaler
who came first as a knight of the light
but returns not as a knight
but now as a son of king of all kings
to rule in power and glory forever
vengeful shadows of darkness
hear me
take vengeance on grace of holiness
devour sacred necks
suck bleeding wounds
burn kingdom
unleash hellhounds
onward
