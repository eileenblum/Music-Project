from Transylvania arose a Romanian knight
his bride, Elizabeth, knew that he must face an insurmountable force
Elizabeth flung herself into the river
believing him dead
god be praised, I am victorious, god be praised
my prince is dead, all is lost without him
may god unite us in heaven
she has taken her own life
her soul can not be saved
she is damned, it is god's law

is this my reward for defending god's church?
I renounce god
I shall rise from my own death to avenge hers with all powers of darkness
your impotent men with their foolish spells can't protect you from my power
from eternal hunger for living blood
sacrilege, I renounce you
I shall rule all powers of darkness
the blood is the life and it shall be mine
