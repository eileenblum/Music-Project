I am knight of dark gods
Masters of pain seed cruelty I fight to kill innocence
Master's shadows reflect mortality
Terrorists of darkness to testify dominance
Assault to enemies murdered merciless
I cut sacrifice in cold blood
I killed sacrifice all of bodies and souls
Innocent recruit beheaded my head
I felt in darkness I died
My soul jailed in the dark
My soul can't saved from the dark
I implored to masters, salvation, liberation
Coffin vomited me to kill and dominate
Altars of innocent lonely and suffocate
Breeze of emperor gives them fear and sorrow
Eternal torment in eternal war
