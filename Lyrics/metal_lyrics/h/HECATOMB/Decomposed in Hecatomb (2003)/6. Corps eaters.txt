Sacrifices living in dark forest
They are awaiting death
Ventols attack to them in fog
They kill and eat them

Humans will die by eaters of dead
Ventols attacked to sacrifice
Torture goes on every night
Fresh meats eaten
Fresh meats gnawed
Smells of blood, removed guts
Cut heads, hecatomb in dark

Ceremony of death was horror again
Animalistic instinct won again
Bloody pieces spreaded to everywhere
Fresh corpses eaten by eaters of dead
