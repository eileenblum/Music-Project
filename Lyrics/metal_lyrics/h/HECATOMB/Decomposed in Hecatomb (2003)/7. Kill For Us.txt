Waiting death machines in silent underground
Wake up death machines, kill for us
Rotten hands coming out, rotten lungs breathing
No escape from this terror, death is coming cruelty
Their rules given pain everytime kill them for us
This revenge destroys all mankind
Kill them, they bleeding
Eat and kill, end to all, be cruel, death to all
No mercy to sacrifice
Kill them, kill for us
Kill for us
