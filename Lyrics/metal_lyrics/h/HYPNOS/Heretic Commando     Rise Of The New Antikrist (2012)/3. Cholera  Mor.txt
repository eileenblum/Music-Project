You are nothing but prey 
One in a resigned herd 
That daily fattens up its own doom 
Which you only despise for appearanceÂ´s sake 
You are non entity 
In a throng of plebeian lice 
Eating themselves alive 
Unworthy of the (freeborn) life 
Feel as it leaks through each single chink 
Through every door ajarâ¦â¦ Infectious 
Sick epoch of plague. 
Intrusive renaissance of sexless aggressors 
Carnivorous 
Cult of insects born for vexatious race 
Shadows snooping aroundâ¦â¦ Insatiate 
Captured in the net of an unctuous speech 
Commercial slogans pour in 
â¦â¦..Brainwashing got reformed 

Whatever I feel 
Whoever is luring me 
Wherever I shall roam, all over 
Cholera/Mor 

Whatever I face 
Wherever I stay 
Wherever I shall soar, all over 
Cholera/Mor 

ItÂ´s sick â¦.so sick 

Teeming of supranational worms 
They penetrate the insideâ¦ through skinâ¦. right into the mind 
With every weakness found 
theyÂ´re getting stronger and deform furtively 
WeÂ´re surrounded by an accoustic smog 
taking breath to resist this malicious disease 

Cholera/Mor
