Proud age of mental greyness and misery of knowledge 
We search for true giants, unearthing them from deepest swamps 
Sad theyÂ´re well-hidden but once theyÂ´re seen 
we take a solid hammer and nail them to the golden throne 
We praise the defenders of land 
We praise the sanity, dignity andâ¦ 
Pride, honour, glory 
Pride, honour, glory 

Chronicles of our fathers covered in dust 
Esteem of authorities forever lost and gone 
Digital ecstasy kills the legacy of past heroes 
But once we find some, we nail them to the golden throne 

Oh, what a burdensome living 
Coarseness improves decency 
We greatly love to breed educated dolts 
Blameless deceivers, sinful believers 
We laud the assassins and cast them in films 
The wise beyond the veil, knowledge is for sale 
Oh, what a burdensome living 
Riff-raff are attacking the throne 

Aura of bygone savants is in the air 
and todayâs roads already paved with disrespect 
Oh, you fathers of progress, writers of essential tomes 
Now we take the hugest hammer and nail you to the golden throne 

Pride, honour, glory 
Pride, honour, glory
