I canÂ´t even remember when the sun died 
thereÂ´s just drabness in my mind 
Why should I explain that even breathing is so tiring 
on a crossing leading to the other side 
Leave me lying calmly under the creased blanket, 
let me doze off and go away 
Darken the room with autumnal twilight 
open the windows to freezing air 
Yesterday I observed the sky, awaiting a ray of light 
but all I could see around me was completely dark, 
as reconciled flesh leisurely consumed by eternal night 
through the mouth of Mors, with every new breath I am inhaling death 

Falling into a warm volcanic throat 
Never to be born again 
ReliefÂ´s waiting at the end of the road 
Deliverance from torturous pain 

Why are you telling me merciful drivel about the will to live? 
My power is gone, just a pre-mortal feeling deep inside of me 
My train is brought to a standstill in a neglected terminal station 
Just howling of forsaken dogs as a closing oration 

The awaited morning is not coming again 
Night simply turned into another one 
Every look back hurts as a knife stab in brain. 
Flashbacks are bringing me down 
TodayÂ´s winners stand on the opposite shore 
Glad they are saved for another day 
Everyhting that could be lostâ¦â¦is lost 
Such an extremely dark day!
