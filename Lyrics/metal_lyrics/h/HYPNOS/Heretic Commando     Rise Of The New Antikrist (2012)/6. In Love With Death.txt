Mind, your mind keeps on wandering
While your body gets tense and taut
Longing for self-imposed suicide
Eyes, wide open and yet totally blind
Blinded by arrows of Cupid
Dull poetry obscuring mind
Heart, invisible snake bites your heart
Weird poison slowly spreads in blood
Addiction to a transient drug
Cage, your lust is solid iron cage
and passion is a malicious bait
to snatch you and set you in jail

Nature has started its eternal fight
Struggling to catch us in a trap so hard
With bullets called love wants us torn apart
But I stay away, IÂ´m in love with death

Enchanted with a sugary sham
Preparing for a majestic death
All honors shall be included
Hey, donÂ´t ask me what else you should do
All senses are cheating on you
Embarrassing all the way through

Nature has started its eternal fight
Struggling to catch us in a trap so hard
With bullets called love wants us torn apart
But I stay away, IÂ´m in love with death
Nature has started its eternal fight
Nature has started its eternal fight
Discreetly waiting for another chance
Believe me, love is nothing but a fake
