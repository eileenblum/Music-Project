The gates of ignorance are widely open now
The voidÂ´s coming closer to our doors
Against this influx of all-pervasive contagion
We must build up a solid wall
We laugh at the shallow worship
of immersion in social scum
We laugh at the metro sexual
vision of a perfect life
We scorn this modern fashion
to show off own barrenness
We scorn all trendy flashers
With smashing visage

Our hate is melting down in a furnace with finest steel
and from this steel we craft the locks
Forbiddingly securing our dwellings
against the expansive void

[REF:]
Versus the void
Versus the void
Versus the void
Versus the void

Emptiness is crawling out of profound darkest abyss
The stench is reaching for our legs
Hyenas gathered, patiently waiting for next feast
smelling the cult of gorgeous flesh â FLESH!
All concerns about stardom, about mankind salvation
all efforts to fulfill the global dream
This all means nothing against the shield of our brotherhood
we are the warriors against the void

What kind of human nature
starving for tidings but
daily gluttonized
with useless information
Absorbing flood of nothing
Living on tv drivel
Brigades of slaves of shopping
lost in tedium

[REF:]
Versus the void
Versus the void
Versus the void
Versus the void
