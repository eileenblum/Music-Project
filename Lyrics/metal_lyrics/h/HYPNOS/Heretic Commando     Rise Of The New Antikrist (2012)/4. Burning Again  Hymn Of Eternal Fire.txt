Kold day in heaven, even kolder one in hell,
Fake believers search for a place for afterlife,
And resurrektion, this universal spell
Is grimacing faces of self-styled Demigods.
Oh, what a herd of sheep!
With their own flesh theyÂ´re feeding hungry wolves.
Oh, brothers of sin,
Behold new pastors who have kome to heal the world.

[REF:]
We shall rise to bring the light
We shall roar the gospels down
We shall burn as the cleansing flame
In the name of sane ones â weÂ´re burning again

LetÂ´s rise together to be the ones who show the way.
Be the eyes for the blind, leaders of the weak.
On the ruins of their altars, there will be no more need to pray
And any step aside is no more called a sin.
Oh, reborn of a human, reborn of sanity,
Koming thru the flames.
Oh, since our paths started,
We are the fire and weÂ´re sentenced to burn.

[Repeat REF]

Kold day in heaven, even kolder in hell,
How easy is to follow a path to God
We sing this anthem marching against sacred gates
To set free the prisoners on a journey to the sky
Oh, bekause weÂ´re fire
And we will incinerate the seeds of toxic faiths
Oh, big sleep is over,
The monster is awake and mightily krawling back.

[Repeat REF]
