Fear, religion is a fear that bows our heads
and builds cathedrals.
Fear that only bends the knees, stammers litanies
and pretends honest love.
FaithÂ´s teaching of slavish grace
Self-denial, obedience
FaithÂ´s teaching of slavish grace

Is the God liable for all wars, for the blood of innocents,
persecution, inquisitionÂ­?
Did he permitted the tyrants to kill the patriots
and burn his friends at stake?

[REF:]
Did you ask the Holy Father and his Vatican squad
If theyÂ´ve been walking through Auschwitz back in the 40âs?
Do you think those gas chambers are also divine act?
Then donât ever ask the question why we are inverted.

Church pretends connection with the God
Knows that way to timeless joy is a journey towards death
Preaches salvation by holy faith where docile turn into angels
Disbelievers damned

Then donât ever ask the question why we are inverted.
We never submit to someone whoÂ´s not above of us
We never join the flock of feeble sheep of God
We never fall in the abyss of self-abasement
We prefer to live our lives here and now, thatÂ´s why weÂ´re inverted

Inverted
