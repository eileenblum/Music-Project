Young and brave
born to hate
join us now
we are green enough

Never ask me why
it is all the same
we need to survive
we need to survive...today

[REF:]
Come on soldiers I will take you
on the glory ride
you will like it, you will be always
fighting side by side
to finish one's human story
you do not need to spell
when again your gun is loaded
you will say: Go to hell!!

We are your future
find your enemy
we are top class culture
you brainless family

Never ask me...

[REF]

Praise the war
army's force
praise your green
uniform

Never ask me why
