Keep me hot
let me dream, let the blood stream
into my throat
give me life, give me hope
give me blood
fill my veins, fill my heart
fill me up

[REF:]
In blood we like to drown
in blood cannot reach the bottom
in blood matter of lust
in blood in blood we trust

Follow drops, dark red points
living cells
create new live, learn him breathe
without help
create the hands, create the legs
work with flesh
without blood it used to be
meaningless

[REF]

I am born in blood and created of pain
thousand times buried, thousand times dead

Let me smell the scent of my destiny
let me win my next sweet victories
cut my hands, cut my legs, set me free
let me crawl, let me cry, let me bleed

[REF]
