We are modern Antichrists, the bible we deny
we do not waste the time in the church
there is thousand better ways
how to spend a life
we leave that world behind
we cease praying to god
it brings no difference anyway
we do not need this world
where everything is a sin

[REF:]
Save yourself, refuse this madness
forget sains, they are fabricated
we are living without JESUS
cause we are all sacrilegious

Tell me chosen one if this is fun
staring at a cross from your knees
without any proof
why to worship king of the wood
listen to your mouth
your brain has to be fucked
you are still repeating holy rules
they are fooling you, you are the statue
of 20th century of fools

[REF]

They are stupid, they are smart
easily make you blind
you lie to yourself, cannot you see?
the saints your friends
they have never been

[REF]
