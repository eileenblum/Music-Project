Looking at your peaceful face
another worm is born
we are living by the human's rules
living worse than the worms
we are still supporting parasites
there is nothing we can do
sperm, shit, vomit, alcohol
it is the stuff describing you

[REF:]
The razor blade, a closest friend
a little brain, both hands left
their soul is black, their mind is dark
we are breathing them, we are bleeding....
...the scum
Breeding the scum
Breeding the scum
Breeding the scum
Breeding the scum

Too stupid to understand
how to behave, how to live
too clever to realize

How to rip off, how to be
lazy useless parasite
still making us all stick
re-producing brand new worms
showing the world to brand new scum

[REF]

Their soul is black ....
