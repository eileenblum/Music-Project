Stupid fights make us weak, bloodbrothers
only thing that matters is the quality
quality of our seed, of our brains
forever

[REF:]
Lucifer my lord I miss you
what do you want I am here to lead you
forget all this silly shit
I join in the brotherhood
hand in hand we touch the places
without borders, no differences
we show you now where to go
where we bring new inferno

This is the common war, bloodbrothers
against the simpleminded mass
unite the energy, together
forget the rest

[REF:]
We're working on new nation
not thinking of separation
horizon is not too far
our new land is infernal
hand in hand we touch the places
without borders, no differences
we show you now where to go
where we bring new inferno

[REF:]
Sky's turning red, we're still
seven kinds of burning steel
against the crap we raise our fist
there is the time to leave the mist
hand in hand we touch the places
without borders, no differences
we show you now where to go
where we bring new inferno
