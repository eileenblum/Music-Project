Caught in the spider's web

Inside of the spider, trying to survive
hardly taking breath from nowhere
drowned in slime simply sentenced to die
skinless body falls away

Voracious possession of glass eyes
persistent look before the poisonous touch

Carnivorous holiday, tied in a cobweb
agonizing deadly cramps, victim of spider-werk

Corrosive stomach, sturdy grips
eaten by spiders, dissappeared...

Systematic genocide, paralysing trap
eternally stigmatized, victim of spider-werk

Inside of the spider, trying to survive
hardly taking breath from nowhere
such a nice imagination
but I'll never be the fly!
