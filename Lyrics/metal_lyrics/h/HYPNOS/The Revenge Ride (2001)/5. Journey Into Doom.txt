Organized chaos, ride into doom
hunting for goldshine, under cold moon
Awkward messiahs, hamburgered tribes,
crucified Allah, lust within drugs

Future in the abyss, ideals fell
Ride on a black horse, straight down to Hell!
Celebrated liars, shot between eyes
Earth's blood on fire, ending our times.

Decadence prevails, deception sells well
secure last journey, to seventh Hell
innocent killers lay down the rules
one season rivers lead us to doom...
