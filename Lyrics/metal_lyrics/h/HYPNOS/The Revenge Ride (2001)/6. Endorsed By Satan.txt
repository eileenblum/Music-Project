Marching out of divinized guts of the world
through sick forest of human minds
surrounded by Christian worms we're awaiting the dusk
day of final invocation
I am the winner, God bless Satan!

Endorsed by Satan

Visible and invisible protector of light
Horny guardian angel, psora medicine
with favourite toy Crucifix, him-father Antichrist
Day of final invocation
I am the winner, God bless Satan

Endorsed by Satan

Screech
The sweetest thing to hear
Orgasmic bogus harmonies
Fear The most thrilling thing to see
Scared to death of reveries

Marching out of hypocrisy
marching out of wimps,
supper made of earwigs pulses on,
hanging out with f/r/iend,
laughing off to all,
day of final invocation
I am the winner, God bless Satan!

Endorsed by Satan
