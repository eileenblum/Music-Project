I am the wind, lost in time
deep forest ghost, your silent...silent laugh
I am the wind all over the world
watching the stars hidden in crawling fog

I am the wind, a freezing storm
I am desert grip, perfidious northern stroke
As cold as death, as hot as hell
Dark breath of night, still the lonely wanderer

[REF:]
So fly with me,
spread your arms and try to forget gravity
there's one more step from mind's edge to eternity
we're getting higher, feeling a bit free...

I am the wind that falcons use to fly
upon the frozen lakes we unite
I am the wind, you'll never catch up with me behind the polar line - I'm reborn

[REF:]
So fly with me
become a piece of immortal history
be shadow, be raincoat over storming seas
no better freedom could be my own destiny
