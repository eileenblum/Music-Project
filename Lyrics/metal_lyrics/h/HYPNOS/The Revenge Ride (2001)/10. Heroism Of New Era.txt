Glorify new heroes, down with moral cries
our era began in time
material frenzy contra terroris(la)m
self-satisfaction suicide

[REF:]
See through the lies, old hero dies
consuming kind, purulent find
Dogmatic wars, criminal source
suicidal art of new era

No more days of peace
time-bomb friend pays ticket to Paradise
Really shall we have to read between the li(n)es of Koran? Fundamentally blind

[REF]

Kill, kill in the name of Jihad
kill for your delusions
You've got the right to finish with everyone
Blocked in rudiment mind, you're the king of wimps

[REF:]
Wide open eyes, new hero dies,
absent smile, heaven's trial
Dogmatic wars, criminal source
suicidal art of new era.
