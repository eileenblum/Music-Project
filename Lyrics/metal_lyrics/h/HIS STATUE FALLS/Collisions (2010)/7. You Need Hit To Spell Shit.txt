So here we are
Hopefully
Well prepared
For everything that may now happen to us

This conversation, we're leading now
Just tell me where your heart belongs
Iâve tried to reach you, just for one more time
Just tell me where your heart belongs

This is what came down
This is to believe
We're coming together
This is what came down
This is to believe
We're coming together

Time had come to get things going on
And on this way I noticed that there's no space left for us
Wherever it may go we should be down with it
Cause if we're not all this will break us up

This is all we are, and what we need
It's all we have, and what we're able to
This is all we are, and what we need
It's all we have, and what we're able to

Hiding but nowhere and this wasn't all my fault
Attempt to hold on
This is what came down

This is what came down
This is to believe
We're coming together
This is what came down
This is to believe
We're coming together

Time had come to get things going on
Wherever it may go we should be down with it
Cause if we're not all this will break us
Like sometimes in the past
When everything looked quiet good
But wasn't as we see
