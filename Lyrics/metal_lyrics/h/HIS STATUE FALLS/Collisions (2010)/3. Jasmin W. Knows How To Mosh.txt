Come on

This is something
That you should know
No idea how to say it
Maybe like this

Hear me scream for your love
And let me be the one you've been searching for
Come on lean on me
Let's share this way of living
Cause we're made for each other
Can't you feel it

Make up your mind
Before you break me once again
Make up your mind
Before you break me once again
(we're) so far away from everything I feel
So far away

Can you feel the beating on the inside
You need to know
It hasn't been so low
Can you feel the beating on the inside 
You really know
It is alive somehow

I said so much
And you were listening
But you just didn't get me
Maybe like this

I felt so save and so secure
(So save so secure)
But you stabbed me one more time
Stabbed me one more time
(One more time)
I felt so save, so secure
(So save so secure)
But you stabbed me one more time
Stabbed me one more time

This is about to burn
(Be prepared)
I'm so tired
(Of being concerned)
Later on
(You will see)
What I mean

This is about to burn

Can you feel the beating on the inside 
You need to know
It hasn't been so low
Can you feel the beating on the inside 
You really know
It is alive somehow

This is about to burn
I said so much
And you were listening
It's over now
You ruined it all
And you know that
RIGHT?!?
