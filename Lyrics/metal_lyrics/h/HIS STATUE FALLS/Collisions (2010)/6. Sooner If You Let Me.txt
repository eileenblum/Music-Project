Another apron of tears and pain
(realize and just let go)
That shows how far we made it
(it will never be the same)
Nowhere till now
In the end you'll see sooner or later
That every step we took together
Was a possibility

Higher, deeper - 
Look through my eyes
See what fear denies

Sooner if you let me
Later if we try
But never say
That it's my fault alone
Cause everyday was different 
And so were we
Lean back and take a deep breath 
Because

All these days you've made truth so wonderful
Faithful words
But that fading smile of yours so sorryful
Lean back and take a deep breath because

Because you know why
(realize and just let go)
We're standing here
In front of all that mess
(it will never be the same)
That just won't disappear
Stop pretending 
Stop telling lies
Liar, liar
Stop pretending 
Stop telling lies
Liar, liar

Sooner if you let me
Later if we try
But never say
That it's my fault alone
Cause everyday was different 
And so were we
Don't blame me 
Don't blame me
Don't blame me

All these days you've made truth so wonderful
Faithful words
But that fading smile of yours so sorryful
Lean back and take a deep breath because

Stop pretending 
Stop telling lies
Stop pretending 
Cause you know why
