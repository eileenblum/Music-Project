My mistress' eyes 
Are nothing like the sun
If you're not down with what I say
Stop breathing
And go fuck yourself

Say you know 
What means forever
For either ways
Say you know 
Then let's burn together
My bleeding heart

This is what we are 
This is to remain
This is what we are 
We give what we can

This is what we are 
This is to remain
This is what we are 
We give what we can

All we are is, empty bodies
No heart, no soul, no anything
All we are is, empty bodies
No heart, no soul, no anything

My mistress' eyes 
Are nothing like the sun
If you're not down with what I say
Stop breathing
And go fuck yourself

This is what we are 
This is to remain
This is what we are 
We give what we can

This is what we are 
This is to remain
This is what we are 

Thank you, thank you 
For nothing and for all
Not for the pain for the insight

Thank you, thank you 
For nothing and for all
Not for the pain for the insight
