[Japanese Bonus Track]Suddenly
Everything is broken
And I'm here
Only to get it right
You disappear
A silhouette remains

And all my life
I did work so hard
To be a better man
But now I'm scarred 
Take me back
I don't wanna stay

We could have so much more to stay
But we decide to give it to another day
So I can sleep - but only for a night 
A path that's leading right away
But I'm sure that we will meet another day
A free fall, a free fall, a free fall

So weak
Driven by emotions
And I'm
Drowning in memories
Curtain call
Thank you for nothing

All my life
I did work so hard
To be a better man
But now I'm scarred 
Take me back
I don't wanna stay

We could have so much more to stay
But we decide to give it to another day
So I can sleep - but only for a night 
A path that's leading right away
But I'm sure that we will meet another day
A free fall, a free fall, a free fall
