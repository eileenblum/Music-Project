As you see 
I'm here just like you wanted me
To give in 
I lost my sympathy for them
It's raining for a week now 
Let's take it as a cure
To wash away this killing truth

I'm sick and tired of wasting time but how to stop it yet
No answers - just silly phrases running through my head
I'm sick and tired of counting days so pull the trigger now
Please stop it or it will kill me - bye for now

Give it up! Give it up! Cause it's right now
Give it up! Cause the time seems bright now
Everything you had - now to forget
Give it up! Give it up! Cause it's right now
Give it up! Cause the time seems bright now
Everything you had - now to forget

Once again
You've left me breathless - here I am
So understand 
That every story has an end
No more one last chapter, 
No more one last try
So this could be my last goodbye

Give it up! Give it up! Cause it's right now
Give it up! Cause the time seems bright now
Everything you had - now to forget
Give it up! Give it up! Cause it's right now
Give it up! Cause the time seems bright now
Everything you had - now to forget
Now to forget
Now to forget
Now to forget

As you see 
I'm here just like you wanted me
I'm here just like you wanted me
No more one last chapter, 
No more one last try
So this could be my last goodbye
