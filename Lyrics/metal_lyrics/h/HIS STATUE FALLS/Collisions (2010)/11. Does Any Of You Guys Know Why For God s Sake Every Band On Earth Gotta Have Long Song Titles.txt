Why are we believing
That we're all heroes

When we are pretending
In everything we do

Broken dreams, drying tears, fading memories
Lost in thoughts about this game called life

We realize when we fail
And keep it to ourselves
There is no discretion

Even if I would have the chance to change it I would not
Cause without all this I am simply nothing
Please don't try to find an answer just look forward and move on

[Chorus:]
Wake up, break out this is the only way we found
Wake up and break out this is the only way we found - home

Where have all those feelings gone
That led us to those days when we were happy, together
Please don't try to find an answer just look forward and move on

We seek to fall, we seek to fall

Broken dreams drying tears fading memories
Lost in thoughts about this game called life
ABOUT THIS GAME CALLED LIFE
