I write these lines with blood on the wall
My dedication for when I'm gone
What you remember if you see these words
Love hope and a bitter taste of truth

Making the same mistake - 
Again and again - 
Again and again

The same mistake

I am sorry, no time to see you
Now i don't have good thoughts anymore
Would you remember
If you see these words
Love, hope and that bitter taste of truth

And I feel sorry

A way to say goodbye

I wish one day this world will
Hear me
And my dedication
For when I'm gone
Love, hope and a bitter taste of truth
