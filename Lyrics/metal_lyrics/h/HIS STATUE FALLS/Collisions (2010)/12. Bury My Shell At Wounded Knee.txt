Again we took a step back
And I can't stand it anymore
A waste of time that's all it was
We should have realized it
The same old story written new
The same mistakes the same regrets
But after all it was the best
For everyone except you
Tell me how you're feeling
How you can go on knowing
That we nearly found a way
Come on talk to me

We nearly made it dear
How does that feel right now?
Are you feeling better?
Come on talk to me

[Chorus:]
Thinking over the things that I still miss
For the sake of my heart I should stay strong
Thinking over that there's no place to run away

Step1

It's time to break through
That apathetic way of life

Step2

Clear up your mind and learn
To use the passion that you have

Step3

Be honest to yourself
And everybody that's around

Step4

Stay strong and go on
Never stop dreaming

As you see
Things work out in the end
Just believe in who you are
As you see
Things work out in the end
Take my hand
And follow me

So take my hand - and follow me

[Chorus:]
Thinking over the things that I still miss
For the sake of my heart I should stay strong
Thinking over that there's no place to run away
