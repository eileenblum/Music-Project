I've never seen this coming
Not even in my wildest dreams

All conversations led to nothing
But neverending anger, hate and ignorance

So the tables seem to turn
And you really know that I've got so much
But nothing for you

The ones you love are the ones you scare
Anger, hate and ignorance
It's over now, it's over now
Led to nothing but misunderstanding

Bitch

Tell me what you know and all of you
Then tell me why you turned off me and left me alone
So this is why you turned
And you really know that youâll never know

Every moment was a pleasure until you broke it all
Believe me, believe me
Every moment was a pleasure until you broke it all
Believe me, believe me

Here we are now, at this point
Where we never wanted to be
Here we are now, at this point
Where we never wanted to be

Tell me what you know and all of you
Then tell me why you turned off me and left me alone
So this is why you turned
And you really know that youâll never know

Every moment was a pleasure until you broke it all
Believe me, believe me
Believe me, believe me
