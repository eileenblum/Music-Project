Some might say I am a starry-eyed man
A guy, a fool, a terrible friend
A bitch, a lover
But they don't really understand
That this train called life
Is speeding up
It moves too fast
It cannot stop
Enjoy the ride
The end is yet to come

Who in the world could stop you
Who in the world could stop you now
Who in the world could stop you
No one but yourself

[Chorus X2:]
Get in, move out
All in, no doubt
Call me dreamer now
I don't mind it

Trust me
I am the one to set the world on fire
The end is yet to come
Help me to feed the flames
With our deepest desires
The end is yet to come
(The end is yet to come)
(The end is yet...)

No regrets, no lies, diversity
No blood, no tears, loyalty
A love, a life
And everything in between

Who in the world could stop you
Who in the world could stop you now
Who in the world could stop you
No one but yourself

[Chorus X2:]
Get in, move out
All in, no doubt
Call me dreamer now
I don't mind it

Trust me
I am the one to set the world on fire
The end is yet to come
Help me to feed the flames
With our deepest desires
The end is yet to come
