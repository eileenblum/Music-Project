And when the world collapses
I could not care less
I build my own instead
Because I am the architect

Hold on tight
The world spins way too fast these days
Grab as many living hands you can and fly away

[Chorus:]
No end in sight
There's no need to hide
There's nothing to prove
This is what we are
This is everything we are

My heart is free
So call me homeless
If home is where the heart is
In the blink of an eye
I breathe in a lifetime

And while the world is set afire
We couldn't care less
We couldn't care less
We couldn't care less

This is why I'm alive
This is why I carry on
With bleeding for the dream

The end will come
And I won't miss the beginning
I build my home on a fragile ground
But I know the lightest shake
Could tear it down

[Chorus X2:]
No end in sight
There's no need to hide
There's nothing to prove
This is what we are
This is everything we are

If this is a lie
Don't tell me truth
If this is a lie

If this is a dream
I wanna sleep 'til I die
