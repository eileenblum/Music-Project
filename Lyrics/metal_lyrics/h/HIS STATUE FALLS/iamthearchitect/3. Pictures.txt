We are above and beyond
Let's go

I got a frame but no picture
So let us paint the town red tonight

Black and blue
And a few white lines
A lot of green on all four sides
Hard to tell what's wrong or right
In the city light

I will always remember
I will never forget
I will paint a picture in my head
I will always be patient
I will never let go
My legacy, my tomorrow

Go beyond all imagination
Stand above all creation

Black and blue
And a few white lines
A lot of green on all four sides
Hard to tell what's wrong or right
In the city light

Even if it's just in our heads
Let's paint a picture
We will never forget

I will always remember
I will never forget

I will paint a picture in my head
I will always be patient
I will never let go
My legacy, my tomorrow

Every breath I take
Every mistake I make
Tell me this is worth it
Every step I take
And every chain I break
Tell me this is worth it

I will always remember
I will never forget
I will paint a picture in my head
I will always be patient
I will never let go
My legacy, my tomorrow

Let us be the least suspected
Unexpected, disconnected
