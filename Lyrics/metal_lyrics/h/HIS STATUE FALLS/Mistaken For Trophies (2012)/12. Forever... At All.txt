no more friday nights
they have a bitter taste since
that one night
when you decided to come for a while
you tried your best to please me
you tried to do things straight
but as we both know
it was nothing but a silent call for help

it drives you to despair
cause youâre never satisfied
this is not supposed to happen

everything youâve got seems to be not enough
so tell me who you want to be
everything you need seems so unreachable, so far
everything youâve got seems to be not enough
so tell me who you want to be
everything you need seems so unreachable, so far

i heard it clearly i swear
and as you know my dear
iâd have been there for you
cause i canât stand your tears
but you were
too drunk to speak a proper word
too drunk to stand just straight
too drunk to notice that you broke my heart again

letâs quit this fuckinâ shit, forever
cause youâre not made to live this, at all
letâs quit this fuckinâ shit, forever
cause youâre not strong enough, at all

it drives you to despair
cause youâre never satisfied
this is not supposed to happen

everything youâve got seems to be not enough
everything you need seems so unreachable, so far
everything youâve got seems to be not enough
so tell me who you want to be
everything you need seems so unreachable, so far
everything youâve got seems to be not enough
so tell me who you want to be
everything you need seems so unreachable, so far
