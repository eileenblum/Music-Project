[feat. Chuong Trinh of Hordak]Whatâs up
I can see that youâre tortured
Donât say youâre not

What the fuck went wrong these days
If I deserve an answer
Please let me know
Oh, oh, oh

What the fuck went wrong these days
We had a time when I was part of your mind

We used to be some kind of friends back in the days
It took some time to realize whatâs happening
You gave your best
You played your role so good
I noticed way too late what you were up to
Why are you hurting me
What have I done
If there are reasons for this
Tell me some
I canât believe the way you talk to me
Youâd better stop it now
Thatâs all I have to say

By now there is no need to panic
Breathe in and breathe out
If youâre really about to break with me
Be sure thereâs no turning back

[Chorus:]
There are so many dreams
But so many times
We build these walls to live behind
Tell me what is left inside
When will we leave this graveyard

Whatâs up
I can feel that youâre wrong here
Donât say youâre not
What the fuck went wrong these days
If I deserve an answer
Please let me know
Please let me know
Let me know

[Chorus:]
There are so many dreams
But so many times
We build these walls to live behind
Tell me what is left inside
When will we leave this graveyard

[Chorus:]
There are so many dreams
But so many times
We build these walls to live behind
Tell me what is left inside
When will we leave this graveyard

By now thereâs still no need to panic
