Good and bad
Go together side by side
They are both part of the story
They are both part of my special life

I donât know how much time Iâve spent
With dreamin' in the skies
I donât know how many castles
I have painted in the air
I wonât forget these days
That I would never change at all
I will keep them close next to my heart
I won't let them fall apart
Fall apart

[Chorus:]
All we have in life
Are these precious moments
Keep them as they come
Before they slip away
All we have in life
Are these precious moments
Keep them as they come
Before they slip away

I donât know how much time I've spent
Crying on the floor
Crashing all the castles
I had painted in the air
I wish I could forget the days
That really kept me down
Erase the painful moments
And tear out my bleeding heart

Good and bad
Go together side by side
They are both part of the story
They are both part of my special life

Good and bad
Go together hand in hand
All I try is get the balance right
I deserve no bitter end

[Chorus:]
All we have in life
Are these precious moments
Keep them as they come
Before they slip away
All we have in life
Are these precious moments
Keep them as they come
Before they slip away

[Chorus:]
All we have in life
Are these precious moments
Keep them as they come
Before they slip away
All we have in life
Are these precious moments
Keep them as they come
Before they slip away
Slip away
