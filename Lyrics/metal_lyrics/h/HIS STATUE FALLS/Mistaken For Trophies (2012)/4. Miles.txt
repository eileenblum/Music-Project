Youâve come a long way since
Youâve tasted what its like to be alone
They havenât seen your grace
Memories of good times
Make you hold your head up high
You carry the weight of the world

I try to escape
The burden of today
Iâm longing for tomorrow
But tomorrowâs far away
I try to forget
The pain of yesterday
Itâs slowly gettinâ better
But release is miles away

And so itâs up to me to maintain
What we had and what we shared
Unbroken and still standing
When I look at you
The truth appears so I can see
Pretending is what you prefer

I try to escape
The burden of today
Iâm longing for tomorrow
But tomorrowâs far away
I try to forget
The pain of yesterday
Itâs slowly gettinâ better
But release is miles away

You carry the weight of the world
Unbroken and still standing
Youâve come a long way
Since youâve tasted
What its like to be alone

I try to escape
The burden of today
Iâm longing for tomorrow
But tomorrowâs far away
I try to forget
The pain of yesterday
Itâs slowly gettinâ better
But release is miles away

I try to escape
The burden of today
Iâm longing for tomorrow
But tomorrowâs far away
I try to forget
The pain of yesterday
Itâs slowly gettinâ better
But release is miles away
