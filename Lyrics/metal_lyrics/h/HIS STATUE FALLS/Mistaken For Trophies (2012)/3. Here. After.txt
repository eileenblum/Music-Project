Don't you think itâs time for changes
Don't you think itâs time to take another step
Don't you think itâs time for changes
Don't you think itâs time to take another step

In this scene of trendy faggots
You have to make it out of here

This is what you left me with
Something to forget
And nothing left to lose
The time will heal your wounds
But the scars will remain
Tomorrow and forever
It will never be the same again

Time has come to make decisions
Time has come to let enviers feel like shit
Time has come to stand above this
Time has come to live that dream you talked about

Can you feel the pain
When everything seems to break down
You should never complain again
This is the way you chose
Can you feel the pain
Since everyone just turned around
You should never regret a thing
This is the way you chose
Youâre on the way you chose

This is what you left me with
Something to forget
And nothing left to lose
The time will heal your wounds
But the scars will remain
Tomorrow and forever
It will never be the same again

This is what you left me with
Something to forget
And nothing left to lose
The time will heal your wounds
But the scars will remain
Tomorrow and forever
It will never be the same again

I can feel itâs time for changes don't you think?
