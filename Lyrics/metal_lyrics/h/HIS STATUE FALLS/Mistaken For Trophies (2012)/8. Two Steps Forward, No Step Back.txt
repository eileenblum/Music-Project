[feat. Tyler Carter, ex-Woe, Is Me]Everything weâve known by now
Is that life has to go on
The tragic moments kept us fighting
For the feeling we call love
Even though our hope was fading
We took the chance
To work on unspoken thoughts
To work off appalling dreams
Do you remember

[Chorus:]
We started over as a compromise
The same old story of failure and lies
Could you kill me a little bit softer than before
(Softer than before)
All the blood the sweat and all these tears
Made this time seem to last for years
Two steps forward
And no step back
Two steps forward
And no step back

I wonât fear the the outcome any more
Thereâs only one life to live as you might know
It's two steps forward
No step back
Better be quick if you wanna be part of it

Is it possible to just sit alone
With you and curse the thought of trashing
All the dreams weâve condoned
Over these years
Weâve been a part of each other
And a part of this floor
So enough of stripping the screws
Itâs time to act out in force
Use your will to break us free
From this rotting home
Letâs run together
We were never meant to be alone

Memories arenât fading fast
Bury me with your broken past
As you know, my dear
Iâm with you
No matter how hard things become
Iâd prefer to be dead with you
Instead of being alive alone

[Chorus:]
We started over as a compromise
The same old story of failure and lies
Could you kill me a little bit softer than before
(Softer than before)
All the blood, the sweat and all these tears
Made this time seem to last for years
Two steps forward
And no step back
Two steps forward
And no step back

Two steps forward
And no step back
No step back
No step back!

Two steps forward
And no step back
No step back

Two steps forward
And no step back
Two steps forward
And no step back
No step back
