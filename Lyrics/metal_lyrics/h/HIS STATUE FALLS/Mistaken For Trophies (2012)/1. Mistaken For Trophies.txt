Iâm sorry but I hate your storyboard
And I donât wanna be your trophy
Maybe next time you should try
To listen up
Instead of being that shocked
When everything becomes too much

You said youâre able to be what I need
You wrote it down for me so many times
You promised that

Weâll make it no matter how hard
We would both have to try in the end you were lying
So why am I the one whoâs broken
Why am I the one whoâs all alone
Why am I the one whose life has turned from gray to black
In just one second

We got lost in this situation
It only matters that you care at least you try
You are invisible
We got stuck in this conversation
It only matters that you care at least you try
You are invisible

So this was our last act
Not bad if you ask me
And at least we were trying
Let go
And let this curtain fall

It only matters that you care
At least you try
You are invisible

We got lost in this situation
It only matters that you care at least you try
You are invisible
We got stuck in this conversation
It only matters that you care at least you try
You are invisible

You said youâre able to be what I need
You wrote it down for me so many times
So why am I the one whoâs broken
Why am I so alone

Weâre so lost in this conversation
It only matters that you care
