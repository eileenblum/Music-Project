Please donât come closer
I canât stand your breath
Itâs choking my throat
And that scares me to death
Iâve never been bad enough
To deserve your kind of hate
Iâm counting seconds
But my sadness just wonât seem to fade
All my life iâve been the missing piece of no one

[Chorus:]
All my life Iâve been the missing piece of no one
Thatâs why Iâm cold and empty
Thatâs why I hate myself
(Sometimes)
All my life I tried to please my fake surrounding
I really need to wake up
Cause thereâs a lot at stake

Please donât come closer
I canât stand your breath
Itâs wasting my soul
And that scares me to death
Iâve never been bad enough
To deserve your kind of hate
Iâm counting heartbeats
But my anger just wonât seem to fade

This is no call for help
Itâs a collection of facts
The only way to survive
Is getting rid of you
This is my answer to your question
If you remember the good old days
Keep them in mind cause theyâre over
And they will never come back again

[Chorus:]
All my life Iâve been the missing piece of no one
Thatâs why Iâm cold and empty
Thatâs why I hate myself
(Sometimes)
All my life I tried to please my fake surrounding
I really need to wake up
Cause thereâs a lot at stake

[Chorus:]
All my life Iâve been the missing piece of no one
Thatâs why Iâm cold and empty
Thatâs why I hate myself
(Sometimes)
All my life I tried to please my fake surrounding
I really need to wake up
Cause thereâs a lot at stake
Cause there's a lot at stake
