[Chorus:]
We wonât stop until the day
We are dancing on their graves
With that passion in our eyes
That keeps us so alive

[Chorus:]
We wonât stop until the day
We are dancing on their graves
With that passion in our eyes
That keeps us so alive

Did you expect
To see weâre still around
Did you believe
That this was everything we had to give
So let me say
Failing is okay
Everybody needs to know whatâs wrong
To know whatâs real

[Chorus:]
We wonât stop until the day
We are dancing on their graves
With that passion in our eyes
That keeps us so alive

[Chorus:]
We wonât stop until the day
We are dancing on their graves
With that passion in our eyes
That keeps us so alive

I donât waste my time
I leave this mess behind
You can not kill what you did not create
For real itâs far too late
So let me say
Failing is okay
Everybody needs to know whatâs wrong
To know whatâs real

[Chorus:]
We wonât stop until the day
We are dancing on their graves
With that passion in our eyes
That keeps us so alive

[Chorus:]
We wonât stop until the day
We are dancing on their graves
With that passion in our eyes
That keeps us so alive
