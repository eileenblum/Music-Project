Hold on listen what I have to say
Iâm really glad to let you know
That Iâm willing to forget you now
Oh no I heard these words too often babe
So many chances but you failed
Iâm feeling better all alone
See me smiling
Hear me breathing
Iâm alive

But the question still remains
So tell me how you feel
Donât you feel the same
This could be the end
Or is it just the beginning of something new
Itâs the beginning of the end
So I guess that we are through
Donât you feel the same
It could be the end

Problems yeah I guess thatâs all we had
Selfishness in times of sadness
Apathy instead of happiness
I will work hard on doing what I can
Crossing borders for a better life
For a way brighter tomorrow

The answer my dear is
As simple as it sounds
Either way I wonât be misunderstood
The fate of your heart
Is uncertain till youâve found
Any person any place where you belong

Iâm alive can you see my chest moving
Iâm alive right in time with the beat of this song
Iâm alive my way my rules my profit
Iâm alive I wonât stop till all is said and done

See me smiling
Feel me breathing hear
The sound of my heart beating
Iâm alive

But the question still remains
So tell me how you feel
Donât you feel the same
This could be the end
Or is it just the beginning of something new
Itâs the beginning of the end
So I guess that we are through
Donât you feel the same
It could be the end

But the question still remains
So tell me how you feel
Itâs the beginning of the end
So I guess that we are through

Iâm alive can you see my chest moving
Iâm alive right in time with the beat of this song
Iâm alive my way my rules my profit
Iâm alive I wonât stop till all is said and done
