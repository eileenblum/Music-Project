I hate the way youâre acting
I hate it so so much
It even takes my last breath
Iâm feeling so so lost
We had a deal I guess and
We talked a lot 'bout that
Right now it seems as if you changed
And Iâm alone with it
Tell me why
We need to go through this
Will it be
My neverending nightmare

I am down
With all your specialties
So let me live
The way I live

[Chorus:]
You're on the road to nowhere
You need to get it now
Before youâre all alone
It's not too late to turn back
Iâll guide you home
Be sure that help is on the way

Youâre right i made mistakes
And I do apologize
But there's no need to have an argument
Just every night
Thereâs only one way left so
Please let me prove my promise
And after that
You have the right to jugde me finally

(To jugde me finally)

Will you ever really try
To feel my passion
It means so much to me
Cause if not youâll never know
How big my heart is
I dare to say the day wonât come
And we will seperate

[Chorus:]
Youâre on the road to nowhere
You need to get it now
Before youâre all alone
Itâs not too late to turn back
Iâll guide you home
Be sure that help is on the way
(On the way)

All I know is that itâs time to awake
Before it never ends
All I know is that itâs time to awake
Before you walk the line
(Walk the line)

Will you ever really try
To feel my passion
It means so much to me
Cause if not youâll never know
How big my heart is
I dare to say the day wonât come
And we will seperate
