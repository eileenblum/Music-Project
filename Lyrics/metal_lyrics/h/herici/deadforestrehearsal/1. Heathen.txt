Let me grab my battleaxe
And I will kill you
Let me grab my spear
And thrust it through your heart
You will rot in fear
When I walk near
Fear's with my spear
Your death, is here

Plague the faces
Rotting corpses
Axes, swords, and evil forces
I have lived a life of sorrow
Death I follow
Die tomorrow

Plague the faces
Rotting corpses
Axes, swords, and evil forces
I have lived a life of sorrow
Death I follow
Die tomorrow

Battleaxe
I will kill you
Let me grab my spear
And thrust it through your heart
Fear, when I walk near
Fear is with my spear
Your death is near

What is going on in my mind
I've lost all control of my thoughts

Heathen!

[lyrics by G.]
