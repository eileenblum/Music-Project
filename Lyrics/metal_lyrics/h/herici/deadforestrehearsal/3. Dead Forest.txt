"Dark shadows moving in the woods, and I have no doubt that whatever I have resurrected from this book... Is sure to come calling... For me...."

Surrounded by demons laughing
In the woods I'm sleeping, dreaming
Forever alone in silence
Ice and snow is my environment

Venture into my dead forest
You'll loose touch of your emotions
Possessed by Satanic beings
Killing now, dead soldiers feasting more

I will see you in your secrets
I will purify your mind
I will answer all thy questions that may come from your warped mind

Venture into my dead forest
You'll loose touch of your emotions
Possessed by Satanic beings
Killing now, dead soldiers feasting more

[lyrics by G.]
