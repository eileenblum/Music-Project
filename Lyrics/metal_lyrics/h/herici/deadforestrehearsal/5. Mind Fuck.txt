Nothing left
I am all alone
Stuck inside the heat
Living out in my mind
Nothing left in my mind
I think about killing you all the time
Life is so heavy with a broken heart
All of these things that lye on your mind

Embrace the pain
It dyes in vein
Yasota ??
You're not on my mind anymore

[lyrics by G.]
