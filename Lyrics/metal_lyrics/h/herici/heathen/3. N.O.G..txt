You gave your faith to liars, defiers
Burned my people
We fight them off with honour
Me and my brothers in battle

No one god for me to worship
But myself, I'm my own prophet
Of an ancient pagan life
Through other realms my spear will fly

I am a Celtic Shaman
My powers are divine
In a deep trance that will guide your soul to the underworld, alone

No one god for me to worship
But myself, I'm my own prophet
Of an ancient pagan life
Through other realms my spear will fly

I am a Celtic Shaman
My powers are divine
In a deep trance that will guide your soul to the underworld, alone
You gave you faith to liars, defiers
Burned my people
A deep trace that will guide your soul to the underworld, alone

No one god!
