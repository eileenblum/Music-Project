So here we are. Let's play pretend
I'll take the blade without hesitance
'Cause I'm the only one who'll ever know
What goes on in my own head
You see for me I let it bleed
I draw these lines just to feel something
This game has always been release for me
But this time, this time...

I found nothing at all in bleeding
I guess that's what it took to cross this line

I guess I thought that
I could never turn back
I could never turn back
Is this the bottom of the pit?
Is this when the darkness shifts?
I'll strip my fate from the hands of the enemy
And lift my hands as the demons flee!

I am finally free
