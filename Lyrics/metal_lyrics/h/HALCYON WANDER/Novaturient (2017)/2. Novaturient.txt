It's said, "We are who we are."
"We were born this way."
But nothing is created broken.
Have you ever seen something so broken?
Have you given up on me?

I'm always chasing away the ones who want to stay
'cause if they met the real me, oh, they'd be sorry
I've got a way of making things okay just long enough for them to break
If I repeat the cycle, soon enough I'll be on my own

I hear you. I hear you.
Don't tell me how to live!
Don't you dare tell me I'm the coward here!
Show your face! Don't hide from me!
A life lived alone is colorless

I'm always chasing away the ones who want to stay
'cause if they met the real me, oh, they'd be sorry

I've got a way of making things okay just long enough for them to break
If I repeat the cycle, soon enough I'll be on my own
I'll be on my own
