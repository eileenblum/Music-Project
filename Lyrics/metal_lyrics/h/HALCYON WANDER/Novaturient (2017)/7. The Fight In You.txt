When tired arms can't hold the dimming light, I'll hold your hand until that light is bright

It's okay if you were a mess today and it's fine if you couldn't hold back the tears you cried.
Sing: It's okay
Scream: It's okay
Sing: if you were a mess today.
Sing: Don't cry
Scream: I'll be there on your darkest night.

In the pain from today we find hope for tomorrow.
As seasons change, we know this pain is only temporary.
It may hurt for now but when it's gone and you're feeling strong,
remember, remember the fight was in you all along

I want to see you fight! Your light within shines bright!
I want to see you fight! Your light within shines bright!

DANCE BREAK

Carry on, child
Fight for hope
Take my hand
I fight for my own

When tired arms can't hold the dimming light, I'll hold your hand until that light is bright
When bloodshot eyes can't see the passing night, don't wait for dawn when you can't rely on sight
