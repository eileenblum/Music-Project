You used to stand on solid ground
You used to walk on the water
You used to say you'd never fall astray
And now I watch as the waves take you away

There was a bridge we used to cross that brought us from death to life
And now that bridge is like a lost city in the sea
Forgotten

My God, you came looking for us
Though we are only idle vessels made of blood and rust
Is this it, is this what's left of us?
Don't get me wrong, yeah, we're to blame
For we haven't moved in months. We are but fragile frames
Would you send rescue again knowing we'll never change?

Just like the night submits to the light [to the light]
We will not try to hide. We will not dare to fight.
Just like the sandstone crumbles below
Few of us will grow old. These bones aren't made of stone.
Time is running out. Time is running out.
Time is running out.

There was a bridge you used to cross that brought you from death to life
And now that bridge is like a lost city in the sea
Forgotten

One hand can pull you out and it's not mine
Keep your head up! Keep your head up!
I can't save your life without losing mine
Keep your head up! Keep your head up!

Slowly drifting away, goodbye my friend
I hate to see that this is where it ends
