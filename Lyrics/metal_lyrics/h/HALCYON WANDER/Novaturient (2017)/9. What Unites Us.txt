[feat. Jonny LaDuke]Wake up, wake up and see the light
As it shines for you, it's burning bright
You say that you can't, don't say that you can't
You will never learn to run if you refuse to stand
The very thing that made you an outcast is
What unites us

You live in a shell believing you're nothing
But what makes you feel that you can't be something more?
What are you waiting for?

Only confident in being talentless
These self-defeating lies will leave you paralyzed

Wake up, wake up and see the light
As it shines for you, it's burning bright
You say that you can't, don't say that you can't
You will never learn to run if you refuse to stand
The very thing that made you an outcast is
What unites us in the dark
Don't ever let them steal that spark
You say that you can't, don't say that you can't
You are worth more than you know. When will you understand?
The very thing that made you an outcast is

What will be the common ground we walk upon
And we will never, we'll never give up
Oh, their words, they hurt.
All it took for you and I to become one
Was to find we were never alone
I swear we will fight for you as one.
We fight for our own
Never again will you swing with your back against the wall

Wake up, wake up and see the light
As it shines for you, it's burning bright
You say that you can't, don't say that you can't
You will never learn to run if you refuse to stand
The very thing that made you an outcast is
What unites us in the dark
Don't ever let them steal that spark
You say that you can't, don't say that you can't
You are worth more than you know. When will you understand
The very thing that made you an outcast is
The very thing that made you an outcast is
What unites us
