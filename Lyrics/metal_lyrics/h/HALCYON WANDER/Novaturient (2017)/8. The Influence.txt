Everywhere I turn they're screaming
"Give in. Give in. Just give in."
Everywhere I turn they're giving in

I will never let this go
I will sing it louder than ever before
I will never give up hope
For I found my voice
I was never alone

I know the messages you're sending out to the masses
What is your fame when it tears them down?
Why then should they be wearing your name
When what they see on stage is fake?
Your poise hides nothing but your poisoned words

Their worth is not defined by your painted lies
Their worth is not defined by your troubled times
Their worth is not defined by your painted lies
Their worth is not defined by you

Everywhere I turn they're screaming
"Give in. Give in. Just give in."
Everywhere I turn they're giving in

I will never let this go
I will sing it louder than ever before
I will never give up hope
For I found my voice
I was never alone

They say it's nothing more than illusions of grandeur
They say it can't be found what I'm holding now

Rise up rise up
We're not backing down
Rise up Rise up
All at once

Rise up now

Hope binds us together
Altogether now

We will never let this go
We will sing it louder than ever before
We will never give up hope
For we found our voice
we are never alone

You can't hold us down
We're not backing down
