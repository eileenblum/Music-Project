I can feel you in my bones (I can feel you in my bones)
This life is not my own, I gave it up for the One who built this home
I can hear you in these walls (I can hear you in these walls)
We're in this till the end, to trust your design through thick and thin

Cover me, blanket my imperfection
Smother me, with purpose and direction
I've been long past dead but my lungs keep breathing
How much can a broken body take?
My skin's cold but my heart's still beating
Is this the consequence of one mistake?

I never thought we'd still be standing within the house we built on sand
The earth below is collapsing from the weight of our destructive hands
It's a long shot to ask your forgiveness
Wash my hands of all the blood
From the lives I've truly broken, what's there to be loved?

I'll scream at the top of my lungs and cry from the bottom of my heart and know this,
I'm moving on ahead, I'm not better off dead, you're not better off dead

We'll scream at the top of our lungs and cry from the bottom of our hearts and know this,
We're moving on ahead, we're not better off dead, we're not better off dead
