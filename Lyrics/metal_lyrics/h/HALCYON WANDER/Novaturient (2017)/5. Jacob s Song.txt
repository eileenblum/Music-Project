Daddy, where did you go?
Why would you leave me all alone
To wander the halls of a broken home
and I'll never know your love
Maybe, I'm just unloveable

Daddy, where did you go?
I miss you so. Please just call.
Daddy, where did you go?
I miss you so.

Daddy, I'm sorry I lost my sense of home
Daddy, I'm sorry I wasn't worth the call
Maybe one day you'll hear my song and realize it wasn't all my fault
Maybe, I'm not unloveable

What would it take for forgiveness to break through the walls of this glass heart, I've hidden in shame?
What would it take?

'Cause I just want to hear you say my name
and that you left me for a reason
I can't understand the change
Tell me that you love me after all this time
Tell me you're sorry and I'm not alone

Tell me I'm loved
Tell me I'm loved
