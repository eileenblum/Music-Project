My travel began when the awakening came
No friends at all, boring people around
Small talk and gossip i'd never care about
It was my call, the risk was for me to take

Sacrifices made in order to save our lives
What a waste of time! there's no redemption!

A gun in my head...
Nightmares coming day after day
There's life beyond death? i really don't care!
Hell was my home on earth!
Hell is what you deserve!
There, i'm finally broke...

Be careful! i'm bleeding!
Long way from home...far beyond the stars!
Why should i travel far beyond the stars?
Long way from home...far beyond the stars!

Sacrifices made in order to save our lives
What a waste of time! there's no redemption!
Now that i'm leaving the whole world
Can blow up to fucking pieces!
