Once again
An angel fed in darkness screams at night
Beyond her flesh
If flesh it might be called which has none
Some evil curse,
Was it the witching hour when she came
Tome?

A whisper in my dreams...

No more sins forgiven!
No more lies beneath them!

Am i in love with the devil's whore?
Treacherous plans within god's work?
Leave me alone! cut off your tongue!
Despite the prayers there will be blood!

Solitude,
There's no place to hide so be my guest!
Obscurity

I'm already part of your wicked game...
Oblivion,
I've found the mirror of my own despair
