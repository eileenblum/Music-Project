I'm looking back
All that we lived before...
We've found the light
At least some kind of enlightenment!
To burn me in hell you had destroy it
Your dark coldness sent me to nowhere...

No! i won't relapse
This vice! almost cost my life
Shame! is what i feel now
Sins of the past keep on chasing my soul...

Day by day no end for this suffering
Crawling through my spine this sensation

No! another night again
Why? i lost control of myself
My soul is wasted away
Because its gets more painful, i must stop..

I'm falling in my inferno!
My tears turn to blood
Why i deserve my life?

I remember your stab in the back
You betrayed me, your smile was a trap
But i can see the light shinning far behind
Everlasting wounds from within me
Welcome to the hell of my feelings!
