What can i say about your game?
Your path leads you to infinite space
But the stars can't hold your runaway trail
Nor get you out of your mind's maze
What can you say about your seed?
The need for speed, the need for revenge
Will make you hurt, will make you bleed
You've lost your friends, you're someone else!
Everything rises and everything dies
Everything falls in between!
Golden days and frozen lakes
See by yourself the mirror's eye!
Everything rises and everything dies
Everything matters but will be forgotten...

What can be done about your truth?
Twisted words, a poisoned food
But never think we are so screw
We know the way to leave the woods
What can we say about your leave?
Trough the wormhole we all see
A new dawn, a new eve
Paradise stands for us to seek
We don't need your inspiration!
Purification by fire!
We don't need more education!
Purification by fire!
