Let them grow, eating flesh!
Let them feast to the bone!
Brainless earthworms without tongue,
Let them crawl where they belong!
Let them drool and laugh,
Let them crawl where they belong!

The crow stands there, paint it black,
But the moon seems pale and betrayed
Who lies behind?... so hard to hide
When the past defines what sleeps inside
Empty shape, walking shadow,
Ritual slave... to the gallows!

Their flight seems high
But their winds are not so proud
Always trying to reach the clouds
But they never scream so loud!

Such fake life is so hard to buy
When the past defines what sleeps inside
Empty shape, walking shadow
Ritual slave...to the gallows!
