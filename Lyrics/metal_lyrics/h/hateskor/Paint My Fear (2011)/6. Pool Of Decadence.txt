Are we bound to end like this?
Feeding ourselves with pool and beer...
Keep it simple you destroy your life
But i'm still thinking... should stop it now?

Look yourself into the mirror!
See the effects of what you did
Isn't it what you wanted coward?
Did you ever think it twice?

Do you wonder if this is the way
Are you supposed to live in?

Open your eyes and you will see!
There is your life inside of you to carry on!

Darkness, voices... within your brain
We don 't give a shit!
Although you must succeed
Face your sins, pool of decadence!

Runaway from the pool of decadence
