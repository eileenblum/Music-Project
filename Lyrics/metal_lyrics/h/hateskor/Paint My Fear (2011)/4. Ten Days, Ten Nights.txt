Silent screams in my head, quiet prayers to no god
Hopeless request wrote in red
I'm hot your assassin!
Black disease within me, hear my will, i'm defiant!
Meet me, inside, face to face!
Why should i? you won't last
My best bet, ten more nights...
But i'm not afraid anymore!
I'm not your assassin!
There was not reward, no one ever told me...

There was a time when i had no thoughts of death
When i was happy without knowing shit!
I left these days behind to face the unexpected
There was a time, there was a time...
How it's your chance, bitch!

Your request, my desire...
Both of us,we're defiant!
Meet me, now, face to face!
I just pull the trigger!
My name there's no secret
I'm disease the undefeated one!
Love me as your last affaire!
Why should i? you won't last
My best bet, ten more nights...
And i'm not afraid anymore!
I just pull the trigger!
Will i disappear? will my memories remain?

There was a time when i had no thoughts of death
When i was happy without knowing shit!
I left these days behind to face the unexpected
Shadowless swords bring me pain, blindness despair
And rage!
