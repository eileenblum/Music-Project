All i can tell is what i've learned...
All i can tell is what i've seen...
There's a place i want to be, take me home!

One more day, no one to blame
These darkest hours i live in pain
Desire, temptation!
Demons and witches, they feed my damnation...
One more night, nothing to do but howl
Tears of fire burn my soul!
Hunger, deception!
Angels and priests, the need of salvation...

I was there just for one day
Close enough to take the bait
Outfit, presumption!
Jewels and crowns, the treasure of clowns...
Shall we ever meet again, dark blue eyes,
While it rains?
Illusions, prayers!
Tools for fools, such lonely shelter...

Spring, will you bring the same dress?
Heat, will you eat your night's dream?
Fall, will you crawl to sadness?
Cold, will you hold your ice whip?
