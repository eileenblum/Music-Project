Decades of decay...
My sadness overwhelms all my feelings
Dying like a flower, no water in its veins
My love flew away!
The meaning of, my life,
The reason of my despair,
Your weeping eyes...
Years of fucking madness
It's driving me to an end!
Fate written in the sky...

Tears of fire!

Grief in the darkness, i'm alone in the night,
Because i feel you are so far away!
Stars try to guide my soul
But i know my heart is dying
Why cannot i be with you?

Eternal flames of moonlight, the beauty cast inside
I can't reach my beloved one, fate i don't understand
Inside my deepest feelings i won't accept the fact
Your presence is ah illusion, the distance what i have...

Centuries are gone and i'm getting old...
Empires had fallen but my love will remain forever...
