Shadows blind my eyes 
Like painful tears of martyrs 
An act of rememberance 
A feast for the wolfs of my darkest dreams

Desire for freedom was gone long ago 
Along with my last muttered words 
Death has become my most deared friend 
The court of the one who will fall 
For why shall I seek what cannot be found 
The last shard of light in my soul

Feel the fear, feel the chill across your spine 
Unbowed, unbent, unbroken! 
Take me down, crush my will... IÂ´ll still remain 
Unbowed, unbent unbroken!

Illusion of hope has abandoned me now 
An omen for eternal weep 
All that remains is a thickened night 
A soiree for ghosts on my sleep

This is the way your legacy ends 
Chimera will live through my pain 
Sweetest oblivion is calling my name 
A whisper I shall not disdain

Feel the fear, feel the chill across your spine 
Unbowed, unbent, unbroken! 
Take me down, crush my will... IÂ´ll still remain 
Unbowed, unbent unbroken!
