What's beyond the violence?
What wars are for?
Lots of ruin and pain for non-existent score
What's beyond the violence?
What wars are for?
Destructive nature using more and more...
The unpredictable war
Reason to kill, inside of us
Law of the man
Too much to ask, too much to do
To understand
Destruction of humanity, our sanity
No future, present or past
Stopped history
By war
What's beyond the violence?
What wars are for?
Lots of ruin and pain for
Non-existent score
What's beyond the violence?
What wars are for?
Destructive nature using more
And more...
The unpredictable war
We are just the experiment of earth,
The natural cause of our eco-system.
And as useless we are to this universe,
Will nature itself wipe us away
Life under insane prophecy
Incoming end
Future becomes your enemy
No more a friend
Destruction unavoidable
Genetic fate
Chess in the game of victory
Yields check and mate
For war
What's beyond the violence?
What wars are for?
Lots of ruin and pain for
Non-existent score
What's beyond the violence?
What wars are for?
Destructive nature using more and more...
The unpredictable war
