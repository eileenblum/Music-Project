I live in strange situation
My hopes fulfilled by their fears
Speed in a road of deception
I live by the vision to see your tears

I wanna lie
I wanna lie
I wanna lie

Justice is done, I'm the witness
One freedom turned into jail
Your world is all I don't care
With smile on my face I prevail

I wanna lie

No man in this world is immortal
Our lies will live when we die
Sin is my fate, my religion
From gates of hell you will hear me cry:

I will not die
Don't wonder why
I wanna lie
