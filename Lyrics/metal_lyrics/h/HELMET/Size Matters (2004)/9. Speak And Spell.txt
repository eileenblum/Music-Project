Darlin' I would never tell
Use your speak and spell

Like revolution that's bound to stall
It's hard to be ignored

it doesn't mean that much
I don't hate your guts but
I don't want to hear you're better off
I wanna know he's dull
And he's miserable
I wanna know that he can stand an insult

Darlin' I would keep it down
You give yourself away

All the insults you toss around
Come back to haunt you now

it doesn't mean that much
I don't hate your guts but
I don't want to hear you're better off
I wanna know he's dull
And he's miserable
I wanna know that he can stand an insult

Drive this car right off the road
Are you comfortable?
Let's go

it doesn't mean that much
I don't hate your guts but
I don't want to hear you're better off
I wanna know he's dull
And he's miserable
I wanna know that he can stand an insult
