I'd like to see you
In two pieces
You won't be walking
Barely breathing
I'd like to see you
At my door
We're together
Like before

I could miss you more right now
or I could slit your throat
Sometimes I get so down
You're not around and...
I'd rather see you dead

See you dead

Tonight you're sleeping
By his side
I tried to see you
But you let him decide
I'm a threat now
Are you scared
It's just murder
least you know I care

I could miss you more right now
or I could slit your throat
Sometimes I get so down
You're not around and...
I'd rather see you dead
Sometimes I get lonely
And all I need is...
Just to see you dead

see you dead
see you dead
see you dead
dead
see you
see you
see you dead
dead dead dead dead dead dead deeeeeaaaad

Sometimes I get so down
You're not around and...
I'd rather see you dead

Sometimes I get lonely
And all I need is...
Just to see you dead

Sometimes I get so down
You're not around and...
I'd rather see you dead

see you dead
dead
see you dead
dead
see you dead
