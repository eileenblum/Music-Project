The air you breathe you suck
The life out of me
Your mouth moves like
Something shaking loose
God knows these insults don't
Even phase you now

Don't get comfortable
Start thinking I
Still believe you now
I know you're lying

I'd take my death before I'd
Let you win
I am removed there's nothing
Left to prove
You're down, I don't care
You know this life is unfair

Don't get comfortable
Start thinking I still believe you now
I know you're lying
I know you're lying
I know you lie

If I believe you now then I'm to blame
but I know what you are
So don't get comfortable
Start thinking I don't realize it now
I know you're lying
I know you're lying
I know you lie
