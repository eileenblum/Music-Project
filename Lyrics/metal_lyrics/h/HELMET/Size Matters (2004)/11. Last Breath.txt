You're so worked up this torture
Is paying off
Who's keeping score now?
You let me know before
How far can you get?
I don't know I could only guess
You'd never notice when
Everything started vanishing

Your last breath on earth
Is all I can take

All these compliments
Are you for now or against?
You're too nice somehow
You'd murder me right now

You last breath on Earth
Is all I can take
