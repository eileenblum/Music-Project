Can't explain, can't decide
Can't confirm or deny
We could talk all night

They say you hurt the ones you love
You love yourself more than anyone
Honey, do it right

True love waits
Or maybe only suffocates

I love the way you work a room
The way you talk, the way you move
You were never shy

So bored, you watch them feed
They bite but don't bleed
Honey, suck them dry

Love and hate
Anyway you suffocate
