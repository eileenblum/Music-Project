Just kicked all
My vices
In time for her next crisis
Shit's crashing
Around us
No use pretending we trust
She's better
No wonder
Every day gets longer
You push
I shove
Just like we were in love

Take all
Take all my money

Forgive
Forget
But she ain't done yet
Its total
Disaster
To duck, try to slip past her

Take all
Take all my money
Get lost
So long now honey

It's no better

It's no better now

It's no better
No wonder
This fucking life gets longer
You push
I shove
Just like we were in love

[Chorus x2]
