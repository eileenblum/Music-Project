Someone's got it in for me
He's trying to get to you
You think he knows what you need
But not a word he says is true

When it's time to move in
He is creeping 'round
You think he respects you
But he'll just drag you down

I can make you miserable
I have been that low
If I can make you miserable
Just let me know

Someone's got it in for me
I don't care any more
I've learned to enjoy the pretty things
Like settling a score

I can make you miserable
I have been that low
If I can make you miserable
Just let me know

Let me know
Honey, let me know

Just let me know
