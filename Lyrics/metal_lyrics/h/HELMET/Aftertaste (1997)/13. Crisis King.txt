If you're inclined to complain
It doesn't matter, he's got greater pain

Any crisis takes its toll
Then he'll get down, let the bad times roll

You'll never go down fighting
You'll just go down
The crisis king is mighty
In a crisis showdown

The sole provision he needs to live
Is what he can take, he's got nothing to give

You'll never go down fighting
You'll just go down
The crisis king is mighty
In a crisis showdown

Go down
You just go down
Down
