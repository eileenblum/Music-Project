It's never easy being ignored
When you're worshipped and adored
Attention starved, inflatable
An ego that is insatiable

You've always been so superior
Avoid eye contact with the mirror
I still admire your toned exterior

I need somebody to hate
I need someone that I can imitate
The attention that I crave
It's self-esteem that I can almost save
