I like the way you set yourself goals
The blind ambition you sport like new clothes
There's nothing bold in the posture you wear
It's always stunning to show you care

You're so outspoken, the status quotient
Brought up to peak broadcast emotion
As calculated as the news is
At least you've got yourself impressed

Appropriated, the concepts you boast
You love the sound of your own voice
You're always vocal, affecting passion
Wholesale opinions will stay in fashion

You're so outspoken, the status quotient
Brought up to peak broadcast emotion
As calculated as the news is
At least you've got yourself impressed

I like the way you set yourself goals
The blind ambition you sport like new clothes
There's nothing bold in the posture you wear
It's always stunning to show much you...
