Find something mindless I can advocate
Make up the me I want to be
Then always keep a finger on "the pulse"
Maintain high visibility

Grubbing for any contact I can make
Then dig in deep to get ahead
Line up the prospects that I think will "take"
You know you have to use your head

And inability remains protected
The company I keep
Won't let me ever be rejected
