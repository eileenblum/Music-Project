You're comfortable as the poison dunce,
Completely oblivious
This might come as a big surprise
But since you've been sterilized

You won't bite back
You've always been cut too much slack
And now you're primed
To have a great time

Milk-fed full of boldfaces lies
Canned and homogenized
Perpetuated by the myth
Impassiveness equals intelligence

But you're a star
Just like any accomplished liar
You can make it at last
Never let a good lie pass

You won't bite back
You've always been cut too much slack
And now you're primed
To have a great time

But you're a star
Just like any accomplished liar
You can make it at last
Never let a good lie pass
