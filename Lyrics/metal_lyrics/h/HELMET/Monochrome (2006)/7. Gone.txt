Hey son, where you think you going?
We ain't done, hang tight
Everything could vanish overnight

None of your friends ever did anything
Now you're dead
You are dead
Hey now you are gone
I can't feel the sun
Now you are dead and you're gone

Get a grip
Coughing up the shit that you've been fed
None of your friends hang around anyhow
Now you're dead
You are dead

Hey, now you are gone
I can't feel the sun
Now you dead and you're gone
Hey now you are gone
We're all moving on
Now you are gone

Alright, just keep it move moving
Cause there's an end in sight
What was that you said?
Well that don't really matter now
You'll be dead

Hey now you are gone
Can't you feel sun?
Now you are gone
Hey now you are gone
We're all moving on
Now that you are dead and you're gone
You're gone
Gone
