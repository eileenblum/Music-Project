Bury me alive and pretend I'm awake
Like you lost me out somewhere in the highway
I thought you were decent
Everything was easy
Every single word was true

I left all them all
I believe I was right
I might start thinking too much,
When I rather deny it

I thought you were decent
Everything was easy
Every single word was true

I'm alright
I'm alright now
