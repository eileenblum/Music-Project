I can fill in your blanks here
Just like reading your mind
Everybody's got opinions,
Well I know I've got mine

We're running in place, ain't you tired?
Just make up your mind there
We're only running in place
Hey, are you tired?

I know you don't deserve it
You needed someone to love
One more opportunity for somebody to love

We're running in place, ain't you tired?
Just make up your mind there
We're only running in place
Hey, are you tired?

Will you disappear when the world is here?
Will you run for cover?
Have you taken aim, found someone to blame?
Does it make it feel better?
You're alright now, you're better
Whatever

We're running in place, ain't you tired?
Just make up your mind there
We're only running in place
Hey, are you tired?

We're running in place
Just make up your mind there
We're only running place
Hey, are you tired?

You're my monochrome
Yes, my monochrome
