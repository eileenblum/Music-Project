Hanging out with all these dicks
Still collecting tokens
Knock 'em back, you're making noises
You live in the moment
Wonder you're not morning sick
Making conversation
This dull arithmetic, all these stock exchanges

Swallowing everything
Sinker, hook and line
Paralyzed, anesthetized
Wasted one more time

Swabbing now in duplicate
So mystique consultants
They all figured unequipped, cannot be insulted

Swallowing everything
Sinker, hook and line
Paralyzed, anesthetized
Wasted one more time
