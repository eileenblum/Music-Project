Consolation don't account for it
Healing helpless want to look
Like this
Bet distraction whips it out of you
Pay to see it suck you down
There too

Don't walk

One fuck now boost my self-esteem
One weak not a word sounds comforting
Beg forgiveness started back again
One for me said dig it deep
And then...

You walk
