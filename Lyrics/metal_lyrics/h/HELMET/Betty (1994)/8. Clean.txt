Spread your mind the fish feed
Don't ignore my speech my
Heart bleeds
Make yourself the perfect butt
Some passing thought, I don't know what

Don't remind me, I'll take
What I need to

Get back in case the door swings and
Don't forget to hide
Your mood rings
Fit to tie
I thought I knew good company
I'd like to be you

You're right behind me and
Mouth all I read

Don't remind me, I'll take
What I need to
You're right behind me and
Mouth all I read
