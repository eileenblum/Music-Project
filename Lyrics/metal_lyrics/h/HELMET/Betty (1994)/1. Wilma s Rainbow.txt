You heard about, "be your own man"
You talk a lot and loud
Illustrate the obvious boy
You're mentally endowed

Watershed year comes
You're flush with fever
The richest junk dealer

Honestly, a book you read once let you
Think in rhyme. The old extreme sits
Pale and molds now for the
Millionth time

Wilma's rainbow of peaceful colors
The richest junk dealer
