i'll throw you scraps and talk
the bad things
the language or the motive
affected shown is

self imitating
trust the dying breed
the pitch i made has been

on my end i trust in
what's left here
to lie is
admired your trust in
without fear
you borrow

my world of one speak up
the good things
the guidelines let me follow
offense is borrowed
