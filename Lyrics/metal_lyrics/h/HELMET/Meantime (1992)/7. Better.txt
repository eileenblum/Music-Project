get it right
my last word sins
i taste it now
omission wins

for keeping down
my better side
i still ignore
and try to hide
so get out

the easy word
will never slip
i brought it down
to take the lip

don't need to know
don't have to feel
our better side
i had to steal

your better, you die better
write down the day, expend it
work it in again, death ends it
