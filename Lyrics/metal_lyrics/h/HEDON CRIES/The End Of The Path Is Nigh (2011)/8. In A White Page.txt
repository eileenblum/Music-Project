I will drown
In a white page once again
I will ask
For your black thoughts
I will face your fears
Struggling to find my breaths
I will try to taste
Your images once again
Sorrow, curses and anger
I will make appear
Taking this strength by my side
I will suffocate in my blood tonight

In a white pageâ¦
My fears celebrate
Just like a tissue soaked by blood
Flowers cover my naked aura
In a white pageâ¦
Through dark thoughts
Iâll wonder why once more
I shall die away for the past

Tears roll down my face
When staring at your frozen sun
Iâll offer
A spark from my bright look to it
Fire will be reborn from the heart
My wish to revive my dreams
And if I have the courage to ask myself
For being given a touch by soul-mate
Iâll find the way
To lighten up the darkness
And my precious moment
To become my whole life

In a white pageâ¦
Iâll be embraced by stars
I will never whisper âwhyâ again
I will never ask for the sinful kisses
In a bloody pageâ¦ a life will be buried
A message for a loved one
My dying breathâ¦
