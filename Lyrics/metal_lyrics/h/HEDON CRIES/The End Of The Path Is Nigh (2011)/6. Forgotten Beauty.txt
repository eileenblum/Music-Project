Under the moonlight I gaze
At despair of the candles fading away
A name carved in the ashes
A pale memory 
Through an icy thought
A noir swan into a blood tarn
A luminous angel
To believe in a poisonous truth
A gloomy melody
To fail into a sweet nap
The wish
Of a wounded old man into the night
The rise
Of a twee eclipse into darkness

A scarlet rose
That flourishes in the middle of a desert
And my tragic figure
Stands in front of this beauty
The most optimistic journey
Into the crystal island of love
My life belongs to âforgotten beautyâ

A scarlet rose
That flourishes in the middle of a desert
And my tragic figure
Stands in front of this beauty
The most optimistic journey
Into the crystal island of love
My life belongs to âforgotten beautyâ

I shall embrace the winter
And he will sing for me
I will be offered a glass of wine by him
And then a dream
Shall touch my soul
And my soul
Will face the era of wisdom
Once again!

A scarlet rose
That flourishes in the middle of a desert
And my tragic figure
Stands in front of this beauty
The most optimistic journey
Into the crystal island of love
My life belongs to âforgotten beautyâ
