Welcome to my realm
Where I thrive and decay
I invite you
To the garden of no life
Blackness all around
Piercing through my core
Walk with me the groove
Of dark pleasure and excess
Caress my broken body
With seal my open wounds
With your luscious lips

Your morbid figure
Still haunts my ecstatic visions
Forever Iâve been thrall
To your majestic splendor
Thou! Translucent macabre figure
Light up the torch
Of damnation or revival

Iâll let you savor
My lustful fascinations 
And your ecstatic pleasure
Will drag me from this limbo
Maelstrom of emotions
Revive my long dead senses
Where fragments of delusions
Build my reality

Your morbid figure
Still haunts my ecstatic visions
Forever Iâve been thrall
To your majestic splendor
Thouâ¦
