I looked through
That broken mirror
Once again
Four tears I have cried
One for my deathly trapped soul
One
For their nauseam fake feelings.
One for the loved ones
That said goodbye
And one for you

Four demons haunting my existence
Screeching out in pain
Reminding my fears
No salvation
For my immoral psyche,
No revenge on them,
No suffering for their lies,
No forgiveness
For the lovelorn lost souls,
No cure for my mental wound
Of you gone astray

Abhorâ¦ hateâ¦ mayhemâ¦
The trilogy of evil
Has conquered my soul
Come and release me
Release my sinful spirit
From these darkened visions
Come and taste my tears
Take me to our fairyland
An ex gratia payment
For you and meâ¦
