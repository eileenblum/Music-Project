Once a dream was reality
Once I was living in the sky,
Among the stars
I hadnât fell the color of loneliness
I hadnât touched
The tear of fire
But you froze
 My bright visions
You scattered thorns
On my naked body
You tasted all my breaths till the end
You found
The only way to kill me

Once an angel 
Was painting my life on his wings
Once I could hear
The divine melodies of silence
I hadnât met shadows into darkness
I hadnât loved
The caress of my end

But you froze
My bright visions
You scattered thorns
On my naked body
You tasted all my breaths
Till the end
You found
The only way to kill me

Your bloody light
Blinded my soul
Your holy sin
Gave birth to my absolute hatred

Iâll see again
The luminous plains
Iâll feel again
The ethereal clouds
Never again shall I cry
Never again shall I scream
Iâll breathe again
Iâll kill you a
Gain and again
