Through the night
I cross a path onto the sea
I stare at the mourning faces bowing
On bended knees
I have no recollection of ages passed and gone
I have no recollection
Of the color of life itself

I feel like Iâve seen the gardens of the sun
Iâve touched the veil of the frozen days
Iâve healed my wounds with its crystal water
Iâve felt the golden feelingsâ¦
But I cannot remember

I know I was a king once
The stars were whispering to me
About their dreams
But the bright blue color faded away
And nowâ¦ touching the voidâ¦
I shed tearsâ¦!

I know that angels and swans accompanied me
With every drop of their tears I created planets
Amidst a bleached room Iâll never smile again
And nowâ¦ touching the voidâ¦ I pass awayâ¦!

I know I was a king once
The stars were whispering to me
About their dreams
But the bright blue color faded away
And nowâ¦ touching the voidâ¦
I shed tearsâ¦!

My sorrowful performance
On a stage among the cloudsâ¦
Is the last precious moment
That had been left to this last breath
The sky looks like itâs been full of mirrorsâ¦
Wherever I turn my eyes to, I see my frail figure
I see though every shape an image I had dreamt of
I exist in no place, I cannot be touched by any face
An endless void suffocates me with its naked handsâ¦
It takes me its arms and offers me its kiss
