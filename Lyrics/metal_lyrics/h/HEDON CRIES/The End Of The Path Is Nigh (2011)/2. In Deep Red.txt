The green gem swam into deep colors
Visions keep me in captivity
But I want to see you
And still I dream,
Still I wish to reach your soul

A red river brims out from my veins
Its anger covers my hopes
And I still winderâ¦
â¦wonder
If you are looking for me in your dreams

Frozen mountainsâ¦ sad skiesâ¦
And eon nightmaresâ¦ in deep redâ¦
Fatal seasâ¦ lost plainsâ¦
And scared dreams
Iâm drifting awayâ¦ in deep redâ¦

 Endless sorrow and absolute despair
If I knew what you feel for me
I would be stronger
If only knew I could keep my dreams in life
I could feel you only for once

Frozen mountainsâ¦ sad skiesâ¦
And eon nightmaresâ¦ in deep redâ¦
Fatal seasâ¦ lost plainsâ¦
And scared dreamsâ¦
Iâm drowning deeperâ¦
In deep redâ¦
