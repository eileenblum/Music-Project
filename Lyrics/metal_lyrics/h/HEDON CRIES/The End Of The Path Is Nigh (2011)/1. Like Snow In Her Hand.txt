In a dream...
Golden fields drown in shadowsâ¦
Helpless angels deny their shine
Fairy queens lost their beauty
And warrior elves distinguish her strength
Her ocean suffocates innocence
When the color in her eyes turns darkâ¦
Melodies and feelings leave the heavenly castles
Under the rays of a winter sun

Everything seems to be all the sameâ¦
The same sullen imageâ¦
Everything melts away like snowâ¦
Like snow in her handâ¦!
The last hope can feelâ¦ and taste the endâ¦
Everybody fades away like snowâ¦
Like snow in her handâ¦!

After the dreamâ¦
I open my eyes and stare at my wounded ego
I stand still and watch my chaotic motions
I touch my face and tears fill my eyes,
But I stay speechless and cold

Trapped behind a mirror,
Thereâs nothing I can doâ¦

And now all I need is a bright lieâ¦
A lie which offers me a more peaceful endâ¦

Everything seems to be all the sameâ¦
The same sullen imageâ¦
Everything melts away like snowâ¦
Like snow in her handâ¦!
The last hope can feelâ¦ and taste the endâ¦
Everybody fades away like snowâ¦
Like snow in her handâ¦!
