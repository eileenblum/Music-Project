I hate youâ¦
I dream of your death
Again and again
Take up the gauntlet
And come to meâ¦
Once againâ¦
Snakes all around you
Will taste your flesh
Iâll be watching your hideous face
Youâll bleed, youâll die,
You will rot
Youâll be writhing
In pain, heathen figure

I hate youâ¦
I dream of your death
Again and again
I loved you onceâ¦
And it hurts
But your depraved soul
Was a sacrilege to my heart
Your haggard image haunts me
Iâll enjoy
Your unending hemorrhage

I hate youâ¦
I dream of your death
Again and again
I loved you once
Take up the gauntlet
And come to me
Once again
I hate youâ¦
I dream of your death
Again and again
I loved you once
Bleed, die, rot
And then I will be releasedâ¦
