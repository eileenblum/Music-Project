Oh night, burn the magic birdsâ wings
Let me drink their soul, let me see through their eyes
Cover the bloody moon, show me the frozen path!
Let my thought keep company to a bloodthirsty sun!

His love is dark, threatening, cursed!

My silent scream takes me to the fantastic island of a lonely planet!
I see... I feel...
I fly in a sky of fire â¦ far away!
The feelings of the damned humanity are going
Away through the royal stars!
Voices in the mist and bloody suffering shapes!
