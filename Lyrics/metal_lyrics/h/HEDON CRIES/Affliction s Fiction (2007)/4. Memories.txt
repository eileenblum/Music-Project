As I look at the river of my thoughts
I see a weird shadow
Death rules on her lips
A desperate message for me
Something tells me I'm loosing my mind
Something tells me I'm going to another world
A voice is urging me to kill
My memories are my avenger
I dream of valleys full of blood
I wish I could taste his flesh
I'll never forget his kiss
I'll be his nightmare forever
Something tells me I'm loosing my mind
Something tells me I'm going into another world
A voice is urging me to kill
My memories are my avenger
The fire inside me will never extinguish
The mourning light will never touch the trees
My anger will cover the darkest vision
My broken heart will love my alter ego
Something tells me I'm loosing my mind
Something tells me I'm going into another world
A voice is urging me to kill
My memories are my avenger

You must dieâ¦
