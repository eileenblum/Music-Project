If heaven could come close to me...
If knowledge could become wisdom...
If a bright eye could look at me...
Maybe my sÃ©ance would be completed...

If nature could win the dark...
If I could see the colour of a shadow...
If I could fly through sorrow...
Maybe my sÃ©ance could be a sea...

My soul's winter holds me blind into its frozen castle!
The sÃ©ance of time throws me into my fear!
I oscillate into thousands of deaths!
All roads lead me to the mountains!
Rivers will show me the seven signs!
The seven magic points to find the cave!
The cave under the lava of MORGOTH!!!

The curses of the gods will rip my flesh!
But my damned fires will decay their thrones!!!

I felt pain in the air!
I stepped on broken wings, I stepped on bloody trails!
I held the bodies of the fairies!
I cried for the graves of the flowers!
I buried the light of the stars!
I lost faith on my wishes!
Two worlds have been crashed inside me!
Two deaths have been born inside me!

My agony is changed into grief!
My sorrow turned into the most dangerous God!
Lightnings of anger have fallen from the sky!
The ground opened wide its mouth!
The wind left its symbol over the sea!
The revenge started by the worst way!
I broke everything into pieces!
Enthroned I tasted the holy blood!

Beyond the sea of sÃ©ance!!!
Beyond the sea of sÃ©ance!!!
