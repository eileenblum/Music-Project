In the dark everything is gone...! Now itâs dawnâ¦
We can rebear the darknessâ¦
We can give light to our gloomy dreamsâ¦
And be drown in their fire...
Eternity! Eternal grief!
A frozen sun inside me forever!!!
Let me taste hypocrisy, let me accept  humiliation...
I'll suffer until their circle fades... Iâll be lost!
The beginning of my destination is close to themâ¦
Human kindâ¦! Ironyâ¦! Suicideâ¦!
A tragic feast in a theatre of mistâ¦!
Dead bodies without eyes are watching...!
A black dream melts the steel of my soul...!
Horses of evil spread death everywhereâ¦!
The myth of immortal rises above the oceanâ¦!
Loves the innocence of the angelsâ¦!
Calls for unborn souls to taste their juiceâ¦!
Wounded sky starts bleeding...!
Its idol suffersâ¦!
Its image in a dead childâ¦!
Starts feeling itâs dying...!
