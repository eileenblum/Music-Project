Being chased by images, trying to escape
Some previous self shows me the signs
My wounded thoughts seek for a miracle
This is the end of my suffocated soul!
Everythingâs screaming in a funeral constellation
The stars are sneering at the planets that host them
The fall of an angel shows the lost destiny
And the grief feels my pain once more
Listen to the desperate voices through melody
Wipe the dark ice from my face
Day by day my faith becomes stronger
I saw the dawn of war in a vision

A war that doesn't scare away my lifeless remorses
I feel the divine service of my past life
I've lived the profanity thousands years ago
My bloodful reincarnation is the only truth for me
Chased by lives Iâm trying to die
One of them makes me suffer
My broken body seeks for redemption
This is the end of all my souls forever...!
