Watch the crying stone
Silence is broken
Another bloomy tear
On my bloomy garden

Watch the blood red river
Just before the dawn
A sad song is heard
On his riverbanks

Absence of feelings, cold fragile fears
Neverending mindtrap, I will not fear

Time hugs my sad and painful life
I must fly like a bird to other places
Bloomy roses surround the crying stone
The sun is setting in the deep red

I will breathe love, in a grey garden
Among the black sunshines, kisses I will send
Meaning my life has now gained with you
If my body's touched, I shall melt slowly
