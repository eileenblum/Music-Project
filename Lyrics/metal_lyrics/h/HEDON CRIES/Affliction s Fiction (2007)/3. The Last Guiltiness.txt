Carrying my guilty past
Shadows now hunt me
Everbleeding scars of my soul
Lying in a veil of thoughts

Trapped inside for long
Annoyed and disturbed by many
Crying leeks of bloodred guilts
Show me the answers.. I seek!!!

Cry, cry out loud
Tear my soul apart
Show me the answers.. I seek
Cure my wrecked existence

Cry out loud!!!
