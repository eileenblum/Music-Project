The stars are swimming in its rivers
Birds of fire are flying in its sky
A sweet attraction is drawing me in my dreams
The kingdom wants my innocent soul

My thoughts... are loosing... control...!
Under the sun... the pathway is looking at me...!

In chaos I see the bright line
The passage into the bloody dimension
I can't escape from my destiny
Every planet I look at sleeps forever
A shadow stands in front of me
A face from the past
A young boy inside a cloud of flowers
My tears cover my face

The kingdom, the bloody dimension and I!!!
This is the end, the end of time!!!
