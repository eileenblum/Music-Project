A tear is slipping on my face
Pain dives into the lake of time
Its voice is weak... itâs bleeding
My whole life seems like a moment
All images are gone when my scary eyes are open
A tear offers me a dying smile
My light dances with darkness
And I am only a mournful melody

Cursed angels are looking at me
Lying in a grave deep in the sky

A tear is bleeding my innocence
A tear is dancing with my pain
A tear is freezing my soul
A tear under the rain

The wind goes away in my dream
I'm afraid of the past when looking at the future
Crystal tears make me bleed
Crystal tears are killing me
