I have memories of a lifeless cry...
A thought that swings in the captivity...
A crime into dizziness...
Some ironic God laughs at me...
I remember me shedding tears in a vision...
I remember a horrible halo...
An inapproachable desire...
A face of a dreamy sphere...

Sorrowful âcause of loneliness into a mortal room
I can see a painful colour in my heart
A burning sun burns down my rage
I lament over the frozen motion of your eyes
A strange shape is born inside me
My coronation in the evil valley
Throws me into a bloody starlight
Innocent...! Guilty...!

Being rolled in the fog, I loose my footsteps...
I'm attracted to a luminous chaotic hole
I see the greatness of an ancient temple
I'm close to the spring of feelings
I hear the crystal voices of the souls
I can release them! I can give them power!
And they can give me complete hate
Life...! Death...!

"There's nothing but an image into the mirror...
The lovers of a moribund inspiration...!"
I'm afraid that I won't find my self again...!
"There's nothing but an image into the mirror...
The lovers of a moribund inspiration...!"
I condemned my fear! I will meet my death!
"There's nothing but an image into the mirror...
The lovers of a moribund inspiration...!"
