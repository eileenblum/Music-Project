His moments are a dark flash
His memories are pictures of pain
All around him there's only one feeling: Abhorrence!
His dreams are a cloak of thorns

Fear is burning his wishesâ¦
Only he knows thatâ¦
His breath emits a never-ending agonyâ¦
Everybody wants to see him drown into the lakeâ¦
They desire only one lakeâ¦
The lake of his bloodâ¦!

His look is freezing their shadows
His black eyes never close
All alone in the night, suddenly light!
It hurts... Explosion...! Fire... dark again!!!
