My Image, My Pleasure, My Grief...
The Pain Embraced My Feelings
The Luminous River Travels
Between The Moon And Stars...
A Black Thorn Hurts Me
Just To Taste My Melancholy
Shades Of Past That Belongs To Me
I Can Hear The Nature's Scream...

"Now I Can See, I Can See...
I Can See My End, My End, In My Mirror...!"

Feel Like I Do
My Heavenly Sentiment
Shed Your Tears Like I Do
Hide Your Smile
Believe To Your Guilt
Love Your Death
The Only Hope For You...
Hedon Cries forever...!!!!
