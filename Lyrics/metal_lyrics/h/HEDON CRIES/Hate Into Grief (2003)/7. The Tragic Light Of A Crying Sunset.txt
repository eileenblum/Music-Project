I'm Losing Myself, I Feel Me Frozen
Just Like A Black Winter Sheltering Me
His Shroud Traveling Through My Heart
And Now Searching To Find My Light

I Feel Fear...!
I Stare As My Tragic Light Goes Away
Just An Image For Me...
The Tragic Light Of A Crying Sunset
Just A Feeling For Me...

I'm Dying, I'm Dying, I'm Dying, I'm Dying...
