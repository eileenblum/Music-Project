Bewitched My Self's Brother
Read Lies Truth
Searched My Feelings Map
Traveled Into Sky's tears

Like A Hand Saved Me Of The Sea
Blinded Me The Light Of The Dark
My Passion Broke Up With My Misery
And Now The Circle Becomes A Line

"And Maybe Those Days To Heaven I'll Send My Feelings"

Stack The Broken Tears
Kissed My Idol On The Sea
Took The Deepest Breath To See
Sleeping Angel On The Magic Tree

Read Lies Truth
Searched My Feelings Map
My Passion Broke Up With My Misery
And Now The Circle Becomes A Line

"And Maybe Those Days To Heaven I'll Send My Feelings"

I Will Roll Like A Teardrop
On A Dead Virgin's Breast
I will Kiss The Hair Of Eternal Feast
My Words Will Be The First Of The Last Tissues.
