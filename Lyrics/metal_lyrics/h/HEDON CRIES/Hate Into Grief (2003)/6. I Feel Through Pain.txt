Frozen Movements Running After Me
Burning Feelings Hear My Voice
Just Like Something Staring At My Yesterday
Lying On Glasses, It Catches The Pain, It Kisses My Pain
And Breaks My Heart

May A Beauty Taste My Fire
May Another Shadow Cover Mine
The Voyage Awaits Its Passenger In Black
The Sun Is Dying, The Sorrow Is Bleeding
Whispering : "I'm Fading Away"

Deep Inside A Sick Breaking Ice
Trying To Draw The Tears On My Face
And If I Can't Feel The Melodies Of Silence
I Will Tear My Heart Apart From Her
Just To Hear Her Scream

"And I Feel...I Feel Away From You...
I Feel Through Pain...I Feel The Darkest Of Times"

Now As The Time Passes By More Than Ever,
I Realise How Wrong I Was, What Suffering I Made Him Face
If I Had The Time...If Only I Had...But No...!
The Clock Doesn't Stop, I'm Cold
I Taste Death In My Lips, I Hear Him Screaming: "You're Mine"
And I'm Dying, Can't Change It, I'm Afraid Of What I'll Meet
I Don't Know Where I'll Go, What I'll Find
And With Every Passing Minute It's Feeling Colder!!!

"And I Feel...I Feel Away From You...
I Feel Through Pain...I Feel The Darkest Of Times"
