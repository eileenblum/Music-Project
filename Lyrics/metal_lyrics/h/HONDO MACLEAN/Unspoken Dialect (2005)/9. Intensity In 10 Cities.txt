It's making me depressed, seeing these guys getting everything they want.
You can see it in their eyes, switch off, I can't Iâm addicted!
I've got to allow myself to get what I want, have you got it baby?
Yeah you do but do I deserve it? Intensity in 10 cities!
At times I feel guilty of everything, a complete bastard.
So ashamed so I tell myself to fuck off, I implore you... I applaud you...
