This palace of immortals battle for the crown,
Bludgeon the senses!
"Iâm not the dumb cunt what's pissing blood"
Plates collide, lava run!
If these defences, defence from what attack?
What attack?
We bludgeon the senses, with no resolve we've taken this too far,
In violence rejoice.
A feast for your indulgence, to amuse yourself alone,
Barbarians in a bare back brawl, wise men fall on their backs at midnight,
In violence rejoice.
