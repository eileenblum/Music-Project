They face each other and inhale at the same time,
Nothing better than sharing, in one short second she grew wings to fly,
Now the arrow's missed all that she intends,
Is to start her heart again.
Ignite the cigarette, the hot cherry tips connect.
A simultaneous combustion of unspoken dialect,
Comfort one another's child bearing hips.
Hands that touch, feminine touch, unresolved unconvinced.
Elevated she's feeling liberated.
But what passion exists that could make this of you?
Peel the peach, juices flow.
Eat the girl and keep the stone
Sever ties, no conviction in her promises.
The presence of abandonment,
Got a gun, not afraid to use it!
What's the secret? I can hear it breathing, under the bed.
Woah! She wants devotion not apologies.
By the time, you get home, promises will be broken,
By the time, you get home, your fish will be dead and floating.
"Oh speechless Karina I will learn to read thy thoughts."
Fingers crossed behind her back, she swears on her mother's life,
When enemies become lovers, lovers can't become wives.
