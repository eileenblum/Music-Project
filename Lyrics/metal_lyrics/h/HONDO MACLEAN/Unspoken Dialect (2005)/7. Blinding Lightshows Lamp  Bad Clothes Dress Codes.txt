See how the city walks,
Out of step but synchronised,
Synchronised and out of time.
Limbs outstretched and we imagine that we could look like stars upon,
The bathroom tiles and pavement cracks, out against the night.
The ground we tread has turned to tracks.
A cycle of seasons with no turning back.
Aura winds are blowing cold in the bright lights of this city,
We are all passers by,
Treading harder - I wish you'd stay out aloud.
Treading water - I wish you'd sink out of sight.
I wish you'd sink.
