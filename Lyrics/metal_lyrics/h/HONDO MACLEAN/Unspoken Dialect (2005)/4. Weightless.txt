Last night we crashed the gates, they burst wide open.
Last night we crashed the gates, when the guard was down.
(Slowly she) We dare to dare ourselves, beyond borders,
We're ready to crash the fight,
We're ready to take flight,
We're ready to drop the guard.
As we dare to dare ourselves a little closer... Walls disintegrate.
Weightless, we carry no burden here.
Weightless we're carried projected in flight.
Come back and say you will dance with me (You're so perfect)
Come back and say you wilted since we.. (You're so perfect)
