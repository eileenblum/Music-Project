So you've got to go... go... gone
This surge has taken,
Destined to bestow...
Get Over Here.
Cold morning wrapped in shivered silence.
I hear the fountains pour and Iâm reassured.
Alive, before I forget to remember.
Final Round.
Salt water swallow choke my lung,
Cough out blue tears in the company of none,
All drunken eyes, raining just like the day I heard of,
Your devastating acceleration.
Rain kept hitting ground I drown.
My head is in the cloud.
And I am soaked right through,
Gotta dry these dripping clothes,
Or else every hand I shake,
Will catch these dripping blues,
Gotta dry these dripping clothes.
I've got to get out these dripping clothes...
Weâre staring into a void that seems to be everywhere,
Between the skyline, down to the sea.
Shine your distant rest anaesthetised,
Finish Him.
Sun's gone to plan for a better day.
Sun's gone to plan for...
Fatality.
Flawless Victory.
