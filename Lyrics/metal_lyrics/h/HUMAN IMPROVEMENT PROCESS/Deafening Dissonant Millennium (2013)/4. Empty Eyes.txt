apathetic state of self unconsciousness
a dream no longer led by reason
repression, resistance unveil a new inner self
undoing, shattering your tortured defenses
you struggle within your mind
your defenses, shattered by paranoia

introspection designs a portrait of your wicked thoughts
embracing a discordant reality
you're alone with your madness

cognitive dissonance condemns your perceptions,
you are alone with your madness

your screams, not detected
nausea is encoded
an ego become too prevailing
to be suppressed

[Chorus]
in your empty eyes we realize how fragile we are
in the darkest days, we are so far

you once were there,
walking among mediocrity,
following the ignorant dogma
carved in human's core,
an agonizing soul
is dying underneath your flesh

cognitive dissonance condemns your perceptions,
you are alone with your madness

your screams, not detected
nausea is encoded
an ego become too prevailing
to be suppressed

[Chorus]
in your empty eyes we realize how fragile we are
in the darkest days, we are so far

undoing, shattering your tortured defenses
you are dying, crawling, within your mind
