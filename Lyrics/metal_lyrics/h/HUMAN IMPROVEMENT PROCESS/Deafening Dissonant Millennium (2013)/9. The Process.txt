your sheer integrity avoids the post human scourge that is me
I'm no one, I'm nothing but the unassigned end
to anticlockwise beating mechanized hearts

I deny each step of this reverse evolution
that changed our bodies but did not corrupt our minds

[Chorus]
I'll find, what was left and denied in sleepless hours
our infinite struggle, our improvement process

I deny each step of this reverse evolution
that changed our bodies and chased us from our haven

[Chorus]
I'll find, what was left and denied in sleepless hours
our infinite struggle, our improvement process

when we fail, the process is finally complete
we'll be only shells without a soul
