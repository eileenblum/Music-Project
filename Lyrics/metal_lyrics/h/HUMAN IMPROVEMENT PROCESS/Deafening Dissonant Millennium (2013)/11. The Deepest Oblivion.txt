the impulse maltreats our minds
its clenched jaws threaten our balance
we are waiting for the sentence
with hands chained to the floor
light is forbidden to our sewn eyelids
our sealed dry mouths can't even shout
as blood withers in our veins
we'll never feel free again

[Chorus]
we fall into ourselves, blinded by pain
we are too distant
to hear the inhuman cries of our tortured soul denied

can you feel our suffering
and the nothingness we live in?

we are waiting for the sentence
of the man-made engine god
our sealed dry mouths can't even shout
as blood withers in our veins

[Chorus]
we fall into ourselves, blinded by pain
we are too distant
to hear the inhuman cries of our tortured soul denied
devoid of hope, devoid of name
we are the slaves of evidence,
the cancer of this planet
we are the cancer of this planet

the impulse maltreats our minds
its clenched jaws threaten our balance
we are dying, consumed by our own vanity
arrogance is our condemnation

here is nothingness, here is chaos
the hunger of the deepest oblivion
feeds on our non-dreams
this pain seems so real

abandon all hope
for we are, we are the victims
