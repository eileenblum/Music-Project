deconstruction, synthesized birth of machines
prototypes of a new race of androids
the vile view from scorching icons of nothingness

through this ethereal barrier
no feelings, like me others, millions
born for vanity, searching within themselves
a god that's missing

within themselves, a god that's missing
we all rely on this ethereal lie

bred on a clandestine soil
our last spark dwells on the edge of denial
where atoms are gathering, improving, generating
something that never asked to live

[Chorus]
in spirals of infinite pain I fall
turning to the observant heavens
that separate us from serenity

no remorse, cause failure is here at hand
your birth is violation of our freedom

we all belong to a mechanized sun
we are ethereal, fragile minds
confined to struggle through the stream of existence

fed on lies, we turn our eyes to see the nothing we are

atoms are gathering, improving, generating
something that never asked to live

[Chorus]
in spirals of infinite pain I fall
turning to the observant heavens
that separate us from serenity
in spirals of infinite pain I fall
turning to the observant heavens
nothingness, the answer to our insanity
