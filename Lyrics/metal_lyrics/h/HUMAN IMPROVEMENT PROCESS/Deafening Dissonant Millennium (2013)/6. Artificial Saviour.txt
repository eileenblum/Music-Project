reactivate your fragile senses erasing a binding mortality
the source of self-denial
let the virus spread within our bodies
as the machinery gives you
a new biomechanical life

you are the product:
the engine-god, man's artificial savior

you preach conceit, shine in disgrace
you are the sickening architect
of a vacuous paradise,
the cynic observer of our ordinary fool existence
the flesh mechanism in obsolete decay

[Chorus]
fear not the dreadful passing of time,
you, perfect creature unable to cry or feel,
unable to heal the wounds of this foolish mankind

you are unable to heal these wounds
your paradise is falling in pieces

spread the contagion
to our formless mental state of disorder

reactivate your fragile senses erasing a binding mortality
the source of self-denial
let the virus spread within our bodies

[Chorus]
fear not the dreadful passing of time,
you, perfect creature unable to cry or feel,
unable to heal the wounds of this foolish mankind

the dreadful passing of time
you are unable to cry or feel,
to heal this foolish mankind
