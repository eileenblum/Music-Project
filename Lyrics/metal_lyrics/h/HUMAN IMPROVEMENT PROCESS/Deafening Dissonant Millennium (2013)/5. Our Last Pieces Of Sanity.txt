can you feel the void of its substance?
the lash of a million tongues,
licking the wounds of our inner entrapment

the paradox discovers its sentence
in the gallery of obsession
we imagine our introspective self
becoming insane

we are broken pieces of a denied sanity
we, the dehumanized stains of creation,
we only wait for the lie

[Chorus]
for the beautiful
illusion that feeds on our fears
will we find ourselves again in a refuge
built upon our last pieces of sanity?

the beautiful illusion from which we can't run away

can you feel the void of its substance?
the lash of a million tongues
licking the wounds of our inner entrapment

we are broken pieces of a denied sanity
we, the dehumanized stains of creation,
we only wait for the lie

[Chorus]
for the beautiful
illusion that feeds on our fears
will we find ourselves again in a refuge
built upon our last pieces of sanity?

our last pieces of sanity crawl through non-reality where
consciousness flows in streams of ignorant omniscience and
we outstretch our arms reaching infinity
embracing ourselves in nothingness becoming part of essential architectures
