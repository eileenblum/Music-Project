human am I , the imperfect creation,
the self-deceived philosopher
that feeds on illusions
I am the obsolete prey

senses collapse, seconds now ages they seem
is this only a mental deceit?

is this the relentless ruination I am forced to behold?
insanity, ties me
and condemns me to suffer alone

[Chorus]
erase this pain I feel
erase the everyday apathy I lose myself in
will I return to you?
erase this pain I feel
protect me from anyone, anything
set me free from lies!

when will these unending scars heal?
am I just a product of my own tortured mind?
here I stay, caged in a sphere-shaped dimension
where life is an endless spiral floating around negation

I, the human
I, the mind

is this the relentless ruination I am forced to behold?
insanity, ties me
and condemns me to suffer alone
senses collapse, is this only a mental deceit?

[Chorus]
erase this pain I feel
erase the everyday apathy I lose myself in
will I return to you?
erase this pain I feel
protect me from anyone, anything
set me free from lies!
