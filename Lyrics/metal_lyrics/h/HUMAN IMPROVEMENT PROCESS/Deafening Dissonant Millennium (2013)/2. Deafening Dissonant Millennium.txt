constant sense of vanity,
we fall into this sickening void of
chaos, systematically aligned
to shape eternity

we, the dry grains of sand
of the cruel desert that's life
we, the withered veins
cowardly piercing the deafening silence
we belong to the new millennium

sweet horizons of madness
slowly creeping through dissonant thoughts
we never wanted to kneel
in front of this cruel fate

[Chorus]
eyes turn to stone
as the new sun appears
will the mourn of our solitude
fill me with pain?

we are the sons of the new millennium
our future is denied
what was promised us won't exist anymore

we are the products of the new millennium
blank, sterile minds
whose deafening lament
cannot be sensed in this hollow world
this hollow fuckin' world!

[Chorus]
eyes turn to stone
as the new sun appears
we are drowning
in our inner oceans of tears

constant sense of vanity
we fall into this sickening void

we are the sons of the new millennium
millennium

we are closed in our lost existence
under this cold black sun
we are the abortions
of the dissonant millennium
