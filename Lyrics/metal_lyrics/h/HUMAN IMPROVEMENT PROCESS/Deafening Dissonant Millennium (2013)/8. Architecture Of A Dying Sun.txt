as these wounds bleed with spiteful intent
amusing my disobedient glance
I recall nightmares and illusions
I claim my sanity

just to taste suffering, to fall on my knees and cry
I am the narrow minded
son of mediocrity, the indifferent, the degenerated

[Chorus]
my heaven is lost
and my dreams torn apart
will this sun warm us again?
while our new black sun devours all
like a black hole amid the stars

will this dying sun warm us again?

the architecture of a dying sun
makes my emotions flatten
apathy unveils my inner conflicts
futile is now resistance

I am the narrow minded
son of mediocrity, the indifferent, the degenerated

[Chorus]
my heaven is lost
and my dreams torn apart
will this sun warm us again?
while our new black sun devours all
like a black hole amid the stars

my heaven is lost
will this sun warm us again?

I'm in a reverie
the extraordinary unconscious prison
the benignant smile of pain
