come on!
crawling, step by step there is no horizon to
define, beyond the curtains of this deceiving
stage, on which we find ourselves
miserably doomed to walk the earth
behold the ruins
(connected to absolution)
of this planet
the post-industrial haven
behold the ruins
(awaken in lies)
of this planet
the post-industrial haven

condemned by god
to live like parasites
the failure of
mankind, is nearer than you think

[Chorus:]
ascension of silence
the hidden face of this mistake
a hope for no one
the weakest glance from my eyes

I lie in gardens of sorrow
the factory that gave me life
Emotions are yet-mechanized
The plague is spreading through my brain

Rise, walk, feast, upon
our shapeless
reality defined
in grief
Rise, look, speak, words of
sinful agony
reality set to
fail

[Chorus:]
ascension of silence
the hidden face of this mistake
a hope for no one
the weakest glance from my eyes

give us a sign!!

scars, on the face, of misery
burn, these bridges, down!
now! step by step
we severe these-
ties!
