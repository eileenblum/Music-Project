I watch the stars in the sky
before my body is affected
by the wall of light
that dissolves all around me
I hear the voice of Creation, which says my name
infected of our knowledge, we've grown only fuckin' greed.

Surprised by the promises of science
giving up our soul, for Biotechnology
synthesizing all the feelings
Scars in between the cosmos
unlimited echoes of, ruins of a past,
in which we were parasites

It's like a flame inside me
that consumes, all that I believe in [x2]

[Chorus 1]
I've waited, under the rain,
trying to go on, to trust you

I watch the stars in the sky
before my body is affected
by the wall of light
that dissolves all around me
I hear the voice of Creation, which says my name
infected of our knowledge, we've grown only fuckin' greed.

(And we'll never find)

It's like a flame inside me
that consumes, all that I believe in [x2]

[Chorus 2]
I've waited, under the rain,
trying to go on, to trust you
I've waited, in my last days,
to break these chains, to burn with stars

only blank files, now in my mind
they seem to fail, they seem to collapse
now at my feet, ruins rise
now at my feet, statues are blind
carrying black wings, doomed to perish
I seem to end, these dying days
now at my feet, ruins rise
now at my feet, statues are blind
