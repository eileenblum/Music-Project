everyday i feel the weight of my sins
like a knife through my life
trying to evade my punishment
maniacal analysis of all signs
systematically
refusing what I am burning in shame

[Chorus x4]
what's happened
pain
shame
everything is a fucking hell today

maniacal analysis of all signs
systematically
refusing what I am
burning in shame

[Chorus x4]
what's happened
pain
shame
everything is a fucking hell today

savoring the taste of remorse I'm awaiting another day
fighting and bleeding I keep my pride

born, in between all enemies
shores in flames burnt at my feet
blood drops fall in which we sink
beyond daylight
scorn, majesty of vanity
with blind eyes you'll never see
the imperfection of our race
(man/kind)

[Chorus x2]
what's happened
pain
shame
