oh - weep for me as an angel,
weep for me as a liar,
in these last seconds, in which we fall
consumed by nothingness and blindness

oh, we seem to end these days
we seem to end these days

[Chorus]
I, find,
what was just denied
by sleepless hours, through nights
of hope, born / dead
a world to erase and dehumanize

with scorn, with pain
within, these eye

oh - weep for me as an angel,
weep for me as a liar,
in these last seconds, in which we fall
consumed by nothingness and blindness

[Chorus]
I, find,
what was just denied
by sleepless hours, through nights
of hope, born / dead
a world to erase and dehumanize

When we fail, the process is finally complete.
we will be shells without a soul
