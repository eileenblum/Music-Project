Hysterical masses asking for help, in these years of madness
We are brainwashed and cradled by opulence
like weak primates, we live in benighted ignorance.
observers are here.

Welcome the new era
Welcome the new order

Fight through faith, truth through science
draconian eye watching us from the clouds

[Chorus]
Rebuild our heaven, our silent dreams come true
in our paradise, breathe new life coming back home

Ready for the sacrifice that we have imposed, we die to evolve.
A new order with new rules to solve
the inefficiency of, hundreds of ages
hundreds of fucking ages

welcome the new era
welcome the new order

It's time to evolve our minds, in blindness
they fall from the sky.

[Chorus]
Rebuild our heaven, our silent dreams come true
in our paradise, breathe new life coming back home
when our sun will die, and we'll no longer blind
from our prison, take my hand coming back home.

Hysterical masses asking for help, in these years of madness
We are brainwashed and cradled by opulence
like weak primates, we live in benighted ignorance.
observers are here.
