Through millions of universes with the fury of a god
to save them from their sins that kill them slowly

We are the verb, the existence and the only truth
Let's go to war against our son, to free him from his madness
we are the only hope for their souls
no one will stop us

[Chorus]
We come from eternity, to save them from themselves
between us, thousands of dead stars

burning civilization, we adjust the decay
of their distorted consciences

Counting all the tears that I've wept through the years
trying to improve them , despite their mistakes

You've almost come to an end
like your Atlanteans brothers (trapped in a corner)
our first sons, you've chosen the darkside

We are the verb, the existence and the only truth
Let's go to war against our son, to free him from his madness
we are the only hope for their souls
no one will stop us

[Chorus]
between us, thousands of dead stars

we come from eternity, to save them from themselves
between us, thousands of dead stars

you've almost come to an end
like your Atlanteans brothers (trapped in a corner)
our first sons, you've chosen the darkside

The end has come for the Ancients' sons
behold the creators of the universe
(behold the creators!!!)
