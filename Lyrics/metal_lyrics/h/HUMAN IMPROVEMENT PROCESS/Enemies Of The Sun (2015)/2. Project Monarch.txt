the sickening lies of the regime
nourish a new age of man
confined to the physical
our minds condemned to obey
an exoskeleton of fear
a centrifuge of thoughts
structured dissociation
identity erased

they watched us crawl through our shattered dreams
while manipulating our consciousness

[Chorus]
they watched us feed
they watched us reject our former self
built to follow their vanity
the only reason we exist

upon the throne of conceit
they reclaim their omnipotence

trapped inside a conscious host
we're now corrupted, damaged and

lost
constantly
searching for an answer
redefined
driven by the need to kill

trapped inside a conscious host
we're now corrupted, damaged and
lost behind intertwined souls
preachers of disharmony herald our dissolvence

moved by hidden strings
for reasons we can't understand
accepting our role
as merciless machines
with science and sorcery
they shaped the souls of the weak
a matter of life, death and everything in between

the womb of displacement breeds
the new era, the new world order
in which we are slaves

[Chorus]
they watched us feed
they watched us reject our former self
built to follow their vanity
the only reason we exist
