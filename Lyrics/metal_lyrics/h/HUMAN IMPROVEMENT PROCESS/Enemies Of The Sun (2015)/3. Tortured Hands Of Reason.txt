bleached fragments of immaculate consciousness
dwell behind the shapeless void
eyes reopened, movements detected
perception reactivated

agony procreated by a distorted mind
that feeds on shadows against the wall of substance

I'm the insane, the figure not shaped
translucent, indefinite, blank
the spiritual disharmony perpetually drowning in tears

my glance can't reach the cold and distant sun
defective projection of my inner torment
am I real? Am I alive?

[Chorus]
greed and despair
voraciously swallow all signs of hope from our
newborn sun
serenity is what I cling to in my psychic seclusion

the inner mutation draws
iridescent paths through the void
your empty faith is rejected
mirroring abstract prophecies

this world is sentenced to death
and we unconsciously procreate the infection

the turmoil arises from negation
as we speak, as we deceive ourselves
denying the truth, but allowing the deceit
the two of my eyes blindly scan the unexpected

my glance can't reach the cold and distant sun
defective projection of my inner torment
am I real? Am I alive?

[Chorus]
greed and despair
voraciously swallow all signs of hope from our
newborn sun
serenity is what I cling to in my psychic seclusion

images framed in a regretful vortex of disillusion
the teeth of insanity still glimmering
waiting for my demise
as the tortured hands of reason
sharpen their nails against my nerves
I proclaim my failure
