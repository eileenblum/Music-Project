When it all bows to darkness
Natural Justice will be served
The only truth we can fathom,
Is the judgment of the earth
Water will try to drown itself,
Fire will try to burn
And what we take for granted, will take us in return
Woe to us thieves!
We, weâve stolen our childrenâs souls

[Chorus:]
Heavy rain will come,
Wash the disease away
Storms will serve as punishment
For our refusal to obey
Hey! Hey!
Refusal to obey
Storms serve as punishment
For our refusal to obey

An age of refinement beyond our control
We must pay the toll

Water will drown
Fire will burn
Earth will bury
Air return home
An age of refinement beyond our control
True consumption neither bought nor sold
Created or evolved
We must still pay the toll

[Chorus:]
Heavy rain will come,
Wash the disease away
Storms will serve as punishment
For our refusal to obey
Hey! Hey!
Refusal to obey
Storms serve as punishment
For our refusal to obey
