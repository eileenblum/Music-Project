As civilization reaches a point of no return
We must begin to value action rather than {just} concern
Released from bondage, our minds now free

Spirits open
To embrace humanity
Tear down the "just us" system
Top of the pyramid
Mass hysteria
Revoke our right to live
We can stand
Or rot where we lay
Nothing less than war
Revolution of the enslaved
Minds now free

Spirits open
To embrace humanity
Tear down the "just us" system
Top of the pyramid
Mass hysteria
Revoke our right to live
We can stand
Or rot where we lay
Nothing less than war
Revolution of the enslaved
