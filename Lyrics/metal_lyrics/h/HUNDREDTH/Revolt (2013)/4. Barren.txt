How do we think we are the most intellectual creature that ever walked the Earth,
But we are destroying and polluting and damaging the futures of other species?
How come then, this so intellectual being is destroying its only home?
Because we only have the one home.

Melted down,
We live to waste.
Denial breathes decay.
The vultures know
We are running away.
Denial breathes decay.
Weâre running away.
Denial breathes decay.
Weâre running away.
The vultures know
Weâre running away.
We never see
We live to waste.
Weâre running away.

With damnation commencing
Those of us on our knees are in fear
Having to pray for deteriorating humanity.
Deteriorating humanity.
Barren will be our soils.
A desert of dry bones
As we wait for rapture.
We reap what we sold.
We reap what we sold.
We reap what we sold.
