Iâm fed up... Iâm fed up with the constant flow. Getting lost in the rhythm.
Cadences of disdain, melodies without satisfaction.
But the only thing... the only thing I have is time.

Risk lays the foundation of my destiny... destiny.
Risk lays the foundation of my destiny.

And if it crumbles, at least I know I tried. I can stand on that. Instead of questioning why...
Instead of questioning why I never chased down the man I want to be.
Buried deep inside of me is the door to what Iâm meant to be.
And I... I hold the key... I hold the key. I hold the key. I hold the key.

I met myself in a dream. Innocent, adamant, adolescent me.
Donât turn your back on me. Donât turn your back on me.
This regret wonât tear through me (tear through me).
Iâd rather fail... Iâd rather fail than fail to be... myself.
This regret wonât tear through me (tear through me).
Iâd rather fail... Iâd rather fail than fail to be... myself.
