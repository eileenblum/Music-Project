I'm gonna live today, live to make a change.
There's comes a time in every life when it's time to move on.
and well hey, that what it is today, it's time to make a change.
I was never awake, just dreaming of the days
When things were said and never done.
But now this is the life I lead, living only to breathe
hope into humanity.
I made a promise to myself.
I promised I'd never go back
to thinking of this place as my wishing well.
It's the same ol' take, take, take
I gave up on the world and that's all I could give.
And I said I'll never go back to putting myself above the rest.
I held my chin up high, but that's all I could lift.
Inside of me was a void as empty as the sky without the sun.
I was never awake, just dreaming of the days
when things were said and never done.
But now this is the life I lead, living only to breathe
hope into humanity. I'm gonna live today.
