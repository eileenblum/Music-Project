Looking in the rear-view mirror at everything that Iâm leaving behind.
I know this is right, I know itâs my time.
Now is my time to escape this weathered town and what this place is all about.

Iâve gotta get out of here, but the memories Iâll take with me.
Everywhere I go, to everyone I know. These memories will stay with me.
To escape this weathered town and what this place is all about.
These memories will stay with me... will stay... will stay with me.

And I donât know... I donât know if youâll ever understand. You can say that itâs not worth it.
And you can say... you can say itâs a wasted life.
But the memories, Iâll take with me. These memories, theyâll stay with me.
The memories, Iâll take with me. These memories, theyâll stay with me.

Holding onto the past each day leaves me empty, wanting everything to be the way it was.
There are better days to come, I just have to... I have to let go... (let go, let go)
of the things that I have done and the ones who have moved on.

Iâve gotta get out of here, but the memories Iâll take with me.
Everywhere I go, to everyone I know. These memories will stay with me.
Iâll escape this weathered town and what this place is all about.
The memories, theyâll stay with me... theyâll stay... theyâll stay... theyâll stay... with me.
