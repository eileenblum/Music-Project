[feat. Ian Fike of It Prevails]why am i wasting my time pleasing people around me? i'm sick of waiting around for nothing. why am i wasting my time? i will not build my legacy on earth. my legacy will not be of this world. i will not build my legacy on earth. my legacy will be too large for this soil. my whole life i've been compared to people around me. expectations on my shoulder and people to please. i will no longer sway with the willows. i will stand strong on my own. when everyone lets me down. i will stand strong alone. i will stand strong alone. and when the winds hurl, i will not move. i'm destined for greatness. i'll see it through. we will see this through.
