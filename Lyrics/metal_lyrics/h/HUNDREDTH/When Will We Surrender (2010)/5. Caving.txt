my life leaks away groan by groan. my years are fading in sighs.i am growing weary.i am growing weary. they want to blot me from their memory. forget me like a corpse in a grave. throw me out with the scraps. behind doors they plot to ruin me. and i'll be honest with you, it's caving in on me. i been breaking through walls to get free. neck deep in this sinking sand. i will no longer run but my trust will remain in everlasting. your hands hold my days. embarrass the wicked. stand them up. leave them shaking their heads. as they drift down to hell. gag the loudmouthed liars who heckle me, your follower. slam the door on those oily, mocking faces. silence the venom of gossip. i cannot go it alone. the world is caving in on me.
