[feat. Matthew Hasting of Mychildren Mybride]when will we surrender.
when will we strive for what is good and not for what man has created.
when will we no longer trample the poor.
ignore the stomachs of the starving.
renew the hearts of the hopeless and the strength of the helpless.
those who can't stand on their own two feet.
those who can't stand on their own two feet.
we gotta change what means the most to us.
when will we look to the hurting before we bandage our own wounds.
we say we are martyrs, but we'd only die for ourselves.
we gotta mend the wounds of the desperate.
we have the power to change circumstance.
we have the power.
we have the power to change.
let us rise above the storm.
rise above the storm.
set sail into the sea.
set sail into the sea.
into the sea.
when we pass through waters, we will not sink.
when we walk through fire, we will not be set ablaze.
we will not sink.
we will not be set ablaze.
instead we sink into your grace.
a furnace of your mercy.
because you chose the despised and lowly.
you choose the despised and lowly.
i am despised.
i am lowly.
we will be the catalysts to reach out to the hurting.
we will embrace those who have been abandoned.
we will be catalysts.
we will embrace those who have been abandoned.
