[feat. Jonathan Vigil of The Ghost Inside]what have i gained by giving the world my everything. it's never been such a struggle to regress to what i was yesterday. but today, i seem so far away. i'm waiting on the world to sing. the song i've been singing. i'm waiting on the world to sink. the way i've been sinking. i've given too much away over these past few years and this is ending today. there's pain in my eyes like i've never known. i have fallen short. do you still see me as beautiful? carry me home. lighten my stagger. my conscience is weak. i'm begging for reparation. i am deficient of hope. refine me with fire. refine me with fire, oh God. refine me with fire. there's pain in my eyes, like i've never known. i've fallen short. do you still see me as beautiful? i'll never find my place on Earth. but i refuse to fade away.
