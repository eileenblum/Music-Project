the sun rises and the sun sets and hurries back to where it rises. wind to the south, and wind to the north. ever returning on its course. all streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full the streams return again without an ounce of toil. what has been, will be again there is nothing new under the sun. lest the adversary misunderstand our hand. lest the adversary misunderstand and say our hand has triumphed. what has been will be again. nothing new under the sun. what has been, will be again. to exalt flesh. what has been done will be done again. to exalt flesh. remove our worthless idols. wreck our pride. remove our worthless idols. wreck my pride. kindle a fire that burns to the realm of death below. devour the earth and its harvests.
