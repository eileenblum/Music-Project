Remove the shadows from my eyes
Chains locked and tied across the door
He thinks himself a heroine, tie and run
He is the needle, I am the damage done

My anger is a gift my mind trained my eyes to see
The difference between who I am and the man I want to be
Closed off and silent, fear lashed and left this scar
A wall that won't come down until I know that I know who you are

Tear it down
I'm torn open and spilling out
All my burdens bury me
Restless soul still wrestling
I've felt it closing in on me
For far too long

I feel it
I feel it crawling in my skin
It's going back and forth and then back again
Why does it feel so desperate?
Acceptance, it feels so fucking pointless
A fleeting feeling, a means to an end
Like resurrecting a monument only to tear it down again

Tear it down
I'm torn open and spilling out

All my burdens bury me
Restless soul still wrestling
I've felt it closing in on me
For far too long

Remove the shadows from my eyes
Chains locked and tied across the door
He thinks himself a heroine, tie and run
He is the needle, I am the damage done
