I was rotting inside
My inner flaws begging not to be revealed
Swallowing doubt, choking it down
Whatever I have to do to keep it concealed

I'll leave it off the list when you ask me what
my disposition is
I just avoided it
Hoped it would blow over but you caught wind
And just to see you turned me inside out

And now I see it
There's no freedom in bottling it up and hiding it
So I air it out

I am my only judge
And my self-hatred is justice enough
Set myself free
Set free

And just to see you turned me inside out

You hung me on your wall
Gazed into darkness until you saw it all
It wasn't what I wanted but I've never felt so free
Until you turned me inside out
