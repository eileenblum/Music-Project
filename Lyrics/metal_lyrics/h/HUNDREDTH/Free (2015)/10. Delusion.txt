Tell me I'm free to run with my tied feet
So when I fall you can coax me with sympathy
Force failure down my throat until I feel guilty

Weaken my will by limiting what I can do
What I can say and how to be
Want me to compromise
Want me to fall in line

I tried surrender
But I had to let go
Rise in revolt
Resist the fear I was being sold

I freed myself from your divine delusion
Chains of guilt that were enslaving me
Put a veil over my eyes, debt myself to a sacrifice
I have to blind myself to believe

Tell me to fly but there's a ceiling
Cage me in and say that I can't leave
Drag me through the dirt so you can clean me

But I won't surrender to
The cold hand trying to silence me
Make me follow a concept
A mouth that doesn't speak
Slanted the truth and expected me not to see

The warped reality that breeds bigotry and ignorance
Trades equality for kneeling at an empty throne

Forfeit control to none
The warped reality
Forfeit control to none
Kneeling at an empty throne
Forfeit control to none
The warped reality that breeds bigotry and ignorance
Trades equality for kneeling at an empty throne

Forfeit control to none
I had to let go
Rise in revolt
Resist the fear I was sold

I freed myself from your divine delusion
Chains of guilt that were enslaving me
Put a veil over my eyes, debt myself to a sacrifice
I have to blind myself to believe
