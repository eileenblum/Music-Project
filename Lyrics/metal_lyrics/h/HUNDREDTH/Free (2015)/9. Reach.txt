I just have to reach, reach out
It's right in front of me

Seek out the balance between
Keeping my eyes on the horizon
And staring at my feet

I have to choose between drowning
In a puddle or burying myself in the sea

The weight of my concern is distressing
And my lack of discern only disconnects me

I must fight the sickness
I must find the cure and let it take me
Into the same deep waters as you

"The shallow drowned
Lose less than we"
And it's only drifting further

I just have to reach, reach out
It's right in front of me

Open waves of turmoil or
Closed off serenity
Do I cast my burdens?
Or do I learn to carry the weight?
My lack of discern only disconnects me

I must fight the sickness
I must find the cure and let it take me
Into the same deep waters as you

"The shallow drowned
Lose less than we"
And it's only drifting further

I just have to reach
It's right in front of me

Embrace the deep
There's more room to sink
I just have to reach
Bury myself in the sea

I just have to reach
Embrace the deep
Because there's more room to sink
I just have to reach
