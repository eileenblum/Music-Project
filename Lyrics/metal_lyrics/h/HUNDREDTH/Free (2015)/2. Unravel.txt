How was I to know?

The search went on and on and on
I thought I could fill you up
While I had nowhere to go
But the deeper I dove the less I found
A waste but how was I to know

On the surface
It seemed like everything was worth it

I was an aimless string
I was dangling
You were pulling me
Just to watch me unravel

Push and pull
Provoke my will
Trying to see what you can get out of me
Soak up every last ounce of me
More than you can carry

Youâll have to wring yourself out
Before you walk away
Youâll have to wring yourself out
Before you think about leaving

Iâll stand there and watch
You pour me back out
It's a sad sight to see
Because without me
You return to being empty

On the surface
It seemed like everything was worth it

I was an aimless string
I was dangling
You were pulling me
Just to watch me unravel
