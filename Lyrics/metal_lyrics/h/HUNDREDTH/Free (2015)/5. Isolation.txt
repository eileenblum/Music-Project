Becoming who I despise

The naked truth leaves me bare
A tipping point between order and chaos
Gave way to despair every thought that
Sides with scorn

Constantly stranding myself
I push them away
I hold my tongue and say
"No one understands me"
I justified my position with
"We're all alone in the end"

I blur the line between who loves me and needs me
Separate myself to gain control of everything
And redefine, but I lost in the isolation

Empathy, a foreign word to me
Had no desire to speak
Had no desire to set free
Fear let ency steal my virtue
Pain blinded my escape
I chose to side with my enemy
The part of me that I hate

Fear pain envy hate
I'll see you on the other side

I blur the line between who loves me and needs me
Separate myself to gain control of everything
And redefine, but I lost in the isolation
