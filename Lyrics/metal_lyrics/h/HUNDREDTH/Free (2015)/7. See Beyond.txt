See beyond
You try to break me, I look past and see beyond
You try to bend me
I won't align

Cast aside
Don't expect to find a single thing in common
With the crooked smiles, the aimless idols
Hollow and wandering
They're going nowhere for miles

They try to break me
They try to bend me
But I see beyond

I won't align
I don't need validation to define me
Or justify manipulation

And I'll sway you spineless
Prove you mindless
You lash out while I'm poised and silent
I won't live up to mass appeal
"I'm holding out for a better deal"
"Something real"

I see beyond

I won't align
I don't need validation to define me
Or justify manipulation

They try to bend me
They try to break me
But I see beyond
