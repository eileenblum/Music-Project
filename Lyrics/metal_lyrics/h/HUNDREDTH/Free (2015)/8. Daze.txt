I tried to wake you but you were lost
Lost in a daze and I gave up

Your fits of rage could only last so long
Until you were splintered, shattered, silent
Swallowing stones
Exhaust yourself fighting the truth
Just made it known
No judgment made, I knew it was just a fit of rage
And while you're splintered and silent
A fire of shame

I was willing to burn in the flame
But when I tried to wake you
You were lost
Lost in a daze

You gave me this,
But I paid for that
You once told me you're gone
There's no coming back

Now that you wished yourself so far away
I see what I should have seen
You divorced yourself from feeling

And you force it out of your mind
All your fury in a fit of rage

And while you're splintered and silent
A fire of shame

I was willing to burn in the flame
But when I tried to wake you
You were lost
Lost in a daze
