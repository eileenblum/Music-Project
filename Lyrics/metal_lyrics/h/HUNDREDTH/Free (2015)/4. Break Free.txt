I just wanna break free from my misery
It's suffocating everyone around me
Choking on my apathy
And disregard for humanity

A bitter taste I'm so sick of swallowing
A dead end path I'm sick of following
I'm becoming my own worst enemy
Spit it out

Force fed by no other than me
Self-inflicted suffering

I just wanna break free from my misery
It's suffocating everyone around me
Choking on my apathy
Gonna find the wall and tear it down
Tear down everything
So I can shed my disregard for humanity
And unlearn the things that make me

Sink back into my ways
Past and present
Grow and change
Don't you fucking test me (test me)
Force fed by no other than me

I just wanna break free from my misery
It's suffocating everyone around me
Choking on my apathy
Gonna find the wall and tear it down
Tear down everything
So I can shed my disregard for humanity
I just want to break free
