It didn't mean anything to me
To mean anything to you
And you pretended you were calloused
Because you didn't know what else to do

You were begging for attention
The loudest in the room

You confused my silence
My solitude for weakness
But I could see right through
You were starving for acceptance inside
And when you cracked, it all seeped through

You're slurring words, things you know nothing about
Ignorance displayed like a trophy you're proud of
You stagger around nothing but stones in your mouth
Because you're too deep in your front to spit them out

You were begging for attention
The loudest in the room

You confused my silence
My solitude for weakness
But I could see right through
You were starving for acceptance inside
And when you cracked, it all seeped through

You pretended you were calloused
But I could see right through
You cracked and now you're at the bottom
Stones in your mouth
Too deep to spit them out
Trying to make your way back
And your desperation is deafening

You confused my silence
My solitude for weakness
But I could see right through
You were starving for acceptance inside
And when you cracked, it all seeped through
