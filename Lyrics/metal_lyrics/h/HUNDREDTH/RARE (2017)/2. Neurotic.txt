Get out tonight
From the deafening sound inside
That I'll deny
But it feels like I'm right
I'm feeling alright

Light up
No, blow it out
Neurotic
The flower burns
Sinking
Down to the bone
And you lye, lye, lye
Decompose
Decompose

Cut down to size
Paralyzed
Low tide
Wait to rise

Light up
No, blow it out
Neurotic
The flower burns
Sinking
Down to the bone
And you lye, lye, lye
Decompose
Decompose

You lye, lye, lye
Until you decompose
Decompose
Decompose
Decompose

Light up
No, blow it out
Neurotic
The flower burns
Sinking
Down to the bone
And you lye, lye, lye
Decompose
