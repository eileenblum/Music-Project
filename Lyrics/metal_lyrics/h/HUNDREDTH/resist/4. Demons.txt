no one can save me from
my demons they're all around me, and they don't come from hell
every single one of them reminds me of myself.

the strongest are seared with scars
through their suffering,
they find out who they are

some may say i've lost my faith,
i just got up off my knees
stopped staring into the sky
and started looking inside of me.

i am not governed by anything but my consciousness.
bring forth from within, i am the only one who can save me from

my demons, they're all around me, they don't come from hell
every single one of them reminds me of myself.

we think about thinking
and feel about feeling
plaguing ourselves with perpetual anxiety

we live our lives acting
instead of just being.
egos rule our masked society

think about thinking
feel about feeling
live our lives acting
instead of just being

sovereign and independent
we've lost our innocence

so we waste our lives,
waiting for someone to save us from

our demons they are all around us, and they don't come from hell
every single one of them reminds us of ourselves.

we can't set ourselves free, by fighting them away
we turn inward, and our perception will change.
