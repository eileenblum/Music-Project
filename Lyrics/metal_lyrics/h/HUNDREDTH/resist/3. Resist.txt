Believing our fate is dictated
By that of which it was created
Leaves the human struggle unmediated.
Leaving destiny separated
Between the isolated and manipulated.

The human spirit deteriorated
By fear of being castigated
For refusing to bow to thrones predicated
By the falsely consecrated.

Under human rule we are dominated
The more indoctrinated, the more emaciated.

As we adopt blind faith,
We disregard thought and choose to obey.

The choice lies with the manipulated
Whether to be incarcerated or emancipated.
Power reinstated
To the people now back where it originated.
Rehabilitated.

All power eliminated.
All wealth circulated.
All thrones eradicated.
All humanity rehabilitated.

Embrace thought and never obey.
