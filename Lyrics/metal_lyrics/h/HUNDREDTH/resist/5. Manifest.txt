My ego lives in fear, it thrives on approval.
Mask blinding spirit, hiding the unknown.
Consciousness misled until the removal.
I'll never understand without letting go.
Afraid of silence and the truth it might tell.
Instead of facing my soul, I distract myself.
Illuminate each day, set free from the past.
I shed my body and manifest.

I am the one,
The one that I've been waiting for.
As I seek inward, I create the world.
You are the one,
We are the ones,
The ones that we've been waiting for.

I have to reach beyond illusion to find reality.
Ego and spirit are two separate things
And the world is not the problem,
The problem is me.
I shed my body and manifest.

I am the one,
The one that I've been waiting for.
As I seek inward, I create the world.
You are the one,
We are the ones,
The ones that we've been waiting for.

The ones that we've been waiting for.
The ones that we've been waiting for.
That we've been waiting for.

Fear is the foundation of my insecurities,
The root of my anger and hostility,
Of despair and agony.
I'll be a slave to my ego until I transform.

The end is the beginning.
