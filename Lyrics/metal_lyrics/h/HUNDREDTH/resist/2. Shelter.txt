Separation from everything.
You boarded up your mind
With whatever you could find.
You chose shelter over the storm
So you could still smile.
You thought hiding from the truth
Would be worthwhile.

I'd rather be awake and fight the misery.
I'll waste away if I stay asleep in my apathy.
I'm not satisfied, trapped in a lie
Locked inside, self-defiled
Mental Suicide

I see further and I feel more finely
And if that burden be the curse
With which I must walk the earth
It's a price worth paying.

Does the body rule the mind?
Or does the mind rule the body?

I think I finally know.
We have to fold something to make ends meet
We're backed into a corner
And forced to live on our knees.
They shun those who think
And silence those who speak.
But fuck authority,
Leaders make us weak.

Shelter your mind
For a little while
From the cold
Truth outside.

Evacuate.
