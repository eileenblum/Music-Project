[Taken from S. Brian Wilson, Waging Unconditional Peace 2/21/2009]

Yes, Iâm talking about a non-violent revolution of consciousness.
A consciousness that is able to understand
how weâre all inextricably connected to each other on this Earth,
and to the Earth itself.
And that if we violate those fundamental principles, we do so at our own peril.
Yes, we can continue to live in this delusion and the denials of reality
because itâs painful, itâs frightening.
Sometimes, itâs terrifying.
It's terrifying to face the truth.
So I ask each of you to search your hearts,
as to what your truth is,
for being a citizen of the Earth,
promoting justice as a foundation for peace.
Itâs not going to happen magically,
itâs not going to happen by relying on these political structures and institutions.
I think weâre going to have to wage peace in the most extraordinary ways
whether our government wants it or not.
Without a non-violent revolution of consciousness,
we will not survive as a civilization or as a planet.
We can choose to have peace if we want to pay the price.
And what more glorious goal than peace for all people?
...To build a new society, a society that understands
that we are not worth more, and they are not worth less.
And that we will be willing to pay the price and take the risks
to wage peace with all fellow and sister human beings.
