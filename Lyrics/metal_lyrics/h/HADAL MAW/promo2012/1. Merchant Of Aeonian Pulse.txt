The infinite stream of darkness flows
Foul depths hold the origin of deceit
Gestation of the black and vile
Bursting forth from the womb
Abortion of ill

Travel upon the skies of wrath
To mediate chaos from distant realms
Conquer the heights of boundless resist
Consume the flesh and blood

One thousand years
Among merchants of aeonian pulse
Now all have fallen before me
On your knees

Bringer of sanctum
Redeemer of hope
Feel the burning aura of rapture
Extinguish those of inferior soul

In the hands of the frail and weak
Your strength will surely slumber
Misled by the undying stench of hypocrisy

We are the cursed wolves of ire
We are the churning winds
Alone we shall rise
Towards infinity

Overbearing, this treaty of cold
Built into shrines of teeth and steel

One thousand years
Among merchants of aeonian pulse
Now all have fallen before me
On your knees
