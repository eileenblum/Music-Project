Waves of beckoning haunt my shores
Arising messiah, I loom
As a shadow I shall be
Cast out by the light of the flames from the dragon's mouth
I take of all that is

From beyond we speak in tongues
A curse of divine nature
Of centuries it hath grown
To merge all in its reach

Be not mortal, be not weak
Become an everlasting cage of revolt
Be immortal, free of thee

Take flight upon thy wings
Tears of the gods awaken you

Fall to ashes
Unbearable heat consumes you
Of what is existance without pain?
I hold darkness within
Barriers of malignant sin

In utterance, they speak your name

Abandoned one, be not mortal, be not weak
Become an everlasting cage of revolt

From beyond we speak in tongues
A curse of divine nature
Of centuries it hath grown
To merge all in its reach

As winds afar surround
Take flight upon thy wings
Tears of the gods awaken you

Waves of beckoning haunt my shores
Arising messiah, I loom
As a shadow I shall be
cast out by the light of the flames from the dragon's mouth

From beyond we speak in tongues
A curse of divine nature
Of centuries it hath grown
To merge all in its reach
