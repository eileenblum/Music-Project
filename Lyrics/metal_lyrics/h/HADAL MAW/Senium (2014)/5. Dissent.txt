Order has been lost
It disintegrates upon us all
Creating vast walls of inundation
Burying us below

Our final hour
Reaching terminus
A life altered
To cause unrest
Your demons speak to me
In language of torment
Those whom flee shall be caught
Force-fed dissent

All bow to thee
I am the great disposer
I command your fractured world
None shall be spared
None shall escape
Overruled from birth to senium

Desperately they recoil in war
Only to be left unanswered
Their cries remain paralyzed in dissidence

Control has been lost
Dissension ubiquitous

Destiny lies within rebellion
Defile the moral way
Repent against the word

Witness the fall of our declining world
Our nature reduced to ash

All bow to thee
I am the great disposer
I curse your fractured world
None shall be free
None shall be forgiven
Overruled from birth to senium
