Disinformation flows through rivers of sin
Overflowing with feculence
Drowning man insidiously
I search for the answers
For what I endure
Corruption of sanity
Sub-existence installed

Invisible eye
Searching for the mind
Risen from oceans black
Treasures of Mammon and pride
Opiate of the masses revealed
Servitude divine

Ghastly divisions of depravity now growing immense
Attempting to relinquish themselves of moral despair
Observing their sallowed existence
They lust with golden deceit
Souls dissolved in wealth

Invisible eye
Reaching for the sky
Summoning offerings of odium
Destined for the fire

The pestilence of man
The profit of ignorance
Tearing us under
Severing our hands

Hail our divine servitude
Enslaved in bitterness
We reap inequity and immoral resolve
There is no virtue here
