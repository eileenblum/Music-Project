Blood of the ages
Adorn us in holocaust
Thus finding true meaning in agony
Solely time's creator of destruction
I breathe unending oblivion

The earth, a spasm in ageless gloom
A temple of mass extinction
The throne empty and cold
Frozen in absence of power
No heir to commence infamy

Embodied in oceans of falsity
There is no sanctity in creed
Distorted visions intoxicate animation
Reducing man to a lower breed

Hear my words of disgust
I, among many, shall burn upon the altar of ire
Tempest coiled in blades of wrath
Their godless hands tremble in pain
Absolute desolation

Downwards, to the core I shall descend
Beneath sands that throats ingest
This stillness cold
Ripe with infection
It be the usher of the coming of murk

The discord that is mankind
An unhindered beast of gargantuan ways

Twilight of our coming darkness
Reveals my true name
Wrath was bound from within
Thy invoker of flame
Conflagration

Embodied in oceans of falsity
There is no sanctity in creed
Distorted visions intoxicate animation
Reducing man to a lower breed
