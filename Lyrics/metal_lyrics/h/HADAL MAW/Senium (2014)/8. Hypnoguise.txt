So distant
I have travelled so long
Obeying the calling of death
My own objection
It's forcing me out
Upon the waters unstill

To await extermination
To rot without will
Prayers spat in abeyance
From the bottomless void

The sun speaks red dawn again
Master of lies awakes in suit
Blind yet he walks
Calculated misuse
Hungering in mortality
Starving the weakest one
Preaching all infirmity
His wrath be surely done

A bastard child of his own creation
Left to linger and slowly deteriorate

Oceans spreading reach
Carving veins to the bird's eye
Thirst of a million leeches
Feeds the blood dry
Mountain upon which they stand
Built in hollow man's eyes
Turning vision aside
A legion spawns the hypnoguise

To await extermination
To rot without will
Prayers spat in abeyance
From the bottomless void
