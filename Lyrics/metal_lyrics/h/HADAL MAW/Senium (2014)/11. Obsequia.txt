Of discontent is your mind
Forever dividing and consuming
Null and void are your abilities to control
Methodical contradiction
You will renounce all that ails you

Spawning the tumor of existance
You will never concieve true equilibrium
Eternal upheavel
Finite supremacy
Obsequious reality

Swarm of utter locusts
Gorging on the bowels of thy dominion
Abomination of all kind
A constant derangement by native impulse

Never understanding
Always demanding
This entity is of a terminal nature

All inhabitants seek to amend only themselves
With judgement made by the hands of a few
We will bring this union to rupture

No intent on preserving
Only momentary relief
Thoughts beyond your own are non existant
You cannot govern this
