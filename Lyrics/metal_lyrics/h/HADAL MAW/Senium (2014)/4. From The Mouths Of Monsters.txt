Enter the pit of all hells
Become one with the fire
Kingdom of the blackened flames
Surrounding me

Vanquished is the light of hope
In shade lies greed and filth
Breeding fear through the mouths of monsters
Tongues of madness speak the word of disease

Take thy flames from within
Cast hate forth
Tread the path of the wretched
Let the fire of malice descend thee

As we fall into the abyss
of sacred myths we behold
Bereft of ourselves we stumble
Stagnant and writhing in filth

From the mouths of monsters, spewing forth misery
Among them all, haunted eternally

The scourge of the mighty
Reaping all horizons
Eclipsing the minds of fevered flesh
Open the jaws
Of fury so vast
Veering beyond the reaches of the eye

Abomination
Miscreation
The death of our existence
The burning woes of all

Among these plains of utmost suffering
Decrepit vultures shall gorge

Take thy flames from within
Cast hate forth
Tread the path of the wretched
Let the fire of malice descend thee

From the mouths of monsters, spewing forth misery
Among them all, haunted eternally

From the mouths of monsters
