Rid us of them
Those bound in chains that scorn
Oppressors of our chosen order;
the flourishing heart of life
Fooled by visions of their own

Despondant oracle
Upon whom hope is lost
All answers starved of truth
Vacant within
It was faith that kept them prisoners

My name is foreign to the exalted sons of man
Ruthlessly ruling the fate of the world

Awake from my origin
To breathe smoldering ashen swirl
Do you deny the progeny of your hate?
Hear my affliction
Speaking in horror storms
Evoking the snake
Do you wish to defy me?

Judas
Betrayer
The worm of the fruit
Go forth, spread your seed

My name is foreign to the exalted sons of man
Ruthlessly ruling the fate of the world

And so it unfurls, consternation eternal
An age of transgression
Been thrust upon us all

Aetas de morior

In quivering silence
In abandoned desire
We march toward our chosen annihilation
