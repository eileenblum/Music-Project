Await invalidity
Your expiration is inevitable
They are watching you
Your every move
Lusting for your demise

Behind the blinding veil
This earth tremors and sways
Our hands clawing at the dirt
Searching for what remains

In vast swarms of discontent
In flames we wither away
Offerings to our shining idols
Have adorned us since days became

Ascend this shell of misery
Break these shackles and chains
To travel beyond the mortal coil
To escape the pale of time

For so long I have endured
The abhorrence of this world
My soul, it casts out
Illuminates thee with rage

In mass storms of regret
In fear we fade away
The world you knew is now undone

Hollow
Void
Empty of life
Swallowed in murk
Behold dissonance

Behind the blinding veil
This earth tremors and sways
Our hands clawing at the dirt
Searching for what remains

Deliver us pain
In flames we wither away
Since days became
