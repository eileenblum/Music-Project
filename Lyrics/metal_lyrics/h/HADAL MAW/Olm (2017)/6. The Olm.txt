With cavernous guilt we possess, regress
'Til bones echo mere shadows of man
Pear shaped tones deliver heresy
Reside in a soulless skin
Evil which we deplored
Runs rampant in us all
Evil which we ignored
Frack a deeper hole
Confine truths of demise
Persist this short term excess
Blindly gorging ourselves
Obese beneath burning sky
Evil which we deplored
Now gravid in us all
Evil which we absorbed
Mammalian hearts of coal
Supplant this abysmal ark resign

Coerced beneath the dirt, there's no escape
A shining cage is still a cage after all
This plague ingrained
We bald apes shall not be saved
Our deaths pre ordained
Retreat from light, a church of dirt
The chosen now mere troglobites scrambling alone in our hole
Eden's fruit calcified
We giants fall
Humanity, rancid crops
Synthetic pesticides
Starving us all
