In this abusement park
Torpid crowds abound
A glut of first world swine, hoorah!
Usher in an era
Affluenza!
Bald apes, the great plague
Behold, God's vitriol
Every inch a worm
Status bought through hide and bone
A soul of excrement
Vapid proud, succumb
As the last Eden burns down, my son
Humanity undone
You'll chain leviathans
Parade your cruelty
A waste of DNA
Homoshamepians
Tape worms adorn this bowel earth
Banal clones amass
Bald apes, the great plague
Behold, God's vitriol
As we trawl a dying sea with genocidal lines
To feed a hopeless race of botched designs
Indentured servitude
Behind dead cow eyes
Dirt encrusted dreams sullen ones reign
Virus engulf us, the host shall decay
This husk of illusion
Shall wither away
In this mutated ark
Man, the leech, shall dine
Upon his weak, upon himself
Upon the lie
Plastic coasts on which to strand
Stroll to extinction
Hand in hand

This cancer culture
Bleed it out
Fresh carrion piles
Herald the vultures
