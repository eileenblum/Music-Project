Dined in gutters, I have worn disgust
Like no other, no one better
Armour of spite and lust turned sour

Scaffolding the flesh, all for a first world sow
You'll thrive in a shallow, shit filled pool
Flirting with your reflection
Don't we all feel married to martyrs?
Don't we all drag our own soul's anchors?
I am your burden leeched on the breast
Suckling on this modern time
Failed harvest, each apple rotten
Don't we all feel married to martyrs?
Don't we all drag our own soul's anchors?

Lampreys shall feed on the meek
Salivate, chew in the venom
Blisters form

As a species at home with our excess
Greed is our albatross around our necks

Real hell is in our backyards
It's everyday
Relish your existence, mundane
