Dust for all
Dirt bound no light
Finds soil
Root hairs of a lie

Shall take seed and choke
Take seed and choke
Same shit filled sty
Now twice what you can afford
It's a culture of eat what you can
Steal all you can hoard
Drunk on your own mythology
An age of ignorance
Eager, we crawl to the butcher's block
Morbid obsession
With romancing your end
A legacy of bottom feeders
Pain receptors misfiring
Shall take seed and choke, enablers
Shall take seed and choke, scavengers
Take seed and choke
Shake thee from apathy, logic is cold
Erase the charade, logic is cold
An entire life spent cultivating an illusion
Farm your lies
Farm your lies
