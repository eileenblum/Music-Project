You can't see the excrement through your sentiment
Malnourished remorseful when Eden rotted

Grand destroyers
We humans shall embody parasitic appetence
An artless age descends one stratagem
Extinction

Debates stalling
Made you more grotesque
More appalling

Snap portraits
Narcissism
Capsulate
Indifference to our annihilation

Spew forth
We organic iconoclasts
Farrowing deaths caste
Decimating mass defacers
Carbon based

Snap portraits, celebrate failed youth
Narcissism, meat cocooning an ego
Capsulate, knuckle dragger
Indifference to our annihilation

Accept nothing survives in this farce called life
No end to our condition
Feed, suffer, spread
Birth, feed, suffer, spread
Birth, feed, suffer, spread
