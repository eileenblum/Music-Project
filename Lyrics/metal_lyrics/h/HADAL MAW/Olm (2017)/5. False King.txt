Canned hunt vacation, taxidermitry eyes
Glass is empty, skull full of flies
Status bought flesh owed mount thy walls
Acquire more!
One more notch
One more bruise
Lost empty

Each piglet squealing, suckle me and swallow me
Bred only for the cull
Praise this unnatural growth

Squandered meat, life's just storing fat and seeking teat
Hail the false king
The whitest ape
Hail minted sinner
Plague incarnate
Invasive abomination
Lard, shit, sperm, sinew
Ire minds, souls of disease and detritus
We erode
Lard, shit, sperm, sinew
Impure to our core

Man is unspectacular, hope ebbs away
Practiced empathy, as empty as our brains
Bleed the sky, scar the landscape
Bleed the sky, scar the landscape
Embrace the flames, the whitest ape
