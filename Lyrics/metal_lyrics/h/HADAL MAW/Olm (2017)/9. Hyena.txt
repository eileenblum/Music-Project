Straw to break the camels back
A marathon of one step forward two back

Can you concede?
Can you compromise?

When you're full of every morsel
Diluted ill, designed
Will you stop? Too big to fail!

Can you concede?
Can you compromise?

A modest tomb amongst the strip mines
Too crazed with greed, hyenas shall feed
I'm pumping lead, I'm eating lard
Pigs to corral, lifespans to halve
