Death seeps through
A sea of inhumanity
Retreating over the horizon

Life is a bore
Tide out, man is the yawn

Biology addled chemically unsound mind

No goal except expanding toxic essence
All we crave is trivial reassurances
Scrolling camera rolls
The vitreous shadows of our vanity
Narcissus cloned
Blunt truth, bitter taste, clench your jaws
Bite down hard
From Triassic swamps, we belly crawled vulnerable
How far we have sunk
Hereditary hostility, moronic and armed
Circus of flesh
Absurdity of all beasts bound
A bleak arena
All our totems broken
Ecological dominance
We bipedal predators
Too proud to see our irrelevance
Achieve profit via pestilence
Line wallets fill tombs
Cull
