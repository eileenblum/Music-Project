Quantify your erections
Via dehorned rhinoceros
Justify the slaughter in praise of quasi-spiritual lust
Death merchants
Simian corrupt
Stockpile your larder
Reap what you sow
Primate husks
Gift wrapped extinction
Is all we know
Bleeding the clock

Now speed up subduction
Now the globe shall swallow us
Brilliant chimps, soul deficient
Atop their thrones of shit

Locusts swarm
Pale ravenous tribe
Vast hordes of failures
We apes aim low
Our serpent mask
Dead world hierophants corral their flock
I foresee the vulture reign
We fodder for carrion crows
Descend now to dine
Unravel in these hollow throes
Mark out the graves
So devolved
Our plight shall be a welcome demise
