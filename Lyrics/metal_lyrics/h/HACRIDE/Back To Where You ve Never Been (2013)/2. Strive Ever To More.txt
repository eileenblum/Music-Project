I'm stuck in here and cannot look around,
I'm doing time for your sake!
Trapper inside a cell I cannot move around,
Feeling so hollow...

You can lock me down,
But I'll live to tell the tale.
You can't control my fury,
For Nature will always take over!

The flame burns bright,
reach out for the strenght inside...
Find this impulse that makes you strive ever to more!

Trying to control me is fucking useless,
Cause I've got nothing to lose now!
Too many tears have been shed to go back now,
I'm not alone...
You cannot rule my realm!

Your world is on fire,
Consumed by deception we will never learn to (truly) make peace.
Man was born for treason.
Let rage take over my sanity!

Stop feeling out of place,
You can't draw a line between you and your family.
You are what you say you are,
And that's why you can't stop falling into negativity!
My sweet shelter of darkness...

The flame burns bright,
reach out for the strenght within...
Find this impulse that makes you strive ever to more!
