"I can clearly see now that there is no universal code of ethics,
The world that we created is falling apart and I can see through the lies."

Rising over the years of sorrow,
Nothing's like it used to be.

Corrupted by their crooked smiles,
Dragged down by force...
Give up all I want from you,
Edification of the fall!

One's failure too often makes the other's pride,
In a binary system of winners and losers...
There is no success,
There are no greater men,
They wanna watch you fail!
They need to watch you fail to exist!

"You can't buy Happiness,
No matter how hard they try to sell it to you..."

Free from the path that chose so long ago,
No longer serving...
Breaking the seal of destiny!

Corrupted by their crooked smiles,
Dragged down by force...
Give up all I want from you,
Edification of the fall!
