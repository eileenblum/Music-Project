All our promises have been erased by the weight of time,
And all the dreams we shared have been replaced by a numbing need to fit in!

This machine has destroyed my aspirations and it's eating me alive day after day...

Scarred by a society crawling under rules and regulations,
Respect the chain of command or get out of here!
There's no space left for the animal inside (of us) and our suffering is constant,
I wanna shake up their codes, but I mean nothing to them!

I don't belong here,
I'm not part of your fucking world!
You don't know who I am,
So don't patronize me!

I'm a passenger in their world,
And I've become a stranger to my own life...
