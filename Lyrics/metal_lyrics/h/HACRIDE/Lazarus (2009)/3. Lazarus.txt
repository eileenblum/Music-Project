I see this world as it is.
I can't help being afraid.
We are locked up in a virtual world.
I'm afraid of our civilization; seems to be war and destruction.
Power of men. Power of end.
Paranoia, fear of the outside world.
The vision of world is complex.
It follows the dictations.
Men and their system are only a part of this mechanism.
Paranoia, fear of the outside world.
Are we crazy enough to destroy it all?
We are removed from the real world.
I see this world as it is.
I can't help being afraid.
We are lucked up in a virtual world.
I'm afraid of our civilization; seems to be war and destruction.
This aggressive world.
A lot of things have changed around me.
The world seems to be more aggressive.
Nobody sees me, understands me.
Nobody understands me, people avoid me.
I think, it's me who has changed.
Power of men. Power of war.
Paranoia, fear of the outside world.
The vision of world is complex.
It follows the dictations.
Men and their system are only a part of this mechanism.
Paranoia, fear of the outside world.
Are we crazy enough to destroy it all?
The world around me makes me scarred.
