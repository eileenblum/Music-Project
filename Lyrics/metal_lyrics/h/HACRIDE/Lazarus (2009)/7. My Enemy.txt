I redefine my own rules and I'm driven by an animal drive.
I feel they were hostile towards me.
I avoid the other people.
All these contradictions make me want to kill.
I want the good and I see the evil.
I can't stay without saying.
Look in my eyes and see the strength of my fight.
Money and power destroys us.
No matter, all these rules are imposed on me.
Look in my eyes; the power of rage.
Many men die while others grow fat and take advantage.
I fight for my own cause.
Nothing will stop me.
I can't stay without saying; all those things make me want to kill.
I run away from the others.
I can't stay without saying; all these contradictions make me want to kill.
I run away from the others.
Nothing will stop me; I run away from the others.
I don't give a shit about those rules you try to impose on me.
You're my enemy. I'm my enemy.
All these contradictions make me want to kill.
I want the good and I see the evil.
I can't stay without saying.
Alone, facing my thoughts.
My dreams are disturbed.
Infinite vision. I cry.
Alone, facing my thoughts.
Alone, infinite vision.
My close relations are watching me.
Myself, save you.
