We are not the element which revolutionized life on Earth.
We have the conscience and we destroy ourselves.
We are in the same world and we destroy ourselves.

Mind the amoeba, mysterious and strong, it develops, divides into two, focused and eternal.
In the middle of the others my mask protects me but I begin to go crazy.
We are not the element.
Mind the amoeba, mysterious and strong, it develops, divides into two.

Being one of them, I need my mask to protect.
But my arm's getting weak; I feel it hard to hold.
I'm losing myself again.
I'm scarred. I'm fascinated.
Complex mechanism of life.
I'm scarred. I'm fascinated.

Man destroys himself. Insane. Insane.
Please mother give me the strength to carry on in this world of lies.
My failure would be their victory.
Don't let me get insane.
I am losing myself again.
Don't let me get insane.
Don't let me get insane.
Don't let me get insane.

We have the conscience and we destroy ourselves.
We are in the same world and we destroy ourselves.
