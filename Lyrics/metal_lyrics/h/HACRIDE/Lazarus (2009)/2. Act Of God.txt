You believe in this fake reality so you can go and destroy.
Men organize wars and slaughters.
But I will be in front of you.
Nothing can... Nothing can calm me.
You do not deserve to live.
Only your blood relieves me.
I know it's inside of you.
I know it's inside of me and death doesn't frighten me.
Each man has this survival instinct, inside of him.
I know it's inside of me and death doesn't frighten me.
You have to make your own choice.
You have to take on your decisions.
Are you afraid?
The human world is so violent.
It can't prevent the violence of men.
My liberty; my freedom is priceless.
Keep me, I don't think my actions make me act.
I feel worse.
You have to take on your decisions and their consequences.
Nature is more powerful than all these corrupt values in which you believe.
