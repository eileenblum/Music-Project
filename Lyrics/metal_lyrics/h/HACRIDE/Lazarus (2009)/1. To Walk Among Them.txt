I want to burst and to be free.
I went too far, I can't back down.
Growing up in a senseless world.
My spirit is lost.
People look at me like a special man.
You're my friend, you feel my despair.
You're my mother, your blood is flowing in my veins.
I confront people with my conviction.
I feel undesirable and misunderstood.
All those eyes stare at me and judge me without knowing me.
Are they afraid of me, are they afraid of my thoughts?
Are they afraid of me or frightened by my beliefs?
I live in this dark system.
Where the truth. Where the lies.
Lost in this senseless world, from which I try to escape.
I feel cast-off. I feel undesirable.
I'm lost in this senseless world.
I live in this senseless world.
I find my way.

"Stop your revenge. We are the same. We are all like you, we stay in front of you."

I find my way. I find the way.
I don't see the reality.
I transform it according to my feelings.
Would I be lost forever?
The human condition is my goal and its lies are my chains.
Come and set me free.
Set me free. [x4]
Save me.
You're my friend, you feel my despair.
You're my mother, your blood is flowing in my veins.
You're my friend, you stop my pain.
You're my brother, you know my scars.

I suffocate because of this environment.
I can't remove these masks, am I lost for all eternity?
This environment kills me.
I can't breathe anymore.
All those contradictions kill me and I put my fate into my human condition.
