[Bourreau]

Your bloody body, the evil which is eating away at you
Without sensation, you let yourself be persuaded, you fight to the bitter end

Your scars remind you of who you are
Motionless, you are attracted by the void, this sensation calms you
Leaving aside you, you can push back your limits
Do you feel you can contain this pain?

Your hate freezes your blood in your veins,
Time is stopping, the moment freezes

Forget your body, release sensation of death
Free your mind, you will know your limits
Your bloody body

A new life reveals to you

Your way
Your hate freezes your blood in your veins,
Lost your way
Time is stopping, the moment freezes

These pains remind, you are
