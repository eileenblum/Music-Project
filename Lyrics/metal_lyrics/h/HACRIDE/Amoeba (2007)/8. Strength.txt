[Bourreau]

You progress without stopping
You face your destiny to develop wisdom of the depths
Our strength

Your mystery exists
We are blind and deaf
And we believe that we know but your presence competes with life
Depths and abysses full of cells
The power that influences the world
To become imbued with your depht
You hang on to life
Your environment is your strength
Death don't exist

Depths and abysses full of cells
Our strength of will

Our strength of will
Strength, you hang on to life
