[Bourreau]

We're buried under man's hand, we've been digged up by our ancestors
Unaware of the depht of the human psyche

We feel bad, we don't feel our roots anymore
Nature hears us and we seem indifferent
This resonance inside of our person calls us

The horror of human nature stops us believing
Nothing is impossible
We are all monsters or we are all deaf faced to hate

Destroy our world vision
Explain this truth, this first experience

Vision

We have no control over ourselves
We have lost our mind
Stay humble in front the unknown

Destroy our world vision
Explain this truth, this first experience
