[Bourreau]

To be reborn again in the universal cycle

Our action resurrects life ingesting his decent offspring
My presence begets this life
Transformation
The putrefaction of the being living

To be reborn again in the universal cycle

Full of electrons I do relive elements
The dead is the start of my life
My role, the fragile equilibrium of this life
I let off of everything and cut and dried part of me
