[Grousset]

Look at my fight, feel my hate and my rage
Follow with your eye, and contemplate the ethics of the determination

A kind of self-mutilation condition which develops and demolishes you
Some people are jealous of it, others use it, I see it, like my guide

Look at my fight, feel my hate and my rage
Follow with your eye, and contemplate the ethics of the determination

I walk, all my flesh follows this fluid which leaves my spirit away
To freedom and quiet towards your own artificial light
You are the architect of your own fate, your own destiny
You lead it or you destroy it
Impregnate you, what nature has made of you

This is my god, my way of the cross, this is my religion
This is my vision, this is the secret of my freedom and peace

Look at my fight, feel my hate and my rage
Follow with your eye, and contemplate the ethics of the determination
This is my god, my way of the cross, this is my religion
This is my vision, this is the secret of my freedom and peace

Look at my fight, feel my hate and my rage
Follow with your eye, and contemplate the ethics of the determination
