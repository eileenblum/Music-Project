[Bourreau]

Experience of life after recovering from one's fright
You have found your nobility of soul

To go from one extreme, you're afraid

This size, gazing into infinity to make a leap into the unknown
Here it's answer, our question
Our fear, our panic in our deepest being

You're afraid

Fear lent our wings to be scared stiff at the idea of doing a leap into the unknown

You're afraid of vision of height

Afraid, to go from one extreme, of height, to the other
Afraid, fear lent our wings, of height, our fear, our panic
Afraid

Experience of life after recovering from one's fright
You have found your nobility of soul

Fear lent our wings

You're afraid of vision of height
Afraid, to go from one extreme, of height to the other
Afraid, fear lent our wings, of height, our fear, our panic
Afraid
