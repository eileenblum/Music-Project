We are here
We are breathing with the evening mist
We are here
And darkness is spreading her wings
In the passion of love
We call our hidden dreams
In the passion of love
Tempting to be realized
We are here, we are breathing...
We are here, united we stand
And for us darkness
Is spreading her wings
And for us
The magic of pleasure is working
With the burning senses
Fire is devouring our hearts
And our soul responding
Stories which will never end
Night is holding us in her arms
Moon is shining only for us
In the passion of love
We call our hidden desires
Before the end of the night
Touch me once more
I will sing a song of love
Which will never end
