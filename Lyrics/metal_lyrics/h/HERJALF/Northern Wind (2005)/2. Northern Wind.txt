Northern Wind from Mountain of Doom
Came to this world ages ago
Born of the roots, oaken old roots
To make man's heart grow strong
Viking boats have gone
Against the whole world
Towards the unknown grounds
Northern Wind was watching their victory
Has set their paths
Northern Wind was carrying a smell of death
And praised the heroes
Northern Wind returned to fatherland
When the end has come
Northern Wind is dreaming under the veil of frost
Northern Wind shall return within thousand years
