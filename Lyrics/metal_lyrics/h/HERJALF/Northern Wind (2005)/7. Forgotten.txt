Pages of old books
Blew out forever
Lost like their secrets...
Forgotten God,
Forgotten hero
Forgotten song
Of the greatest artist
Like the dust
All of them have disappeared
From the remembrance...
Nobody hears the callind of
Their lost soulds
When they are asking for honour
As if their presence
Doesn't mean anything...
Eternal circle of history
Is a chance for memories
Of great affairs
Blew out forever
Today's new God
Today's new hero
Will sing a poem
Of the greatest artist
