Floating within the clouds
...Flight towards the fate...
Imagination follows its way
As the river of ancient tales
The land of colours - so many colours
In a web of crystal tears...
Judgement's bell is very close
That's flight towards the fate...
Crying eyes of conciousness
Wings of dreams making the path in space...
Beyond mountains and woods
River of ancient tales
It's just an illusion
