Solitude was calling him
He came to meet it
Was standing face to face
With the judge of his own soul
That was the time of punishment
For the desires
For the pain of the defeated
For betrayal of the faithful
For spoiled blood
For the honour, which was given away
And for the cry of innocent
It was that time!
Crying sould has been getting silent
When the power became stronger
And betrayal was so glorious
Solitude will cover him
He will be closed in the mansion of darkness
And, for the moment of peace
It will leave only scary memories...
