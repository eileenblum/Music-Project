Sacrifice at the temple
Sanctuary of the wise
Hail to the virgin oracle
She's the priestess of Delphi

Vapors rise as she gazes through
Bleeding eyes
Omens wise slip from her lips of your
Demise

Breathing fumes from the cracked stone
Hallucinating at her shrine
Seated high on her gold throne
She's the vessel divine

Vapors rise as she gazes through
Bleeding eyes
Omens wise slip from her lips of your
Demise

I hear the voiceless and the slain
Blood falls around you like the rain

I hear the voiceless and the slain
I feel the never-ending pain
