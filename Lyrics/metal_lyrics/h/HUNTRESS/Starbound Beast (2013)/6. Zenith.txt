Blazing horizons
Burning the sky
Can't hold me back from the bull's eye

Yearning for heaven
Bursting the gloom
I'll vaporize this earthly tomb

Riding lines that slice the night
and fill the celestial bowl
Roll a sphere of stars about my soul

Zenith
Blaze the sky
Zenith
High

Seizing the cosmos
With beings of light
We'll smoke the galaxies tonight

Soaring on a constellation
Through the northern sky
Vertical forever, we can't die
We can't die
Stay high

Zenith
Blaze the sky
Zenith
High
Zenith
Never die
Zenith
High

Zenith stay high
Burn free or die
