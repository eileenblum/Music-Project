Inside your mind exists the secret masterplan
Fear feeds and keeps you here, the shadow of a man

Destroy your life
Destroy your life

Living in memories of future victories
There's only one cure for the soul stealing disease

Destroy your life
Destroy your life

Burnt and lost, at your cost
Shallow graves are made for slaves
We await your escape
Keep your goals away from trolls

Three things to fear at home are fire, thieves and ghosts
Abandon all you own and burn the whipping post

The gates are rusted but the entrance yields a path
To freedom from yourself and deep self-loathing wrath

Destroy your life
Destroy your life

Burnt and lost, at your cost
Shallow graves are made for slaves
We await your escape
Keep your goals away from trolls

Nothing really matters
Nothing stays the same
