I am the huntress, but also the prey
Sometimes I find pleasure the old fashioned way
If you want a woman, don't come to me
I'm more than just woman as you will agree

When the mood sways me, I find myself weak
Always a victim of the pleasure I seek
All of the lust held up in my breast
Come closer lover, let me suck your breath

I want to fuck you to death

I am the huntress, I'm on your trail
When I want you here you'd better not fail

Come to me quickly, 'cos I want to feel
I want to be handled, I want to reveal
All of the lust held up in my breast
Come closer lover, let me suck your breath

I want to fuck you to death
I want to fuck you to death

I've got a thirst, been waiting some time
While I'll never be yours, you'll always be mine
All of the lust held up in my breast
Come closer lover, let me suck your breath

I want to fuck you to death
I want to fuck you to death
