Secrets we keep 'til death
I promise you, I swear to you
Burn out 'til nothing's left
You know the truth, it's all for you

Hiding the things we do
Torture me, I won't confess
We took an oath for life
My little murderess

Carving my name on your arm
I won't keep you safe from harm

Running away, laughing at the broken past
Open your mouth girl, this kiss is gonna last

Blood sisters forever
Blood sisters

Falling asleep in cars
The morning light, destroys the night
Freedom is paved with scars
We live in gray, not black and white

Famous and living free
On TV screens and radio
Sirens will soon foresee
The encore of our show

Cutting your long jet black hair
I'll hold it tight on the death chair

Running away, laughing at the broken past
Open your mouth girl, this kiss is gonna last
Running away, never look back
Swear on your last breath,
Out love is gonna last

Blood sisters forever
Blood sisters
