Feeding on the roots of lifeless trees
and centipedes
Crawling deep beneath on bleeding
knees with silent greed
Doomed to suffer this life alone
Lusting for the sky, the stars at night,
My crystal throne

Gods please have mercy
My soul is yours
Starbound to seize my destiny
One with the stars forever more

Journey to the highest mountain peak,
though I am weak
Marching insects at my command
swiftly expand
Black wet ice cliffs can't stop me
I've got claws for days to climb my way
to victory

Gods please have mercy
My soul is yours
Starbound to seize my destiny
One with the stars forever more
