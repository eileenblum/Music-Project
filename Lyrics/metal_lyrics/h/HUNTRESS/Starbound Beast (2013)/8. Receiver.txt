Lazers slice your mind
Thoughts unwind
A blank page for your master

Falling into trance
The beams advance
Your eyes roll white, your heart
Bleeding faster

You're the receiver
Born with a fever
The messages inside your head
Ain't from the dead

Words slip from your tongue
Shocked and stung
Baptised in radiation

Visions rape your skull
Back to Krull
Abandon all gravitation

You're the receiver
Burning brain fever
The messages inside your head
Ain't from the dead
