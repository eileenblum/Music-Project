Breathing colored lights
In the corners of the night
Lost in time

Spirits won't let go
of desires they all know
Won't let go

The life they've known before
On the earth climbing to feelings
Between dimensions
In a realm with crystal ceilings

Pictures of long ago
Flash along the ether spine
Static line

Bodies decompose
and the grief always ends
All transcends

The life they've known before
On the earth clinging to feelings
Between dimensions
In a realm with crystal ceilings
You're not breathing

Spectra spectral
Spectra spectral
Surrender to the afterlife
Spectra spectral
Spectra spectral
Surrender to the afterlife
