Danger runs all through my blood, oh yeah
Trouble owns all my bones, yeah, got it bad
Ooo, canât you see the fire lives in me?

Gonna mainline rage into your veins
Iâm gonna give you a lethal dose of pain

Come on and get it
Scorching the night
Ooo, you wanna get lit? Yeah!

Burning for your black art
In flames forever higher
Iâve got the fire in my heart

Be forewarned of the blaze that lays with me
Raising hell to get off, yeah, Iâm in heat
Ooo, canât you feel the fire deep in me?

Overdose with ghost who haunts your dreams
Suffocate in the warmth of eternity

Walk with the witches
Blazing the night
Ooo, smoke out those bitches, yeah!

Burning for your black art
In flames forever higher
Iâve got the fire in my heart

Burning for your black art
In flames forever higher
Iâve got the fire in my heart

Burn, burn, burn, burn
Oh yeah, fire!

Burning for your black art
In flames forever higher
Iâve got the fire in my heart

Burning for your black art
In flames forever higher
Iâve got the Fire In My Heart

Fire, fire, fire in my heart
Fire, fire, fire in my heart
