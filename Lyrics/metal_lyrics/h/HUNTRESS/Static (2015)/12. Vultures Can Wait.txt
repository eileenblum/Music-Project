[7â Vinyl Bonus Track]The desert knows my Diablo and the sorcery I hide
I speak in tongues, sand fills my lungs tonight the spirit rides

Walking through diamond doors to meet the dead, feed your head

Vultures can wait
Vultures can wait

Horizon breaks, follow the snakes they will lead you to the smoke
The Devilâs Weed, she makes you eat her pride until you choke

Facing the fear behind the veils of fate, make them wait

Vultures can wait
Vultures can wait

Do you want to live forever?

Vultures can wait
Vultures can wait
