[Bonus Track]Tear it up, yeah, unleash the night
You gotta lose the light, you gotta give away your sin

Set it off, yeah, run it down
Ignite this lonely town, the ashes riding on the wind

Seek out the Master Hunter, heâs never hard to find
Hunt down the dark elixir and give away your mind

Black Tongue
Show me your darker side
Black Tongue, Black Tongue, Black Tongue

Black it out, soul suicide
Live fast, but donât you hide, the darkness never says you sinned

Seek out the Master Hunter, heâs never hard to find
Hunt down the dark elixir and give away your mind

Black Tongue
Show me your darker side
Black Tongue, Black Tongue, Black Tongue

Hunting for black fire
Burning up the light

Seek out the Master Hunter, heâs never hard to find
Hunt down the dark elixir and give away your mind

Black Tongue
Black Tongue, Black Tongue, Black Tongue

Black Tongue
Show me your darker side
Black Tongue, Black Tongue, Black Tongue
