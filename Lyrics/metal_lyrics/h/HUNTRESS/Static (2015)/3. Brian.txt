Brian finds me
Brings me stars captured in glass
Coins of silver

Forceful savior
Saint of protection for later
Awkward wizard

Your visions
Zap messages through your hair
Keep me in your prayers

Brian
Obsession leads you to me
I want you to hang around
Something lost has been found

Watching colors
Float in the corners of the past
Counting memories

Thereâs a sadness
I feel deep within your madness
We share the torture

Your visions
Zap messages through your hair
Keep me in your prayers

Brian
Obsession leads you to me
I want you to hang around
Something lost has been found

You appear and never warn
Like a strange and golden storm
Pockets filled with gifts for me

All the crystals from Brazil
Birds of prey on windows sills
In the places I see in my dreams

Your visions
Zap messages through your hair
Keep me in your prayers

Brian
Obsession leads you to me
I want you to hang around
Something lost has been found

Brianâ¦obsession leads you to me
Brianâ¦donât you ever leave me
