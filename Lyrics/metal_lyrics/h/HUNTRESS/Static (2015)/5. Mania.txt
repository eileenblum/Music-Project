I canât remember what happened last night
Canât the light, last forever
What happened last night

If you ever spent a night in my head
By the morning youâd be dead
Itâs getting harder every time to pretend
Iâm getting harder to defend

I lose control, she takes hold
My spine distorts, the face youâve known morphs
Violence comes next, I see red
I tried to stay sane for ya, but Iâm ruled by Mania

I wake up feeling that this will be the day
All my addictions fade away
It never lasts, I will find an excuse
This Crone inside me rules

I lose control, she takes hold
My spine distorts, the face youâve known morphs
Violence comes next, I see red
I tried to stay sane for ya
But Iâm ruled by Mania

I lose control, I lose control
She takes hold, I lose control

I canât remember
What happened last night
Canât the light, last forever

I lose control, she takes hold
My spine distorts, the face youâve known morphs
Violence comes next, I see red
I tried to stay sane for ya
But Iâm ruled by Mania

Violence comes next, I see red
I tried to stay sane for ya
But Iâm ruled by Mania
