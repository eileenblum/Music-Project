Nightmares don't trouble me
I wear them on my sleeve like a wet stain
Re skies in the morning signals my final warning
Predicting your pain

Hey!
I'm not the same
I'm in lust
Feel me bust

Hunt you like a wild beast
Turn you out for my release
Craving your flesh

What I'd give to watch you cry
Sister, I ain't gonna lie
Unless it's on your flesh

Watching you walk alone
I call you on the phone
Heavy breathing

Night covers me
It's all clear
I want your fear

Hunt you like a wild beast
Turn you out for my release
Craving your flesh

What I'd give to watch you cry
Sister, I ain't gonna lie
Unless it's on your flesh

You on my shelf
I can't control myself

Fall to your knees
Crawl to me

What makes me want you bad?
Well, I can't stop craving your flesh

Hunt you like a wild beast
Turn you out for my release
I'm coming craving your flesh

What I'd give to watch you cry
Sister, I ain't gonna lie
Unless it's on your flesh
Your flesh
On your flesh
