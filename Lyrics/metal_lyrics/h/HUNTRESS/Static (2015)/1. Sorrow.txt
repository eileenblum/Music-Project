Iâm high all the time
To keep you off my fading mind
And days slip away
Canât keep my head or thoughts straight

Racing to death
My life is spent
Bury me

Forever Iâm your slave
Chained to the wet lawn of your grave

Sorrow
Canât let go
Iâm done with getting old
All I got is breath to hold

My hate fuels the pain
I get trashed to fuck my brain
Thoughts breed regret
The future is my only threat

Sorrow
Canât let go
Sorrow
Canât let go
Iâm done with getting old
All I got is breath to hold

Take me away from all this death

Lost in fading summer
Iâve become such a bummer
Like a suicide letter
This shit canât get any better

Life really sucks
Someone please shut up

Give me decay
Take me away
Bury me

Forever Iâm your slave
Chained to the wet lawn of your grave

Sorrow
Canât let go
Sorrow
Canât let go
Iâm done with getting old
All I got is breath to hold
