Strange things are happening
Confused by the unknown
Like science fiction in a dead zone

Machine disease
Low frequencies
You cannot hide
It crawls inside your ears
Feeding on your mind

White noise is all you hear
When you close your eyes to sleep
Dreams of electric beasts, harsh tweak

Electro fields
Magnetic shields
Shock therapy
The sirens scream, panic
Takes over the streets

Static the sickness no one ever survives

Brain dead humanity
Zombies of the noise
Blank generation destroys

Canât get no help, no fix
Drugs no longer work
Lost in a maze where life and death blur

Machine disease
Low frequencies
You cannot hide
It crawls inside your ears
Draining all your mind

Static the sickness no one ever survives
Evil within electric
Static comes for your lives
