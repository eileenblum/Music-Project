I have dreams of what I used to be
Lifetimes fail and fall
I always leave them all behind

Iâm in pain but I hurt you worse
Save yourself from me, stop the torture and deceit

Since the day I was born, I transform

Iâm packing it up
I want to wanna wake up
Bound to the trouble that Iâve made
I want to wanna wake up
I canât get away

Years drift by and I forget
How to play the game
I will find another name

No regrets, I want revenge on my head

Iâm packing it up
I want to wanna wake up
Bound to the trouble that Iâve made
I want to wanna wake up
I canât get away

Shaft-shifting life away
Mutations and the sadness turning brings
I want to wanna wake up

Iâm in pain but I hurt you worse
Save yourself from me, end the torture finally

Since the day I was born, I transform

Iâm packing it up
I want to wanna wake up
Bound to the trouble that Iâve made
I want to wanna wake up
I canât get away

Shaft-shifting life away
Mutations and the sadness turning brings
I want to wanna wake up
