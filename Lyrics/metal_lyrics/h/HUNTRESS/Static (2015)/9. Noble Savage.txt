I am free
As free as natureâs first made man

There are no laws
Where the fierce and untamed ran

I see God in the clouds, hear him in the wind

Noble Savage
Defender of the wildlands
Weapons in hand

Le Bon Sauvage
DÃ©fenseur des terres sauvages
Armes Ã  la main

I am free
My heart beats for victory

True âtil my death
Protecting all who run with me

I see God in the clouds, hear him in the wind

Noble Savage
Defender of the wildlands
Weapons in hand

Le Bon Sauvage
DÃ©fenseur des terres sauvages
Armes Ã  la main

I live alone for my desires
In the forest, in the streams
I live alone for my desires, free

I see God in the clouds, hear him in the wind

Noble Savage
Defender of the wildlands
Weapons in hand

Le Bon Sauvage
DÃ©fenseur des terres sauvages
Armes Ã  la main

I live alone for my desires
In the forest, in the streams
I live alone for my desire, free
