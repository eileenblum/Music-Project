Come Adriel
Toll the bell
Death angel

Come hell awaits
Open the gates
Lose your faith

The horsemen ride tonight

Dieâ¦ the fifth season arrives
Dieâ¦ the reaper's by your side
All life drains from your eyes
Senicide

Look what you've done
What you've become
Nothing won

Quick here comes death
Take your last breath
You are spent

The horsemen ride tonight

Dieâ¦ the fifth season arrives
Dieâ¦ the reaper's by your side
All life drains from your eyes
Senicide

You try to hide, you try to run
But you'll be slipping in your blood
All those prayers you thought would save
Will be buried in your grave

Dieâ¦ the fifth season arrives
Dieâ¦ the reaper's by your side
All life drains from your eyes
Senicide
