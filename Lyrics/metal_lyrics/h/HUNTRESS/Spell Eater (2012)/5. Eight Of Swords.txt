Eight swords form a cage
The sky is grey
I'm tied and I am blind
There is no escape

The cards will tell the truth
The laws of motion rule

Eight of swords
Trouble or trick
Kill the heretic!
Eight of swords
Devil's cards of sin
Let the witches in

My clothes are wet and torn
I stand in waste
These blades can set me free
The fear keeps me enslaved

Eight swords form a cage
The sky is gray
I'm tied and I am blind
I don't want to escape

The cards will tell the truth
The laws of motion rule

Eight of swords
Trouble or trick
Kill the heretic
Eight of swords
Devil's cards of sin
Let the witches in

These swords don't protect you
They bind you
more!

Eight of swords
She said choose two
Only one will do
Let the witches in
