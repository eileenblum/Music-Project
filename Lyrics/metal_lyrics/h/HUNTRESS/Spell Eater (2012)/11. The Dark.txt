You think I'm dead and lost
To everyone we know
But you'll see friends smiling
When they slit your throat
You'll bleed, at my knees
Torture ain't enough
Death rings when darkness comes
Your time is up

Shadows fear the dark
Your time is up

I'll get my thrills and justice will
Come hard tonight
This is your end, feel my revenge
Nothing to fight
Last breath, this is death
Hell awaits your soul
No one cares that you're gone
Let the good times roll

The dark, the dark
The darkness falls on you
The dark, the dark
The darkness swallows you

Black, covers me
Nacht, verborgen

The dark, the dark
The darkness falls on you
The dark, the dark
The darkness swallows you

Shadows fear the dark
Your time is up
