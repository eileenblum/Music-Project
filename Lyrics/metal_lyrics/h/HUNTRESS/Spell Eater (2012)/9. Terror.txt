Terror
No one stays alive
I execute at noon
You fail, meet your doom
Terror

You! Lock the doors
Hit the floors, this is war
You will never get out
You! Lock the doors

Terror
Nowhere to run or hide
Your screams never die
Memories last for life
Terror

Blood spills in the hallways
Cries for help
Look at me, see my face, die
School is out forever
Terror

Terror
No one left alive
I've planned my escape
Burn it down, run away
Terror

Burn! Fires blaze
Sirens wail, you have failed
You will never get out
Burn! Fires blaze

Blood spills in the hallways
Cries for help
Look at me, see my face, die
School is out forever
Terror
