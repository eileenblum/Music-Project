You have died many times
Beside the fire and upon the sea
Tonight the fates keep you safe
In the arms of the snow witch

Your ship wrecked on ice cliffs
Violent waters of green
To the valkyries you're unseen

Spells shroud the darkness of your soul

Dark arctic night together
Her spells heal your wounds
Flesh to flesh under the moon

Glory waits in the halls of Valhalla

Now you're strong, crux and ship
You want to take her to distant shores
Make her your wife in this life
But the snow witch can't be yours

The snow witch sigh
Turns her face from northern lights
Alone she cries
Your ship roars into lonely nights

No words
Silence is broken
Shifting sails
Sad songs of whales
