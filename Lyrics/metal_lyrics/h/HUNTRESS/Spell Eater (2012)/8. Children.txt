That man is bad
He put your mother in the lake
Don't wait, leave now
Children run away

Beware the hunter's blade
Don't wait, go now
You should be afraid

Run children run
The path is dark, but don't look back
Don't look back
Stars burn the curtain of black
Don't sleep, don't wait
Run

The river at night
Keeps you safe from the hunter's grasp
Beware, he rides
Near the shore's tall grass

If you knew the things he's done
Left hand is hate
Father's become Cain

Run children run
The path is dark, but don't look back
Don't look back
Stars burn the curtain of black
Don't sleep, don't wait
Run
