Dark forces draw strength at night
Depleted in the light
Secret sight

What's hidden behind the veils
Unseen worlds
Sleep and death, waking death

You'll burn this is the first step
Stripped til nothing's left
Feel all the pain that you've prolonged
You'll relive all your wrongs

Don't stop breathing
Dreamless tonight
Astral bodies take flight

All that you know now
You must lay it to rest
Sacred realms that await you
Sleep and death
All you were before
Will be your once again
Sleep and death

Flames take you, don't fear, accept
Your rebirth into light
Spirit sight

You'll fall into a new womb
Ripped out of the tomb
Feel air fill your infant lungs
Taste blood on your tongue

Pain is fleeting
Perfect tonight
Spirit bodies take flight

All that you know now
You must lay it to rest
Sacred realms that await you
Sleep and death
All you were before
Will be your once again
And again, and again, and again
Sleep and death

Science of the supersensible

That's the place
The place
Deep space
That's the place
