Call the name of the one
Call her name, Aradia
Call her name
The murderess
Heathen born to bring the storm

Call the names of the false
Father, son, Maria
Spill blood
Our sorceress
Death will spread in roman beds

Sorcery revealed to those who seek, Aradia

Give yourself to the one
Worship her, Aradia
Pagan queen
Strega
Midnight rings and murder sings

Sorcery revealed to those who seek, Aradia
Our saviour

Summon the banshees tonight
Writhing until we ignite
Screaming in tongues, secret speech
Enemies hang in the trees

Aradia, our saviour
