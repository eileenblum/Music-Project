The goat god knows
Where the fool goes
To the place
He helped create

Above sharp rocks
He unlocks
The wicked power
Of the tower

Misfortune rains
On cold black waves
Souls are devoured

Where jackals breed
Along a violent sea
Stands the tower

The fool will shout
Thunderbolts out
Crowns fall fast
The spell is cast

Twice lightning strike
Twenty-two flames
Blaze in the darkness

False are the ways
Of those who've stayed
Inside the tower

Fall to your end
Mars descends
The thirteenth hour

Death to the fool
Only truth
Destroys the tower

False to the core
Science of war
Ten spheres, one path
Fall to your end, drop dead
Fall to your end

Twice lightning strikes
Twenty-two flames
Blaze in the darkness

False are the ways
Of those who've stayed
Inside the tower

Fall to your end
Mars descends
The thirteenth hour

Death to the fool
Only truth
Destroys the tower

Fall to your end
Fall to your end
