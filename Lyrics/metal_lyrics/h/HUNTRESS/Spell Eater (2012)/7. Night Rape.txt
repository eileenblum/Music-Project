Sleepers and dreamers
No you're not safe

White noise, black horns
Static in the air
Faceless creature
High on despair

Between the very dead of night
And the morning light
Upon electric waves you ride

Come lay upon me
Take me asleep
Demonology
Night rape

Can't scream, can't breathe
Will this ever end?
Demon disguised
I'm paralyzed

Between the very dead of night
And the morning light
Upon electric waves you ride

Come lay upon me
Take me asleep
Demonology
Night rape

Sleepers and dreamers
No you're not safe
