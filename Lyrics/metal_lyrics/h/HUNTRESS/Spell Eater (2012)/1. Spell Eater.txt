Spells seize my mind
Tied to the shrine
Forever

Spells feed this secret life
Obey the rite
Forever

Apothecary
Poison me
Feed me

Spells eat my head
Bound, spread and bled
Forever

Mandrake and henbane
In my veins
Bleed me

Reveal your scroll
Come feed my starving mouth and soul

I can't stop, spell eater
I am the spell eater

Hallucination
Alchemy
Deathly

Come visualize
The horned god laying by your side

I can't stop, spell eater
I am the spell eater
I can't stop, spell eater
I am the spell eater
