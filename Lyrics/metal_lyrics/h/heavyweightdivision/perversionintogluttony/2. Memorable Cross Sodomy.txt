He's the one who uses body parts up decorations in his house
God, word your hope secures the weight of religion you endure
Yes, he's everywhere, daddy's watching you son
He's the one who's taking care of your children
Yes, he's everywhere, daddy's watching you son
The Pope keeps molesting to keep the economies

I've heard about you and I've read about you
Media attention is not enough to create your extinction

This is just amazing
Burning love
Set a fire
(Do it; Do it good)
Almost anything can take
(Do it; Do it good)
The role of a sex toy
(Do it; Do it good)
Eternal begging for this
(Do it; Do it good)
Memorable cross sodomy
Breathe the satisfaction
Nothing is real

Find a happy place, find a happy place
You will never find anyone else who could possibly be interested in you
Happy happy, joy joy
You will never find anyone else who could possibly love you
Overused stupid sex product
The system possesses absolute control
Overused stupid sex product
You're not really alive

Forever in your heart
Ignorance leads to ignorance
Oh mother, let me be the one

Amen
