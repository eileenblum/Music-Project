I was left helpless in the storm of hate
Real interactions are unavailable
Feeding the masses with the devil's bloody playthings
I'm nobody, life is a fallacy
God set fire all around me, I set you all ablaze

Consume; Consume; Consume
I want some more
Consume; Consume; Consume
You want some more

Perversion into gluttony
Nobody enriched your derisive existence
Reality is embellished to fit in with this consumer ideology
Dead meat and tasty gravy
I want some more
Good money and sexy lady
I want some more
If this world is built to last we're here to change that
We are the unstoppable useless hungry pigs
Our skin's a costume made of waste

If this world is built to last we came here to change that
