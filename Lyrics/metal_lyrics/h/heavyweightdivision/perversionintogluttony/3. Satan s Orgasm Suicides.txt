Don't worry I'm not surprised you don't know how to spell loser
Congratulations your ignorance is now legendary

Submerging interruption of the body's absorption of oxygen

I left the world in disgrace without a suicide note
Inescapable disorder, I let the ship sink
There is no hope at all my friends
This corridor will never end
Be creative and imagine this low tech killing scenario
What am I suppose to say?
(Satan)
Page one, the absurdity of reality into illusions
(Orgasm)
Weakness and more on page two
These are the dying words of your infamous son
(Suicide)
Nostalgia's all I need to keep my conscience clean
Repugnant towns fit so well in this disgusting world
Confusion and contradiction
Hey kids!
If your dad is far away bridge the distance by sending him your suicide note
