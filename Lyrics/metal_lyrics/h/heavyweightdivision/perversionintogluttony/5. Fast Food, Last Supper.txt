Just free yourself of complication
Imagine your death in every room of that house
Enjoying life, beauty?
We exist to eat and procreate like every other species
Unable to read a book or sign your name
Keep buying unnecessary products from multinationals

For a moment that makes sense

Strict birth control
Drug companies destroy people's health while the governments spreading
AIDS
Accept it

Who give a fuck about your New Year's resolution?
I'm thinking about myself, centering everything me
Advanced acknowledgement
We are comfortably brainwashed
Trapped in an over-consumption rich nation
What you commonly see is not the best that could be made
Peace; Love; Equality; Freedom is pure science fictional shit
Banking overlords
Self-obsession
Powerful leaders subjugating the poor and keeping them dependent
Oh God
Is there a better life out there that we can escape to?

Just free yourself of complication
Imagine your death in every room of that house
Enjoying life beauty?
We exist to eat and procreate

The "Universal declaration of human rights" is nothing but a hilarious joke
And if you think that we want to live here you're fucking wrong
And Jesus won't share that food with you anymore.
