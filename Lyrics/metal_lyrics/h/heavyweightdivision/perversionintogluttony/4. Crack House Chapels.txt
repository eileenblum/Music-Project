Welcome to my quest to get a larger television
I only find joy in acquiring new toys
Repetition after repetition

Re-killed some stupid public character for another fake narrative
Controlling
Dominating
Repeat and start again

We are the "never satisfied" fueled by our materialistic egocentric desire
Funeral homes
Morgues and crack house chapels
Inhale the injustice
Entertainment, distraction and enslaving humanity

Re-killed some stupid public characters for another fake narrative
Controlling
Dominating

Another useless celebration
Another impossible explanation

Read my lips
This is the meaningless vision of a hopeless nation

Duct tape
Creamy dildo
Burning candles
And romantic gifts
(Fuck)

I swear by my life
The first thing I do every morning is turn on my computer to find out if anyone has died
Feel the never rending romance
