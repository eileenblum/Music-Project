The cat moves like a shadow flash
He's on the hunt won't you come and see
His crawl will tear you apart
He's on the loose he's gonna blow you away

So what mighty cat will strike and pay
So what, mighty cat will strike and pay

He's in your back alley
Go fast, lock your door
The last fall for your days
So watch out or he'll make you pay

So what mighty cat will strike and pay
So what, mighty cat will strike and pay

You try to slow down and he will justify
You try to slow down and cat will die

You try to slow down and he will justify
You try to slow down and cat will die
You try to slow down catstrike
