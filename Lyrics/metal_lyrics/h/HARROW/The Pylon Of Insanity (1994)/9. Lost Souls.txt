Your head is turning, I can't see rights and see wrongs
Sooner or later the priest gets your head, he must come from beyond
The Earth is burning don't go into this black zone
And screams are yearning stay away don't move on

With a smile and bright look on his face
The hero he walks into cold
I can't see paradise, coldness of death
There must be ways to survive

The beds are burning, reincarnation won't help
Sooner or later the priest gets your head, he must come from beyond
The Earth is burning don't go into this black zone
And screams are yearning stay away don't move on

With a smile and bright look on his face
The hero he walks into cold
I can't see paradise, coldness of death
There must be ways to survive

Your head is turning, don't go into this black zone
And screams are yearning stay away don't move on

With a smile and bright look on his face
The hero he walks into cold
I can't see paradise, dust clouds ahead
There must be ways to survive
