Every day I have tried to find it
The book of black in reversing rimes
You know fools who don't know emotions
Try to blame you for murder crimes

They must be out of their minds
To find a victim for unknown lines

They fool around with some electronics
Turn around all this hellbound talk
And the shame when they cannot find it
Let us pray and be empty heads

They must be out of their minds
To find a victim for unknown lines

I guess we, we know, know what rock's all about
You're metal undertakers to bring solutions
We, we know, know what rock's all about
Metal undertakers

I you never trust a stranger
Try to kill What you don't know
And your law gives you a reason
Go to hell and fight yourselves

They must be out of their minds
To find a victim for unknown lines

I guess we, we know, know what rock's all about
You're metal undertakers to bring solutions
We, we know, know what rock's all about
Metal undertakers
We know what rock's all about
