I was a fool to listen to your promises tonight
The world is crazy but you don't get me for your plans no more

When you find a girl like this and your monkey's very pissed
You will take her to the alley, fill her with some jelly
The moral of it all, no matter who you call,
Better go to nowhere

Higher, things to know, but that's just what I like
Higher, I don't get it, but now it's too late

Walking for days into the empty spaces of my mind
I found the way you were trying to get back to society

When you find a girl like this and your monkey's very pissed
You will take her to the alley, fill her with some jelly
The moral of it all, no matter who you call,
Better go to nowhere

Higher, things to know, but that's just what I like
Higher, I don't get it, but now it's too late

When you find a girl like this and your monkey's very pissed
You will take her to the alley, fill her with some jelly
The moral of it all, no matter who you call,
Better go to nowhere

Higher, things to know, but that's just what I like
Higher, I don't get it, but now it's too late
