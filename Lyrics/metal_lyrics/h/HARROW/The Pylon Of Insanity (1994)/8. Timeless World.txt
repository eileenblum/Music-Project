An eagle's dreaming away tears will take control
Your powers melting away so strong
A bastard sits on his shelf dreaming away
A dead skull inspired his mind too long

Try me, try me, there ain't no hope anymore
Try me, try me, there ain't no hope anymore

The green rock's calling for me, his eyes look bright
A tattooed bringer of law will fight
A slam of his sword my thoughts are torn apart
They lied nothing is real in this world

And I dream away, a timeless world, no yesterday
And I stay away from heaven
I've seen creatures fall big and small and after all
In the night they will appear

Try me, try me, there ain't no hope anymore

And I dream away, a timeless world, no yesterday
And I stay away from heaven
I've seen creatures fall big and small and after all
In the night they will appear
And I dream away there's no yesterday
In the night they will appear

Try me, try me, I've seen creatures fall, try me
I'm the man, the man, the man. try me
