In these ages of tears and melody
There still members who choose violent guarantees
The young riders they can kill
On their fast bikes outta scary steel and fire

Gotta wake up and see
No fifth dimension, gotta break out be free
Wake up and see, your only chance is liberty
To be send away, to be send away

In early stages they ragged me just to see
If I could waste a child, a painful memory
Became their leader, my fading face
And with a shock another parallel

Gotta wake up and see
No fifth dimension, gotta break out be free
Wake up and see, your only chance is liberty
To be send away, to be send away
Wake up and see, intuition, mystery
To be send away, to be send away

Wake up and see, your only chance is liberty
To be send away, to be send away
Wake up and see, intuition mystery
To be send away, to be send away
