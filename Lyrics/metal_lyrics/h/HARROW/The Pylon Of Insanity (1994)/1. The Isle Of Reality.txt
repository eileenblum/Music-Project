She wakes up in a dream her eyes are wet
She stays so clear it looks like masquerade
The isle of reality your destiny to face the fear
Prepare to sacrifice

Call for me the saviour comes, immunity
Wake for me the cure is here to stay
You are awake my friend my helping hand that saves your land
I'm on my way to this masquerade

Why do you anger oh there's me eyes are so bright
And the search for the mermaid rages on
To cure the illness and to fight now for us all
And the search for the mermaid rages on
To fight for freedom to cure and waste the wrong

And the search for the mermaid rages on
To cure the illness and to fight now for us all
And the search for the mermaid rages on
To fight for freedom to cure and waste the wrong
