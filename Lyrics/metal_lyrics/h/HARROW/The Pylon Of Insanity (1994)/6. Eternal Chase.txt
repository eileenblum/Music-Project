We see the mountains glow before we close our eyes
Then someone shuts the door, I would like to try eternal chase
Try to look into your eyes
Try to run from your disguise
And I want to see the red line, find the entrance of your will
It seems the last chance to the final ecstasy

We feel the oceans shake after mountains fire
Then love becomes a fake, I would like to try eternal chase
Try to look into your eyes
It seems the last chance to the final ecstasy

And I know that she's waiting
And I face it till the end eternity
At her own fate into darkness
And I face the end of times

Run forever, what you gonna do about the awful sin
Tease like hell
Run forever, what you gonna do about the awful sin
Tease like hell

And I know that she's waiting
And I face it till the end eternity
At her own fate into darkness
And I face the end of times

Run forever, what you gonna do about the awful sin
Tease like hell
Run forever, what you gonna do about the awful sin
Tease like hell
Run forever, what you gonna do about the awful sin
Tease like hell
