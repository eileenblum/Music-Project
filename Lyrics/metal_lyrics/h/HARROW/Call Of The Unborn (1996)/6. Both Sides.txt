Don't leave your world, in a song is the rest just a 
fake.
Glimmering features, two lives, who cares.
Want out, gotta get out, you can't, you want, you 
can't break out to me.
Humble remain, just accept, Your future in here. 
Strong men, rely on, their power, but I don't have 
it.
Hold me, spare me, care now, just respect, both 
sides, the two sides of me
Both sides, don't you see
Mistreat your heart, it's a cure, I am sure that it 
fails.
Want out, gotta get out, you can't, you want, you 
can't break out to me.
Ain't no solution, abate, all the pain, in your life.
Strong men, rely on, their power, but I don't have 
it.
Hold me, spare me, care now, just respect, both 
sides, the two sides of me
Both sides, don't you see
Both sides, the two sides of me
Both sides, don't you see
Strong men, rely on, their power, but I don't have 
it.
Hold me, spare me, care now, just respect, both 
sides, the two sides of me
Both sides, don't you see
Both sides, the two sides of me
Both sides, don't you see
Both sides, both sides, both sides, both sides.
