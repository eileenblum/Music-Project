found out they're living in a cage, within a crowd 
they burst out in rage, yeah! Fight back, your 
body's falling apart. Fight back, your life is falling 
apart. Domination, resist as much you can. 
Limitation, infecting every man, yeah! Fight back, 
your body's falling apart. Fight back, your life is 
falling apart. You can't stop us now, what is on 
your mind. You can't stop us now, terminal attack 
in me. You can't stop us now, what is on your 
mind. You can't stop us now, terminal attack in 
me. Terminal attack in me. Fight back, your 
body's falling apart. Fight back, your life is falling 
apart. You can't stop us now, what is on your 
mind. You can't stop us now, terminal attack in
me. You can't stop us now, what is on your mind. 
You can't stop us now, terminal attack in me. 
Terminal attack in me, terminal attack, terminal 
attack.
