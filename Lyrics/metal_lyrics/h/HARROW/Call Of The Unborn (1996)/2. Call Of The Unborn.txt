Don't be rough to me, my mother, a nitwit, can't 
be good to me.
Don't give birth to me, you liar, you hate, even 
when it's own blood.
You looked for the seed everywhere, no love to 
be found to be shared.
Don't be cruel to me, my mother,
a devil, has no right to stay.
I want to be free, the law, the future, they are on
my mind.
You wanted to breed anyhow, in every possible 
way. Want my life, I come anyway,
I won't be recognized, you don't cherish me.
Want my life, I'm begging you why,
You won't be recognized, your life will be had
You won't be recognized, life will be sad
You looked for the seed everywhere, no love to 
be found, to be shared.
Want my life, I come anyway,
I won't be recognized, you don't cherish me.
Want my life, I'm begging you why,
You won't be recognized, your life will be had
You won't be recognized, life will be sad
