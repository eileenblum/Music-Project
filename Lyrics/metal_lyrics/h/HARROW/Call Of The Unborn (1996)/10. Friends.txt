I am thinking 'bout the early days, friendship on 
parole, life has changed, like autumn does to 
trees. Now I realize the magic's gone, the one 
that chained our minds, we separate, separate. I
will never say the word that causes tragedy, now 
we share together memories. I just met the man I 
talked about, our shadows had a chat, words like 
wind, like the wind. I will never say the word that 
causes tragedy, but our life together ends, now. I 
will never be your friend again, cannot find a way 
to understand. It will never be the same again, 
cannot find the way back again.

cannot find a way to understand.
cannot find the way back
