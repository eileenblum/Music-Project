You got the face of the rider from hell. Screaming 
for justice the judge has to tell. And no-one 
escapes from this prison I stay. Get ready to
suffer it's punishment day. Out of this bad world 
escape to be free,
your eyes will be torned in the dark. This 
powerful shadow is entering me,
I can see no pride. Ready to focus the senses of 
life. Don't paid no attention to children and wife. I
enter the world of the radical terms. Infected by 
anger like powerful germs. Out of this bad world 
escape to be free,
your eyes will be torned in the dark. This 
powerful shadow is entering me,
I will show no pride.
Wasting, my eyes cannot see in the dark.
Wasting, I can see no lights. Wasting, my ears do 
not hear any sparks. Wasting, I broke down in 
parts.
Wasting, my eyes cannot see in the dark. 
Wasting, I can see no lights. Wasting, my ears do 
not hear any sparks. Wasting, I broke down in 
parts.
