See the sunrise, a lonely feeling, 
the day the project really ends.
Face your new world, now it's your time, 
remember all the mess we shared.
Well I've given you the best I could, no-one is to
blame, is to blame.
You're my will and not another should try to 
claim, it's always the same.
You, you got to look back, ancient times 
and don't rely on a mad machine.
It's just a waste of time just spare
a little time.
You tried to hold me, you face my hunger 
Waste, I waste my time back in the barn 
thinking of you.
But I, go on, I'm trying, to build up,
the giant, he rises, explosion, he falls clown. 
Awake now, don't live for the money it tears you 
down
Awake now, don't wait for the giant, lifeless one 
Awake now, respect mother nature you're her son 
Awake now, disgrace of the giant can't go on.
But I, go on, I'm trying, to build tip,
the giant, he rises, explosion, he falls down. 
Awake now, don't live for the money it tears you 
down
Awake now, don't wait for the giant, lifeless one 
Awake now, respect mother nature you're her son 
Awake now, disgrace of the giant can't go on.
