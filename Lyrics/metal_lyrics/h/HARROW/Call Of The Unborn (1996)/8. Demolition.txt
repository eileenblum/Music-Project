I've done some mean things for money. I've been 
to places of death, Rough seas, empty seas, 
results of bad ideas. Payed no attention to earth. 
Put your furcoats on, come on let's destroy some 
lungs. Even better, everybody's waiting. I am the 
star Demolition. I change the woods into sands. 
Black air, filthy air, some weeds are really rare, 
tell my child what I've done. Put your furcoats on, 
come on let's destroy some lungs. Even better, 
everybody's waiting. The silkworm slowly dies, 
our mind's too strong, we do it wrong, the birds 
fall down, they never did. And the blue whale 
stops to sing, our mind's too strong, we do it
wrong, the tiger's tame, he never was, never was.
