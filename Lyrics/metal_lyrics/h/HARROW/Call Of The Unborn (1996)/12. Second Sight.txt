I invite my friends, I can see the way reality 
extends. Stay around, the digger's job is done, 
their greedy way, the feeling is gone. Prowl 
around, if I had time to stay.
As I died my mind got second sight, I had to 
judge, became aware of things, depravity rules. 
Now I know at last what real friends are, I have to 
leave, I can't change a bit, can't change, I can't 
change. I can see right through you, there's no 
escape. You cheat me, yon rob me, with a friendly 
face. Don't treat me wrong, it's the fact, the act I 
see. Don't treat me wrong, against my will, don't 
fuck with me. Don't treat me wrong, the night, 
the fight, the dark and the light. Don't treat me 
wrong, leave me be, I don't agree.
Don't treat me wrong, it's the fact, the act I see.
Don't treat me wrong, against my will, don't fuck 
with me. Don't treat me wrong, the night, the 
fight, the dark and the light. Don't treat me 
wrong, leave me be, I don't agree.
