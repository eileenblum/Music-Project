Up there's a man out of steel,
time's running out since your brother left home. 
The only solution he had,
the name of the dark one, unknown by the law. 
Watch out!
Someone has seen how he came,
destroying the enemies crossing his way. 
An old man he ate, the worst what he did, 
torned by the sword, be punished to death. 
Watch out!
Watch out!
You will rise, the guardian protects and defeats, 
His image is strong, the ultimate way, survive! 
You will rise, the guardian protects and defeats, 
His image is strong, the ultimate way, survive! 
But now when the battle is clone,
the good side survived the guardian has won. 
The price he will ask is too high,
We can't sell our children, our women and pride. 
Watch out!
Watch out!
He will rise, the guardian protects and he cheats, 
His image is strong, the ultimate way, survive! 
He will rise, the guardian protects and he cheats, 
His image is strong, the ultimate way, survive!
