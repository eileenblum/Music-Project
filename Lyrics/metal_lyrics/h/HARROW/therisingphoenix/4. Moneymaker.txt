Sit down write a song
Get along and use your fire tongue
The charts will rise
Funny clothes a toothpaste smile
Sing what's wrong and what has style
And he will pay, meet Mr. Money now
Use your brains
Lay down think of me
Rip the cover from the magazine
Behave like stars
You better sample you soul
Empty your brains, take a long rope
Dirty moneymakers
I don't know what you're dreaming [4x]
Sample your soul
Empty your brains
Take a long rope
Fucking moneymakers.
