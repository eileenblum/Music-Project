I don't know 'bout the chains in her life
I don't see tears
I can't feel tragedy rules
I don't know please
Walking through the wastelands of hate
I'm coming by the windmills of fear
She looks at me but I stare in a cloud
Can't stand no tragedy, 'cause I don't
She asks my help but I,
Care, I don't know what's right or wrong for me
Share, feel the coldness
You know I have to care
Can't stand no tragedy, 'cause I don't
Care, I don't know what's right or wrong for you
Share, feel the coldness
You know have to care
Let me live the way 1 struggled for
Fair, no, no, no.
