Somewhere in the deserts of Amrax
far beyond the ring of deception,
lies hidden under moving sand
Along time the people have suffered
from the tyranny of the black magicians,
now it's time that we all stand up and fight
Now we break out with a massive attack
blow away the leaders of the pact,
so I put your balls on the track
Faster than light, don't go faster
faster than light
Faster than light, don't go faster
you go faster
Somewhere in the mountains of Ephra
we learn from the mighty high priests,
that we are the chosen ones
So they will finally discover
golden power of our own free will
we're on the way to soul liberation
Faster than light, don't go faster
Faster than light
Faster than light, don't go faster
faster than light.
