I see this moments clear
There's no-one I will fear anyway, anyhow
Maybe the time is wrong
Well it makes her feel strong, oh somehow
But you don't know the name of this evil excess
You wonder how it's gonna live
You find a clue why it has come to earth
It fights against you and me
You ride through the dark clouds
On a horse with six legs and wings
Over and over the beast is getting closer
'till the bell gives the sign
and then when the lights are getting blue
you're riding through wastelands of clues
and I never talked 'bout this place
over and over the beast is getting closer
The evil cracks the earth
There's no-one I will fear, anyway, anyhow
Invite them all today
Well it makes her feel so strong, oh somehow
But you don't know the name of this evil excess
You wonder how it's gonna live
You find a reason why it has come to earth
It fights against you and me.
