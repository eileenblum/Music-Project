I don't like to stare in his lines
He knows for sure what the message will bring
I'm speaking tough a story 'bout times
You can't check 'cause the edge is our real life
Talking back doesn't make no sense
Hate grows on some wars will be started
The storm of Difference's blowing on
I don't know which game's going on
I will prove their minds must be wrong
Don't suck
I don't think he walked out a grave
A way of writing in symbols of times
And they say he walked on a sea
You can't check 'cause the edge is our real life
I don't know which game's going on
I will prove they are so wrong
Don't suck
Your mind I cannot see
Live along our destiny
Clears your soul, amputates
Brilliant moves out of the shade
