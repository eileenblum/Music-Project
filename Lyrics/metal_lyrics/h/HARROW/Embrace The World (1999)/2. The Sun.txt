She looked up but never faced it
That there's something up ahead the sky
With the might and the power
I didn't realize it are the gods
Became aware, the feeling of despair
Somebody asked and somebody pointed, into the air
Became aware, the ozone didn't care
A waste of time, the waste of life, and first of all unfair
We made it up, it's not important
it's just a thing for sale to ease the minds
So be aware, and be suspicious
It's just a thing for sale to ease the minds
So be aware, and be suspicious
Better analyze before they scare
Became aware, the feeling of despair
Somebody asked and somebody pointed, into the air
Became aware, the ozone didn't care
A waste of time, the waste of life
And first of all unfair
I am the sun and every run I claim to be your God the sun
Don't waste your time anymore
I am the sun and every run I claim to be your God the sun
Don't waste your time anymore
I am the sun, the whole wide is looking for the time to come
