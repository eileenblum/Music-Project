He who is high looks down on many
Overcome by loneliness in the search for what was lost
The Original Orphan asks: Am I all there is?
Where are you....... of who I have no memory
But whose faint imprints I sense, everywhere I appear?
Who are you...... that whispers to me from across the great silence
Of who my fiery heart sings, with the rise of each morning?

In the middle..........

There where no eyes can see, where all is left to becoming
The separation dissolves, as the restless echo returns home
Here where the me becomes the we......
We see that hose who know, show that love is the key!
And when illusions of fear melt away with the last tear
Hope shall meet joy and across the Heavens will resound the one call:

"Embrace the world in all!"
