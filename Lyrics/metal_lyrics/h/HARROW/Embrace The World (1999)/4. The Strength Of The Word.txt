The minstrel is singing about the stories concerning all life
He is changing the days into nights, just in a spark
The noble man listens to him
Unconscious reforming his land
And the reason that's causing it all
The strength of the word
Blind and deaf, gives you the chance
No war, no life, no death, life's in your hand
What you think 'bout the powers you gained
The judge was the same as yourself
You enriching yourself in a way, and try to oppress
Blind and deaf, gives you the chance
No war, no life, no death, life's in your hand
Wasting the crowd, ramming it down
Do you know what I wanna breed
I wanna change this world to another scene
Do you know what I want right now...
Wasting the crowd, ramming it down
Do you know what i wanna breed
I wanna change this world to another scene
Do you know what i want right now
