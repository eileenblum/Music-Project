See me flying pretending there're no bad things
But life is not in vain, possessed or seduced
But one thing's on my mind
Where do we all come from
The answers are unclear
Don't know where to go
What is our soul and what did it create
What is the maker of all times?
Our behavior, we're searching for the answers
And science does exceed
But where's the control
We're looking at the stars
There has to be a blueprint
The powers of the mind
Can't reach for the truth
What is our soul and what did it create
What is the maker of all times?
Don't be shy to clear your mind
We let it out and be so kind
You check it out to see the light
Don't be afraid of the dark
Don't be shy to clear your mind
We let it out and be so kind
You check it out to see the light
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid of the dark
