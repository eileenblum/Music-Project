What is wrong with your career?
The time goes by and kills the atmosphere
You have to score, you sell your flesh
Accounts are rising, you collect the cash
Clock strikes "come" your shift is on
The night is weary, it's never dawn
It never sleeps, it never wakes
Don't you dare to change these mortal closing times
Ready to fall down, in my life I suffer
Don't you agree to, you better run for
When the hand points at itself
Time is up, life lies down
Twenty-four the counter counts
Time is up, precious life dies down
