A day in life I watched with glee
Savannah's life's surrounding me
What i like is not what I see
Don't you agree with a better scene?
A way of life was meant to be
A balanced life, all species free
What I like is not what I see
Don't you agree with a better scene?
What happens when nature kills itself
Because of the interfering man
Outside of the parks this life should be
Facing its enemy
Polar bear, he likes his ice
Is wondering why his iceberg cries
What I like is not what I see
Don't you agree with a better scene?
What happens when nature kills itself
Because of the interfering man
Outside of the parks this life should be
Facing its enemy
You're all alone
You're on your own now, in fear
You're out of stone, you disappear, in anger
You're all alone, you're on your own now, it's clear
You're almost gone, you must never turn your back to man
