Watch out, tornado's rage
It's a never-ending story
It's disaster time
Earthquake, house explodes
Gotta shelter every man in the neighborhood
Srpingtide, shore collapses
Disappear into a vortex and be never found
Foresee it ain't no option
It's the power of the plant and it's mighty strong
Your life is on the loose
Nature gets abused flashes of your life
Your game is at it's end
No one is your friend
You're acting really selfish
Don't you worry
Big bang, the loudest blast
It's the mother of disasters in a certain way
Mutate, life will last
There's a creature in the cradle and it ain't my son
Your life is on the loose
Nature gets abused flashes of your life
Your game is at the end
No one is your friend
You're acting really selfish
I will survive when the six's on the dice
it's the will of the times
Don't worry now
Now take your aim
Make a bet in the game
it's the thrill of the times
Don't worry now
Get the chills of the times
I think it's better you'll die
