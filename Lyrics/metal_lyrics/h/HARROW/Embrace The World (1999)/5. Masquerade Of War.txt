In my dreams, I've seen it all the way
Through the eyes of the dead man
Your concerns, i threw them all away
In the blasts and the fire
Go, you gotta go to war, playing like chess
You're gonna spill some gore
Fight, I'm gonna fight my war
You, you gotta bomb their kids
Nevertheless I'm gonna kill what fits
All, I'm gonna kill them all
When the masquerade begins
it's a war he never wins
In your thoughts, you want my soul to nail
In the jungle of lairs
I've seen worse, he's spreading a final curse
In his will to admire
Raise, I'm gonna raise the flag, shooting like hell
I'm gonna risk my neck
Lose, they gonna lose their back
Use, they gonna use their spies
Nevertheless I'm gonna blind their eyes
Cold, I see the silent cries
When the masquerade begins
It's a war he never wins
When the masquerade begins
Well I don't know what's on my mind
Gonna win for sure, gotta final cure
Well I don't know who wins this war
Never gonna guess, never gonna crash
You never know which game is on my mind
Gonna win for sure, gotta final cure
Well I don't know who wins this war, this war......
When the masquerade begins
When the masquerade begins
I'm your goal, I am your shadowsoul
In the being of sire
From a haze is clearing up total waste
In land's will to desire
No, you never wear me down
Nevertheless I'm gonna take your crown
Pride, I'll never get back home
