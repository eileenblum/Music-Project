I am one with the ones who bring the plague
I control their universe
Through the dark, beyond this world I am
In the dominions of thine
Consume the earth, the night will never end
As I see through the secrets of all time
The funerals will never end

I will summon thee
Forces of Darkness and ancient might
I'll bring you forth, into eternal impure night
I will summon thee
Who the legions of light will attack
Step right through my Mirrors of Black

As the flames from the past start to rise
And the sun drowns in blood
As my spirit burn the world of lies
The vision has come true

I will summon thee
Forces of Darkness and ancient might
I'll bring you forth, into eternal impure night
I will summon thee
Who the legions of light will attack
Step right through my Mirrors of Black
