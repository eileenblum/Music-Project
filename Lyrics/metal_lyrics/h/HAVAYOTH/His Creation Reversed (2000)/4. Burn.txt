I gaze through worlds unknown to man
I got the secret all within my hand
Burn now, make me bleed
Feel the fire rise
Release me, let me go
Free me from the lies

So burn now, make me burn
Feel the flames rise within
So burn now, make me burn
I'm the one born with sin

I got the key that opens up your mind
Close your eyes and dream, fear me not my child

I send you into the dark to play
Your sleeping soul, let it be led astray

So burn now, make me burn
Feel the flames rise within
So burn now, make me burn
I'm the one born with sin
Burn now, make me burn
As the fire is rising,
You better pray for your life
You're gonna burn now, burn now, burn now,
So Burn Now...
