I am the air you breathe, the wind that makes you freeze
Into your soul, the winds of death I'll blow
As night is drawing near, your consciousness I'll sear
I'll break you down, I'll break you down

As the winds of time blow cold
As the night unfolds, I will steal your soul

Under the stars
Under the moon
I'll be watching over you
I am the one who can't be seen
I am the night,
The dark in your dreams
I'm the one who can't be seen
I am watching over you

As the winds of time blow cold
I will not let you grow old

I am both life and death, I am your final breath
Inside your mind, my poison you'll find
As night is drawing near, your consciousness I'll sear
I'll break you down, I'll break you down
