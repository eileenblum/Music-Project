He is back
He returnes and dwells in me again
I saw him dying
I thought he was dead, I buried him

I destroyed his grave and regard
I forgot his name and reflection
I destroyed his way to throne
I killed his queen and his court

And now I am my enemy
I am my fear, I am my agony
It is in my mind, in my heart
In my veins
It shows me my dreadful memories

I will not ask for help, I will fall
Leave me hear to die and to awake again
I will rise and declare him war
I will rise and this will be his end
