He craved for glory
But life left him alone
Now nothing will be like before
It hurts that is enough

Run while no one cares
It is too late to die
Rise your hopes from dust
And keep them deep in dusk

Save you tears for hell
This won't be your last day
Leave your prays for fire
Leave your priest to die

Close your heart for wind
He will always lie
Feed your hate with pain
Don't stay here, go away

Save your tears for hell
This won't be your last day
Leave your prays for fire
Leave your priest to die

Be free from doubt
Cut all your darkness bounds
Leave your heart it's cursed
Leave it cold and dark

Brake your walls with hate
This won't be your last day
Make the sky to fall
Make it weak and dull

Now it's time to go
You have been here too long
Go while there is dark
Go while there is spark
