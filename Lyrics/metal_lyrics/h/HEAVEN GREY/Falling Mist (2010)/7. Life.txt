Spirit seeks for sun in dark
Seeing no light in the eyes
The lost hopes he never finds

How the power runs in the blood
Imperious and heart tearing
And thoughts deviating from the aim
Mingle your brains from time to time
Just some thirst of the soul remains there
With broken wings, sinking in the dark
Enough you're done your way
But never you returned

It's your life
With hopes
With feelings
With the heart loving you
With the distant future
There is your life
