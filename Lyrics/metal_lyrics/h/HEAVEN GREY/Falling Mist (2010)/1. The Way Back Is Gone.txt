Something is pulling me back
But way back is gone
There is only, only eternal darkness
There is only, only empty rage
There is only, there is only void

Wings of sadness
With a shadow cover me
Don't wait for me, I am cursed,
I am cursed

You can't save me,
I have gone too far
I can't see any ray of light,
Any drop of hope
There is only, only empty rage
There is only, there is only void

Conscience leads me in death
I can't to resist, I'm emptied
There is only, only eternal darkness
There is only, only empty rage
There is only, there is only void

There is only void
There is only void
There is only void
There is only void
