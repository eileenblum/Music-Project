In this calm when the sky is burning
And the earth sleeps in the serenity of ice
The sigh crosses it all over
As the whisper, as hardly perceptible touch

With the first burning dawns
Eternal expectations are soughing
The earth dare not embrance
Cause everything`s still silent, ice`s white

What makes the voice shudder in memories
What makes the gaze stun in blue distance
What makes the heart stay permanent
In thousand visions and dreams

Cold, more cold as the ice (this heart is)
This heart - not feeling pain
In this serenity of ice the northwind is born
Leaving hopes not reached
