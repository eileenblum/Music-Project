I'm walking 'round in the night
People disappear, silent roams on the streets
You're not by my side
But thoughts gather only around you

Cause you're got something
I can love etrnally
That's the most cherished
We have in this world

I hate to see you
Crying here in front of me
And those moments
When I can't reach you, darling

I'm walking 'round in the night
People disappear, silent roams on the streets
And you're in front of my eyes
But I don't know why it's
