Do you recall me through years any more
Those dreams day - dreamed together long before.
Still flowers in you hair, but not like then
Revived sentiments smarting from the depth of heart.

Again you're dropped your eyes.
Smiling thorough the sorrow gently.
Heart surges after words with yearning
Which really unsaid to any for a long time.

Remains unforgettable soft kiss
Like a silver glitter on lips.
And scent is mild and slumberous.
Maybe it won't be resolved to feel once more.

Sometimes I meet you again
Every thing's changed, become
different as an unreal dream.
