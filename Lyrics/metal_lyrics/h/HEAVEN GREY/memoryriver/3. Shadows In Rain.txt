Like a life you pass away.
Sensing the smell of you body.
And the mildness of you skin
Being like rosy flowers.

Stays the broken heart and the broken soul
Like an accidentally smashed crystal vessel.
Stays your shadow in the rain
But it's seized only in a dream.

Only silence coming from my depth.
Let's go dreaming to the virgin lands
Where our shadows meet each other in rain
And rosy roses bloom and don't fade.

Please don't weep in our last rain.
That all will stay unforgotten.
One day we'll remember each other in rain.
Calling for immersed memories.
