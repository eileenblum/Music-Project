Glowing pain is burning in the soul
Wound struck by bolt of lightning.

Nothing matters any more.

Gods of darkness laughing in the mirror
Because the black, flower of hope is
Blooming in God's garden.

Nothing matters any more.
Cead soul in broken mirror.

My dirimes star as vapour love
Heaviness before the storm of the soul.
It seams like death is breathing
Arms length.

A lot has been left unsaid.
The tree of life is wilting now.
The tears from your eyes tell the truth.
Time is standing still
My aching heart starts crying.
It's raining rain of dying angels
Who needs the sadness that is in my heart
And incredible longing pain.
