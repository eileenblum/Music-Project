The voice of the soul happy people have,
Hiding in a lake of beauty.
You can't please for the world of life
And submit to the ruling strength.

Where would you go you dreaming spirit
If you're overcome by heavenly sweet feeling
And your spray of life withers
Over the dreaming shades of the wide universe.

Why this dream disappears ?
Why sweet days of love are over ?
Why the loving hearts are carried to the graves
And here don't stay a single one ?

When stars will burn in flames
The heart trembles slowly.
It'll sound far away in the night
Over the dreaming shades of the wide universe.

Why this dream disappears ?
Why sweet days of love are over ?
Why the loving hearts are carried to the graves
And here don't stay a single one ?
