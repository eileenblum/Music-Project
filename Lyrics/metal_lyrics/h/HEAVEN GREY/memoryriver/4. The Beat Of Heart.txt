The beat of heart counts appointed time for you.
All pains of soul you hold
And cry all tears of sadness,
Vainly heart burns in blazes of feelings.

Yearning haunts your heart long ago.
If has the heart all life.
You'll always be lone inside,
You're nothing without your solitude.

The longing pines for shores of far - away been life.
The soul drops in captivity of undreamed fancies.
Childhood seems as an ancient dream,
Every one wants to get back to it.

Closing eyes you sink into yourself.
Don't strive to disclaim you truth.
Feel it inside you as a salty tears.
Forgive you lost hopeless ness.
