Your blind eyes will look for the lost paradise
Under the grey clouds.
You'll got lost yourself seeking this paradise
Under heavy silver clouds.

In the morass of life you feel lost.
Your scowl wrapped in the mist.
And in your eyes growns dim and revives again
By gone dreams, the apathetic, cloudy weather reflects there.

You bid your enchanted soul
To melt in the long weeping.
As the violin cry's the heart
Unfairly scolded.

Another grows into the grass, it fades.
That can't say what was all's.
You'll search for happiness in the field of closed hearts.
Don't cry, when somebody will look at you with empty eyes.

You bid your enchanted soul
To melt in the long weeping.
As the violin cry's the heart
Unfairly scolded.

But listen your soul is dreaming...
