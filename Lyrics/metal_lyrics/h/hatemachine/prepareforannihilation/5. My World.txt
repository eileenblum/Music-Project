It is the shadows of life we walk through everyday I look at my life and want to run away
From all of the pain that has been handed to me my world hass been infected by my minds insanity
I see my reflection as time breathes upon me
This image of confusion laughs at my destiny
Where will I end up in this world of confusion?
Seeing through the doorways of twilight delusions

Pain can breed hate if life makes mistakes
Pain can breed hate if life makes mistakes
Cracks in the system blood in the sky
I look at my thoughts and I wonder why
Day turns to night as the light fades away
The smile of my loneliness puts me away

Fuck all these pretensions of my unwanted world
Spinning through cycles of chaos letting evil unfurl
Into the depths of my reality destroying the chapters of my ancient history
Through the holes of time I can never be late
The demons have entered into my world of hate
I can only fight them off the best that I can and try to send them back into where they began

Cracks in the system blood in the sky
I look at my thoughts and I wonder why
Day turns to night as the light fades away
The smile of my loneliness puts me away
Hate, obsession greed, regression
State, attention bleeding confessions
Leaders, haters feeders, takers
Believers, creators seeking the fakers
