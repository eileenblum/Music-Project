Sick of all the words you say your vicious lies have cut through me
Feel the fury vengeance rage to watch the blood flow down your face
I feel it burning inside motherfucker staying inside
Get away from me inside in my mind you cannot hide

I'm obsessed with a will to destroy stay out of my way or I will rip through your life with a blast of pain
How does it feel to be flat on your face going to put you in your place leave you with a little taste
I feel it burning inside stay away from me inside
Get out of my brain inside in my mind you cannot hide

Can't take away do you feel pain in me
Can't take away do you feel pain in me
