Lost in the shadows raped by affection my mind attempts to resurrect
When you come to be no one will escape the walls of this century will break this gate
Unholy sins will enter this realm wreaking havoc to take control
Deadly awareness to the unconscious state rip through this life, make no mistakes

The devil himself can't compete in this race
Only the strong can breach this place
Creation dwells in the obsession of men
Look in the mirror do what you can
For end the end, you can see the truth
Unholy presence, weakens the youth
Come with me, step into the light
Ressurect, with all your might

Lost in the shadows raped by affection my mind attempts to resurrect
When you come to be no one will escape the walls of this century will break this gate
Unholy sins will enter this realm wreaking havoc to take control
Deadly awareness to the unconscious state rip through this life, make no mistakes

I'm fighting demons and I want to escape
I want to break free but it's to late
Someone's out to get me and I got it all wrong
Try to take my last breath but its all gone
For end the end, you can see the truth
Unholy presence, weakens the youth
Come with me, step into the light
Resurrect, with all your might

Can't you see you're not yet a man?
Can't you see I do what I can?
Can't you see what lies ahead?
Can't you see what will be said?
Welcome to this resurrection
Deep inside this resurrection
Witness to this resurrection
Surrender to this resurrection
