I await the day I could see you again
The day when the past comes to life again
Like it was before in a distant time
I knew that you would return with the force of mine

This is my day here I will stay
This is my day here I will stay
Do not take away my day
Save my day save my day
This is my day here I will stay
This is my day here I will stay
Don't take away my day
Save my day save my day

Together we would remain until tomorrow is cold
All of the winds freeze us to death 
In my today actually, my tomorrow
Still I will wait for your return

As tomorrow comes do not go look for me
I would not be around for you to see
Hatred for passion has grown very strong
Next chapter comes moving right along
