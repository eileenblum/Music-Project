What the fuck is wrong with you?
All of the things we make to do
Killing off life so you will pay
With all of these fears that break away

Clear your mind, clear your soul
Time has come to take control
Forbidden pleasures locked within
Inner child escaping sin
Gonna snap stay the fuck away
Angels fallen but never afraid
No lights inside the bricks of hell
Deep inclined to the demons bell

Where are we, who am I
Take a good look your gonna die
Virgins cry out in their sleep
As we rise from the deep

Clear your mind, clear your soul
Time has come to take control
Forbidden pleasures locked within
Inner child escaping sin
Gonna snap stay the fuck away
Angels fallen but never afraid
No lights inside the bricks of hell
Deep inclined to ring the demons bell

This is war
Your gonna die motherfuckers, war
Gonna settle the score, it's war
It's your end motherfuckers, war
This is war
Your gonna die motherfuckers, war
Gonna settle the score, it's war
It's your end motherfuckers, war

Now your body's numb you cannot feel
Time for your life to disappear
Time has come, it's over now
Your life is spent and we know how

Clear your mind, clear your soul
Time has come to take control
Forbidden pleasures locked within
Inner child escaping sin
Gonna snap stay the fuck away
Angels fallen but never afraid
No lights inside the bricks of hell
Deep inclined to the demons bell

This is war
Your gonna die motherfuckers, war
Gonna settle the score, it's war
It's your end motherfuckers, war
This is war
Your gonna die motherfuckers, war
Gonna settle the score, it's war
It's your end motherfuckers, war
This is war
Your gonna die motherfuckers, war
Gonna settle the score, it's war
It's your end motherfuckers, war
This is war
