Frozen, alone in my time you have chosen this life that is denied
So get the fuck out my mind stupid bitch you lied I wanted to take your life
Your pain, my glory

You left I thought I lived on with you gone I have lost all control
Conclusion will never be known
Running and running you feel yourself running
You're trying to take on the world
Running and running you feel yourself running
You're trying to take on my world
Your pain, my glory
