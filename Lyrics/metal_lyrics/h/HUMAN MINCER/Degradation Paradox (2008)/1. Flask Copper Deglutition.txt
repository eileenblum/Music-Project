The copper once in hand
With visible transformation
Suddenly the pain restart
Skin transmutation due to this chaotic matter
The why of the invention is not clear
Protecting with password
On this psycho inhuman form

Pulverized, coal combustion : residual ash formation
Broken cables, tech machinery, high levels
Sparks, fire everywhere
[x2]

Deglutition of my flask copper
Deglutition of my flask copper

Overheats my internal
Body temperatures to 203 degrees (Fahrenheit)

Infectious viruses
Paralytic shellfish
Toxin lethal
Botulism toxin
[x2]

Insulin - will arrange this...
This huge hand - can take it

Pulverized, coal combustion : residual ash formation
Broken cables, tech machinery, high levels
Sparks, fire everywhere

Cerebral blood flow
Unconventional techniques

Inserting needles
With a programmed pistol
In my jugular veins
And brachial arteries
Tilting my head down
And, after massive blood loss
Causes paralysis and fainting

Revive! Revive! Revive!
