Sorrow &amp; grief

Hereditary paranoid activity
Disadvantage and loss syndrome

Physiological reaction on the last minutes of the deglutition

Misery, own body bridge
Behement denial
Hereditary prejudice

Screamless
Screamless

Deformities on the face
Recombination events
In a recessive lethal ways
Mutation | Commuted

Sorrow &amp; grief
Sorrow &amp; grief

Imperceptible common sense
Inheritance understanding
The ancestors from the suborder of cephalaspida

Fusionable

With my three polar bodies
Pulverizing with a mortar and pestle
Parallel disillusion
Men inspired by a vision

Reaction, accelerating the fury of my potion
I can control it, perfected and overclocked
With the optimal organism to make him grow
Make him, make him grow!

Alone watching his transformation
Smiles and paranoia

Reaction, accelerating the fury of my potion
I can control it, perfected and overclocked
With the optimal organism to make him grow

Feel the power of my work
Conserved in the fridge
Now I need to sculpture my body with his members

Cellular replication
Perfection, beauty and harmony
