When I'm deformed
Dyskinetic martyr modification
Is my inglorious end?

Fractions of my genetic

Distortional vision
Three pairs of identical twins of me
Emerging from my organism
Purulent forms - liquids and bones

Renew of my being
And old roots and old man

Experiments rather than nature
I would concentrate on control
Whereas if we think of the conquering
In terms of dissipation

There are two directions: to go
In the interpretation
Of these modifications

Physical: nature collapse
Self physically: modification

Earth - Air - Fire - Water

Formulas for giving the appearance of the "true" beast

Dyskinetic martyr modification
Dyskinetic martyr
Dyskinetic martyr abstraction

Over the heads of the humans
The completion of my work
Using the vast system of my mind and old wisdom
Changing my constitution
Inhumane actions

Inject 4.7 micrograms of plutonium

Feeling better, mechanical and enormous
My weapon is in the refrigerated cabinet

Absorption of vitamins and minerals
Via is not the mouth
Skin adaptation in assimilation
For this hyper being I am
