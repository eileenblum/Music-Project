The abomination am I
Gigantic inhuman form
Grotesque and repulsive
Nuclear blood I have

Correcting human madness

Through completely - erasing one's memory
And rewriting - with my psyche
In the breezy surface
Enormous like a extraordinary beast tower
My head destroys some buildings
Living spaces cracked
I'm the disgrace for the humans
Sensory deprivation induced

Dry thing in water - solid in a liquid

Resistance to chemical and biological weapons
Don't run - a deep crater on a state
Infected with my great work
Decontaminated of your principles

Complex attack
Easy to accomplish
Explosions in the sky
Bullets and nuclear bombs

Heads blow up
Bloody bodies left
Engrossing my brain
Defensive measures against me being
Suffer the power
Transmission line failed
Intellectual and philosophical rationalizations

Convulsive paroxysms
Urban and poor
Thoughts of extinction
Vibrations on the surface

Monster experiment has one result

Tsunami of human blood
Tsunami of human blood
Tsunami!
Tsunami of human blood
Tsunami of human blood
