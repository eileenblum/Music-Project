Head molding anticipation
Inflammation appearing

Distress, agonize, roars of animals locked
Modern quantitative sciences doesn't work

Head deformer,
Brainpower of a sickened brain
Voices &amp; internal vibrations

Says to him
That the process has an error
Freedom shall be yours

Keep the mind alive
Decease is not the next step
Blood mechanism

Deteriorating of the head bones

Genome distortion / Of the injected osteostrace life fluids
Increasing the rate of mutation in 566

Random - Discontinuous

Movements - Movements

Practicing under the lower bounds
Self-preservation of the wounds

Trying to support the pain
Investigations engulfed in tension

Arrhythmic contractions

Systemic circulation
Like venom which coalesce
Into veins permanent mutation

Of his parameters
Causing errors in protein sequence
Minimizating the mutation rate

Genome distortion / Of the injected osteostrace life fluids
Increasing the rate of mutation in 566

Real insight into the / Likely biological mechanisms
It is necessary to have effective DNA repair systems
