A very violent death
finished with your miserable life,
in your body are happening lots of nervous spasms,
vomiting a mixture
of your kidney with blood
and repulsive white grubs as the colour that you saw when you
give your last shout of desperation

Nobody is worried - for your disappearance while
your body is rotting
now your brain is dead, you will never wake up,
of this eternal nightmare

Inside of your body, thousands of grubs,
are devouring, your internal organs

This causes an obstruction of the blood in your brain,
a lot of little insects drink the blood that is
inside of your putrid head

In your stomach a lot of horrendous chrysalis are forming
after a weed your body will be infested by moths
a troop of insects devour the rest of your
cancerous flesh, and your purulent and fragile skin
The moths die inside of your corpse,
a big dough of flesh and parts of guts is the best
food for more and more insects

The nature is wise...
