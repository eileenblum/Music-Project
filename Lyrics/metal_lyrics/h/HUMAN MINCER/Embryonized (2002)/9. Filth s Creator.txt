Jesus repose on the cross
death awaits its turn

Are you ready for the first suffering?
evangelic garbage now you are christ
three sentences, three victories, three hits of truth

The crucifixion is the revenge of God
God sacrifice you, you pay the mistakes, mercy and salvation

Dead in silence, dead on the cross
the killer penetrate the holy flesh

You are the sad excuse of your father
a toy or religion for manipulation
the reconciliation is denied
word of the hypocrisy you never survive

Bloody cross, bloody word, bloody Christ, bloody God
unholy storm falls down on the valley
bloody cross, bloody word, bloody Christ, bloody God

Blood and water on the cross
pain and confusion in your mind
divine sentence to make an idol
king of lost souls you can see the last sun
alone in the darkness fly to the heaven
fly with your people
to never return

Bloody cross, bloody word, bloody Christ, bloody God
divine sentence to make an idol
