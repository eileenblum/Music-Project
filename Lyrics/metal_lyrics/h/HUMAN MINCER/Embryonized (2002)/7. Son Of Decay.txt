You can see in her eyes the refection of petrubation,
and in her face the radiance of the extreme degeneration

Poor psychologist, you are blind
you don't understand her blessed act,
may be the ugly destiny, broken the faith and close the doors
when she loses the hope, everything ends

In dreams she can feel the intensity of her internal universe
the manifest of life in the entrails of one mother

But don't support the hate and suffering of the world
blood falls down in the street
the body engendered the sacrifice

Born son of decay, the way of your life is sentenced
open her your soul, she knows you don't like the world and go
to give you the solution for your existence
return to your creation find your salvation

Dead son of decay, by the bleeding of your body
your mother never lost you, she has you in her anatomy again

Eat the cadaver of birth, the ritual of flesh satisfy her appetite
now is the turn for the killer, goes to help you
in the other world
rest of flesh by the vaginal dissection, regurgitation of cadaver
repungant vision of her bloody vomit, this is the last injection of mortal venom!!

Dead son of decay, victim of neccessary
antropophage, created and destroyed
don't support the world, don't support reality
the ritual of flesh satisfy the mental appetite

In dreams she can feel the intensity of her internal universe
the manifest of life in the entrails of a mother
