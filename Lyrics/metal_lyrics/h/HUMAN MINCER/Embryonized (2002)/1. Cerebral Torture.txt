Feelings of hate, go over my veins
Damned remains, whip my brain

The Smell of your blood raise my instinct
The Angels squirm when I dream with you

Stained hands, by your dirty body
eternal suffering is awating me
I'm not going to waste my time
I only wish your incessant torture

In hell

Dreaming with no feel of your conscience
bringing in your fucking soul
I take control of your body
devouring your entrails

Tearing your sweet dreams
my teeth flows in vengeance
you will live in a nightmare
such as you give it to me

I will only rest, when you're dead
Retaliating my eternal pain
