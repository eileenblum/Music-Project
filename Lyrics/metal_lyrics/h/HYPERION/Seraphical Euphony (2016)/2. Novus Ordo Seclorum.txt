Signs of eyes antic repulsive
Sacrilege acts of cyanide seductions
Concealed truths, spurious statements
Spoiled minds shall be their slaves

Drawing out the black dilemmas
Blazing though the skylines
Contributing to their prosperity
Thee, false divine!

The final days have come as we bleach from exemption
Psychosis takes its place as we remain in deception

As humanity falls, into one standing course
Forecloses beliefs by our own made deceits
A New age to come, A New age to serve
In the last occasion we'll be awaken from their curse

The blood still rains in fever, as they die for their arts
To summon unknown forces far beyond our thoughts
For years they labour to fulfill their own demands
To breach this world's source, now they will tear down these doors

There will be great men to bare their master plan
Assassinations will be essential, they will prevail
A privilege crime to never dispute or expose
The machine still reigns by one force

Corrupted skies in eternal bless
As dystopia clashes to earthly rest
Dances of enigmatic acts
Our false perceptions reach us at last

(Reflections from a dark past
As time moves forth clarity becomes rayed
We repent our actions with detest
For we faced veracity at the end)

I saw the world fall into downward cycles
Depravity fills us as we crawl though ashes and bones
Where is the sanctuary for the dying calls?
Your words have only been deceitful
Those words we all died for
