Once a star deforms
Men shiver at the wake of its course
Once a soul depraves
Malevolent allegiance is forged

Yet in the midst of insanity
We strain, thus brightening our Flame
Beyond all human consciousness
Sanctifying lunacy

All regenerates within the cycle that is time
Eradicate your piteous foes
Their demise shall bring you bliss

And by the secrets of the

Black Void
Of Redemption
Ever Present
Mark in every human soul

Raging flames assail
The craven, abhorred and weak
For the age of reaping draws nigh
Our destiny beckons

Once your star deforms
All shivers at the wake of your cause
Once your soul obtains the splendour of candour and sin
