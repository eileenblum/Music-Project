Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall?
Am I to leave this haven of my rest?
This calm luxuriance of blissful light

All that is left of my lucent Empire
Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine
The blaze, the splendor and the symmetry
I cannot see, but darkness, death and darkness!

Despair not, oh Titan of the Sun
We shall reforge your once glorious bastion
And bathe in your everlasting strength

All of our ancestral powers lies shattered, forlorn and awaits our renewal
Those who aspire wisdom and truth will immerse in his flames

Is this the end, or a new beginning?
The worth of mine haven decreased
Shall the sinful works of the evil bring theâ¦ Fall?

No by Tellus and her briny robes
Over the fiery frontier of my realms
I shall advance and bid Saturn to take his throne again
