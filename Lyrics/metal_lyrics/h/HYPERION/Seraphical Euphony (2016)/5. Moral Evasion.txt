Raise the tide for every time I fall
Drown myself for the wretched fate
Fail to see the enemies
Claw inside the inner me

I tend to think in black and white
A grey-scale and a touch of red

Life hollow, no surrounding
Time is out, room is void
Absence in my sight

I'm following my shadow
Making sure that the light's
Always on my back

Left the surface to sever a day
From last and tomorrow, zetetic for clues
Underground and into time
Set my sights, (but) rights denied

I tend to think in black and white
A grey-scale and a touch of (the) red

As I try to be martyrising me
Why can't I see I cannot limit myself to this

I'm set to suffer, I
I'm set to do my time (my time)

Witches, demons come to me
Join my ride, pass through spite
Late in time I'll burn my soul
To wander through the atmospheric sphere
I will not look at the facts, I will not justify
To fulfill all your wishes (re)defining Moral Evasion

And the truths remain concealed
In depth forever more
