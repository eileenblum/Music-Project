As I see thy greed upon the ordinance
Disputed unholy seditions
Under the thirteenth shall I appear
Destroy the creation, the root of all fearâ¦ and doom

Unvarnished truth by the Zephyr Of Grace

Thy father giveth thee birth upon thine hands
Though, no light arise before me
Reaping the scars of my dreamy calamities
Whence comest thou? I need to feed upon thee

I shall turn the sun, black as sackcloth of hair
And the moon shall cry red drops of blood
Touching the surface of the decieveth of heaven
Where thy greed's no longer covered â despite the flooded

Bring me thy detest, for under the red moon shall I fall

Thou shalt see, I shan't pass over the sky
Nor shall I come forth into heaven
Nor shalt I walketh under the hands of god
My final breathings (shall) bring me to the burning sevens

With no sensation nor obligation
Nor any self-hatred about
Shan't these steps through the portal deny
The reversed blasphemy and take me through time

Grant me the heads, and the ten horns
And the ten crowns of hell
So shall the dragon worship the beast
And so shall we be worshiped in rewind

And thus my brethren, my fallen reverends
(Shall) the stars of heaven crush unto the earth
On the fields of the dying sun
Shall they depart as a scroll when it's rolled

With no regret nor sensing a threat
Shall those where the cowardly dwell cower
Though, remember these following words
For no sun will shine upon the purple flower

...and so they shall fall like stars from their ancient firmament
