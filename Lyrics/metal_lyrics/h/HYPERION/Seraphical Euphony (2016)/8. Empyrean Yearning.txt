"Perish, inferior vermin!"
His gaze imminent to the south
Futile Tatarian blood will not suffice

Roam! Wreak ail, havoc, subjugate defiers
Let none bereave your ever germinating might
From the plains of DelÃ¼Ã¼n Boldog to the mighty Khwarezmian forts
Your empire shall stand supreme - to erect the seal of worldwide reign

Be apprised to behold the malignancy of the great Khan!

The wall - adamant, rigid, harboring the kingdom beyond
Yet so unable to shelter their piteous lives as they circumvent it

Following the path along the grand impediment
Laced traps were concealed beneath the impending hordes
Faced with a throng of soldiers, putrid and corrupt
Who's fealty was as staunch as a hired force could be

Fierce pillaging and utter supremacy. The purge through salt and flame.
As embers fade into empyrean futility, dusk abates before atrophy descends.

And the fall of the metropolis dawns
With accommodation from their own treachery
A mighty dynasty elapses.
Storming into the attenuated fortress
Grace was utterly absent in rage
Slippery streets of humanly fat
A paragon made in aversion and dread

From whence the genesis comest in ire
Shall the worldwide domain tremble ablaze
Khwarezmian citadels crushed
Beneath fierce reprisal

A fraction of Ghengis's legion was sent
To survey the gallantry of the west
Yet meager defiance was shown
Thus sealing the kismet of realms beyond

What heinous atrocities he couldn't achieve
Throughout the era of his tellurian reign
His son would later attain
In otiose yearning nothing can thrive

He attempts to halter the carnal cycle
Though to no avail
For the great misfortune of human asinity resumes and nothing is reshaped
