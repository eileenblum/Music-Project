Each day I ask to myself
Where's the house of God
Each day I try to find it
But I find me all alone

Air: Walls of air are falling down
Now this is what I see

[CHORUS]
Shade of sin
Walking thru the lies
I'm your shade of sin
Running thru the time
Behind the shade of sin
Walking thru the lies
I'm your shade of sin
Shade of sin

Each day I ask your God
Can you save my life?
But I haven't found answers
Cause we are afraid to fight

Rage: Walls of rage grown in my mind
Madness, destruction, evil and pain
Will rule again

[CHORUS]

Each day I wait for the day
In which I'll see my rising force
Grow in the shade of God
To become the biggest storm

Lost: I am lost in this burning land
Where the sun is only a dream

[CHORUS]
