Chains around the time

This is the time to liken our secret lives
You love, your God, your honest world
And now remember that there's only one way
To break the chains with passed time

[BRIDGE]
Don't listen who tells you remain here
Comfortably you'll slowly die

Cause life means fight
And now we know we fight for us
On the edge of life, go back or fly
And now we know this is the time
To change the dreams in daily life

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
Chains around the time
Break the chains before you die
Scream your rage at the sky
Chains around the time
Break the chains before you die
Scream your rage at the sky
Before you die

My majesty; The unknown troubles of the world
Don't touch my mind, don't make me afraid
Now that I'm seeing what could be my way
I've found the one who gets me away

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

Immensity; The land that I'll conquer in time
From east to west, from hell to sky
And I'll stop when I'll take the starway
To get the name of the immortal
