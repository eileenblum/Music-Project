We don't know the destination
Like the tears fall from your face
In a lake of lies they're falling
Lost in labyrinth of mind

[BRIDGE]
I want to know the right direction
To find the promised land
I'll escape to search my destiny

Hear the silent cry of black swans
Swimming in a million tears
Searching in a drop of water
To realize my dream to

[CHORUS]
Ride, on the seven seas of life
In the darkened skies of fear
This dream will last forever
Time, to forget the blessed wins
In this labyrinth of sin
Your dream could be forever

Everyone gives right solution
To remove the mortal sin
We don't use their sacred answers
I've already plot my way

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
