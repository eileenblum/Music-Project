To reach for the sky and search a new land
Of wisdom and hope where stone is unscarred

No devastation, there's no domination
In front of divine judgement day
Cause the wind will take me away
No genuflection, no stupid reaction
In front of the God of the skies
Cause the wind will take my soul
And will take me away

[BRIDGE]
There's no temptation, there are no sensations
I'm living in eternal rest
I'll be dust in the wind
To reach for the sky and search a new land
Of wisdom and hope where stone is unscarred
Wherever the wind will call my name, I'll be there

[CHORUS]
Where the wind like a flame burns my eyes
Where the dreams kissed by fire burn my mind
Where the wind like a flame burns my eyes
Where the dreams kissed by fire burn my mind

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

Never-ending wind...
