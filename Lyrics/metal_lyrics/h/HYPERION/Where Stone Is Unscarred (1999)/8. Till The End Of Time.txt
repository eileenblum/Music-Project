Look at the red sunset
When the sky crosses the Nile
Look at the horizon
God came with his temple

[BRIDGE]
Lost in the mist of the past
The secret reamins
It'll never see the light
Under a century of stones

I'll be eternal
Over earth and skies
I'll be immortal
Till the end of time

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
Like a raven in the sky
Scanning future with my eyes
With the secret you can fly
Till the end of time
Like a raven in the sky
Scanning future with my eyes
With the secret you can fly
Till the end of time

Building the empire
Reinforcing my old secret
You'll know my power
You'll be my slaves forever

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
