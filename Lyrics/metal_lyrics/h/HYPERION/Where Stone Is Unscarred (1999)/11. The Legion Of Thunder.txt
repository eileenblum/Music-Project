Take me where the eagles fly
And wind displays its force against the time
Where legions come from hidden skies

[BRIDGE]
Vengeance and glory get higher and higher
Like sea and wind, we've got the absolute power
Thru the desert and mountains
The warriors are coming
Breaking the silent of desolate lands

Take where the heros cry
When kings and dragons rule to spread their might
If you can dream of this land, you'll be my guide

[CHORUS]
We are the fire that burns in your heart
We are the lords of legion of thunder
No one can live and no one can die
Without laws the legion of thunder rules
The legion of thunder rules

[CHORUS]

With the almighty crown
Over seas and lands
Like the kings of the world
We'll rule forever 'cause
We're the flames of the blazing blood
We've got a dream inside
We're ready to explode
To let it free

[BRIDGE]
