Look at the passed time
Someone hoped
Someone cried
Someone died
There's no mercy in the sky
To scape from the past
To forget my mistakes
And to find
A real reason to live

[BRIDGE]
Victory
In my dreams
You've waited too much time
To grow in mine

I'll go on my way
What I need
What I seek
All I want is being second to none

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
Temple of desire
May your walls be my kingdom
Temple of desire
Change my life in perpetual fire
Temple of desire
Temple of desire

And it's never too late
To realize your mistakes
And your sins
And to lift up your head

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

I'll go on my way
What I need
What I seek
All I want is being second to none
