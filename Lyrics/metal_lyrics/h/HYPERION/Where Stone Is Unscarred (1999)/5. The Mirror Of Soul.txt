It's time to open your wings
It's time to know the absolute truth
It's time to throw the mask away
And figt against sorrow and fear

[CHORUS]
Inside the mirror of soul
You'll find the reflection of your life

It's time to watch inside yourself
And to cry for all you have made
To see into the mirror of pain
And you'll recover yourself

[CHORUS]

Dance with the lifes of your friends
And fly on the land of sadness
Can you see a gleam of light
Can you see in your mind
The revenge of the spirit of wisdom

[CHORUS]

I believe in your force
And I'm sure that you can
Fight again without fear
To destroy the selfishness in you
