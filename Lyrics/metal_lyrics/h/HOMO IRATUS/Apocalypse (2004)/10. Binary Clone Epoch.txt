Subjected to digital restrains
Subjected to silence
The new order dictates

Masking confinement with joy
Flee or meet mental defeat

They make you feel alive
Or make you think you are
"Possessed" the urge "comply"
Parochial paraplegic minds

New age mental drugs
Sucking up your soul
To live is to consume
In omnivoric outbursts

Confined into oneself
Let others choose for you
Life's a real bitch
The hardest choices are the true ones
As multiple razors/sec
Slash through desiccated brains

A weapon in every home
Inflicts injuries that cause no pain

Fucked up / bent in two / psychotic / psychaotic
Stepped on / crushed / bewildered
Neuroconsumefreakbrainrotting

Bursts of light pierce through virgin eyes
Overloading infant brains
Suppressing minds lobotomising
With electric impulse strains

There's no pain in the procesS
