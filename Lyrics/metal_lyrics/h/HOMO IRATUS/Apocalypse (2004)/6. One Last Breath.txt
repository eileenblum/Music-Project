Gods of labs
Noble vows sworn
Tampered genomes
Picked and torn
Pest and virus sculpted vile
Inside the tubes of hybris

Zeroing down on us
To zero down us all
To zero down our soul
No chance to breathe
Even one last time...

Living hell on planet earth
A life with one foot set on death
Nano demons haunt the lives
Of experiment human cattle hives....

Lungs are torn apart
Eyes start to bleed
A raging success
A virus indeed

Deadly moleculeS
Are sucked in deep
As one last breath
Cuts sharp the weak

(The strong were sculpted
Cleansing has begun
All survivors shall now praise none)

The ones that survived
Take the place of those that had fallen
And in their turn hand their place
To the next to fall
(Till we all fall)

Now cell by cell
Nature denies innoculation
And the next fall
Will be the fall of all

(Innoculate your souls)
