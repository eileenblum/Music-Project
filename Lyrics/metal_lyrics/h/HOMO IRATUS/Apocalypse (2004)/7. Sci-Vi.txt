Scientific violence
Hi tech mass murder
Profit 100%
Human loss absolute

Punishment none
No chance to recuperate
Chances of repeating
The same mistakes 100%

Estimated time
Of healing the wounds....forever

Death sealed in concrete awaits
The epitaph of logic
Death sealed in concrete
The cenotaph of mankind

A dance of constructed demons
On an earthly hell
A world where science is god
A world where science
Was diminished to gold

Paying with our lives and souls
A debt we have not chosen to partake

In this sphere of obscenity
Every day a new page in the book
Of inhuman history spawned to remember
Is written in human blood

A mother weeps...
While she buries her only child
With the bare hands she raised it in the same soil that killed it
And now poisons her body as she digs the grave

No proper burial
No obituary
Ashes to ashes
To moleculation
To total extinction

Not a single trace of our existence
Will be left behind.
