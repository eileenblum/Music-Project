You will find me everywhere
In miserable shows of a cheap broadcast
In the hatred, born from ignorance
I am there...lurking

On your walks across streets
In words full of promises
Over microphones and...people

Born parasitically we procreate and
Multiply without interest for your life the
Reality you don't see....i have no purpose

I just consume and destroy
So many nulls
In the vastness of the mass

So, many, nulls
So, many, nulls

So many...innocents deceived
They hate and spit
And with the mud
They sculpt the demon

So, many, nulls
So, many, nulls

So many of innocents deceived
They hated and spat
And sank in the mud
They had created
