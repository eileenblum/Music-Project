Death is falling from the sky
Human masses
Burn in sacred, holy flames
"The sublime redeemer"
Throws up fire
Teaching pain

Fire and pain are interrelated

Death is falling from the sky
Mass hysteria, lost control
Pure black pain within the soul
Fear - the only feeling known

Tomahawk cruise messiah
Thus we killed morality
Tomahawk cruise messiah
Thus we murdered beauty

In this time of grief
Values detracted from our world
Hope has been devoured
Violence is now a way of life.
