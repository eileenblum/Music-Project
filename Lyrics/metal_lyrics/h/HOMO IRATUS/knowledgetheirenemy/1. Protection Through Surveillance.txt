Maximum protection, massive observation
While questions marks get rejected, orders are imposed
The eye custodes us all, protects us from delusion
The delusion of liberty under the watchfull eye

Under massive observation
Internal symbolic models collide
Functional fixity
Replaces spontaneous thought

A subjective depiction of our reality?
...Or "their" objective depiction?
In a time of fragile balances and unbalanced power
One finds it difficult to distinguish reality from
Reflection and truth from impression or which
Side of the mirror they are looking at...

Walkers on a path uncertain
In a world of prowlers being the prey
Living what seems to be full lives
Lives full of doubt

The will to will, evaporates
As will becomes the will
Of a universal step brother
In the tender hug
Of the false "democracy"

Daughter of tyrrant and of deceit

Sister to subjection
Sworn enemy of ( individual ) liberty
One be the argument of....
"Absolute protection"

Cleanse the tyrrant expose deceit

Under the watchful eye
