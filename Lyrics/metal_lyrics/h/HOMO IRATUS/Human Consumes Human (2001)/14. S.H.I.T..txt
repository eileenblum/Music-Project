Under the guidance of twisted minds
Knowledge was moulded into swords
And slashed its own possessors

As time passed
Knowledge got moulded into metal jackets
And was fired upon its own possessors

Some stood to think
What were they doing?
Why were they doing it?
They were killed...

Why devise our own plagues?
Why kill on the altar of wealth?
Why channel knowledge
Into homicidal ideas?
S.H.I.T

As the old age declined
Knowledge got moulded
Into weapons of mass destruction
And was unleashed upon its own possessors

Since they were made
To leave no one behind
Only the ones who got lucky survived

As the new age dawned
Nobody possessed any knowledge at all
It was the decline of mankind

In this age of supposed progress
The only things we have progressed on are:
Weapons
Diseases
Drugs
Pollution
Crime
While having the means of decreasing
These aspects of our so called evolution
We choose to put them in use and make
Our lives really fucking worse than they allready are
That is what got us here in the first place...
