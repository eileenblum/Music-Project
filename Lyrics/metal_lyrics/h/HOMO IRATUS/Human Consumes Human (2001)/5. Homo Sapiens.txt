Death in the name of a religion
Its provenance unknown
Violence in the name of a political idea
Who created it? unknown
Fascism, nationalism, racism, attack
Against the different, the unique
Against black, yellow, white and red
Condemned to subhuman logic
Who planted these ideas to the "slaves"?

Homo sapiens?

When did they exist?
Only exceptions
Of ego's comprehension
And of uniqueness

Homo sapiens?

Our fur has fallen
But we still got
The stones in our hands

Homo sapiens?
