In this sheepcote - society
Significance of feeling
Melts like plastic
The predominant factor
For a luminous future
Recedes and rots

The word love
Acquires new meaning...
...denoting mourning

Love left to rot
Once more
We judged life's values
With false criteria

We had the perfume of life
But we have chosen
The stench of the slaughterhouse

Now we're kneeling
On broken glasses
Worshiping paranoia.
