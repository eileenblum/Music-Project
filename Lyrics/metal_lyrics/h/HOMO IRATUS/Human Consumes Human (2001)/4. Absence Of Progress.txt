Progress in labor
On inactivity, in madness
On religion
On authority
Progress on drugs
On public hysteria
On chosen violence

No progress

Progress on arms
On authority use
On tv, on fascism
On the values that have
A price and number
On world's diversion

No progress
Absence of progress

Progress in murder
In terror, in vain
On false enlightenment
That blurs your eyes
Progress on drugs
On public hysteria
On chosen violence.
