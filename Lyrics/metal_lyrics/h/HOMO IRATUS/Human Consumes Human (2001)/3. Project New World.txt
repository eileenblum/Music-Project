Genocide - obliteration
Slaughter - in the name of god
Imposition - domination
Enslavement - extinguishment

Human consumes human
The stronger prevails
Human consumes human
The stronger dominates

Crimes of the "civilized"
Countless - inhuman
New world without hope
Full of corruption and loathing

Human consumes human
The stronger prevails
Human consumes human
The stronger dominates

New world of bloodshed
New world of pain

Human consumes human

New world of disgust and crime
World of corrupted morale
New world of disgust and crime
...of incinerated hope.
