Terror 
The passion of demise is a worm within our mind
It sucks and it swallows our logical thoughts
...And we have nothing but a sickening existence
Nothing but a drained mind

Psychotic murderers - psychedelic murders 
Generation of mental suffocation 
Schizophrenic animal behavior 
People of carnival into the grave of unreality 

Terror

Tragedy? Comedy?
We suffer laughing with tears in our eyes
Guilty we are and as guilty we suffer
For we are those who feed the worm.
