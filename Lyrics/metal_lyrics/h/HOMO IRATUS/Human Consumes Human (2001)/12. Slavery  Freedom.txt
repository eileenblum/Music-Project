Slaves of their creations
Absurd is the purpose
Of digital processing
Lack of communication
Outside the screen
Communication, power, freedom
Inside the screen
Silence and misery

Silence - technocratic
Silence - digital
Silence - new

Looking again at reality
Nothing changes
Everyone chooses
Life or insanity.
