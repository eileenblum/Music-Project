[Twisted sister cover]

We'll make it

Been fighting for so long don't know which way up is
Been stuck and ripped and burnt till it feels like nothin'
Our time will come and when it's over and it's done
Those fools are gonna know that we ain't bluffin'

[Chorus:]
We're gonna make it
We'll reach the top
We're gonna make it
And then we're never gonna stop

The power of the people ain't been showin'
It's never what you know, it's who you're knowin'
Sure it ain't right but as the saying goes it's might
That decides who stays behind and who'll be goin'

[Repeat Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus]

Alright, alright, we're gonna make it
Come on, boys, come on, boys
Ain't gonna stop until we drop
Oh, oh
Let it rock, let it roll
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Here we go, baby
