A flash in the night, a journey through time
The Templars are back on the streets
Guarded by prowess and the will to survive
All led by the guiding light

Angels of mercy, guardians of time
Shackled and chained through the eternal flame
The hammer will slowly arise

Heeding The Call, one and for all
Never surrender, with glory weï¿½ll fall
Brothers unite, letï¿½s stand up and fight
Fulfilling our fate, we are
Heeding The Call

One step ahead, revealing the past
United, together we stand
The call of the thunder, the sign to begin
This final crusade we will win

Angels of mercy, our journey must proceed
With hearts all filled up with chivalry
The lifeblood that we all need

Heeding The Call, one and for all
Never surrender, with glory weï¿½ll fall
Brothers unite, letï¿½s stand up and fight
Fulfilling our fate, we are Heeding The Call

Oh, oh, ohï¿½

Heeding The Call, one and for all
Never surrender, with glory weï¿½ll fall
Brothers unite, letï¿½s stand up and fight
Fulfilling our fate, we are Heeding The Call
