It's midnight, the clock strikes twelve
When the beasts come out and play
The headlines made it clear
Judgement day is near

They're crawling down the street
Sinking their razor teeth
They're knocking on every door
Now the steel begins to glow

They're vaporizing the earth, no mercy
Into the battle they thrust
With power and lust

Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave
Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave

There's something, a single spark
Out there in the dark
The metal is shining bright
Brings back hope and light

Bumber-to-bumber he reigns the wasteland
Turning their steel into dust, he will never rust

Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave
Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave

[Solo: Pontus]

All hail the chosen one - Fight proud, don't touch the sun
Come join our steel parade - Together in the last crusade
All drop the hammers down - Burn out, reclaim the crown
Speed demons never turn - at speed of light we ride, running flat-out let's crash and burn

They're vaporizing the earth, no mercy
Into the battle they thrust
Bumber-to-bumber he reigns the wasteland
Turning their steel into dust, he will never rust

Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave
Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave

Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave
Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave
