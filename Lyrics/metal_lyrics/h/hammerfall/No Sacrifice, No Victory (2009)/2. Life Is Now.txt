6 am, we still rush along
The open road and we're feeling strong
Another town - HEY! - just lay it down, down to the ground
Only our way, or the highway straight to hell

Never give up, never give in
Always ride out the storms, so fight
Never give up, never give in
It's your life make it right

Our life is not a fashion - Life is Now
Pedal to the metal - Life is Now
Our life is based on passion
And we live our lives the way we want

Hit the lights, time to bring it on
Ten thousand fists, they can not be wrong
We've come to slam - HEY! - the hammer down, never lose the game
Please come inside, do not be afraid, ain't no requiem

Never give up, never give in
Only one way to shout and scream
Never give up, never give in
Please take hold of your dream

Our life is not a fashion - Life is Now
Pedal to the metal - Life is Now
Our life is based on passion - Life is Now
And we live our lives the way we want

[Solo: Pontus]

Our life is not a fashion
Pedal to the metal
Our life is based on passion
And we live our lives the way we want

Our life is not a fashion
Pedal to the metal
Our life is based on passion
And we live our lives the way we want

Our life is not a fashion - Life is Now
Pedal to the metal - Life is Now
Our life is based on passion - Life is Now
And we live our lives the way we want - Life is Now

Our life is not a fashion - Life is Now
Pedal to the metal - Life is Now
Our life is based on passion - Life is Now
And we live our lives the way we want

Never give up, oh, never give in
This is your life, a thing you can't set aside
