Rising forces, thunder in the east
No fearless warrior could subdue the beast
No gallant man around could stand and hold his ground

Days passed by and weeks turned into years
Every drip of hope became a sea of fears
Somewhere in the dark, a light or just a spark

Brothers in arms fighting one for all
Fearless and wild we stand tall, one of a kind
No turning back, brothers fight or fall
Standing together, we fight, one of a kind

Years of darkness all torn by fate's hand
A nation cursed, once glorious and grand
From the ashes we will rise, like a Phoenix to the skies

Brothers in arms fighting one for all
Fearless and wild we stand tall, one of a kind
No turning back, brothers fight or fall
Standing together, we fight, one of a kind

[Solo: Oscar]

Come take my hand, don't leave me here all alone
Come make a stand, don't let us all fade away, fade away

[Solo: Pontus]

1666  - We stood in the valley of death
Steel in our hands, the final command
To cure and to heal our nation

Mighty warriors - mount up don't stare at the ground
Hold your heads high, resist and defy
Fighting, defending, we're screaming, avenging you all
We're standing all for one for all
One voice we're one of a kind, we are
Never look back, never surrender

We're fighting all for one for all
One heart, we're one of a kind, we are
Cause we are here and we are fighting

Brothers in arms fighting one for all
Fearless and wild we stand tall, one of a kind
No turning back, brothers fight or fall
Standing together, we fight, one of a kind

Fighting, defending, we're screaming, avenging you all

One of a kind
