The war still remains
No Kingdom on earth
There's only pure evil, indifference to birth

In the tombs of the dead
One man breeds alone
The unearthly warfare shadows the throne

Three temptations written down
The Lust of flesh, lust of the eyes
Finally the pride of life

The Demon Twelve, the hell hounds
My name is Legion, for we are many spirits inside of one
To build a land of chaos, brought forth from the Abyss
My name is Legion, and we bring destruction and death

Possessing his soul
The curse of the damned
A tormented victim, to the bottom he's slammed

One man stands alone
Tripped, under a spell
Encounter your demons, send them to Hell

No temptations left to fend
Sanctified, Anti Christ
Casting shadows towards the cross

The Demon Twelve, the hell hounds
My name is Legion, for we are many spirits inside of one
To build a land of chaos, brought forth from the Abyss
My name is Legion, and we bring destruction and death

[Solo: Pontus, Oscar, Pontus, Oscar, Pontus, Oscar, Pontus, Oscar, Pontus, Oscar]

The Demon Twelve, the hell hounds
My name is Legion, for we are many spirits inside of one
To build a land of chaos, brought forth from the Abyss
My name is Legion, and we bring destruction and death
