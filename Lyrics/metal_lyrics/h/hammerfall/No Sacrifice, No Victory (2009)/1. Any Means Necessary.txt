I won't pull the trigger

Just to see you die
No remedy to make me come alive

I'm ticking like a timebomb,

(Need) no fuse, just guts and gore
(To) initiate the burning of the core

I count down to zero, pull the trigger, no parole
No mercy, have mercy, no mercy on your soul

Kill by any means necessary
Win by any means necessary
Live by any means necessary
Die by any means necessary

I am not judgemental
A sinner nor a saint
Cause either you're my best friend or you ain't

Come gather here around me
feel my breath under your skin
I'm deadly, only when I'm getting caught

Counting down to zero, I'm a soldier without soul
No mercy, have mercy, no mercy on your soul

Kill by any means necessary
Win by any means necessary
Live by any means necessary
Die by any means necessary

I am born to kill - Judge and condemn
I am born to win - Slay and maim 'em
I am born to live - Fight for glory
I am born to die

Kill - Win - Live - Die

[Solo: Oscar, Pontus, Oscar]

Kill by any means necessary
Win by any means necessary
Live by any means necessary
Die by any means necessary

I am born to kill - Judge and condemn
I am born to win - Slay and maim 'em
I am born to live - Fight for glory
I am born to die - Memento mori

I am born to kill - Judge and condemn
I am born to win - Slay and maim 'em
I am born to live - Fight for glory
I am born to die - Memento mori...
