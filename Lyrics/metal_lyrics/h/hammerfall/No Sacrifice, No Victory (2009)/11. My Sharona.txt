Oh. my little pretty one, ah pretty one
When you gonna give me some time, Sharona
Ooh you make my motor run, my motor run
Gun it coming off of the line, Sharona
Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind
I always get it up from the touch of the younger kind
My my my ay ay - HEY!
Ma-ma-ma My Sharona
Come a little closer huh, ah will ya huh
Close enough to look in my eyes, Sharona
Keep a little mystery, kissin' me

Runnin' down the length of my thigh, Sharona
Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind
I always get it up with the touch of the younger kind
My my my ay ay - HEY!
Ma-ma-ma My Sharona
Ma-ma-ma My Sharona

[Solo: Pontus]

When ya gonna get to me, g-get to me
Is it just a matter of time Sharona
Is it d-d-destiny, d-destiny
Or is it just a game in my mind, Sharona

Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind
I always get it up from the touch of the younger kind
My my my ay ay - HEY!
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
My my my ay ay - HEY!
Ma-ma-ma My Sharona
Ma-ma-ma My Sharona
Ma-ma-ma My Sharona

[Solo: Pontus]

Ooooh, My Sharona
Ooooh, My Sharona
Ooooh, My Sharona
