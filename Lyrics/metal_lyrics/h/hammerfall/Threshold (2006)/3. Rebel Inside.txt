A battle with pride and ego.
A journey that started long ago.
Life time of passion and war.
Rebel Inside.

Legends in our lifetime.
We have our hearts set in the past.
And eyes towards the future.
Rebel Inside.

The thunder 5 are riding once again.
Hell bent on blazing our own trail.
To seek out fortune and the fame.
We're warriors, warriors.

We're sick and tired of trying to explain.
That it's a life it's not a game.
The need to be will never wane.
We're warriors, warriors.

Rebel Inside, rebel for life.
Rebel Inside.

We'll never bend or bow we'll be
Always unbroken can't you see
We deal in steel and liberty.
We're immortalized, immortalized.

Realize it's not just how we are.
It's in our blood to seek the stars.
The crimson red will take us far.
We're immortalized, immortalized.

Rebel Inside, rebel for life.
Rebel Inside.

[Solo: Stefan]

A battle with pride and ego.

Rebel Inside.

Rebel Inside, rebel for life.
Rebel Inside, rebel for life.
Rebel Inside, rebel for life.
Rebel Inside, rebel for life.
