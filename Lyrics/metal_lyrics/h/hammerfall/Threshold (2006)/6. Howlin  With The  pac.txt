There is a crying in the nightfall.
There is a howling in the wind.
And when the urge is getting stronger.
We hit the streets, the city calls.
The night is free for all.
We rule the dark and we do as we please.
And nothing can stop us.
No time to catch some Z's.

Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Fighting for the right to be.
Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Templars of the first degree.

We never minded any warnings.
Or asked directions from the stars.
And when the moon stops it's ascending.
We feel the rush, the inner glow.
The crimson will flow.
We have the might, and the power to succeed
And nothing can stop us.
'Cause we're the restless breed.

Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Fighting for the right to be.
Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Templars of the first degree.

And when our allegiance is falling down.
We will crawl back from hell.
Reclaim the crown.
The sign is shining for us.
Its glow will lead us on our way.
When we are led astray.
No, no!

Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Templars of the first degree.

Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Fighting for the right to be.
Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Templars of the first degree.
