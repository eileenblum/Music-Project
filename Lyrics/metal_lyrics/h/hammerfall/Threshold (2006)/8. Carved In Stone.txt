There's silence, in the dark.
There's the fire, ready to start.
Stone pages, inked by fury.
The exception of the damned.

They are calling, out my name.
Come join us and carry the flame.
Our precious time, is standing still.
When the future meets the past.

No freedom, no glory.
There's no future, no past.

This will be our one last wish, one last dream.
When you follow the masses, or follow your own.
One last chance, one last dream.
Before your future will be, Carved In Stone.

I remember, what they said.
I still hear them, inside me head.
The legions of damnation.
They keep calling out my name.

The wind blows, forever.
But the time standing still.

This will be our one last wish, one last dream.
When you follow the masses, or follow your own.
One last chance, one last dream.
Before your future will be, Carved In Stone.

Knock, knock on my door.
Please revoke what you're asking for.

One last wish, one last dream.
When you follow the masses, or follow your own.
One last chance, one last dream.
Before your future will be...

One last wish, one last dream. (Carved In Stone)
When you follow the masses, or follow your own.
One last chance, one last dream. (Carved In Stone)
Before your future will be, Carved In Stone.
