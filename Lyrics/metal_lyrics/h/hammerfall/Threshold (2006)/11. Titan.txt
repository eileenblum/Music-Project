The gate is closed, the sky is burning.
Dark clouds of claw set in.
A world at war, no revelation could help predict a mankind fall.
Somewhere above, the unpolluted skies, we'll be resurrected.
What have we done? We payed the highest price.
No shelter for the undeserving masses.

Standing in line for a final journey.
Into space and beyond.
A final sigh, a breath of hope we gather, heed the eternal call.
Counting the stars, we pull the shortest straw, life is fading rapidly.
Nothing remains, a withered devil's claw.
Soul survivors picking up the pieces.

Titan.
Even the dark has a silver lining.
Titan.
Shining bright so far beyond the sun.

So this is a new beginning.
So far away, so far away.

We leave the past behind us.
No turning back, no turning back.

Titan.
Even the dark has a silver lining.
Titan, Titan.
Shining bright so far beyond the sun.
Titan.
Even the dark has a silver lining.
Titan, Titan.
Shining bright so far beyond the sun.

We will fly.
We're flying into space.
Fly, fly away.
We're flying into space.
