Once there was a time when we were standing
Back to back against the whole conception
Once we had it all the world was our pleasure dome

Times were changing fast, our dreams were fading
Black, the darkness fell on our creation
Time was running out, we were falling one by one

We live by honour - We fight for freedom
We die but you can't slay our pride

[Chorus:]
Behind these walls, we deem, take a hold of the dream
To live our lives as we please - Metal Genocide
No fear, we know the end is near
One day we will retaliate - Genocide

Fall, mighty Babylon, your might is declining
Fast, you're on your knees repent your sinning
Fall beyond the realms of hell, we are born again

We live by honour - We fight for freedom
We die but you can't slay our pride

[Chorus]

[Solo: Stefan]

[Chorus x2]
