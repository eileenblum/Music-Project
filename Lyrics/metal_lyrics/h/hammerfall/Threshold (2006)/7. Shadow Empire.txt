As I open up my eyes.
I see a face I don't recognize.
If the mirror tells the truth.
Then who the hell am I?
I scan the surface I am low.
What arises from above.
Everything I can't detect.
Not a thing I will deflect.

Countdown, I'm coming through.
And the vengeance, and the taker.
And the one, that shining sun.

Shadow Empire.
Shadow Empire.
The rise of the machine.
Shadow Empire.
Shadow Empire.
They rise up from the graves, to steal our dreams.

I see the world in infrared.
Hear the voices of the dead.
I'm half man and half machine.
The essence of your dream.
Soon the judgement bell will toll.
We'll take back everything they stole.
And then judge the hammer fall.
Liberty and metal for all.

Countdown, your time has come.
And the vengeance, you're in danger.
You're the one, let justice be done.

Shadow Empire.
Shadow Empire.
The rise of the machine.
Shadow Empire.
Shadow Empire.
They rise up from the graves, to steal our vivid dreams.

In my heart there is always winter.
Can not rest until I found the master key.
The master key of trust.
In my mind the arctic wind blows.
Can not sleep I can not rest before the dawn brings back the light.
Light of day.

[Solo: Stefan]

Shadow Empire.
Shadow Empire.
The rise of the machine.
Shadow Empire.
Shadow Empire.
They rise up from the graves, to steal our vivid dreams.
