It's been a long cold winter, widespread snowfall, raging storms.
Caught in winds delusions, of our heart and soul.
He came down from the mountains, into our own frozen world.
Spoke of revolution, fed us with his words.
A sacred man, from the other side.
He gave us something to believe in.
How could we be so blind?

His right hand gave us freedom, while the other stole the pride.
Thought he had the answers, standing by his side.
Tales of a world, not so far away.
We got entangled in his vows.
How could we be so blind?

When the sun and moon unite.
Fear Dark Winged messenger, dread his darkened words.

[Solo: Stefan]

A graven image shattered, a meltdown of our wonderland.
As the sun raised slowly, we tried to understand.
A sacred heart, lost prosperity.
But we found a way back home.
From dusk came clarity.

When the sun and moon unite.
Fear the Dark Winged messenger, dread his darkened words.

When the sun and moon unite.
Fear the Dark Winged messenger, dread his darkened words.
