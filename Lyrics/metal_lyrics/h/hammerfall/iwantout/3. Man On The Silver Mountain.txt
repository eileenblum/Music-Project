[Original By Rainbow]

Iï¿½m a wheel, Iï¿½m a wheel
I can roll, I can feel
And you canï¿½t stop me turning
ï¿½cause Iï¿½m the sun, Iï¿½m the sun
I can move, I can run
But youï¿½ll never stop me burning

[*]
Come down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Someoneï¿½s screaming my name
Come and make me holy again
Iï¿½m the man on the silver mountain
Iï¿½m the man on the silver mountain

Iï¿½m the day, Iï¿½m the day
I can show you the way
And look Iï¿½m right beside you
Iï¿½m the night, Iï¿½m the night
Iï¿½m the dark and the light
With eyes that see inside you

[* x2]

Just look at me and listen
Iï¿½m the man, the man, give you my hand
Come down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Iï¿½m the man on the silver mountain
Iï¿½m the man on the silver mountain
Iï¿½m the night the light
The black and the white
The man on the Silver Mountain
