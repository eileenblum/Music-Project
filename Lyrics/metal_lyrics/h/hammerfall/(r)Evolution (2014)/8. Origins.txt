Once upon a time not far away
We all swore the oath to seize the day
Moving on at the speed of light
Still united, undivided

Weâre brothers in arms searching for gold and glory
Stay true to your heart, come follow, heed the call
But nothingâs forever, no nothing at all

Come inside, true templars of the world
Raise your voice, letâs speak for the unheard
On and on the story must go on
Running free we always will be

We are what we are and we always strive for glory
Together as one we shine like the sun
Beyond the divine weâre soaring

SHINING ON SO GLORIOUS, THE BLOODLINE OF TRUE WARRIORS
FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT TO BE; PART OF THE LEGACY

SEARCHING FOR THE RAINBOW'S END
THE GOLD AWAITS FOR YOU MY FRIEND
COURAGE IS YOUR GUIDING STAR
AND IT WILL TAKE YOU FAR
