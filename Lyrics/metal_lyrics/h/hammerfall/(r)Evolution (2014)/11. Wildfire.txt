WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE

I am the one running out of control
I am faster than the speed of light
There is a darkness surrounding my life
And its claws gotta hold of my sight

Iâm leaving the past behind, wander off into the wild
Pin down my future at last, moving on nowhere fast

LIKE A WILDFIRE
WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE

Hellbent for metal it clouded my mind
Like a force of destruction and rage
Possessed by possessions, it all choked me up
I must fly bursting out of my cage

Iâm free, set at liberty, no chains are pinning me down
My scornful eye takes me places, no one dares to go

LIKE A WILDFIRE
WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE
WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE

Bathe in the rays of the sun
Feeding my inner flame
Why are we wasting our time
Watching horizons go down
Standing there patient in one fine line

WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE
WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE
