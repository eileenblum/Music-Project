Many times this story has been told
A legendary tale, a fable, brave and bold

Now your blood begins to boil
Turn the crank of all the toil
Raise your fist and yell, born again

LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD

Caught up in a maze nowhere to go
Suppressed by powers endless deep of pain and woe

Come on, break your inner chains
Feel the power in your veins
Raise your fist and yell, born again

LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD

Now your blood begins to boil
Turn the crank of all the toil
Raise your fist and cry out loud, born again

LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD

LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD

LIVE LIFE LOUD
