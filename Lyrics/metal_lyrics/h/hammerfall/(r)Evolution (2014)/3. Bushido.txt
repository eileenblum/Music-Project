Screaming and twisting
He's pounding his sword to the ground
A soul made of fire
A heart made of solid steel, fear the sound

Guided by courage
The fear of eternal disgrace
The spirits of daring
The trail of his life brought fail to embrace

Trapped in the corner, hell or paradise
Forever failure or self-sacrifice

I'M A WARRIOR, I AM
In the rising sun I stand
MY TRUE COLOURS SHINING BRIGHT
INSIDE AEONIAN FLAMES

Winding and turning
He's seeking a path to survive
The hunter's the hunted
The spectre within will soon come alive

The spirit of bearing by seven diverges unite
Never surrender, be ready to kill
When killing is right

Shame and dishonor, the wrath of the sword
Beyond all bearings, the honor restored

I'M A WARRIOR, I AM
In the rising sun I stand
MY TRUE COLOURS SHINING BRIGHT
INSIDE AEONIAN FLAMES

I'M A WARRIOR, I AM
I'm a soldier under command
IN THE SETTING SUN I'LL CARRY ON
The code of the warrior soul

Honour, courage and rectitude
Tempered by ancient wisdom
One law, one life in solitude
Live by the code, die by the sword

I'M A WARRIOR, I AM
IN THE RISING SUN I STAND
MY TRUE COLOURS SHINING BRIGHT
INSIDE AEONIAN FLAMES

I'M A WARRIOR, I AM
In the rising sun I stand
MY TRUE COLOURS SHINING BRIGHT
INSIDE AEONIAN FLAMES

I'M A WARRIOR, I AM
I'm a soldier under command
IN THE SETTING SUN I'LL CARRY ON
The code of the warrior soul

This is the way!
