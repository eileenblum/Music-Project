Whoâs there
Walking the shadows I fear
I am in deep
The nightmares they wonât disappear
Leave me alone

Lay down
Lay down your arms on the ground
Youâve been sent here
To champion for the unbound, yeah

Satan's scheme falls into place
An evil grin upon his face

No fear
The duels about to begin
Iâve got a black hand
The hand of the dead man can win, yeah

Satan slips another ace
A thousand souls will fall from grace

EVIL INCARNATE, THE SON OF MAN
LOST TO THE GREAT DECEIVER
EVIL INCARNATE, I FAILED THE PLAN
A NEW INCEPTION REIGNS

EVIL INCARNATE, THE SON OF MAN
LOST TO THE GREAT DECEIVER
EVIL INCARNATE, I FAILED THE PLAN
A NEW INCEPTION REIGNS
