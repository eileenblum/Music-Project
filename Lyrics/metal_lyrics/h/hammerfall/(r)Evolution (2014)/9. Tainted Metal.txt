Hear the screams from down below
The cry of the raven, the demons and wizards
In league with the dark

Feed the fire nourish the flames
The hammer is pounding the steel in its grace
By via crucis, embraced

Born out of wedlock, the spirit is lost
Ordeal of ingestion, the way of the cross

OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL
TAINTED METAL

No return nowhere to go
The wands of the wizards call demons to fetter
Their heart broken souls

Face the fire, defiling the steel
The blood of the heathens, their guts and their gore
Weakens the sword to the core

Born out of wedlock, the future came fast
Trial by fire, iconoclast

OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL
TAINTED METAL
OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL
TAINTED METAL
BLACKENS THE POWER OF STEEL

Born out of wedlock, the spirit is lost
Ordeal of ingestion, ordeal of the cross

OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL
TAINTED METAL
OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL
TAINTED METAL
BLACKENS THE POWER OF STEEL

Oh...

OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL

OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL

OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL
