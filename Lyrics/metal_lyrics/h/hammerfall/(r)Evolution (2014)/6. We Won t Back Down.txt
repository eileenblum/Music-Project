Silence, we have sworn
The oath, protect the earth, the sun and moon
My precious friends
United we stand âtill the end

The vision, futureâs demand
Has been written in the palm of our hands
When we charge the storm clouds amass
Cause the ace of swords will lead on this glorious day

HOLD YOUR HEADS HIGH
REACH FOR THE SKY
NEVER SURRENDER
WE WON'T BACK DOWN
THE POWER WITHIN
OUR REMEDY FOR SIN
THE TRUE LIFE DEFENDERS
WE WON'T BACK DOWN

Battles, we have won
We bled, but never once weâve fallen down
Form dusk âtill dawn
Standing with our mighty swords drawn

The future lies straight ahead
Our dreams within reach, not mislead
We are here, true warriors on the line
Forever weâll be the sun in the tarot deck of cards

HOLD YOUR HEADS HIGH
REACH FOR THE SKY
NEVER SURRENDER
WE WON'T BACK DOWN
THE POWER WITHIN
OUR REMEDY FOR SIN
THE TRUE LIFE DEFENDERS
WE WON'T BACK DOWN

Cause the ace of swords will lead on this glorious day

HOLD YOUR HEADS HIGH
REACH FOR THE SKY
NEVER SURRENDER
WE WON'T BACK DOWN
THE POWER WITHIN
OUR REMEDY FOR SIN
THE TRUE LIFE DEFENDERS
WE WON'T BACK DOWN
WE WON'T BACK DOWN
WE WON'T BACK DOWN

We won't back down, we are partners in crime
We are true life defenders on earth
