So here I am once more, the devil in disguise
You've seen me before
I stray the earth alone, across the seven seas
To settle the score

I stand behind, I am your dark reflection
Last thing you see when you die

DEMONIZED
POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL, I'M IN DISGUISE
A BLACK-HEARTED SOUL SCREAMING ALL BUT LIES
WELCOME TO ENTER MY FINAL MASS
A SINISTER SNAKE IN THE GRASS

So many times before
I've seen the world go down
By the touch of my hand
So if you wanna fly, wanna fly across the sky
To find the promised land

Your wings will burn
There's nothing left above us
A paradise lost to my crown
You spread your wings, melting in the sunlight
The fear of the future, hands down

DEMONIZED
POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL, I'M IN DISGUISE
A BLACK-HEARTED SOUL SCREAMING ALL BUT LIES
WELCOME TO ENTER MY FINAL MASS
A SINISTER SNAKE IN THE GRASS

I'm strung-out, I am the air that you breathe
I will make you choke, addicted
I feed on your needs

DEMONIZED
POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL, I'M IN DISGUISE
A BLACK-HEARTED SOUL SCREAMING ALL BUT LIES
WELCOME TO ENTER MY FINAL MASS
A SINISTER SNAKE IN THE GRASS

DEMONIZED
POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL, I'M IN DISGUISE
A BLACK-HEARTED SOUL SCREAMING ALL BUT LIES
WELCOME TO ENTER MY FINAL MASS
A SINISTER SNAKE IN THE GRASS
