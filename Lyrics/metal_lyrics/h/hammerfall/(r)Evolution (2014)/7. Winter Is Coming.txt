The passion of broken hearts, the passion of pain
Flames of the mortal world, the fire still burns

Out of the dark, the winter is coming

The passion of broken souls, their passion is pain
Forever crying, forever dead

OUT OF THE DARK, THE WINTER IS COMING
OUT OF THE DARK, THE WINTER IS NEAR

I am lost in confusion
I am trapped between worlds
Iâm a wolf on the prowl in the night
Take the black, you win or you die

First of the ancient men, the bloodline is strong
A star from beyond the wall will rescue us all?

OUT OF THE DARK, THE WINTER IS COMING
OUT OF THE DARK, THE WINTER IS HERE
