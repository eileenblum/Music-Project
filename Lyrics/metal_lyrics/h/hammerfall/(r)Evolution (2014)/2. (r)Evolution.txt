Heed the words, my son
Here is where my journey ends
I pass my legacy, for you to carry on

You are the future, I am the past
These words of wisdom might be my very last

The insurrection will show your direction
After years of deceit
The futureâs in deadlock the peal of the death clock
A red-blooded brick in the wall

Retrogression here in neverland
Carry through utopia

(R)EVOLUTION - RISE AND RESIST
(R)EVOLUTION - FIGHT TO EXIST
(R)EVOLUTION - A WRECKING BALL
(R)EVOLUTION - FREE FOR ALL

Years of oppression, dark agony
No evolution, the unborns dim destiny

Retaliation unite our nations
All give heed to the call
Youâre the selected, preferred and elected
A red-blooded brick in the wall

Wave your banners here in neverland
Speak up for utopia

(R)EVOLUTION - RISE AND RESIST
(R)EVOLUTION - FIGHT TO EXIST
(R)EVOLUTION - A WRECKING BALL
(R)EVOLUTION - FREE FOR ALL

Cause no sticks and stones
Could ever break my bones
Nor their words
Could ever quench my soul

(R)EVOLUTION - RISE AND RESIST
(R)EVOLUTION - FIGHT TO EXIST
(R)EVOLUTION - A WRECKING BALL
(R)EVOLUTION - FREE FOR ALL

(R)EVOLUTION - RISE AND RESIST
(R)EVOLUTION - FIGHT TO EXIST
(R)EVOLUTION - A WRECKING BALL
(R)EVOLUTION - FREE FOR ALL
