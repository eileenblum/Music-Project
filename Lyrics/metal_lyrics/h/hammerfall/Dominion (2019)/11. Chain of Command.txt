Been quiet from ages past
We held our peace, condoned our enemies
The desolation, destruction of the nation
Enough, can't take it anymore

March out like true warriors
Go forth and stir up your zeal
In battle we shout, we roar
We honour the name of our lord

Follow the chain, follow the chain
Follow the chain, follow the chain
The chain of command

He's fighting under command
A man of war, protector of this land
Come guide us to glory, ignite the purgatory
The flames turn darkness into light

He marches like a champion
He reigns the sun and the moon
In battle he shouts out loud
He triumphs his sworn enemies

Follow the chain, follow the chain
Follow the chain, follow the chain
The chain of command

[Guitar solo]

Follow the chain, follow the chain
Follow the chain, follow the chain
The chain of command
Follow the chain, follow the chain
(Don't you break it, just follow the chain)
Follow the chain, follow the chain
The chain of command
