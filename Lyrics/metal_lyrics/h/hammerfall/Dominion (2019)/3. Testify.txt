Testify

Testify, testify
Testify, testify

I'm electric, energetic
Quite high on life's epiphanies
I don't need no two-time weasel
To judge my way based on their bigotry

Rattle the cage, time to taunt the cobras
Tell me, what tongue do you speak?
And where is your almighty God in great need?

Down on your knees (Testify)
Pray your souls to keep (Testify)
Now the wolf's at the gate (Testify)
To seal your true life and fate (Testify)

Be the prophet, the creator
And master your own universe
False crusaders, God's dictators
Reclaim the fate, our freedom, lift the curse

Rattle the cage, waiting for the rapture
Free me from your tainted deeds
Infected, primeval, retarded beliefs

Down on your knees (Testify)
Pray your souls to keep (Testify)
Now the wolf's at the gate (Testify)
To seal your true life and fate (Testify)

[Guitar solo]

On the first day of man
He invented this sham
Fabrications forged by evil, spiteful, twisted minds

Rattle the cage, waiting for the answer
Tell me now, how do you plea?
And where is your almighty God in great need?

Down on your knees (Testify)
Pray your souls to keep (Testify)
Now the wolf's at the gate (Testify)
To seal your true life and fate (Testify)
