The board's on the table
All the candles alive
Time to wake up our senses
Build the bridges to the other side
Take your place in the circle
And keep your eyes shut
Invoking the darkness
Never taunt or goad the spirit world

The circle is solid, unbroken
The first of the wonders outspoken
Tell me when I'm gonna die

You will be dead by dawn
When the bells of hell strike six, six, six
You will be dead by dawn
Say your prayers and grab your crucifix

There's a spirit among us
As evil evil can be
A paranormal encounter
Draw the number of infinity
I've been with you forever
Walked by your side
You wanted an answer
Better watch out what you're asking for

My hands start to shake and shiver
The board starts to glow and deliver
Three, two, one, let's say goodbye

You will be dead by dawn
When the bells of hell strike six, six, six
You will be dead by dawn
Say your prayers and grab your crucifix
You will be dead by dawn
Now the bells of hell strike six, six, six
You will be dead by dawn
Say your prayers and grab your crucifix

The answer to your question
Is an answer you cannot recall
You summoned the evil spirits
And you got the demon Baal

[Guitar solo]

You will be dead by dawn
When the bells of hell strike six, six, six
You will be dead by dawn
Say your prayers and grab your crucifix
You will be dead by dawn (Dead by dawn)
When the bells of hell strike six, six, six
You will be dead by dawn (Dead by dawn)
Say your prayers and grab your crucifix
