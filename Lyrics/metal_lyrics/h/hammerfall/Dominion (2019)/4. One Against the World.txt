The night's riding in as the lights go down
It's time, heed the call
Psyched up expectations erupting in us all
Playing to win, now let the madness begin

Templars of the world
Victorious immortals
Thunder up your souls
Rebel and shout out loud

We are what we are and we do whatever we want to do
Metal heart crusaders, our dreams we must pursue
In for the kill, charged by the power of will

Templars of the world
Victorious immortals
Thunder up your souls
Rebel and shout out loud

Templars of the world
Victorious immortals
Thunder up your souls
Rebel and shout out loud
Ante up your game
The modern time crusaders
Power up your immortal souls
Be one against the world

We are one
We are the one
