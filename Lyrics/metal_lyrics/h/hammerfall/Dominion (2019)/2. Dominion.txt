Dominion

In solitude's society
The evil breeds, autocracy (Dominion)
The fall of man, no son of God
Can tame the flames, welcome to Hell

Oh Lucifer, almighty one
The overlord of Babylon (Dominion)
Apostles' creed, the demon seed
The mammon rules the misery

At the final battle
On the first day of war
Where angels die and legends rise
Only one man survives

Serve in Heaven or reign in Hell
Find your Paradise Lost
Rise, awake or forever be
Fallen in the abyss

The purge of God, banished to Hell
Angelic hordes and a warrior (Dominion)
The chosen one will brave the storm
Awake, arise and claim the throne

At the final battle
On the third day of war
A warrior-shaped demon lord
Came to conquer them all

Serve in Heaven or reign in Hell
Find your Paradise Lost
Rise, awake or forever be
Fallen in the abyss

[Guitar solo]

Serve in Heaven or reign in Hell
Find your Paradise Lost
Rise, awake or forever be
Fallen, welcome to Hell
Serve in Heaven or reign in Hell
Find your Paradise Lost
Rise, awake or forever be
Fallen in the abyss
