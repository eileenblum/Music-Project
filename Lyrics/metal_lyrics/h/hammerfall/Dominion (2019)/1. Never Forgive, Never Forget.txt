For their freedom, we are fighting
One click from the trail
Suffer shell shock, peace in deadlock
Immoral carnage prevail
We are soldiers on the line
And this is what we do
Rolling thunder, kill them all
Come hell or high water

Never forgive, never forget
Never forgive, never forget

Just embrace it, run the gauntlet
Down south of the Ho'
Guns are blazing, hell is raising
Call for Agent O
Combat's fast and furious
Behind the enemy lines
The dragon lady fuels the fire
Rain hell from the skies

Never forgive, never forget
Never forgive, never forget

You can kill ten of mine
For every one I kill of yours
Can you smell the scent of victory falling from the sky?
Hey LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?

[Guitar solo]

Combat's fast and furious
Behind the enemy lines
The dragon lady fuels the fire
Rain hell from the skies

Never forgive, never forget
Never forgive, never forget
Never forgive, never forget
Never forgive, never forget
