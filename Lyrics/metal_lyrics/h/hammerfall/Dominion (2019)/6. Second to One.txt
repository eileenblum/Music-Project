You can never escape from your heart
That inner guide, the voice in the dark
Stop and listen just once in a while
To what it has to say
I remember the day when we met
Your love was true, my life was a mess
I knew fate was a one way street
But we were meant to be

You're my honest cause
Never ending strive to become better than I am
You're the sweetest sound
The note that explains the symphony

I know I can't hide anymore
My head is up, my feet on the floor
And you know I cannot lie anymore
When I look into your eyes
Fear of failure will all bring us down
To darkened places where dreams go to die
I pretend to be strong, but I'm weak
You make my life complete

Everything must change yet remain the same
But nothing stays forever
I will take your pain
You are my everlasting flame

My second to one

Oh, I cannot lie
No, I cannot hide when I look into your eyes
Everything I say
Everything I do, I do for you
I will resurrect
I have found myself, a knight in shining armour
When you call my name
I will be your needle for the pain

My second to one
