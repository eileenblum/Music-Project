I remember the day when the winter came back in 1969
With hearts made of stone, they paved a solid one way to glory
The roar from the north shook the universe
Right out of its solitude
The sign of the times, they said
As we praised the birth of our story

The power inside, our source of creation
Far beyond the sun they hear our singing swords

Sweden rock
(We make) Sweden rock
Bringing the hammer down
Three are the crowns in our banner

They were breaking the chains long before the storm
Play Judas to get along
The traitors and renegades smoldered the soil of our fathers
Now lay down your guns, raise the hammers high
Together we are one
A true life worth fighting for 'cause this ain't no dying illusion

A call from the grave where flames are eternal
In the land of fog and mist we carry on

Sweden rock
(We make) Sweden rock
Bringing the hammer down
Three are the crowns in our banner
(We make) Sweden rock
(We make) Sweden rock
Sons of the northern light
Forever let your strings cry out

[Guitar solo]

Sweden rock
(We make) Sweden rock
Bringing the hammer down
Three are the crowns in our banner
(We make) Sweden rock
(We make) Sweden rock
Sons of the northern light
Forever let your strings cry out

We make Sweden rock
