Now listen to this, my friends

On the first day of creation we were electrified
The rebel generation born to amplify
The call of the wild was burning inside
Shattered minds across the universe couldn't bare the thunder
Second day was dawning, we were immortalized
The clash of metal sounded and no one could defy
And out the blue, the storm broke loose
And the green-eyed monster sang the blues to choke our flame

By blood scars will pyre
A generation lost and mocked and scorned
Cleansed by fire, restored

On the last day came the winter, so crystal clear and brand
But deep inside, the fire was not ready to face the end
We kept our eyes shut, awaited the dark
To rebellion, the hypocrisy, resurrecting the stars

By blood scars will pyre
A generation lost and mocked and scorned
Cleansed by fire, we will be reborn

This is our destiny, all that was meant to be
The passion of the sacred fire is burning deep inside

[Guitar solo]

By blood scars will pyre
A generation lost and mocked and scorned
Cleansed by fire, restored
By blood scars will pyre
A generation lost and mocked and scorned
Cleansed by fire, we will be reborn
