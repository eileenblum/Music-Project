Templars of steel - we came here to win
Never will kneel - we never give in
This is our deal - the future 'n' past

Built to last

Templars of steel - we came here to win
Never will kneel - we never give in
This is our deal - the future 'n' past

Templars of steel - we came here to win
Never will kneel - we never give in
This is our deal - the future 'n' past
Built to last

Templars of steel - we came here to win
Never will kneel - we never give in
This is our deal - the future 'n' past
Built to last

It's not a dream, visions you can steal

Built to - built to last
Built to - battle to the core

Built to - built to last
Built to - win this sacred war

Templars of steel - never will kneel
This is our deal - built to last
Templars of steel - never will kneel
This is our deal - built to last

Templars of steel - we came here to win
Never will kneel - we never give in
This is our deal - the future 'n' past
Built to last

Templars of steel - our destiny's call
Never will kneel - united we fall
This is our deal - the hearts beating fast
Built to last
