We saw the lights go down
The falling of the crown
The infidels, dethroned
Climbing up from their darkened abode

Your pious words won't mend
You're not from heaven sent
You're holier-than-thou
To the swords, to the guns, we must go

And so here we stand
We're the soldiers of the promised land
We are here, so please leave us be
We're fighting to live, to be free

New breed, old breed
We are all the same breed
Heavy metal running through our veins

You say we are the same
But, who are you to blame
Our mighty swords won't rust
When your hearts made of stone turns to dust

You're not the chosen ones
Your second to the guns
Your deeds are bound to fail
Better find your own path, your own trail

And so here we stand
We're the brethren of the promised land
We are free, to follow our dreams
Protecting our lives, by all means

New breed, old breed
We are all the same breed
Heavy metal running through our veins

New breed, old breed
We are all the same breed
Heavy metal running through our veins

Warriors - hold your heads high
Glorious - high in the sky
The fire burns - deep down inside
Glory for us, nothing for thee

[Solo: Pontus, Oscar, Pontus, Oscar/Pontus]

New breed, old breed
We are all the same breed
Heavy metal running through our veins

New breed, old breed
We are all the same breed
Heavy metal running through our
Running through our veins
