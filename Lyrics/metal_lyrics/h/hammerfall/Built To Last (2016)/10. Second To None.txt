Returned from the dark side I found a greater truth
No doubts or delusions, no higher absolute

A walk through the ages, through history and time
I've seen all the treason all done by mankind

I deny your illusions
Reject your forceful demands

My dreams seem so real now; they all come alive
The age of enlightenment, the power of your mind

Wheels of history turning 
Re-spinning out of control

So many mountains to climb to be falsified
My spirit is second to none 
And my heart can't be denied

My soul is my furnace, my never-ending craze
My body is my temple a well-protected maze

False messiah, rejected
Return your distorted prophecies

So many mountains to climb to be falsified
My spirit is second to none 
And my heart can't be denied

[Solo: Oscar, Pontus]

Returned from the light side
Some answers left to find 
In search of my brothers 
My one of a kind 

So many mountains to climb to be falsified
My spirit is second to none 
And my heart can't be denied

My heart is torn between heaven and hell
Your gods are rejected all false prophets will fall
