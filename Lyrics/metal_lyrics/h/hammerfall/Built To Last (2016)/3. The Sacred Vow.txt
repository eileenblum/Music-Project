Somewhere in the alley
A shot inside the dark
The gutters paved in blackened blood
By the godless patriarch

You hear the thunder howlin'
You fear his glowing eyes
A bang across the universe
As the lightning hits the skies

Fear the sound of metal
The clash when steel meets steel
We're renegades, let's regulate
Let's finish this ordeal

We are defenders, the almighty
We stomp the trail where no one dares to go
We are the brave, let's keep on fighting
Protect the sacred vow

Trapped into a corner
Silence fills the air
The dark abandoned city streets
Is now the dragon's lair

A scream across the heavens
A sound to heed the call
Protectors of the universe
Ready to play ball

Fear the sound of metal
The sweetest sound of all
We're flying high up in the sky
A mighty fireball

We are defenders, the almighty
We stomp the trail where no one dares to go
We are the brave, let's keep on fighting
Protect the sacred vow

The first cut spilled blood in the gutter
The second cut blinded his eyes
The third cut gave us all the answers
The final cut sliced up his lies

[Solo: Oscar]

We are defenders, the almighty
We stomp the trail where no one dares to go
We are the brave, let's keep on fighting
Protect the sacred vow

We are defenders, the almighty
We stomp the trail where no one dares to go
We are the brave, let's keep on fighting
Protect the sacred vow
