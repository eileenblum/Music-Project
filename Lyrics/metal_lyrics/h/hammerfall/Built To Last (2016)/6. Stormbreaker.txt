The dragon awakens the guardian waiting around
Once touched by fire
The flames kissed this dangerous ground

Cause by lust the creature slaughtered human race
Once defended to become a state of grace

We are the crusaders
Blood-red cross caretakers
Allied as one, known as Stormbreaker

In the dark ages when mankind
Gave birth to the beast
The demons and wizards united rejected the priest

All invoked the power of king Lucifer
To infuse the power from the crucifer

We are the crusaders
Blood-red cross caretakers
Allied as one, known as Stormbreaker

[Solo: Pontus, Oscar/Pontus]

Out of the ashes they summoned
The brave to fight back
To bring down the evil
The best way was solid attack

To avoid repeating history once more
We must slay the dragon burn his guts and gore

We are the crusaders
Blood-red cross caretakers
Allied as one mighty storm

Call out the defender
Return the beast to sender
Hail to the king, known as Stormbreaker
