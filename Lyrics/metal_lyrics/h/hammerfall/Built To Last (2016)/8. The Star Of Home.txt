Day after day, we all try to find a way
Fighting to be brave
Keep the wicked far at bay
We ride across the battlefield
There's nothing left to find
You hear the vultures cry
Now their task is just a grind

The last sun will soon ignite
An ever-lasting blight

We must find the star of home
Time will end at break of dawn
One more odyssey remain
Leave this desert plain

Destination's far away
Into universe we stray
To a place known as forever

Countdown begins
We must leave this place of sin
There's blood everywhere
When the riverâs running red
A vigil for the dying world
Resurrections last crusade
Fragments left of life
Shattered pieces from the blade

A deathwatch for the human race
Life's falling down from grace

We must find the star of home
Time will end at break of dawn
One more odyssey remain
Leave this desert plain

Destination's far away
Into universe we stray
To a place known as forever

Across the sacred universe we travel on
We'll find our remedy
Our home away from home... travel on

[Solo: Pontus]

We must find the star of home
Time will end at break of dawn
One more odyssey remain
Leave this desert plain

Destination's far away
Into universe we stray
To a place known as forever
