The hammer is pounding
When all the steel begins to glow
The fire is burning
It keeps the cauldron boiling slow

Ashes to ashes
We'll make 'em crawl into the dust
The dragon will forge the steel
In fire, never-ever rust

No angels will come down
To hold this sacred ground
The anvil starts to glow
Hammer down!

Made of steel - raise your swords to the sky
Charge! In battle - dethrone and defy

Blessed by nefarious
It'll make 'em yield, will make 'em kneel
Wizards of fire
Will cast their spells upon their steel

Striking the anvil hard
No rest from the hammers violent blow
We are the power

And you are welcome to our show
Dark angels falling down
We're waiting on the ground
The anvil starts to glow
Hammer down!

Made of steel - raise your swords to the sky
Charge! In battle - dethrone and defy

[Solo: Oscar/Pontus. Pontus]

So, bring it on
Fighting all for one
Tap the hammer, keep a solid pace

[Solo: Oscar/Pontus]

Oh, oh, oh...

Made of steel - raise your swords to the sky
Charge! In battle - dethrone and defy

Made of steel - raise your swords to the sky
Charge! United - dethrone and defy
