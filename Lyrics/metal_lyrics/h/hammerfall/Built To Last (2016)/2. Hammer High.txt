Hammer high, this is a freedom cry
Hammer high, no one should ask me why
It's my life, proudly I will defy
Hammer high until I die

Black clouds on the horizon
Dread crimson skies
The thunder within, the sign to begin
A tempest of fire and ice
I keep my courage blazing
Withhold these grounds
Protecting the steel, this is my deal
The flames of thy anger, my will

Remember the frozen tears
Turning each second to years
A meltdown in paradise
Revolution calling break the ice

Hammer high, this is a freedom cry
Hammer high, no one should ask me why
It's my life, proudly I will defy
Hammer high until I die

The rapid-fire pounding
To the beat of my heart
Let's make a stand; True till the end
A warrior under command

I'm melting the frozen ice
Burning the books filled with lies
And inside the pouring rain
Things will never ever be the same

Hammer high, this is a freedom cry
Hammer high, no one should ask me why
It's my life, proudly I will defy
Hammer high until I die

The strong will survive, in the end it's the game
Forever defy, hammer high up in the sacred sky

[Solo: Pontus, Oscar, Pontus]

Hammer high, this is a freedom cry
Hammer high, no one should ask me why
It's my life, proudly I will defy
Hammer high until I die

Hear me now, this is a freedom cry
It's my life, no one should ask me why
Hammer high I won't conform and I
Will defy until I die

Hammer high, this is a freedom cry
Hammer high, no one should ask me why
It's my life, proudly I will defy
Hammer high until I die
