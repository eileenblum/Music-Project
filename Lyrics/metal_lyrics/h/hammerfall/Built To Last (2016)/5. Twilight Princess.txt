Where have I been? I don't know where to begin
Memories flash, bright and painfully clash

Forever gone, my mind is clear but undone
Storms raging on, sensing the other one

Here, in the thunderous silence I sit, petrified
Knowing the Twilight Princess will come

I hear her lies, piercing through me, hypnotised
Cursing the skies, who I've become, I despise

I have no choice, all is lost, can't rejoice
Nothing but noise, and her sweet, sweet voice

No, as the dusk is approaching, I hear her again
It is the Twilight Princess I fear
Oh, her beauty, ethereal, out of this world
Because the Twilight Princess is here.

Give me a reason, won't you give me a sign
Give me a reason to cross the line
Darkness has come
And the last rays of sunlight are gone
What matters now won't matter soon
In the light of the moon

[Solo: Oscar]

Once I was dead, time standing still and at last
Free in my head, never remember the past

I must obey, finding an innocent prey
To make the Twilight Princess smile
Always astray, need her to show me the way
It is my Twilight Princessâ trial

Yes, as the dusk is approaching, I hear her again
It is the Twilight Princess I see
Oh, her beauty, ethereal, out of this world
Because the Twilight Princess is me

She is always with me
