Your words of slander won't take us down
We see right through you, a shattered clown
We walk the walk and we talk the talk
We'll back it up if you wanna rock

We'll give you action to back these words
We'll write the songs that are still unheard
And at the dawn of the new crusade
Youâre at a standstill beneath the blade

No matter what they will say
Forever we march our own way
We're in this together; we're fighting to win
For better or worse by the virtue of sin

Bring it - just bring it
Bring it - just bring it

You cast your spell with a serpent's tongue
Through rage and fire, you walk among
Your tainted magic we see right through
Time to retreat, from our point of view

Come join our mighty parade
The future is ours to invade
Cause you heard the warnings, the reason, our cause
G.Y.D.U. this is our call to arms

Bring it - just bring it
Bring it - just bring it
Bring it - just bring it
Bring it - just bring it

Time to step down from your throne
Free of sin? Please cast the first stone

[Solo: Oscar, both]

Bring it - just bring it
Bring it - just bring it
Bring it - just bring it
Bring it - just bring it

Just bring it
