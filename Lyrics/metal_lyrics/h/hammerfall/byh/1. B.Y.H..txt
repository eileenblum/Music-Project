In 1981, the metal struck like thunder
The harmonious noise all linked in one voice
A croon across the nation

My soul was ripped and torn and I couldn't
Resist the power
The music I heard, the thunderous words
My gate to liberation

It made us rock it made us lose
Our self control

Bang Your Head - Stand United

It was the spark, the flame, setting our
Hearts on fire
Creating our dreams, our lives
And our means
We're howling' with desire

We came to rock we came
To lose our self control

Bang Your Head - Stand United

The years kept passing by
No wind of change could bring us down
Cuz we are one my friend
We stand together 'til the end
This is our destiny
Our will, our life our honored crown
Our dreams is ours to dream
Our beat's out beat forevermore

[Solo: Pontus Norgren/Oscar Dronjak/Pontus Norgren/Both]

Now, Templars, bang your heads and unite

It made us rock it made us roll forever more

Bang Your Head - Stand United
Bang Your Head - Stand United

Bang Your Head!
