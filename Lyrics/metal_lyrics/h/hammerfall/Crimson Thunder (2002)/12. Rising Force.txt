[European Bonus Track]

[Cover of YNGWIE MALMSTEEN]

Out of the darkness the voices are calling
Riding the wings of a song
The Fury is screaming and Heaven is falling
I feel it coming on strong.

The lightning strikes cracking the night
It feels like never before
Thunder and sparks in the Heart of the Dark
I hear a Rising Force.

Searching my soul I find something else
I take my life in my hands
From the gates of Heaven to the altars of Hell
The Power is at my command.

The lightning strikes cracking the night
I'm not the same anymore
Thunder and spark in the Heart of the Dark
I feel a Rising Force.

Burned by the glory of a sacred fire
A Rising Force starts to shine
Alone in the inferno it soars ever higher
Leaving the demons behind.

The lightning strikes cracking the night
It feels like never before
Thunder and sparks in the Heart of the Dark
I hear a Rising Force.

The lightning strikes cracking the night
I'm not the same anymore
Thunder and spark in the Heart of the Dark
I feel a Rising Force.
