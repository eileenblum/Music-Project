There's never been any reason
or escape for the treason
You just think of a time far away
I feel your flame and your anguish
I know your plans and your last wish
You just can't face another day

Angel of Mercy, take her to your homeland
Angel of Mercy, you can feel the signs,
it's the End, it's the End

You've stood along the life line
You've played the fool for the last time
You just want the joy and the peace
You've heard all the laughter
You've seen what you're after
You just want the rest and the sleep

Angel of Mercy, take her to your homeland
Angel of Mercy, you can feel the signs,
it's the End, it's the End

Angel Of Mercy, Angel Of Mercy

[Lead: Stefan]

[Solo: Stefan]

You can hear the clock's tick
as you scheme for your last fix,
from a place you never will awake
I hear your cry into the night
I hear you die within my fright
But now you've saved your mistake

Angel Of Mercy...

Angel of Mercy, Angel of Mercy

[Solo: Stefan]
