Never thought I'd feel again, feel the darkness
fade and see the morning sun arise
Never thought I'd feel alive again, senses dull
and blunt from all the lies

Now, when I hold your face so close to mine I
see a place where the sun will shine, with you
it is divine

Looking down into those eyes, I know, I'll be
lost and never found again. Kiss me once and
I will surely melt and die, kiss me twice and I
will never leave your side...(if) Dreams Come True

Do I dare to trust this time? Ooh, the Bells of
Fortune, will I ever hear them chime?
Only those who have been burned before truly
know the meaning of Hell's flaming core

I was the brooding night and you were dawn.
Saving me, for I was forlorn, in your light I am
reborn.

Looking down into those eyes, I know, I'll be
lost and never found again. Kiss me once and
I will surely melt and die, kiss me twice and I
will never leave your side...(if) Dreams Come True

[Lead: Oscar]

Then, when the walls are breaking down on us, when all
we see is misery
will you still believe in me?

Looking down into those eyes, I know, I'll be
lost and never found again. Kiss me once and
I will surely melt and die, kiss me twice and I
will never leave your side, until the sign of winter,
always by your side....(Dreams Come True)
