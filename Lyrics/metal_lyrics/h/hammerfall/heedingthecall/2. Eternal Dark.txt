Living in the shadows
Live a life of sins
Now you feel the pressure
There ain't no giving in
Do you ever wander
Do you ever think
What may lie beyond you
What's the missing link

Will you enter the paradise
Will you see the light
What is your destination
Your eyes will see - eternal dark

There ain't no use behaving
Life can never change
There ain't no book to guide you
You're desperate to the range
Why do you listen
To the holy man
Sage one will take you
The only one who can

Will you enter the paradise
Will you see the light
What is your destination
Your eyes will see - eternal dark
