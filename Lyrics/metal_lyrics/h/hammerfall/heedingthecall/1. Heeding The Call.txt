[Zuruck]

A flash in the night, a journey through time
the Templars are back on the streets
Guarded by prowess and the will to survive
all led by the guiding light

Angel of mercy, guardians of time
Shackled and chained through the eternal flame
the hammer will slowly arise

Heeding the Call, one and for all
never surrender, with glory we'll fall
Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight
fulfilling our fate, we are Heeding the Call

One, step ahead, revealing the past
united, together we stand
The call of the thunder, the sign to begin
this final crusade we will win

Angel of mercy, guardians of time
Shackled and chained through the etrenal flame
the hammera will slowly arise

Heeding the Call, one and for all
never surrender, with glory we'll fall
Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight
fulfilling our fate, we are Heeding the Call

Oh, oh, oh...

Heeding the Call, one and for all
never surrender, with glory we'll fall
Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight
fulfilling our fate, we are Heeding the Call
