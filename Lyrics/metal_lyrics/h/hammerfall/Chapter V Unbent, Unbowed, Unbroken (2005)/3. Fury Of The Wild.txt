Sighs - The fury has electrified my mind
Sighs - The hatred burns inside by the mark of vengeance I will grind

Sighs - The sound of metal falling to the ground
Sighs - By blood we will unite by blood we are forever bound

Vengeance calling me
Oh, please set me free
The Fury of the Wild
Locked up in this cage
Can't you feel the rage?
The Fury of the Wild

Sighs - Your silence will not sanctify your crime
Sighs - When revolution calls I will be the first in line

Vengeance calling me
Oh, please set me free
The Fury of the Wild
Locked up in this cage
Can't you feel the rage?
The Fury of the Wild

[Solo: Stefan]

Now as you stand on your own
With the future, face to face
Take a look at me now
Feel the fury, taste my rage
Come taste my revenge

Unbent - Unbowed - Unbroken

Vengeance calling me
Oh, please set me free
The Fury of the Wild
Locked up in this cage
Can't you feel the rage?
The Fury of the Wild
