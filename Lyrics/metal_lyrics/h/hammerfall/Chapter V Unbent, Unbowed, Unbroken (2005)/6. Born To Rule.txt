Lay down your arms this night
Surrender to the power
Embracing your metal heart
On your final walk through the snow

[Solo: Stefan]

A hammer made of steel
From the river of blood
With magic, forged in flames
Delusions, a curse of the damned

What do you see?
Imaginary visions or reality
When you're free
Then you'll see that you are bound to rule

Rule - Born - Rule
We were Born to Rule
Rule - Born - Rule
We were Born to Rule

Born to Rule - Born to Rule
We're Born to Rule forever more
Born to Rule - Born to Rule
We're Born to Rule forever

The revolution forced us all to heed the final call
And if tomorrow never comes
Then we will strike the hammer down

[Solo: Stefan]

Rule - Born - Rule
We were Born to Rule
Rule - Born - Rule
We were Born to Rule

Born to Rule - Born to Rule
We're Born to Rule forever more
Born to Rule - Born to Rule
We're Born to Rule forever
Forever, forever Rule!
