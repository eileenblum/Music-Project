So where were you when darkness came to life?
Inside a dream that controlled your inner plight
Take a look at me, you've ruined what we had
Inner visions, infrared, it drives me mad

Out of control
The system mounted on the wall
For every soul there's no way out

In this world where nothing lives
The walls are caving in, life's a sin
In this world we have to give
Before we all can see The Templar Flame

Do you believe surveillance is the cure?
The remedy for our insanity
Take a look around and tell me what you see
Souls walking planlessly like you and me

In infrared
Controlling what is left to see
Awake the dead, there's no way out

In this world where nothing lives
The walls are caving in, life's a sin
In this world we have to give
Before we all can see The Templar Flame

You see the words - Speak
In infrared - Speak
You see the words
Damn the machine - Speak
Speak of the flame....The Templar Flame

[Solo: Stefan]

Oh, oh, oh...
