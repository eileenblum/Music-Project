The moon is full you can not see
There's something in the air
Sound asleep you're into deep
Protecting your own lair

The lion roar into the night
Yet another foe to slay
Who are you that I see right through
The hunter or the pray?

Too late to hear the final warning
No one can defy the reaper
Voices - Twisted
Calling out your name
Voices - Twisted
Calling for you

Ain't no reason for the rhyme
Take the Black - Ready to attack
Take the Black
Face to face you bide your time
Take the Black - Ready to attack
Take the Black

You though you had it all in there
In your little bag of tricks
Insanity won't set you free
As you cross the river Styx

You're out of time your bridges burn
In the undying flame
We'll nail you down to the ground
For you to bear the shame

Too late to hear the final warning
No one can defy the reaper
Voices - Twisted
Calling out your name
Voices - Twisted
Calling for you

Ain't no reason for the rhyme
Take the Black - Ready to attack
Take the Black
Face to face you bide your time
Take the Black - Ready to attack

[Solo: Stefan]

Voices - Twisted
Calling out your name
Voices - Twisted
Calling for you

Ain't no reason for the rhyme
Take the Black - Ready to attack
Take the Black
Face to face you bide your time
Take the Black - Ready to attack

Ain't no reason for the rhyme
Take the Black - Ready to attack
Take the Black
Face to face you bide your time
Take the Black - Ready to attack
