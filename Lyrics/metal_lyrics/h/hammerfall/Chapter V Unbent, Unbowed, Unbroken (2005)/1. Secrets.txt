Charge into the vein
Like a needle for the pain
Thunderbolts clashing down
A new sound across the land

Force we are the pawns
Conveying a new dawn
Hear the screams, feel the force
In a symphony of steel

Across the universe
Embracing all mankind

There's something in our hearts worth fighting for
Some Secrets better left untold
And when the time has come for us to die
We'll take the Secrets to the grave

No, here they stand
The resistance, hand in hand
When you think we are gone
We will rise a brand new dawn

Across the universe
Embracing all mankind

There's something in our hearts worth fighting for
Some Secrets better left untold
And when the time has come for us to die
We'll take the Secrets to the grave

[Solo: Stefan]

[Solo: Oscar]

[Solo: Both]

Charge, hear the screams
It's the fear of the unseen
Force, no remorse
It's a symphony of steel

Across the universe
It all remains the same
You can't break a metal heart
And it's far too wild to tame

There's something in our hearts worth fighting for
Some Secrets better left untold
And when the time has come for us to die
We'll take the Secrets to the grave
