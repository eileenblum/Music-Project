Sitting in my room, staring at the wall, I can't believe it's happening
Once so wonderful, now, life's a twisted kind of reality, a fantasy
Don't know where to begin

Saw your love for me vanish in a single moment of stupidity Nightmare this
may be, but it is not a dream, ooh
I want to scream; a broken heart still bleeds

Never ever talk, never ever smile
Knowing that my life won't be the same Never ever touch, never ever feel
I will never hear you call my name...again

In my dreams I see, see you come to me; a memory of times of old
Waking up, I realize Hell's as cool as ice and the touch of sin did get me in
Nothing burns like the cold
Never ever talk, never ever smile
Knowing that my life won't be the same Never ever touch, never ever feel
I will never hear you call my name
As we sin, so do we suffer
I've fallen from grace, want to turn back time and make it undone

[Solo: Stefan]

Never ever talk, never ever smile
Knowing that my life won't be the same Never ever touch, never ever feel
I will never hear you call my name Never ever talk, never ever smile
All I see: a future full of fear Never ever touch, never ever feel
I can never whisper in your ear...I'm sorry
