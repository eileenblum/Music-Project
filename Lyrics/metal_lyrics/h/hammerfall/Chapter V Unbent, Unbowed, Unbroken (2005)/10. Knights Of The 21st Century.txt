Words unspoken, sworn in secrecy
A burning flame for the ones who believe
The prophecy

Revelations from the sun as of the moon
In seven nights we became history
The prophecy

On a cold dark night
We set our sails to search for land so far away
Searching for the truth

There's a howl in the wind
On this mystic trail of water we sail on
The source of youth

And the storm breaks loose on the seven seas
Tag on the signs on the mounting sun

Northern light is shining on for us
Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows

From the mountain side
Came a twisted wind, it brought us new insight
Whispering these words

Come in the midst you'll see
Said a voice, I thought it was the prophecy
The secrecy unheard

And on the violent sea there's tranquillity
We saw the signs on the mountain side

Northern light is shining on for us
Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows

A secret passage never to be found
In front of us a delusion of sight
The prophecy

From the mountains and the rivers down below
A silent breeze, there's a wail in the wind
The prophecy

We've come from a land so far away
We bow down to the words you pray
Storming down the mountain side
No place to go, no place to hide

[Solo: Oscar, Stefan]

Here we stand under of cover the moonlight
Oh, the prophecy was bound to fail
Here we are, nowhere to be found
We're trapped in another world and the journey's just begun

Ah, ah, ah...

Northern light is shining on for us
Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows

Northern light is shining on for us
Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows
