The morning breaks, as a new day begin
And Iâm still on the road to nowhere
No sign of life in his eyes, no emotion shown at all
Just like water through my hands

In his heart, in his eyes
In his soul thereâs no sign of thunder
Screams, can you hear the screaming
When another restless soul must die

In his heart, in his eyes
In his soul thereâs no sign of thunder
Screams, can you hear the screaming
When another restless soul must die

A glorious ride, to become immortalized
As you sought you inner dreams and visions
Your final words caught by the wind, never to be heard again
Your last will to be forever free

In his heart, in his eyes
In his soul thereâs no sign of thunder
Screams, can you hear the screaming
When another restless soul must die

In his heart, in his eyes
In his soul thereâs no sign of thunder
Screams, can you hear the screaming
When another restless soul must die

In his heart, in his eyes
In his soul thereâs no sign of thunder
Screams, can you hear the screaming
When another restless soul

In his heart, in his eyes
In his soul thereâs no sign of thunder
Screams, can you hear the screaming
When another restless soul

In his heart, in his eyes
In his soul thereâs no sign of thunder
Screams, can you hear the screaming
When another restless soul

In his heart, in his eyes
In his soul thereâs no sign of thunder
Screams, can you hear the screaming
When another restless soul must die
