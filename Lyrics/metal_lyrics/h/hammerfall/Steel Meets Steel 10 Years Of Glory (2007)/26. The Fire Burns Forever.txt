Fire, burns. Fire, burns. Fire, Burns

You danced with the devil
Now your soul is bruised and scarred
There ain't no pride and dignity
We've been down the rusty boulevard
You lived your life, thought you'd be immortalized
The moral of your story, what goes up must come back down

Fire, burns
The Fire Burns Forever
Fire, burns
The Fire Burns Forever More

A moment of silence
Just before you hit the stage
This is your day of reckoning
To pay back all the dues and turn the page
You hit rock bottom and you stood the count to ten
Came back to harvest glory, now your star will shine forever

Fire, burns
The Fire Burns Forever
Fire, burns
The Fire Burns Forever More

Fire, burns
The Fire Burns Forever
Fire, burns
The Fire Burns Forever More

'Cause every step, the light races follow
'Cause every move we make, might be our last mistake

Fire, burns
The Fire Burns Forever
Fire, burns
The Fire Burns Forever More

Fire, burns
The Fire Burns Forever
Fire, burns
The Fire Burns Forever More

Fire, fire, burn
