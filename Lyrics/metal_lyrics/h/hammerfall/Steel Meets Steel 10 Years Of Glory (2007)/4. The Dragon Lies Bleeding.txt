Ride through the valley in thunder and rain
The battle is raging, redeem this domain
The castle of Eden lies silent above
Darkness surrounds us, away we must go

I look through the eyes of the world
I see there's a stranger among us
Awaiting a sign from above
To conquer the power and the glory

Enter the battle, our will to enchain
bringing us forward, defeating the pain
Into the meeting with swords made of steel
We're standing together, the secret reveals

I look through the eyes of the world
I know who's the stranger among us
Awaiting a sign from above to conquer
The power and the glory

Come across to the promised land
Close your eyes I will take your hand
Through the river of steel we'll go
When the dragon lies bleeding

Above the glory we'll carry on
Now the time has come to return back home
The setting sun illuminates the dead
On the battlefield it's shining red

Silent lies Eden on top of the moor
We're fighting with honor protecting our Lord
The last one survivor lies bleeding, I kneel
Into his heart I settle the steel

I look through the eyes of the world
There is no stranger among us
we march through the end of the world
in search of the power and the glory

Come across to the promise land...
