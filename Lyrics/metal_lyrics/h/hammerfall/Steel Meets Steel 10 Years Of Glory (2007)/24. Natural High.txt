Last night I had a vivid dream
I found a place where nothingâs what it seems
Iâm bound to walk this earth alone
I am a hunter and the heir to the throne

The chase of blood and sweet revenge
It keeps on hammering in my head
The urge to kill is getting stronger
Iâm south of heaven, north of hell
My final place to rest

Surrender your soul
Surrender your pride
Please enter my dream
Find your natural high
Youâve got nothing to fear
Cause your rebirth is near

The battle rages deep inside
No where to run for my eternal bride
And when the darkness comes around
I come alive cause, glorious we, by blood I am bound

I taste your blood so bitter sweet
Come ease my pain get on your knees
You know throughout is meant to be
Forever missed out what it seems
This is your final scream

Surrender your soul
Surrender your pride
Please enter my dream
Find your natural high
Youâve got nothing to fear
Cause your rebirth is near

So you are born again
To a higher plane
In my dark lair youâre part of the game
Forever we are, forever weâll be
Weâre forever free

Surrender your soul
Surrender your pride
Please enter my dream
Find your natural high
Youâve got nothing to fear
Cause your rebirth is near
