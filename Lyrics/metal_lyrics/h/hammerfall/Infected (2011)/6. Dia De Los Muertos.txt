[Dronjak / Cans / Larsson]

Light up the candles and open the gate
The bell is ringing for the souls with no fate
Our little angels, all lost in this world

Death is transcending, they will ressurect
Not from their grave, but they've come to collect
In danza macabra, the dance of the dead

We honor the souls, we praise the departed
Now la calavera catrina is glowing
The eyes of the skull bursting into a blaze

All of the damned - dia de los muertos
All of the damned - los angelitos, los innocentes

So listen, beware,
Remember what they said
That life is best
Enjoyed after death

There is a place where the evil can rest
Let's draw a circle and take out their nest
Into the fire, we all been mislead

Battle is raging prepare to attack
Made out of fire they clobber my back
The living and dead in a final ballet

Let's summon the dead, we all stand together
But we thought the spirits would rest on this day
How could we be so blind? Stop the dance start the slay

All of the damned - dia de los muertos
All of the damned - los angelitos, los innocentes

So listen, beware,
Remember what they said
That life is best
Enjoyed after death

[Solo: Oscar / Both]
