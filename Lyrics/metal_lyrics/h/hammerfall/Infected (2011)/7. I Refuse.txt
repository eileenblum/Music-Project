[Dronjak / Cans]

My guard is down, accept my invitation
But don't waste my time, with your slandering lies

Cuz my dream is my dream
All based on my revelations
Extreme, but not mean
And I'll stand the test of time

You say you like me, your my friend, but I got stabbed in the back
Remove that smile and wash the blood off your hands

I Refuse, I Refuse

You call my name, but you don't know me
Say I'm insane, but who's to blame

Cuz I'll scream and I'll scream
And I'm building up a reputation
I esteem by all means
Cuz I swim against the stream

You turn the page and write the story of a life you don't know
My sword is sharp and mighter than your pen

I Refuse, I Refuse

I Refuse, I Refuse
Refuse to be something that I'm not

[Solo: Pontus]

I Refuse, I Refuse
I Refuse, I Refuse

I Refuse, I Refuse
Refuse to be something that I'm not
