[Dronjak / Cans]

Saints - From heaven
Hell hang-arounds - Decending
Disciples of repression
Fuse - Our evil
Exterminate - Protectors
Bringing us down to the ground
And pushing us back to the...

Final frontier, wedlock in the grime
Cry a thousand tears, battle one more time

One more time
One more time
One more time
One more time

Pray - Steel demons
Don't look away - Tormentors
Traverse the darkened heavens
Seek - Our wicked
Seek and destroy - Opponents
Soldiers of heaven and hell

Hey - We're fighting
Eye for an eye - Protecting
Our mother earth, dissecting
Break - Their evil
Ruin the core - Allegiance
Vengeance is now in our hands
Vengeance
Pushing us back to the...

Final frontier, buried in the grime
Cry a thousand tears, battle one more time

One more time
One more time

[Solo: Oscar / Pontus]

Final frontier, the judgement bell will chime
No wasted years, "stand up" one more time

One more time
One more time
One more time
One more time
One more time
One more time
One...more......time
