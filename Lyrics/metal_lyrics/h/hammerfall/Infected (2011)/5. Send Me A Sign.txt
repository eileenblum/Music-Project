[PokolgÃ©p / Cans]

Snow keeps falling down
From grace in the dark
Frozen tears in silent cries

Oh, oh, oh...
Sadness, now color the battle field
All around, life passing by

Falling from my eyes
Like a raindrop from the skies
Falling from my eyes
Oh, oh...

So Send me a Sign
Just a way to explain
Tell me what I can do
I'm turning insane

So Send me a Sign
Show me what I should do
Only one wish to tell
A word sincerely signed just for you

Winter paved ny way, couldn't see nor believe
I watched the snow highlighting my grief

Oh, oh, oh...
Sadness, I long for the sun to shine
Please melt the ice wrapped around my heart

Falling from my eyes
Like a raindrop from the skies
Falling from my eyes
Oh, oh...

So Send me a Sign
Just a way to explain
Tell me what I can do
I'm turning insane

So Send me a Sign
Show me what I should do
Only one wish to tell
A word sincerely signed just for you
