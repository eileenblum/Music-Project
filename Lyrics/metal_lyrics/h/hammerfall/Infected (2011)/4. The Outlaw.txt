[Norgren / Cans]

It started with the holy water rising to a boil
The crops went bad, no life coul breed,
beneath the rotten soil
Imprisoned for his make beliefs,
impending dire views
Became accountable for every flaw,
spreading the news

Disturbing dreams of the future - reverie
Seven flights of imagination

These taunting dreams no one could read or even understand
Desilutions of insanity banned from his fatherland
Just leave the ship and swim ashore, life's hanging by a thread
Days of mass destruction, armageddon lies ahead

Disrurbing dreams of the future - reverie
Seven flights of imagination

Bring out the Outlaw, how do you plead
To the allegation
Bring out the Outlaw, charge him, decree
Eternal damnation

So, seven years of devastation followed in the land
One for every prophecy, served by tha almighty hand
The outlaw was imprisoned for scattering his dreams
None stood up to hold his ground, spineless so it seems
Disturbing dreams of the future - reverie
Seven flights of imagination

Bring out the Outlaw, could you forsee
The allegation
Bring out the Outlaw, charge him, decree
Eternal damnation

A life could be saved, if someone stood up for his rights
Now cursed and condemned, mistreated on his last nocturnal flight

[Solo: Pontus]

Bring out the Outlaw, how do you plead
To the allegation
Bring out the Outlaw, charge him, decree
Eternal damnation

Call for the Outlaw, help us forsee
God's allegation
Call for the Outlaw, charge us, decree
Eternal damnation
