[Dronjak / Cans]

As I wake up from my slumber
From a deep, enchanted sleep
Thereâs a pain, thereâs a mark, thereâs a wound
The trail of blood is running deep

Thereâs an echo in the mirror,
Of a man I donât know
Starring back at the scar on my neck
And the numbers are Screaming...

Six, six, six, grab the holy crucifix
Skies turn red high above the river Styx

Kneeling down in desperation
As I start to speak in tongues
When I praise the old man down below
I recite the mantra

Six, six, six, twist the holy crucifix
Grab the oars scull across the river Styx

Itâs the evil in me
The enemy within my soul the subjugator

[Solo: Oscar]

Six, six, six
get the holy crucifix
Throw it in
into Acheron on Styx

[Solo: Pontus]

Six, six, six
sinking like a tons of bricks
One way pass
over Acheron and Styx

Itâs the evil in me
The enemy within my soul the subjugator
