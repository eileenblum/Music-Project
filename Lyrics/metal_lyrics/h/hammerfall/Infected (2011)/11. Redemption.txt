To find the hidden sun
The source of the spark and the flame

Now the universe is closed
Let the blackening, dissolution start
The aether shining, impurified
Let's burnout the vile from the dark

I kneel down and pray
The elements gather around me
Envision my destined path
I can no longer avoid
I see the...

Black sun  rising
Fall, material god
Opus Magnum
Seize Redemption

My uprising
Find the sun and the moon
Absolution
Seize Redemption

Unification, the spiritualized will unlock the gate be unlimited
Unification of man and his god will limit your life lock the gate

[Solo: Oscar / Pontus]

Now the elements are at peace
Come the reddening, gaze upon the sky
Seven planets, silver and gold
The seven metals aligned
And now the...

Black sun  rising
Fall, material god
Opus Magnum
Seize Redemption

My uprising
Find the sun and the moon
Absolution
Seize Redemption
