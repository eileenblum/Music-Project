[Dronjak]

Standing alone, it's the ultimate proving ground
As real as it gets, we are soldiers of one-man armies

Burning inside, hear the audience scream
We've got a yearning inside to fulfill our destiny

The lights go down, no more fears
The crowd goes wild, music to our ears

Get it on
Let's Get it On - It on
Come on, get it on - It on
Let's Get it On - It on
Come on, get it on

[Solo: Oscar]

Nowhere to run, like an animal caged and cornered
Standing so proud, it's the life we have chosen

(We do what) We were bred to do, were trained to do
We live to do
what we were born to do

Get it on
Let's Get it On - It on
Come on, get it on - It on
Let's Get it On - It on
Come on, get it on

[Solo: Pontus]

Pulled from the ashes and forged from tradition
The essence of power, behold demolition

Are you ready?
Are you ready? - Get!
Are you ready? - It!
Are you ready? - On!

Come on, get it on

Let's get it on
Come on, get it on

Get it on
Let's Get it On - It on
Come on, get it on - It on
Let's Get it On - It on
Come on, get it on
Let's get it on
Come on, get it on
