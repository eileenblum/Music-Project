please tell me once again
what it is that you fucking believe
it flows through you like a god damn disease

You always gamble when it's never in your favour
if you're the odds i'll take the bet
another chapter cut short, left to wonder
forever plagued with this regret

so head strong, convinced you're never wrong
it flows through you like a god damn disease
so please tell me once again
what it it is that you fucking believe
face the facts, your time is now

i've always been a believer, in the strength that lies within
no taking shade the shadow of doubt
it's just the light of a new day
illuminating my path

it's not my fault that you are stuck
fuck that i'm not giving up

don't you fucking dare step on me
it flows through you like a god damn disease
don't you fucking dare step on me
In a world where we're all born to choose
a life to win. a life to loose
I have faith in no one
or nothing else
just the belief
in my self
