Youth scratched,
Witnessing fallen idols
Itâs never the one you choose
A death grip on something you donât own
Explain to me why dues get paid to you
Iâve seen your true face,
Itâs much more scared than mine
Iâve seen your true face
And others like it that disappear in time
Hypocrites will have their day,
Only if we take a stand,
United against lines that divide
And the notion of class separation
Perpetrator you rule with an iron fist
Dictating individual experience,
A corner stone of what youâd have them believe
Up in flames from the venom and fire you breathe
Save us
Constricting the life force
Take us
Humble beginnings now six feet beneath
Save us
Carry the torch for the jaded
Take us
Hope lies with those who seek your defeat
Cowardâs eyes donât make it hard to find cracks in the veneer
No more treading over broken glass
Time to banish the cycle of fear
Save us, save us
From our skin is aging but these brittle bones are pleading
Take us! Take us!
We cast the shadow of a broken man as he turns to dust
Perpetrator you rule with an iron fist
Dictating individual experience
A corner stone of what youâd have them believe,
Up in flames from the venom and fire you breathe
Youth scratched, witnessing fallen idols
Itâs never the one you choose
A death grip on something you donât own
Explain to me why dues get paid to you
