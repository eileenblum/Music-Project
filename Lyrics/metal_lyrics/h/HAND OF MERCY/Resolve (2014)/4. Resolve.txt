The thought had never crossed my mind
But now I know there is no escaping time
There's a hand forever lurking in the shadows
To all hope it's blind
I can't watch as you make your way to the threshold
It's killing me inside that I once never shed a tear
Before our last goodbye
Looking back to help me to look forward
My fondest memories
I'm screaming at the shadows
Afraid that I'll forget
At least I'll find some solace
Watching your sun set
Don't make this harder that it is
I don't want a cross to bear
I know it's not your fault
I just hate the thought of the world
Without you here
