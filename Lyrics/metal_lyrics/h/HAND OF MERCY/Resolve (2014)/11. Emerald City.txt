HOMEWARD BOUND

a sunrise catches my eye
and for a moment you're not there
remain forever on my shoulders
thats a weight i choose to bear

I've seen stone and wood from far and wide
that only stands in peoples dreams
there's been a temptress hand
from time to time
but in my heart of hearts
i know my true calling

even though im away
i'll be home shortly
just know that day to day
i still think of you fondly

HOMEWARD BOUND

a sunrise catches my eye
and for a moment you're not there
remain forever on my shoulders
thats a weight i choose to bear

while others feel a sickness
that eats them alive
anticipation fills my heart
and the panic in my chest subsides

HOMEWARD BOUND

while i don't get to see you
while we're apart
across the land or the sea
you'll always be in my heart
