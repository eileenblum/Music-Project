Promises fallen on deaf ears
Coinciding with otherâs misspent years
Bright lights to document the start of lies
Not long now âtil we sever ties
Turned a blind eye to those you left in the wake
Others bleed and sweat and give,
Iâve only ever seen that hand take
The motivation is to feed then
Disregard them when theyâre bound
I canât believe that I agreed
And sold my soul so easily
Consider this a warning
Donât make the same mistake
The bastards wonât get a second chance
Trust me,
Thereâs no clean slate
Donât let the bastards get a second chance
Roam the room for the next king
Secretly not concerned with their well being
This treachery will have you reap what youâve sewn
You take the praise you fucking snakes
Weâve earned this on our own
