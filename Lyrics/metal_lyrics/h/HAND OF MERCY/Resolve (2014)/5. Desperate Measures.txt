Devoured by darkness.
Thoughts echoed in silence.
The fight to the dirtâs under way.
Paralyzed by the past, the air escaping your lungs.
Tonightâs potential for your escape.
Let me try to scratch the surface, at least ease a part of this.
Perspective in time can be hard to find.
I need you to know youâll be missed.
Donât be the one to bare the burden of past mistakes.
I ask with a heavy heart, it can be impossible to explain.
Just know you donât have to live with the pain.
Hold on. You donât have to live with the pain.
