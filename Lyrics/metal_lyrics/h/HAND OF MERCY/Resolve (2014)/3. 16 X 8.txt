Sixteen and eight guided by the hand of frustration
A nervous wreck rose red
Tongue-tied at the prospect of conversation,
I tremble at the circumstance
Each ring tells me that I have no chance
Persist, persist thereâs no safety net
But a free fall on your own terms is the only way to get
Clarity for the journey youâve been missing all along
Crush the rhetoric of the voices that said I was wrong
The world wonât wait so fuck the mold
There are stories to be made and told,
I refuse to be the sum of my fears
Sixteen and eight have been the best of years
Faith fading, youâre mistaken to think
That weâre still able to share the same vision now
Iâve been shunned from your table
Back to basics
These faces still terrify me
Back to basics
Fuck you, Iâm breaking free
And now Iâm not alone,
Thanks to this outlet now I have grown
