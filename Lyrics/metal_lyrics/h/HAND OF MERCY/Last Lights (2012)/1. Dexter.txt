Murderer,
Your shadow lurks within my soul,
Can't hide it, can't stay in control
Tonight my terror will take it's toll,
Tonight your body will lay cold

Make sure your last words count,
You're going underground

I need, Your fucking respect
Like I need a bullet in my fucking head

Don't think twice about making it right
Don't think twice, it's not alright
You left me shattered
When it really mattered
Pieces of my broken trust now lay scattered

Tonight my terror will take it's toll,
Tonight your body will lay cold

Another night I close my eyes
And let the hatred boil inside
I can't think of a reason why I
Should be taking this in stride
You can run but you can't fucking hide

What do I do with all this rage
I'll put it to use, break outta my cage
Open my book and rip out every page
I'll wash your blood of my hands in the rain
What do I do with all this rage
I'll put it to use, break outta my cage
Open my book and rip out every page
I'll wash your blood of my hands

Channeling pure hate

Another night I close my eyes
And let the hatred boil inside
You can run but you can't fucking hide
Another night I close my eyes
And let the hatred boil inside
Another night you'll lay awake

Knowing that there is no escape
Murderer
Murderer
Murderer
Your shadow lurks within my soul
