Good fortune can only last for so long
This cruel world shackle your feet and throw you back to the slums
Intimidate to force your mind to believe
You're fucking worthless and you'll never achieve

Your dreams are turning into nightmares
Your goals, they've picked them up and thrown them away
Back down, too scared to fucking face the day
Are you content with this hopeless thing you call your life?
No one is looking over you to mend your mistakes
Just a sky full of hate and greed
You weak coward in your fucking disguise
I'll sit back and watch the world
Eat you alive!

You tried to push on
With your hopes so high
Nothing to carry you
With your self centered sights
Holding your ignorant views
When will you wake to find this world has left you
Abandon, too late to redeem yourself
Is this what you thought it would be like?
Chasing your wildest dreams
Are turning into nightmares
Your goals, picked them up and thrown them away
Back down, too scared to fucking face the day
Are you content with this hopeless thing you call your life?

You choke yourself with what you've become!
This free world is what you make of it!
Your bitter soul won't carry you, you!

You tried to push on
With your hopes so high
Nothing to carry you
With your self centered sights
Holding your ignorant views
When will you wake to find this world has left you
Abandon, too late to redeem yourself
Is this what you thought it would be like?
Chasing your wildest dreams
