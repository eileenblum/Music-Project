Is this the end,
Of the road?
Break the shell of a former hero

Caution I'm a trainwreck
No respect
I followed on although I knew nothing was perfect
I know it's easier said than done
So I declare my defeat, my affirmation

It's over,
I'm ready,
My head is getting heavy,
Release me, I'll sleep
My last lights are fading
And.
With cander,
I'm looking back in anger
I'll take the first exist while the world's getting blander

Trapped in a blazing building
Signal the firing squad to shoot me out
To hell with your ruze
Irrational attitudes.
Signals are telling me turns those lights out
Turn my last lights out

There's nothing left to stand up for
(After so many tries)
All that I once said I would die for
(Fell down before my eyes)
What good's having nothing to believe in?
(I should be leaving)
When everything's this fucked, well I should be leaving
(I should be gone)

There is, nobody to blame me
I lowered my shield, trust got the better of me
There is no one to blame but me
(There is no one to blame but me)
There is no future I foresee
(You got the fucking best of me)

Caution I'm a trainwreck
No respect
I followed on although I knew nothing was perfect
I know it's easier said than done
So I declare my defeat, my affirmation

Is this the end,
Of the road?
There's no more room for heroes
Turn my last lights out
Turn my last lights out
