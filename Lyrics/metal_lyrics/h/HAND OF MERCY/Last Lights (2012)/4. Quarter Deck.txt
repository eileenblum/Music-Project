I can't deny I saw it coming, with my own two eyes,
I've learnt to second guess, because it's not the first time,
I had to double take, rub my eyes just to make sure I'm awake
That'll teach me to care at all.
So set the record straight,
You be you, and I'll be irate,
Being let down is now a frequency,
No sign of shame or self reflection,
I can't continue to give a fuck.

You have not learnt from your most ancient mistakes,
Facing a catastrophic repeat of fate,
Set up burn yourself, we the audience sit back
We don't repeat ourselves,
You don't make up for what you lack.

You don't redeem your bitter act

I can't deny I saw it coming, with my own two eyes,
I've learnt to second guess, because it's not the last time,
I had to double take, rub my eyes just to make sure I'm awake
That'll teach me to care at all
So set the record straight,
You be you, and I'll be irate,
Being let down is now a frequency.
No sign of shame or self reflection,
I can't continue to give a fuck

Time spent in vain is time never to be,
Another drop in the ocean, another ship wreck I see,
Catch up catch up, forever chasing your tail,
So much promise only set up to fail,
Search for hope, I know there's nothing to find,
just another case of leading to the blind.
Search for perfection, but you're too far off course,
Nothing left now, only doubt, and remorse.

I've discarded, all that lit the path
That led to this grim aftermath,

Smoke and mirrors cannot hide this disgrace,
I'm ready to forget your face,
A stranger takes your place.
