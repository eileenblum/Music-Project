Well I'll be tearing away your vicious restrains from me.
I have tried, tried so hard, but abandonment,
Has cut my strings of stride,
You plucked my wings, I cannot fly.
My battles, could not be won,
So I backed away, and I held my tongue.
The glory years are dead and gone,
Ashes to ashes.

We kicked holes, in all of the walls,
I set myself up for a fall,
Get back on my feet and,
Once again we,
We kicked holes, in all of the walls,
All the resentment that I could withhold
Adios motherfucker,
I'll go my way,
And you can go straight to f*cking
Hell.
I'll see you in fucking hell.

We kicked holes, in all of the walls,
I set myself up for a fall,
Get back on my feet and,
Once again we,
We kicked holes, in all of the walls,
All the resentment that I could withhold
Adios motherfucker,
I'll go my way,
Rid myself of your filth.

Wretched soul, you've been the catalyst,
You made ash of all the good left in me.
Repressed.
I am a wreck
I am a wreck
I am a wreck

So long I've been,
Trapped in the wake of a horrible dream,
Never mercy,
Only pulling teeth.
So long I've been,
Enraged but unable to scream.
So long, so fucking long.

I've been so long, checking my back, looking over my own shoulders
Afraid to breathe, I'm bottled up to self destruct,
And that still wasn't enough
I'm ready to have pride, and worth, not apprehension.
So I'm going to live the life you stole from me.
