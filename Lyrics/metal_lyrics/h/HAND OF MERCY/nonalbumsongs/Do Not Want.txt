Pick it up;

This is fucking pathetic
This is not how I wanted my life to be
Feeling so apathetic
I need something for these five days of the week

Take a different route in
I fall short of my own dead dreams
There is no way out that I can see
This is not how I wanted my life to be

You're on a power trip
I've had a fucking enough of it
It's time to lose your attitude

You're on a power trip
You're a cunt and you're full of shit
8 hours a day; I can't take nothing out of it

Take a look at yourself
You take your stress out on everyone else
You're just falling in line
You're not worth my fucking time

You're fucked!

You're just falling in line
You're not worth my fucking time
You're just falling in line
You're not worth my fucking time

(help?)
It seems I can't
I've wasted all my days
I'll make it out
If it fucking kills me

You're on a power trip
I've had a fucking enough of it
It's time to lose your attitude

You're on a power trip
You're a cunt and you're full of shit
8 hours a day; I can't take nothing out of it

Pick it up;

This is fucking pathetic
This is not how I wanted my life to be
Feeling so apathetic
I need something for these five days of the week

Never again, will I stand in line
Never again, will I fall behind
Fall behind

Never fall in line
Never fall behind.
