GET THE FUCK OUT !

This time hes come to rip apart,
Every bit of fun we ever had,
We will not stand in his way,
For it will throw us down.

Don't have to fake who,
Cant see the truth,
Open ya' mind,
And we're breaking through.

Fall down to your knees,
Never to be seen again,
Pick up all the things you lost when you,
Slowly past away,
Then you remembered the life,
You once owned.
You can't forget the past and head towards,
The future first.

It's not right for you,
It's not right to do,
Control your mind,
You're breaking through.

Fall down to your knees,
Never to be seen again,
Pick up all the things you lost when you slowly past away,

Then you remembered the life you once owned,
You can't forget about the past and head towards the future first.

It's time to know how far,
These fucking games will go,
We cannot play for long,
I'll show you how you should
