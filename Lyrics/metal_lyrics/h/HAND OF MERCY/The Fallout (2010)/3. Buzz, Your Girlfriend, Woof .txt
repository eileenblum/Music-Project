Bite your fucking tongue, you're emptier than everyone
Live and let live, what's to forgive, guilt is not an issue
Practice what you preach and stop living your double fucking life
Is it really what you believe in or another god damn trend?

And though it seems, all to easy to point the finger
This hypocrisy is clearly just a call for attention
Feeding on fragile minds, to condescend, to patronise
Passing judgement, with no confidence in your own heart

I've seen you spend the nights executing what you criticize,
You've been telling lies
Label us the walking dead, you're not worthy of the ground you tread
Play judge and jury, with blood on your hands, and fury in your head

Don't think, don't speak a word
There's no redemption for a heart so weak
The mask is slipping
Seeing the real you for the first time
The mask is slipping
I hope I don't become like you

Your hook is contradicting yourself, you put your faith on a shelf
So save face and reputation, transforming into somebody else
Welcome conformity with open arms, selling yourself, fuck

Do these words come from the inside?
What is it that you're trying to find?
We were born with a right to choose and most of us weren't born to lose
Drag yourself down if you must, but you cannot take any of us!

Don't think, don't speak a word
There's no redemption for a heart so weak
The mask is slipping
Seeing the real you for the first time
The mask is slipping
I hope I don't become like you
