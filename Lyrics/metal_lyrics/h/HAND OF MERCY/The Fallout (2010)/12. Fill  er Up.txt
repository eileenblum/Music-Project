It's always the last time, always a welcome change of mind
A sudden shift to alter the past, but you know it'll never fucking last
Have you become so confused? 'cause you've been taking wrong turns with every path you choose
Playing the game to lose, every victory you face is a day you can't stand in your own shoes

I've seen you here before, walking the halls, falling through the fucking doors
Another night, another empty heart, forever sifting through the dark
You're always looking second best, sort yourself out, you're a fucking mess
You've become old news, just a warning to others of a life that's been abused

It's always the last time, always a welcome change of mind
A sudden shift to alter the past, but you know it'll never fucking last
Have you become so confused? 'cause you've been taking wrong turns with every path you choose
Playing the game to lose, every victory you face is a day you can't stand in your own shoes

Brave face, even though disrespect's all that's to be found
What you call your happiness will come crashing down and...

It won't make a sound
So quit your fucking around!

Whispers under the low light, I'll be taking you home soon
The conscience never interrupts, always down to give it up

You'll take your time to decide, it'll be another late night
As long as you're wanted then it's alright
How'd you achieve this empty space? Desperation's plastered on your face
The world looks down at you and you won't save yourself
Dying in misery. Bitch!
Your best days are long gone
