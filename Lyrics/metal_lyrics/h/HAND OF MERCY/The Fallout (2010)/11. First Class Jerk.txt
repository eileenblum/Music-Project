There's a cruel change in the air, I'm suffocating and wanting to die
So selfish to say you'll feel abandoned, you're half the reason I left this behind

Too many steps in the wrong direction
Repeat, repeat, every day is the fucking same
Remain stagnant, remain content
Losing sight of the surface I need an escape

Try to hold me back 'cause you're scared, you're scared of what might happen without you
Construct a horror story of fiction, of nothingness that fades to black
The tide has turned so fast, what the fuck happened here?
I must rid myself of this dead weight, release the shackles there's no turning back
So many years, side by side, now all meaningless

Too many steps in the wrong direction
Repeat, repeat, everyday is the fucking same
Remain stagnant, remain content
Rising up to the surface I found my escape

We won't be here forever, I've got myself to worry about
Gazing in the right direction, raising my whisper to a shout

Try to stand in my way, then let the bloodshed begin
Don't drag me down with your sinking ship, I must rise above
So fucking much for thick as thieves, you're all dead to me
