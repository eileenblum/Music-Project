Haunted by a past you can't ignore
The mind races with the thought of your world
Slowly caving in, burning the candle at both ends
Your shadow, your only friend

You never wanted it, you just needed it
Awaken from this nightmare
And don't ever look back...
And don't ever look back...

These dark clouds are passing, forgotten, they're fading away
Pour the salt on the wound and feel nothing
Face yourself and stop running away

These dark clouds are passing, forgotten, they're fading away
Pour the salt on the wound and feel nothing
Face yourself and stop running away

All the bitterness and the sweet you taste, the sweet you taste
All the truth, the lies and the spit in your face, the spit in your face
Ignite the spark, feed fuel to the flame, feed fuel to the flame
Stand up, stay gold, live for today!
Live for today!

No more living on borrowed time
Burn the pages that lie, it's your time to shine
And don't ever look back...
And don't ever look back
