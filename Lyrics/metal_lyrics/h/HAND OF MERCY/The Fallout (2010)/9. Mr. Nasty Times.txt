Unstoppable, I know that my glass is always half full
In a change of tide, I'm wearing my heart on the inside

Looking over my shoulder, I see the blue sky bringing air to the breathless
And when the world gets colder, we will fight this war together
And only the strong can survive this weather

We've had less than second best and been careless with the time at hand
But through all the years, you've wiped away my tears and silenced the fear
And not a single person could tell me to live all alone if you want to live happily
I would not go quietly, cause you can't destroy a family

Unstoppable, I know that my glass is always half full
In a change of tide, I'm wearing my heart on the inside

And we will fight the war together, we'll make it through the weather
Rain, hail or shine, we'll keep pushing on!

Forward we are heading
Are you on board?
Lick my wounds and soldier on, all enemies as good as gone
Hold the world in our hands, all along this was the master plan!
This was a master plan, we've got the world in our hands
The burdens you once faced, my friends, are meaningless!

Seeking out the truth and cutting all out losses
We'll cast it all aside, the bitter, the weak, and the twisted ties
This is what I'll remember on my dying day
We're on the journey home, united, we fight it, and right all the wrongs on the way

Drop it!
We'll cast it aside, the bitter, weak, and twised ties
No grievance, no regrets, we're don wasting time on the tragic
We're don wasting time on the tragic
