Fuck!

All you stood for has turned to dust
As you walked away and turned your back on us
Our anger just turns to shame
I let you into my life and I've only got myself to blame

This time you won't be bailed out from the mess you've made
Wasted days, you refuse to change
You play the victim
It's always the fucking same
This open invitation won't last forever
This was a two way street and all signs are pointing in the wrong direction

Watch as your friends say goodbye
Watch as these days slowly die
Watch as this falls by the wayside
What's the excuse this time?

Relations hang by a thread
Make me believe this is worth it
Sit this one out yet again
Falling short of what's expected

And there you fucking go again
Making assumptions about your lost friends
So bow your head and say your goodbyes
And walk the fuck away
Bow your head and say your goodbyes
Walk the fuck away, just walk the fuck away

This time you won't be bailed out from the mess you've made
Wasted days, you refuse to change
You play the victim
It's always the fucking same
This open invitation won't last forever
This was a two way street and all signs are pointing in the wrong direction

I'll make myself heard
It's the last straw
You've gone too far
Your name won't be remembered
Your existence has been erased
