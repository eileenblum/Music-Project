Recollecting what I've heard, to live in the past is to die before the future
Look in the mirror, you're just getting older (but it's not over)
Deliberate latter-day rights and wrongs, know what you've got before it's gone
You've built these castles in the air

Who can re-write the lines of their own history?
Just say 'What's done is done' and move on!
Without the courage to stand up and be strong, shy away your face, it's clear you're just escaping!
All the mindless fear that you have been creating, sold yourself short again

Hide away behind closed doors, no-one comes in at all
All the faces you loved from before, you don't recognize anymore
You've gone out of your way to destroy all the ties that meant anything to you
And it's a sad fucking sight, that in your mind, this is justified

Recollecting what I've heard, to live in the past is to die before the future
Look in the mirror, you're just getting older (but it's not over)
And you told me you'd never live for a day that's better, and what you had is all that you'd ever need
You've built these castles in the air

Everyday there's less and less of your pride, and through your eyes I see you're empty inside
So afraid of any change, all that you'll leave behind is regret and shame

Digging your own fucking grave, you live alone and you'll die the same way
Digging your own fucking grave, you live alone and you'll die the same fucking way...
