Everything is already here
There's no need to create anymore
Just connect to the magnum brain
Log in to the global heart

You know they're watching you
Coming to drain your conscience
Of all the things akin to a
Human soul you will forget them all

Then all your needs will be satisfied
Countdown to perfect fulfillment
Even fun won't be funny anymore
No end justifies such means

Are these my thoughts that
I'm thinking or am I merely conforming
To what they want me to think
Getting lost in the goggle mirror?
Is this my face that I'm watching
Every line a fault to be wiped away
Until I get the perfect features
To get lost in the goggle mirror?

And everything will be there for you
Every feeling you wanna feel
Every tear you need to cry
Every second that passes by
Every hope someone else
Has hoped for you

Are these my thoughts that
I'm thinking or am I merely conforming
To what they want me to think
Getting lost in the goggle mirror?
Is this my face that I'm watching
Every line a fault to be wiped away
Until I get the perfect features
To get lost in the goggle mirror?
