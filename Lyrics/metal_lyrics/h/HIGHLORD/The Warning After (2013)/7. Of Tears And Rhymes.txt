It might be so easy, easier than you'd ever thought
Just forget all that you think
The world wants you to be
We spend some time together, than we
Spend some time with ourselves
What is the difference, my friend
After all?

Please, oh please, now heal these wounds
Ooh, precious thing, heal my wounds

I'm standing here, naked, in the spendour of your sight
Wondering how much of us has been wasted and gone
A wounded angel, falling bleeding to the ground
I'll turn my water into wine, turn my tears into rhymes

For all the love I've loved in vain
I hate your love, 'cause it brings me pain

Please, oh please, now heal these wounds
Ooh, precious thing, heal my wounds

I'm standing here, naked, in the spendour of your sight
Wondering how much of us has been wasted and gone
A wounded angel, falling bleeding to the ground
I'll turn my water into wine, turn my tears into rhymes
So she left me all alone
With a blessing and a curse
Wondering if my ghosts and demons will always be me
