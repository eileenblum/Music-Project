Then came the day that all would stop and
Realized my world was ruled by slobs, well
Not even sure the name of god was spelt like that
My friend, I don't believe in love, no
My love, I don't believe in friends, say
I just believe in this gun I'm holding in my hand
So I scream out loud, I scream

Hey! Do you think we are ready?
(Yeah!)
Do you think we are here to stay?
To claim our place in this wicked world...
Hey! Do you think that we are afraid?
(No!)
Do you think we've got what it takes?
To claim our place in this wicked world...

We are the spoiled sons and daughters
Of a world that no longer bothers
Cradled in the 80's dreams of omnipotence
Our souls are trapped and reflected
By buildings of steel and glass, so
We are so pissed off it could be a form of art
