So you want to hear the noise I make when I break
because you guess it can sound like music too
Well I've got news for you
I don't want to dream
Dreams somebody else has
Dreamt for me anymore

Lost in a never ending haze of salvation and damnation
Happiness and depression, ups and downs of my soul
It's too late when you realize
Time isn't on your side anymore
Nothing is forever, except what is unknown
Then the warning after comes

I have played with that fire for more than a while
Sure it was a joke, but some jokes
They are not for free
Never had any reward for being what I am
Just the chance of being able to live day by day

Lost in a never ending haze of salvation and damnation
Happiness and depression, ups and downs of my soul

It's too late...
