[ Music:Alessandro Muscio - Words:Stefano Droetto ]

The Prophecy was right
I know it for all the tears I cried
How can we face this day?
The pillars of fate are falling down

Help me to see
If there's a reason to believe
If there's a place for you and me.....

Oh Oh Day by day we lose our faith
Lords of the World we won't protect you
Crossing the mysterious line

The gift of Creation makes us Divine
We won't come back this time
Don't wait for us we're far away.
To conquer what the time denies
(We're) growing stronger, (we're) goin' insane!
Back from the past will rise
Someone to fight what we became

Help me to see
If there's a reason to believe
If there's a place for you and me.....

Oh Oh Day by day we lose our faith
Lords of the World we won't protect you
Oh Oh Step by step we reach the Sky
We are the Gods of nonentity!
