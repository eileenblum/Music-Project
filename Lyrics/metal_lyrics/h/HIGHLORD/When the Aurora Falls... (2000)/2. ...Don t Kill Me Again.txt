[ Music:Highlord - Words:Stefano Droetto ]

Back from my last War
I head to the rest of my life
No one could tell me
If they wait for me to appear

I've lost my time trying to understand
If their truth is the right one for me
Tell me now......Show me the way!

I'm waiting for what I don't know
No one cares if I'm insecure
A dark hand...on their blind eyes
Show them things they take for real

And I'm sharing my words with you and you don't hear.
Revealing the truth to who lives in fear
Tell me now......Show me the way!

From time to time I realize
What I see for good they just can't see
If there's a light for me to see
Maybe I'm just too blind...please don't kill me again!

This time is my last day
I hope I won't be alone
My heart starts to rumble
Maybe the time for me has come.

And I'm sharing my words with you and you don't hear.
Revealing the truth to who lives in fear
Tell me now......Show me the way!

From time to time I realize
What I see for good they just can't see
If there's a light for me to see
Maybe I'm just too blind...please don't kill me again!
