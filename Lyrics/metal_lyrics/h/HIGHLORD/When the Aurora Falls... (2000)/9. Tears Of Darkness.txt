[ Music:Alessandro Muscio/Stefano Droetto - Words:Alessandro Muscio ]

I dream the dawn of the Darkness - the embrace!
Heavenly lights dance in the night
Blood on the altar smells sweet as it burns
I cried my love, - I sacrifice my joy!
Cast out as my father, - bounded in Hell!
Then come a sweet voice, with words of relief
A dark glowing woman had my tears received
She awakened me,  - and I fell into the Abyss!

And shining lights tempted my pride
I wept blood and I drank my tears:

And He exiled me to wander
In Darkness, the land of Nod
For by a long road of Mercy
My children will dwell in the Light: Tears Of Darkness!

With fire and sword, will come their revenge
As the dark-winged angel had said
The ancient power is lost through the wars
In hiding we remain, - 'cause the hunt still goes on!

No one could say when the Father will rise:
And call for the City of Judgment

And He exiled me to wander
In Darkness, the land of Nod
For by a long road of Mercy
My children will dwell in the Light: Tears Of Darkness!

"When the snow consumes the earth
and the sun gutters like a candle in the wind
then, and only then will there be born a woman,
the last Daughter of Eve.

And you won't know this woman, except by the
Mark of the Moon on her,
And she will face treachery, hatred, and pain
But in her there is the last hope"
