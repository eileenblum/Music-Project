[ Music:Highlord - Words:Vasce ]

Why must you always kill
These thoughts and these words?
Why must you always reject our plans?
Now we want to ride the stars
And we're always on the run
'cause the life in this world is not enough.

Too many doubts in my mind
But I'm sure that tonight

ALL I WANT - now is to turn the pages and change my life
Escapin' away
ALL I WANT - is to walk on the stages don't be afraid
If I will go one day.

I'm tryin' to live day by day
Searchin' answers to millions of questions
Everybody knows that life can change
But if you listen to your heart
You can find your right way
And believing in yourself
You'll live in peace.

Too many doubts in my mind.
But I'm sure that tonight.

ALL I WANT - now is to turn the pages and change my life
Escapin' away
ALL I WANT - is to walk on the stages don't be afraid
If I will go one day.

Al I want:All I need:All I want:All I need:
