[ Music:Vasce - Words:Vasce ]

I remember when we were still together
Had the world in the hands.
Nobody could share us we lived as just one thing
Tell me "what's happened"? We're lost in the night.
I was your hope and you the air I breathed
We stayed under the rainbow dreaming of Heaven.
With you I could fly as an eagle through the wind.
Give me light to see, I've become blind another time.

But this time I swear, you'll never be lonely
You always light my way
I can't see you cry, my strength, my glory
Please stay just when the Aurora falls.

And the sun is warming my skin
All the memories fly in the wind.
Our love more true was when we were children
I can't stay another time in loneliness without you.

But this time I swear, you'll never be lonely
You always light my way
I can't see you cry, my strength, my glory
Please stay just when the Aurora falls.
