[ Music:Vasce/Alessandro Muscio - Words:Vasce ]

So many years have passed by
And lots of things have changed
We're no more the same
And I've seen vanish all my dreams.

I've spent so much time
Tryin' to fight the world
And all its crimes.
Now only I understand
That this war is with myself.

The winter is ending now
I've always your
Face in my mind no more words
Could let you stay
And no man will light your way

I've spent so much days
Tryin' to find a place where I can stay
There's a voice inside of me
Singin':" I'm my worst enemy".
