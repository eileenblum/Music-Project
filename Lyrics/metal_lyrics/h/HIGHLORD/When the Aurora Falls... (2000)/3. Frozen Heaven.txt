[ Music:Alessandro Muscio/Stefano Droetto - Words:Alessandro Muscio ]

Searching myself in the maze of my dreams
From the westwinds I can see my
Soul in an icy dream.
Alone, deceived and lost
You were the mainstay of my world
"Your God is me: I'm in all you see:"
Princess of the Dawn take my hands
In this void of pain
I'm lost in this Frozen Heaven
Lady of Aurora hold my soul
Shall be you my hope
Save me from this Frozen Heaven
You take my mind and bring it
in your illusions' world
Trying to capture my will
And I want escape from this prison,
your Heaven is turned to Hell,
Dreamy sight: save my life:
Princess of the Dawn take my hands
In this void of pain
I'm lost in this Frozen Heaven
Lady of Aurora hold my soul
Shall be you my hope
Save me from this Frozen Heaven
