[ Music:Alessandro Muscio - Words:Stefano Droetto/Alessandro Muscio ]

Burning skies,
Angels of hell are marching through the stars
Showing me weak lights through the dark curtains of all your secret lies
Cold winter wind
Kills with no mercy the depth of my lost soul
Now I realize that I lived in an endless dream of pain and sorrow

Fire lines cross the night
Empires' re falling and my pride still rises

Stormy seas
Call me while the Black Moon rises up in the sky
Demons are flying in my mind as witches at full moon night
Time has come,
Now you will taste the whole might of my deepest rage
I've got the wind in my soul and you cannot stop this winter wind

Fire lines cross the night
And I'm the one who never dies
I'm on my way to endless sky
Rainbows fall, heed the call,
Screaming Perpetual Fury
And I'm the one who never dies
I'll cross the gates of space and time
Don't stop my flight through bloody skies
Of my Perpetual Fury, NO!

Dark wings grip my heart
I'll try to beat them
Should it be my last fight
As the dusk defeats the day so you beat me,
But the dawn's closing near:

And I'm the one who never dies
I'm on my way to endless sky
Rainbows fall, heed the call,
Screaming Perpetual Fury
And I'm the one who never dies
I'll cross the gates of space and time
Don't stop my flight through bloody skies
Of my Perpetual Fury, NO!
