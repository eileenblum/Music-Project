[ Music:Alessandro Muscio - Words:Stefano Droetto ]

You found me lying in this lonely road...
Bleeding and covered with white snow
My eyes captured yours but suddenly they turn to ice
Now I follow your steps as a long lost child.

I forgot my name, I had your love denied.
Destroying my memories, can you help me to remember tonight?

In the dark I'll catch a star to see
If your heart belongs to me.
I'll fly on this cold night just to see
your gaze on me again...again...

I swear I won't change my words,
I know you can't hear the northern wind...

How many tears I cried
For what I believe in.
Destroying my memories, can you come tonight?

In the dark I'll catch a star to see
If your heart belongs to me.
I'll fly on this cold night, just to see
your gaze on me again...again...
