There is an Alter in my Ego
Always telling me the wrong path I can choose
There is an alarm clock in my brain
Tick-tock-telling me the hours, the faces, the time, the lies
And there are lies all around me,
In my friends' words, my lover's looks, in each and all of my books
Seems I've been betrayed all this time

By the lies in my words, in my world, all the lies in the truth
And I'm tired of feeling sorry
I've been sorry all this time
I'm so sick of feeling guilty
Feeling guilty for living my life
The jester in a dark corner crying, sorry for
All the pain he's caused, he hops and dances
He wears his better mask and his most flamboyant costume

While inside he doesn't know if he's alive or dead
Nor me or my friends are able to live
Always looking for cheap girls and thrills, happy tricks and treats
Furry animals can trick you, your own mother could slit
Your throat at night, you might lose your sanity, boy!
And I'm tired of feeling sorry
I've been sorry all this time
I'm so sick of feeling guilty

Feeling guilty for living my life
The jester in a dark corner crying, sorry for
All the pain he's caused, he hops and dances
He wears his better mask and his most flamboyant costume
While inside he doesn't know if he's alive or dead
I'm not a Bit of a Torrent kind
The Dead don't bother me
But the Living are such a pain in the ass

The jester in a dark corner crying, sorry for
All the pain he's caused, he hops and dances
He wears his better mask and his most flamboyant costume
While inside he doesn't know if he's alive or dead
