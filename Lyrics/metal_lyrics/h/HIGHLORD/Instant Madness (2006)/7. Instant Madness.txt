This world's hungry for violence, and I'm here to feed it
Somebody said we're fuckin' the wrong hole
It's shit but I'd enjoy it
G-sus Krist with a hard-on and a lust for young flesh
He was drinking his glass like a man who was searching for something
I'm like fresh water flowing from a mountain spring

Being born so pure just to die suffocated in the sea
I'm a golden god or a glazed devil
A wicked angel
A lusting mirror for your desires to reflect
I am a genius or a stupid fool
A pointing finger
Some discomfort you'd better try
Is holiness to be attained through dark thoughts and impure deeds?

I fear Heaven gates' selection...
Close your eyes, let your visions flow
If women are a weapon of mass destruction
Give'em roses then make them bleed
There's something worse than dying for love
I'm a golden god or a glazed devil
A wicked angel
A lusting mirror for your desires to reflect

I am a genius or a stupid fool
A pointing finger
Some discomfort you'd better try
