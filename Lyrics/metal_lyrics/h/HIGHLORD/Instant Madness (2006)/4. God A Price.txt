Crying in the dark won't solve any problem
Looking behind, won't bring her back
Listen to my story, my hopes, my lost love, my mistakes...

She must know 'bout the things I'm talkin'
We all face it someday
But now it's time to show what we've just learnt
She's a Queen I elope and worship
A stinging bee in my head
A rusted razorback that wrings my heart tonight
('Cause we) don't need a reason to get on fire
Don't need a thousand words to show my desire

It's true... Baby I said it's true!
When the night came over you realized
That story was changing your life
The pain you felt was the price to pay
To stay by one man's side
When the night came over you realized
That loving means giving, not taking
The pain you felt was the price to pay

To stay by my side

You said my love was a cage for you
You said you couldn't fly
But I'm the angel whose heaven was denied
('Cause we) don't need a reason to get on fire
Don't need a thousand words to show my desire
It's true... Baby I said it's true!

When the night came over you realized
That story was changing your life
The pain you felt was the price to pay
To stay by one man's side
When the night came over you realized
That loving means giving, not taking
The pain you felt was the price to pay
To stay by my side
