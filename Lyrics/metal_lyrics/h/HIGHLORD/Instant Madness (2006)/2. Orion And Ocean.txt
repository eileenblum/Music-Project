Orion and Ocean
A Perpetual Love
Dreaming on a blue
Diamond path... eternally A radiant lady dressed in white
Coral lips and dewy eyes
The one who holds out
Her waves to the Pleiades
Frozen tears warm my heart
A dying gem in a golden shell
Ethereal spirits lead
Our lonely hands The moon reflected on the sea
... our sweetest kiss...
The rain falling on your lips
... my tearless weeping...
Death has woven our wedding dress
For you I'd refuse the throne in hell
Life has part our bodies...
Not our hearts
A marriage of water and stars
Dearest children of Poseidon and Ra
The stargazer and the Maiden
Hell and Heaven Orion and Ocean
A Perpetual Love
Dreaming on a blue
Diamond path... eternally
Endless flight of
Two broken hearts
Passing over blue
Diamond paths... eternally Floating upon
Hydrogen lakes
Towards clear and distant waves
Every night
I come into your depth
In an ambrosial erotic embrace
Bed of sand
So far away
From human pain
Lie with me
And kiss my heart as
If this were our goodbye at last Lies... Pain...
That's all we have spent in our life
Buried in the Palace of Gods
Enthroned upon a sea of skulls
Dominator of mankind in life...
Lonely lover lost in the stars... Hold my hands...
Forever... it is what we're searching for...
Orion and Ocean
A Perpetual Love
Dreaming on a blue
Diamond path... eternally
Endless flight of
Two broken hearts
Passing over blue
Diamond paths... eternally
