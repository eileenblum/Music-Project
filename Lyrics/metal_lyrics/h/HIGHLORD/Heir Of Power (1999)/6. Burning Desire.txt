[Words Alessandro Muscio]

In this morning
The sun seems not shine
My mind is stifled by the memory of your eyes
Remembering the days
When the sun still shone on us
I don't know how I could wait an year
Before seeing you again

Seasons are changin' now
Leaves and snow will fall
The winter breeze is blowin' on my heart
Only your memory
Can keep me warm
Until I will come back

With every moment, with every hour
With every day I'm coming to you

Burning desire - my life has changed
Burning desire - I feel you in my arms again

Shadows have gone away
But you're so far way

Burning desire - my life has changed
Burning desire - I feel you in my arms again

Seasons are spinning fast
My burning desire

[solos]

Seasons are changing now...

Burning desire - my life has changed
Burning desire - I feel you in my arms again

The shadows fill my world
But your eyes still light my way
With every moment, with every hour
With every day I'm coming to you...
