God! hear me as I am screaming out my rage 
Father! guide my hands through the battle fields 
My sons follow me now is the time to fight 
I'll show you a way stained of blood to the glory 

By the will of our King 
We will fight until our days end 
By the rights of the holy Crown 
We will bring Death and face every foe! 

The kingdom is calling your hearts made of pure Steel 
So carry on, point up your swords to the mighty sky 

By the will....... 

[instrumental]

And the battle was fought....... 
....by the will of a King.....by the will of a King! 

Time never looks behind 
So follow me again 
We hold the light to save the future 
Now all the world will see 
Life was too short for us 
Not to become a part of history 

[Words: Stefano]
