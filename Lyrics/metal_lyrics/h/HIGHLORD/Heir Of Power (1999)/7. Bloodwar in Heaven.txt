We have always tried to judge 
What is Good what is Evil 
We have always tried to win 
But now all is over! 
Life is too short to learn 
But I know you are my answer 
And demons grow in my head 
But I can't stop them... 

Strange lights....shining in the sky 

Time is never enough 
I can't find the right words 
To make you understand 
That I feel an emotion 

This half-moon tonight 
Is smiling with the stars... 

I see through your eyes 
What you feel now inside 
Angels are crying 
Falling in this Hell 
You trust me again 
But I'll love you until the end 
I'm trying to fight 
This Bloodwar in Heaven 

Lights and shadows obfuscate my mind 
What is wrong and what is right this time? 
Queen of Death you can save me tonight 
Destroy my doubts 
I could die for her.
