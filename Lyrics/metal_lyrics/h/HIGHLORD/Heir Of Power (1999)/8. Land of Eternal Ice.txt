There is no time dividing my steps 
From the unfair end of life 
I know the Winter will 
Reach its fingers to close my eyes 

Shapeless demons 
Crawling out to smash our shields 
Blood on my blade 
Dance in vain to stop their charge 

Pray for us inside, you know we live to fight 
We fall on the ground, like rain-drops in a storm 

Princess of the snow 
Hold my hands in silence.... 
Only your beauty can save my soul.. 

[Chorus:] from the eternal Ice!

Dark steel forged in Hell 
Forbidden words to burn our flesh 
Evil eyes on me 
Searching my soul for any weakness 
Wind on my face 
Awake my senses from a filthy dullness 
My faith shakes 
As I see the end coming near..... 

Pray for us inside, you know we live to fight 
We fall on the ground, like rain-drops in a storm 

Princess of the snow.... 
Hold my hands in silence 
Only your beauty can save my soul.. 
From the eternal Ice...Ice....Ice....
