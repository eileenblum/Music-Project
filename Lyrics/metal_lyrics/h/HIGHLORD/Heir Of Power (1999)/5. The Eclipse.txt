[Words Stefano Droetto]

Dar clouds are gathering on my soul
I fear the day on wich I will fail
Ancient scrolls show words of power
Through a magical gate I'll fly to the Unknown

Below my sight from everywhere they're coming
Terror is snaring my mind...

In my dreams I see thousands
Of braves marchin' on
Blazing dragons arisin'
To guard the kingdom's call

I open my eyes while the eclipse starts
Darklord's bards are tuning their warsong
There is no time to waste
I'll lead the hope through the hordes of chaos

Steel and claws please their blood thirsrt
While magical spells shatter the sky 
In my dreams I see thousands
Of braves marchin' on
Blazing dragons arisin'
To guard the kingdom's call

From heaven to hell as was written
Steel will be molten and mixed with blood
Heroes and Gods now are fighting
Toether, forever, once and for all

Steel and claws please their blood thirsrt
While magical spells shatter the sky 
In my dreams I see thousands
Of braves marchin' on
Blazing dragons arisin'
To guard the kingdom's call
