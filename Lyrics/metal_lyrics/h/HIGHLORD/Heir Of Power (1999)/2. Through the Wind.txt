[Words Alessandro Muscio]

Here, alone, I'm searching the answer of life
But I can't fly by
Questions and thoughts are stifling my mind
It's hard to drive'em out
But now my time has come
Like the wind i'll run
They fool me with their falsness
Today I see
They've tried to stop me with theyr hypocrisy
here's no way to stop me now
My time has come
I got no more chains

Through the wind I'll fly
Under the sun I'll run
I'll follow the starlight
And I won't waste my time... through the wind!

Has not vome the time for me to give up
Our time is changing
The winds are taking me voices from the nigth
It' the time to run
I'm facing the shadows of my mind
I'm running out of this night

Through the wind I'll fly
Under the sun I'll run
I'll follow the starlight
And I won't waste my time... through the wind!
