[lyrics - Stefano Droetto]

Out of your door
There i a stair made of gems
Each one of them
Is a dream to believe in

Future is written
Written for every on of us
Maybe I'll change it
Now that you're not the same I knew

The days have passed now
Many years are passing by my side
They leave me here alone
So all I can see is sand in the wind

Before my eyes
There are many choices
Some may be easier
This ways to walk on

Future is written
Written for every on of us
Maybe I'll change it
Now that you're not the same I knew

The days have passed now
Many years are passing by my side
They leave me here alone
So all I can see is sand in the wind

[solos]

Looking the future
With sorrow in the eyes
Shaking with terror
We know we must fight

Future is written
Written for every on of us
Maybe I'll change it
Now that you're not the same I knew

The dreams are goin' away
Many tears have fallen from my eyes
They leave me here again
So all I can see is sand in the wind
