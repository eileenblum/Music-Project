[Words Stefano Droetto]

Dark wings flap on my face
Leadin' shadows all around me
My mind-span crash in the void
As their thoughts pierce my senses

Inside my heart I feel, a new star is rising
Givin' me the power to unlock stone shaped minds

In the dark they beg for light
The ethereal path they walk on, leaves no way out
Givin' no answers
From the past they wait for a sign
Tomorrow will be the day, when we all fly
Leavin' no marks of our life

Foolishness fill's up my eyes
As tears come down, the dream is fading
Frost bite stingin' the hope
The horizon is far, from our reaching

Inside my heart I feel, a new star is rising
Givin' me the power to unlock stone shaped minds

In the dark they beg for light
The ethereal path they walk on, leaves no way out
Givin' no answers
From the past they wait for a sign
Tomorrow will be the day, when we all fly
Leavin' no marks of our life

Oooouh...
As the sun set, I feel so strange...
Screamin' in agony
Too many faces, behind my shoulders...
Look at their broken chains
Can't swallow my tears... So easily
Can't go on my own... Without a helpfull hand
