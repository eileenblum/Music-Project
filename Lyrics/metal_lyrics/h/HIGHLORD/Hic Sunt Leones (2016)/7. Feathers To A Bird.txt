You know you might have pushed yourself too far
When you realize that even saying
A simple sentence as: "I am unhappy"
Has become so hard for you

You know things have reached the point of no return
When you can't understand anymore
If the quiet, silent vastness of the Ocean is still a friend
Or if it has become an enemy

You give me love
And you take my freedom away
You call it love when it makes you feel fine
You call it love when it makes you feel like dying

Take my fears, take my demons and my tears
Take my shouts in the night
Take my never sent love letters
Turn them into feathers
So I can use them to fly

I have no more desires left
But to be the melody you hear through the noise
Like feathers to a bird my voice will fly to you
And help us fill the void

Take my fears, take my demons and my tears
Take my shouts in the night
Take my never sent love letters
Turn them into feathers
So I can use them to fly

You give me love
And you take my mind away
But you never call it love, my friend
If it doesn't make you cry and bleed
Sometimes, just sometimes...
