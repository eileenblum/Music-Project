Father, father, why are they attacking us?
There needn't he a reason why
We'll fight hack without a cause

Father, father who is attacking us?
There needn't be a name or face
Wanna do well? Give 'em hell

Man is wolf to men
Who are wolves to other men
Who are less wolves then they are
Hatred is disease, retaliation is the cure

War is meaningless
If we have no enemies to fight
If the enemy and war are inside our heads
What is the reason why we display our warmight?

It's a me against you
Against him who is against
Who knows who world
War can be a blitz
Ignorance is bliss
But arrogance will never stop being so chic

Father, father, will they keep on coming back?
If you want a safe peace
Keep on fighting 'till they're wrecked

Father, father, is this all right or wrong?
If your flag waves in the end
Your name will be sung in a song
War is meaningless
If we have no enemies to fight
If the front and defence lines are inside our heads
What is the reason why we display our warmight?
War is a business in itself
