So here we are again, a new painting in an old frame
So many things have changed, yet we are still the same
Still our hunger is the best way to fight all that's fearsome
Still our dreams and passion seem to be stronger than wisdom

Recklessness is the force that makes you say:
"Thanks for all your efforts, world, but I'm still alive!"

Bravery is not how many fights you want to fight
It's all you realize you have survived when you're looking back at your life
You won't lose your honour if you die while trying to feel alive
There are still too many who fall without even knowing why

Recklessness is the force that makes you say:
"Thanks for all your efforts, world, but I'm still alive!"

Live day by day
Think like you were eternal

Running at breakneck speed with the clouds on your side
And a distant gleam of sun ahead
Will you be able to run faster
Than the storm once again
There will always be some sucker warning you:
"Hic Sunt Leones!"

Comradeship is not if different heads can somehow fit
It's still looking at each other's face after passing through so much shit
You know you are strong and smart enough to face the change
When those who thought they're leaders only work to get themselves estranged

Live day by day
Think like you were eternal

Running at breakneck speed with the clouds on your side
And a distant gleam of sun ahead
Will you be able to run faster
Than the storm once again
There will always be some fucker trying to scare you:
"Hic Sunt Leones!"
Running at breakneck speed with the clouds on your side
And a distant gleam of sun ahead
Will you be able to run faster
Than the storm once again
There will always be some sucker warning you:
"Hic Sunt Leones!"
