What's the force that leads us all
To live our lives as we're supposed to do
Or makes us waste all our time
Waiting for better times that never come

If we want to feel closer to God
We should raise our eyes to the sky more often
Then we can live a story that is surely true
Because we have lived it all in our minds

I believe this world is still full of good times
You can be sure I want to have them all
It's nice of you to care if I'm ready for the next world
Sorry, mister, I will take one world at a time

You think you live your life in circles
Oh, how do they open and close
When your mind goes beyond the structure of cycles
You will understand our lives move in coils

Why are you so scared of your instinct?
A wonderful force that you should always follow
It will make you ready for your next life
When you understand you never have been for this one

Should we fear an eternity of torment
While we can make our hell on earth so damn well?
Or should we think that displayed virtues
Won't buy us any better seat in the next life?
