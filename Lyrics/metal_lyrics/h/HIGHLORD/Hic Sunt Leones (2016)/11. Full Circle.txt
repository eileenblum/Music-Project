If you think that your God has forsaken this world
Come with me, I can show you where he has gone
While we were so busy looking for the meaning
Of existence that we forgot what it means to merely exist

I have lived so many lives
Does it mean I must be ready to die?
Come Full Circle, when the Age of the Lions returns

One thing that nobody will ever tell us
Is that going through reincarnation can hurt so much
But if the sky fell on my head today
I know I cannot die, 'cause I'm an idea, so I'd not be afraid

No one really changes, that's the curse of us all
But while we evolve, what we are isn't really getting lost

I have lived so many lives
Does it mean I must be ready to die?
Come Full Circle, when the Age of the Lions returns
After living so many lives
Can we finally be ready to die?
Close the Circle, let the Age of the Lions return

Let it return
