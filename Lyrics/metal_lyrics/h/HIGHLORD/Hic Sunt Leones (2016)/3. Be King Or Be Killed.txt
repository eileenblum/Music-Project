There are times you feel like
If you don't start to understand
How your mind really works
You'll never be able to survive yourself

That is when you'd better stop
To think that you are somehow doomed
And realize that what happens to you
Should be regarded more like a boon

It is the right time to break up
With the past and superstition
Break up with destructive habits
And negative thoughts
Evolve, change, evolve
It's time to be king or be killed

Brave are those who stay alive
Our only chance's to be strong and fight
Brave are those who stay alive

There are times you feel so desperate
You could sell your soul to the devil
It seems that one thing's not clear to you, son
They can make you give it away as a present

It is the right time to break up
With the past and superstition
Break up with destructive habits
And negative thoughts
Evolve, change, evolve
It's time to be king or be killed
It's time that I break up
With my past and superstitions
Break up with destructive habits
And negative thoughts
I will evolve, change, evolve
It's time to be king or be killed
