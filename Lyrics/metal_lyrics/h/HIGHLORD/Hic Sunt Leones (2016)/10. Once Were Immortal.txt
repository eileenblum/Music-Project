No matter how old or wise we can be
No matter if they call us sir, your honour or PhD
There are monsters that still live under our bed
They bite and snarl and drool and scratch
With fangs that rip and shred

No more: "Lay me down to sleep"
'Cause no one else could my soul keep
But if you'd die before I wake
To hell with you my soul you can take

The years that pass by will not make us grow old
Wisdom comes along with the scars on our bodies
With the wrinkles on our faces, the wounds in our souls
And the empty, lonely, desperate looks in our eyes

There can never ever come the day
The price we've got to pay seems fair
They once were immortal, now they're old and frail
The tears of a forlorn child still there

No matter how rich or successful we could get
No matter if people look at us in fear, awe or regret
Deep inside us there still lives a child
That won't stop crawling on all fours
Looking for a place to hide

Growing up turns into growing old
All of our dreams only turned to hopes
No place for compassion
Only sadness and decay
