It's the same old setting, only the actors change
If I offer you a Jack and Cock, will you blow my soul away?
Just forget what the preachers say
You can get close to Heaven
Only with a man who's got a Hell inside himself

It starts as a tickle in your head
It crawls down your spine just like a thrill
Then it burns out like a fire
Right between your thighs

Shake it or leave it, this is my Ass O Ass
The truth lies in the sweat
So kill me with your bitter sweet death tonight
Shake it or leave it, this is my Ass O Ass
The truth lies in the sweat
So kill me now, I've chosen my poison

You make me feel like some kind of saint
In a triple X-rated haze of Father, Son and Holy Ghost
Yet if the body is a temple, then yours was clearly made
For violation, so give me head 'til the end of time

You've got all your life baby
But I've only got tonight
I can never get enough
Of that diving in your muff

Shake it or leave it, baby, yeah!
I've chosen my poison
