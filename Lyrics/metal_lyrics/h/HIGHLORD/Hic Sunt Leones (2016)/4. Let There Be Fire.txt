Let there be fire, let it burn wild
Let there be fire, let it rage out fierce
Liquors strong like molten lead
Burn down the poor believer's throat
Does he know about elevation?
Does he know about purification?

Being an artist all your life
Being an artist as a full time job
Letting poisons corrupt your body and soul
Allowing their rotten air to desecrate your temple
Only to ascend a higher level of art
(Only) to achieve the best of what you can do

I am the Earth, still I am the Fire
I am the Earth, on which the Fire can run wild

Let there be fire
Let's all find out
What is this buzz all about
Let there be fire
Let it mold your soul
Like clay, wax or the hand of some god above

Let there be fire
Let's all find out
What is this buzz all about
Let there be fire
Let it mold your soul
Like clay, wax or the hand of some god above

Do those people know what happens to you
When you're all alone, struggling with Art?
Do they know this could be them, me or you?
