Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Of my own being sick and tired
I don't know what I'm aiming for
All I see here around of me
Is our best dreams crushed down by their feet
And I know, this ain't meant to be

I am trying to come to terms with my past
But it will bear its scars forever
Being a borderline is so trendy today

The edge you walk on is oh, so steep
What will I find down there?

I'm walking on the wrong side of sanity
It's a place I know so well
Where I can play the bipolar shuffle

I have learnt throughout my life
Our mind's so strong it can trick itself
And I wonder, if that's good at all
My skin tells of who I am
This doesn't mean the story must be nice
Pretty child, come watch my downfall

The edge you walk on is oh, so steep
What will I find down there?

Cure me, clean me, I will get sick again
Soothe me, heal me, then give me a gun
I'll shoot again

The edge you walk on is oh, so steep
What will I find down there?

I'm walking on the wrong side of sanity
It's a place I know so well
Where I can play the bipolar shuffle
I'm verging on the funny side of lobotomy
Stepping on the morbid side of lucidity
So I can play the bipolar shuffle
