Stranded, outcast, misplaced and so fucked up
We are the new toys for the neighbours to play with
Forgotten, abandoned to ourselves
We are the Lethe to wash your conscience in

Within your mind the answer lies untold
Youâre looking for the truth where no truthâs ever to be found

Modern prophets, self-righteous gurus
No one knows what goes on when the doors are shut
Hysteric beauties, smooth seducers
Having their womb filled wonât make mothers out of them

Within your mind the answer lies untold
Youâre looking for the truth where no truthâs ever to be found

WE ARE! gross and rude
WE ARE! mean and proud (we are)
We are anything... anything you want us to be
WE ARE! back and proud
WE ARE! strong and loud (we are)
We are the main dish... please taste every thrash of me!

They make us starve and thirst on food, oil or water
As long as weâre in need itâs just the same to them
There is no left or right anymore
Just an organized mockery of humanity

Within your mind the answer lies untold
Youâre looking for the truth where no truthâs ever to be found

WE ARE! gross and rude
WE ARE! mean and proud (we are)
We are anything... anything you want us to be
WE ARE! back and proud
WE ARE! strong and loud (we are)
We are the main dish... please taste every thrash of me!
Every fuckinâ thrash of me, sucker!

Within your mind the answer lies untold
Youâre looking for the truth where no truthâs ever to be found

WE ARE! gross and rude
WE ARE! mean and proud (we are)
We are anything... anything you want us to be
WE ARE! back and proud
WE ARE! strong and loud (we are)
We are the main dish... please taste every thrash of,
Taste every thrash of, taste every thrash of me!
