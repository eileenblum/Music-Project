Disintegration
Do you want to be left alone?
Disaggregation
Things that canât stay as a whole

Thoughts are floating like useless burden
On a sea of carelessness

Talent frustration
Can you ever recognize a gift?
Lack of communication
And all the bullshit you believe

Thoughts are floating like useless burden
On a sea of carelessness

The hellish desire of a great Creature
Filled us with sighs
Will Death make flowers blossom
Out of our brains?
