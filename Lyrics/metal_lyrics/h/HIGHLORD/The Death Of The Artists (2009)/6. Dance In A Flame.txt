Iâve been trying, so hard
To follow all their rules
To be what the world wanted me to be
Painful the struggle, it was tearing me apart from within
All I got was a trembling shade
Of the man I thought I should be

Are we starting something thatâs really new?
Or love will make me a victim of my past once again?

You and me forever, free like the wind we breath
A dance in a flame our lives wonât last tonight
You and me forever, a leap into unknown seas
A gentle score to whom my heart will beat

A messed-up puzzle in a dark room
As the last memory of that day
Of that day fades out
I walked the streets of the world
With my pocket-size truth and my bag of lies
Too frightened to look that deep inside myself

Are we starting something thatâs really new?
Or love will make me a victim of my past once again?

You and me forever, free like the wind we breath
A dance in a flame our lives wonât last tonight
You and me forever, a leap into unknown seas
A gentle score to whom my heart will beat

You and me... forever free... dance like a flame...
