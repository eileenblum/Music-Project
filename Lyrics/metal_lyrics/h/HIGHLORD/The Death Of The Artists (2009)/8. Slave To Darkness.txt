King of a kin, enslaved by darkness
The hounds of Gaia, now scenting my blood

My soul will wonder eternally...
'Cause my heart's sake is to die for your beauty...

The unholy grave will grant our fire
Come now! my bride... they won't stop our hearts!

My soul will wonder eternally...
'Cause my heart's sake is to die for your beauty...

To attend a thousand times mankind tragedy
Within my hand-grasp, the centuries will die
For once in my life, I'll deviate Immortality
Embrace the warmth of a small fleeting lust

I dream the day, I cry in loneliness
The touch of Evil corrupting your lips

My soul will wonder eternally...
'Cause my heart's sake is to die for your beauty...

Oooh! Am I cursed by a demon? A servant of love... Drink from me...

My soul will wonder eternally...
'Cause my heart's sake is to die for your beauty...

To attend a thousand times mankind tragedy
Within my hand-grasp, the centuries will die
For once in my life, I'll deviate Immortality
Embrace the warmth of a small fleeting lust...
