I was tryin' to forget you all
'Cause the pain was too much for me to bear
God knows how I feel, how many times I tried to be

Forgive me father 'cause I think I'm gonna fail
And all my steps will bring me back, on my knees

I was ready to disappear
Leavin' my dreams and indulging on my fears
You know it takes some time and some passion to feel alive

Forgive me father, I'm afraid I'm gonna sin
And all my steps will bring me back!

A day will come for me
To rate all the life I've spent
Chasing what you call a dream... yeah...
Simply I don't care
If it's too late or maybe it's not
