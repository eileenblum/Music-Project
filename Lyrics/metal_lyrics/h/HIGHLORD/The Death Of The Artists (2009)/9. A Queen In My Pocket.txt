She's an angel
She's an alien
She can take you to the Sky, watch the stars and smile!

She's a Queen in love
But She's the Queen I love
She won't feel alone tonight, 17 thousand miles from my heart!

my heart... my heart...

Crazy rockets cross the sky
Looking for an empty heart to land on
Falling stars for those with open eyes
They will favour my desires

She's a fable
She's a song I'll never learn
She's a start before the end, she's a kiss under the rain

She's a wonder
But I wonder where She could be
She won't sleep with me tonight, She won't say a last goodbye

goodbye... goodbye...

Ooooooh... She's an angel... she's an angel...

Crazy rockets cross the sky
Looking for an empty heart to land on
Falling stars for those with open eyes
They will favour my desires
