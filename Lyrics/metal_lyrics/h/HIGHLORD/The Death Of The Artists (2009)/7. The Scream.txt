As long as my heart beats, I will keep on screaming
Stopped living in the shade of what I could have been
And it makes me feel free
Though it scares the hell out of me

This is how vile metals turn to gold
This is it, melt your body and your soul

Follow your emotions, scream until it hurts
Then scream beyond mankind and beyond this worldâs girth
As long as you crave for more
The scream will keep resounding

The things I canât control donât scare me anymore
By the tide I will be brought
In some unknown regions of my thought

This is how vile metals turn to gold
This is it, melt your body and your soul

Follow your emotions, scream until it hurts
Then scream beyond mankind
And beyond this worldâs girth
As long as you crave for more
The scream will keep resounding

Follow your instinct, run under the rain
Kneel down and face the reason for your pain
Follow your emotions, scream until it hurts
Then scream beyond mankind and beyond this worldâs girth
As long as you crave for more
The scream will keep resounding
