Come now, my son and listen to my wise words
They are just meant to soothe your weary soul
Come now, my son and listen to my wise words
Let me free your mindâ¦

Everyday in our life
We are scared by how our flesh can be so frail
So much that we need to believe
In a stronger spirit that will survive it

Our God offers you
Eternal life in a paradise
Tell me, how can you beat this offer?
Our God cleansed all our sins
By the sacrifice of himself
Tell me true, have you ever thought
About anything so cool?

Flesh, flesh, so tender and warm
It withholds the spirit, but the spiritâs so strong
Flesh, it will get spots and decay
Where your soul will fly, no one can say

No need for instincts, no need for thoughts
Ainât it easier when your path is clear ahead?
And if you are a good dog
You can get an extra bone from time to time

Our God offers you
Eternal life in a paradise
Tell me, how can you beat this offer?
Our God cleansed all our sins
By the sacrifice of himself
Tell me true, have you ever thought
About anything so cool?

Flesh, flesh, so tender and warm
It withholds the spirit, but the spiritâs so strong
Flesh, it will get spots and decay
Where your soul will fly, no one can say

How can you beat this offer?

Flesh, flesh, so tender and warm
It withholds the spirit, but the spiritâs so strong
Flesh, it will get spots and decay
Where your soul will fly, no one can say
