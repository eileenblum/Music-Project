Walk on the moon, and then swim in it's seas
Once you've had a look you will stop wondering at me
Welcome to the world where your old conscience resides
Flown away one might while you were choosing a side

[BRIDGE]
Forget your romantic dreams of star-spangled skies
Swim in the moon seas, you might have a surprise

[CHORUS]
On the seas of the moon, where your true self abides
Come here on the dark side, Where I'll see you

Let me introduce you to some folks living here
Who became somebody through an abuse of cheers
Politics and managers enjoying the fight
While all religious fanatics are chasing that light

[BRIDGE]
Scientists and maniacs trick us with their pouts
And if your daddy hides a sin you'll probably find out

[CHORUS]
