We thought that life would last forever
That we had would never fall...
But I feel lonely now, in these days
I realize that you have gone...

[BRIDGE]
If I could stop time I'd call for you to come
To touch your hands, to hear your words once again

We never know how to walk on
If we are weak or we are strong...
But I am sure that you will guide me
And help me see where I must go...

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
Like every season must end, I keep on going
Watch me become the man you were... Oooh...
For every shining star I see, I keep on saying
That's where my heroe lies, Oooh... Oooh...

We thought that life would last forever...
