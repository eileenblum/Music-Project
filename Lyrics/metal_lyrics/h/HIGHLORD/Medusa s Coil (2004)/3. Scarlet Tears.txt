Fallen in a silver lake
Lost beteween the storming
waves of infinity
An ocean voice of love surrounds me
I can't explain this reality
I follow my soul beyond the ray
Of a burnning star
While the crystal shores kiss my heart

[BRIDGE]
Send me your whispered words
Written through icy waters...
Show me a million words we've never seen

[CHORUS]
Dream with me the eternity
An ivory glance
Where we can taste
The sweetness of
Our scarlet tears...

Watching the world through blue watery eyes
Never ending sensation
Of facing myself without being me
Black, warm earth, be my new bride

[BRIDGE]
Feel my never ending youth
Flow through your sacred moist veins
A new communion has just started

[CHORUS]

I cry in crimson...
