How many tears do we have to cry
For all our broken dreams?
And all those silhouettes crossing our life...
How could we think that we should last

And we're all...
Lost in the infinity...

I thought I held my life in my hands
And I never cared about a better day...
We are ephemeral sights in a flame
Our chance is to live day by day

[BRIDGE]
And we're all...
Lost in the infinity...
And we're all...
A drop in eternity...

[CHORUS]
Time after time we must face our pain
Shall it last forever?
I'll cry and I'll fight in this endless game...
Cause I dance with destiny...

Thinking about your past
You realize that nothing has changed
A restless soul who saw their first day
Will have to strive to their last one

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]
