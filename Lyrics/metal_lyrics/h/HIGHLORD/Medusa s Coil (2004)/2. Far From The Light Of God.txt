Here I stand, in my darkest hour
Where's the light? Does it shines on me?
Here I face the death of my master
Where's my strenght? I cannot stop it!

[BRIDGE]
A dark shadow on the holy cross
It's a combat that was denied, ooohhh...

[CHORUS]

Shall we have to hate the heavens?
Is what we get... what we pray for?
Shall we have to wait for freedom?
We're too far from the light of God?

Oh please... can someone help me?
There's something left to fight for
There will be battles, blood to be shed
Will I be strong? Will I defy my fears?

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]
