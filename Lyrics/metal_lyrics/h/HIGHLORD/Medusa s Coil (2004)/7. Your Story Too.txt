You were young and you read stories
About desperate lives and broken hearts
Deep passions, clueless frustrations
Rebel sons and hell breaking loose
When it was time to face it in the eye
Say, son, what you gotta do?
Find a job, a house, a woman
Or tear your old man's house apart?

[BRIDGE]
You could not understand why
But you could feel the same emotions
The same misery, the same sparks
Used to light your soul

Find yourself alone in a bad place
Get your kicks just to stay alive
Always too young to face yourself
Old enought to kiss your ass goodnye
Find a place (where) you can party everyday
Rock'n'Roll means you're no fool
Just like at every anciet people's feast
Something they never show you at school

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
What a story, it's a story, that's your story too
You're getting older now
You'd better face the truth
What a story, it's a story, that's your story too
All those stories that would move you
Were about someone like you

Life's a whore that you can't pay
To make her do all that you want
When you're down to your last kicks
Pray you're acting in the same show
Mommy and daddy fought for freedom
Look at this world they've left you
Was it worth fighting for their ideals
Or lightning a cigarette to make you look cool?

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]

Take this!

[CHORUS]

[FINAL CHORUS]
What a story, it's a story, that's your story too
You're getting wiser now
You'd better think about your youth
What a story, it's a story, that's your story too
If that story made you cry
Well, it was your story too
