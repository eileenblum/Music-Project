Forever I roam in the night....
Demons still chase me, try to destroy me
Illusions won't let me go
The way is so clear, but I feel so distant
Is this my fate? Am I so weak?
In my hands I though I held my fate
Deep inside I know this ain't the end
Show me your kingdom take me with you...
Give me the strength buried in my heart
Show me your crown hold my hands tight
I want to be the King of my destiny .....show me your kingdom....

Their eyes tell me to leave
This place is not safe, I have to go now 
Enemies come in the night
I'll keep on burning, the flame of existence
Is this my fate? Am I so weak?
In my hands I though I hold my fate
Deep inside I know this ain't the end
Show me your kingdom take me with you...
Give me the strength buried in my heart
Show me your crown hold my hands tight
I want to be the King of my destiny .....show me your kingdom....
