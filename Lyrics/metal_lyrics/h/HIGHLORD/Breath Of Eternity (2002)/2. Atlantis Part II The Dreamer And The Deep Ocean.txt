Astral glance's 
Kissing jade sea 
Gate of wisdoms lost
In unfathomed deep
Haunted waters
Maids of the ancient gods
Crying for their glorious blood
"Raise your hands,
Surround your soul to see
Places you're never seen!"
Children of sun
Kingdom of stars
Ages of power still rise
In your heart 
Lords of the sea
Victims of pride
In my dreams your tower
Still shine on ...Atlantis!

Dreamlike visions
Of free mermaids and dolphins 
Dancing at the charming tunes 
Of the abyss
Ancient guardians
From the dawn 'till the end of time
Where the sunlight can't touch 
Your virgin heart
"Raise your hands,
Surround your soul to see
Places you're never seen!"
Children of sun
Kingdom of stars
Ages of power still rise
In your heart 
Lords of the sea
Victims of pride
In my dreams your tower
Still shine on ...Atlantis

"The Darkness shadowed the sky
and the storming waves became bloodred
Until the weapon shattered the Hearth
And the Empire sank in its grave..."
