Have u seen 
the world doesn't care of your life.. 
Try to realize we're such a small part 
in the Divine-mind...
There are so many places 
and I just want to be there....
Just take my breath of eternity
So many times I have tried 
to see through the dark realms of my....fantasy
How many times have I said 
I won't fall and then stand back on...a senseless road

I am sure we have to preserve 
what we have inside...
We have the power and we just don't know 
how to get control
There are so many places 
and I just want to be there....
Just take my breath of eternity
So many times I have tried 
to see through the dark realms of my....fantasy
How many times have I said 
I won't fall and then stand back on...a senseless road

So far but so close 
I remain here alone...
just take my part on this eternity...
