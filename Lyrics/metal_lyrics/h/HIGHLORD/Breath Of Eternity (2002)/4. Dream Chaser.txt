Another day
Another failed chance
Another question is filling my mind
Without an answer
How many times 
we cried to change the ways
of our hard fate...
But It's all in our hands!
I want a reason to live for
I want a reason to die 
I want a reason to fight everyday!
I'm trying
day by day
To learn from this sorrow
Shades of past 
turning back
But I won't stop being a dream chaser

I think I'll never
Dispel this uncertainty
But I've still so much power inside...
Can't you see it?
So give me a reason to live for
Give me a reason to die 
Give me a reason to fight everyday!
I'm trying
day by day
To learn from this sorrow
Shades of past 
('re) turning back
But I won't stop being a dreams' chaser
