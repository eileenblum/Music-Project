I've crossed the holy flame
Blood of Gods flows in my veins
I feel my soul burning
Visions of death gripping my mind
Charming beauty, queen of passions
Lurking eyes full of pleasure
You chained me, you fooled me
I sacrificed my soul for your love
"With you, we promise, we shall rule!"
I'm not a pure soul
"The Dark inside your heart is true!"
But my fire still lives on
Skies of my land
Hear my pray 
I've lost my soul...
I've lost whom I loved!
I'm facing my fate
Without fear
Burn for the last time
Phoenix's Fire!

Clouds are going by
Winds of Magic blow so strong
And I'm praying, I'm waiting...
I know it shall be my last fight
Enchanted stones of another age.
Keepers of mystic knowledge,
Are burning, are shining
Trying to face the darkest power
"With you, we promise, we shall rule!"
I'm not a pure soul
"The Dark inside your heart is true!"
But my fire still lives on
Skies of my land
Hear my pray 
I've lost my soul...
I've lost whom I loved!
I'm facing my fate
Without fear
Burn for the last time
Phoenix's Fire!

"Look into our eyes, we are the meaning of all your inner fears!
Don'try to fight us, we are eternal, ...you know...we call you Brother!...."

Asur, sons of the Earth look at my death
I am the chosen one, I survived the Flame
I've spent all my life thorugh shadows and dreams
Here in my last fight I'll deafeat all my Fears!
