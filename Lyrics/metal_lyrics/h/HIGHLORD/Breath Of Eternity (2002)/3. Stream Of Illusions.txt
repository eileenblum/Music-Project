Child of the past, I'm a little lost dreamer 
In this eternal night.... in such a hard life 
I want to feel my glory, my pride, my strenght once again
And to close my eyes and forget all this pain 
You know I'm not a liar
I am what you can see
A little flame in this void of lies
I'm running throughout shadows and hopes
Down the Stream of Illusion finally free I will ride
I scream and cry searching for a way to escape
Down the Stream of Illusion without chains I'll dive

I faced myself in the mirror of my fears
Candlelight is reflecting my pale gaze
Yesterday is died, I've no more excuses for crying
Finally I'm on the run...so don't stop my flight!
You know I'm not a liar
I am what you can see
A little flame in this void of lies
I'm running throughout shadows and hopes
Down the Stream of Illusion finally free I will ride
I scream and cry searching a way to escape
Down the Stream of Illusion without chains I'll dive
