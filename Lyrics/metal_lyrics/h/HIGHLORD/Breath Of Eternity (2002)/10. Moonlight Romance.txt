There are times when I would like to fly 
The taste of my tears can't bring me there 
And there are times when I would like to die
'Cause the pain is haunting me.....tonight
Please take my hands... 
please hear my cry
I'd want to be there and kiss away 
the tears from your eyes..
The Moon always watchin'me 
Like a beggar I stay....askin' for the night to live
And the skies seem to cry for me...
'Cause my tears are forever lost in the night
Please take my hands... 
please hear my cry
I'd want to be there and kiss away 
the tears from your eyes.. 
Live in a circle....wait for the wind to change...
life is so cruel my friend... I know...it won't change.... 
Live in a circle...wait for the night to come...
Hear one more time my Moonlight Romance

I wanna stop crying 
I wanna to be free
And feel all my emotions without chains or fears....
I know It will be an hard chance
A lonely road full of pain
May your eyes light my way..... light my way!
