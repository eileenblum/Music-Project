[Japanese Bonus Track]

[Make-Up Cover]

Burn your Cosmo down
Embrace the power of your soul
To the limit of the stars see a miracle become true
Maybe we will fail

We will learn to feel the pain
Still far is the way but a promise has been done

Pegasus Fantasy it's only in your dreams
Use the wings of your soul this time no one can stop your fly

Saint Seiya - All young warriors
Saint Seiya - New heroes will come... Oh yeah!
Saint Seiya - Pegasus will lead you
Saint Seiya - Right now fly away!

Look up to the sky
Find the evershining stars
Follow them to the end it's your power feel the strengh
Until that day I promise I won't fall
I will risk my own life in the battle i've engaged

Pegasus Fantasy it's only in your dreams
Use the wings of your soul this time no one can stop your fly

Saint Seiya - All young warriors
Saint Seiya - New heroes will come... Oh yeah!
Saint Seiya - Pegasus will lead you
Saint Seiya - Right now fly away!

Pegasus Fantasy it's only in your dreams
Use the wings of your soul this time no one can stop your fly

Saint Seiya - All young warriors
Saint Seiya - New heroes will come... Oh yeah!
Saint Seiya - Pegasus will lead you
Saint Seiya - Right now fly away!
