Can you believe steel can bend at your will...
Since you left me, I do..
Can you believe the stars won't shine tonight...
Well, look at the sky and tell me...
And I, bounded so deep I promise I'll rise
To find a place where I'll stop crying
To stand up and meet you face to face
Never forget, this time I'm back
Back from hell
my wounded pride is screaming for you!
Back from hell
this time I swear you'll be the next one!

Can you believe the truth can burn more than fire...
I taste the tears and remember it's true...
Can you believe, time can hide the sign of love... 
Well, don't wait too much or you will be late...
And I, bounded so deep I promise I'll rise
To find a place where I'll stop crying
To stand up and meet you face to face
Never forget, this time I'm back
Back from hell
my wounded pride is screaming for you!
Back from hell
this time I swear you'll be the next one!
