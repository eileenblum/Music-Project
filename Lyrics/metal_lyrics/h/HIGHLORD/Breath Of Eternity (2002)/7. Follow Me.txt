I've seen the Universe 
Shining from so far
I met a thousand kings 
Dying for their lust for gold
Heroes from ancient tales
Vanish in their glory...
But I'm sure we'll be there
To face the battle side by side
And I am still searching for my soul.... 
Cryin' from the depth of my bleeding heart 
Like rain people fall
All around the Galaxy
Come with me, the time has come!
Spread your wings and save your life
And I am still searching for my soul.... 
Cryin' from the deep of my bleeding heart 
Follow me and you will live forever free 
(out of this world)
Take my hands and you will fly where dreams begin 
(please, now follow me..)

No one will stop us now
We're running on Eternally
Call us, don't be afraid
Stay with us when the legend comes
And I am still searching for my soul.... 
Cryin' from the deep of my bleeding heart 
Follow me and you will live forever free 
(out of this world)
Take my hands and you will fly where dreams begin 
(please, now follow me..)
