Long ago and far away let me take you to another day
Back to when the wind was free and honour stood with purity yeah
If we could look back and remind ourselves then think what could be
I know of such a place just take my hand and follow me
Far from the reaches of modern desires
There's a place where the old waters flow oh I know a place where
Over the mountains and through destiny
I will take you there take you I'll take you there to the river gold
Shades of our past history we're spiraling down now can't you see
Poets scholars preachers all have told us we must heed the call
Now we must look back and refind ourselves and pay the real cost
If we can't make this change then we will surely be lost
Far from the reaches of modern desires
There's a place where the old waters flow oh I know a place where
Over the mountains and through destiny
I will take you there take you I'll take you there to the river gold
Come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on
Far from the reaches of modern desires
There's a place where the old waters flow yeah there is a place where
Over the mountains and through destiny
I will take you there take you I'll take you there ooh ah ah ah
Far from the reaches of modern desires
There's a place where the old waters flow
I'm gonna take you this this place now
Over the mountains and through destiny
I will take you there take you down the river gold
River gold ah oh oh oh oh yeah
