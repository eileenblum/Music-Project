Life can deal you a lousy hand
And again it seems this one's been dealt to you
You tell yourself tomorrow's another day
But what will change what could make it go your way
Nowhere left to turn no one hears you scream you turn and run
Get it and fight don't give in stand up to the social machine
You've got a mind of your own so believe in yourself
If you give it a chance you will show that you can shine shine
So many times I tried and failed to fit in
No kind words to lighten my soul
I have my hopes I have my dreams I try to reach
My peace seems so far away
Soon my rage and anger will find a new playmate your turn a gun
Give it a fight don't give in stand up to the social machine
You've got a mind all your own so believe in yourself
Give your future a chance hold on and you can shine shine
You know you can't give in
Give it a fight don't give in stand up to the social machine
You've got a mind all your own so believe in yourself
Give your future a chance hold on and you can shine shine
Your words are your weapons fulled by your mind
Go to school on your fears and leave them all behind shine
Yeah violence and guns small man's clout
Only dig you deeper you'll never get out yeah shine
