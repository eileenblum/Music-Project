Lookin' out into the distant night
Frozen earth under a velvet sky
Pull my jacket tight to keep me warm
Now I close my eyes and think of you
I long to watch you when you're sleepin'
The breath of love steals from your lips
I will love you girl forever
But there ain't no way to tell you now
I will cry for you live and die for you
You'll always be inside of me yeah ah
I will laugh for you I will play for you
I'll always hold you in my dreams
The stone is laid and now the sky grows dark
Time to take that long walk to my home
Past the thoughts and plans and could have beens
Now I'll close the door and be alone
Your empty cup is on the table
Your lipstick stays though you are gone
I will want you girl forever
But I can't reach through and tell you now
I will cry for you live and die for you
You'll always be inside of me oh oh oh ah
I will laugh for you I will play for you
I'll always hold you in my dreams
I will cry for you live and die for you
You'll always be inside of me oh oh oh ah
I will laugh for you I will play for you
I'll always hold you in my dreams
In my dreams in my dreams
