You have stained the faithful and tied them 'round your neck
Dragged around from year to year and changed their intellect
You can call yourself a leader 'cause it's tattooed on your face
But only you know the agony of bein' far below your place
It's time to stand behind the mic
Take a breath and tell them it's your life it's your life
Set them free or they'll never go let them be and they'll never know
It's your life so follow me I'll take you where you want to go
There is nothin' left here so just follow me
And learn how it's your life oh it's your life hoo
Pain and pride and purity have served your purpose well
Like ripping claws you're full of flaws now the wound begins to swell
You can say that fame's a cancer but the truth comes pourin' out
Pick your head up wipe the sweat off let them hear you shout it out
It's your life so follow me I'll take you where you want to go
There is nothin' left here so just follow me and learn how it's your life
It's your life it's your life so follow me I'll take you where you want to go
There is nothin' left here so just follow me and learn how it's your life
It's your life it's your life so follow me I'll take you where you want to go
There is nothin' left here so just follow me
And learn how it's your life it's your life
