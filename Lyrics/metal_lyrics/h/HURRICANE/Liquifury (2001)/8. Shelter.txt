Reachin' into the sky prayin' for the Gods to make it rain
Feelin' it's do or die will I ever make it back again
Nothin' can defeat me I have come too far to let it go
Only you complete me now I know I'll make it through the storm
Pieces fly through my life even as my summer turns to fall
You came into my world and took away the madness of it all
Even in the darkness I have seen a little light shine through
Even when it's hopeless feel like givin' in
I have got a new place to begin
You've been my shelter in the rain
You are the fire burnin' with no pain
You are the reason I'm okay and I'm givin' it all to you
Givin' me everything is getting so much harder every day
Leavin' my sanity seemed like it might be the only way
I cannot be broken I can take whatever comes my way
Even when it's hopeless I will not give in
'cause everything is new to me again
You've been my shelter in the rain
You are the fire burnin' with no pain
You are the reason I'm okay and I'm givin' it all to you
You've been my shelter in the rain
You are the fire burnin' with no pain
You are the reason I'm okay and I'm givin' it all to you
You've been my shelter in the rain
You are the fire burnin' with no pain
You are the reason I'm okay and I'm givin' it all to you
