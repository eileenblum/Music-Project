Movin' slowly across time now
I begin to hear what you are thinkin' I hear you thinkin'
Grab a foothold watch it grow now
Never touch the world that you are sinkin' we're all sinkin'
And we're blinded and chargin' and nobody's tryin' to fight it back
Fightin' brother to brother and man it's a mother keepin' tight
Come on deliver the message it's comin' on fast
Burn down the promised land don't look back
Just raise your hands shine like the sun pour like the rain
Rage when you blot the sky you decide when we will die
Don't look 'round just kneel down oh bow down to the new God
Dark is partner lies are friends
And anger is the child that you are feedin' we're all bleedin'
Greed is master watch him teachin'
Hatred is what keeps you from believin' love is leavin'
So let's bury the mother and cover the truth inside us all
And forget what you get when you try to heed the devil's call
Come on deliver the message it's comin' on fast
Burn down the promised land don't look back
Just raise your hands shine like the sun pour like the rain
Rage when you blot the sky you decide when we will die
Don't look 'round just kneel down oh bow down to the new God
Oh burn down the promised land don't look back
Just raise your hands shine like the sun pour like the rain
Rage when you blot the sky you decide when we will die
Don't look 'round just kneel down oh bow down to the new God
New God new God new God new God new God
