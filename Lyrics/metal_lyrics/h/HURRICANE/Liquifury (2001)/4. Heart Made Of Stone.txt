Foolish little boy with your hand on your gun
What makes you think if you're faster that you must have won
Fury is a fire an unquenchable flame
When it's burned its way through you
You won't even know your name
So put your toys away and stop pretendin' yeah
'cause the answer's in your head and not in your hand
You're comin' with a passion in this world all your own
And you won't be worth nothin' with a heart made of stone
I only wanna save you before your feelings have flown
Ain't nobody winnin' with a heart made of stone
Musguided and afraid of losin' all your gold
The only thing that you are losin' is youth growin' old
Burnin' your bridges an avoidable loss
When you add up the sorrow you can't afford the cost
The lonely path you choose is never ending yeah
When all you had to do was open your soul
You're comin' with a passion in this world all your own
And you won't be worth nothin' with a heart made of stone
I only wanna save you before your feelings have flown
Ain't nobody winnin' with a heart made of stone
There's more than the truth at stake it's deeper than you know
You'll never be whole again till you let your inner self go
You're comin' with a passion in this world all your own
And you won't be worth nothin' with a heart made of stone
I only wanna save you before your feelings have flown
Ain't nobody winnin' with a heart made of stone
Heart made of stone ain't nobody winnin'
With a heart made of stone yeah ain't nobody winnin'
