No one made me do it no one had to beg
Got myself right in it shot up shot out and shook a leg
Didn't sign no contract didn't leave no mark
Oh 'cause when I saw you baby my heart reeled from the start
'cause when I put my arms around ya like heaven kissed my chest
No ifs ands or buts baby now I knew I found the best
Reason now has left me and my breath has taken leave
So now I'm happy to be your fool
You know I'd follow your every rule
And I'd give up all that's true for you
It's just like the devil to wear a satin dress
But I must like the deal even though my life's a mess
I could spend my lifetime tryin' to break the spell
If I ever got away I'd never live to tell
'cause every time she touches me I know I'm gonna fall
I'd give up all myself and some I swear that I'd sell it all
She knows how to use me and I'm glad to take the call
So now I'm happy to be your fool
You know I'd follow your every rule
And I'd give up all that's true for you
Sometimes I feel inside I know I'm doin' wrong
It's like livin' in the shadow of a storm
It's not the way I had planned it but that's how it's gotta be
Oh it was never up to me ah ah
Whoa ah I'm happy to be your fool
You know I'd follow your every rule yes I will
And I'd give up all that's true yeah for you ah yeah
I'm happy to be your fool and I'd follow every rule
And I'll do it again now ah baby yeah
And I'd give up all that's true for you
