Bleed for me believe in you
Close your eyes and take a look at me
You're too blind for what you wanna see
Dark and red's the place you need to go
Take the knife and plunge it in real slow
I'll return again someday tear the skin and bone away
I'll return and take what's mine
It's not hard to let it all run free
Wet and warm while you lie next to me
Easy sleep the seconds linger on
Now you know your body's really gone
I'll return again someday tear the skin and bone away
I'll return and take what's mine
If you bleed for me I'll believe in you
Reach in your black soul and take my time
If you bleed for me I'll believe in you
It's your final day make me believe believe in you
If you bleed for me I'll believe in you
Reach in your black soul and take my time
If you bleed for me I'll believe in you
It's your final day make me believe believe in you
