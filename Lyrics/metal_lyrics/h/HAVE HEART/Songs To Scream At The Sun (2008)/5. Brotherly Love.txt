Left with images of you pouring from my eyes:
You young, you here, day dawning, eyes wide.

Just images, just images
all that's left
all that I can find.

Like water
from a cactus
in the desert of my mind.

Little to big: o' brother, you leave me like blood from my veins.
Big to little: o' brother, you leave me like blood from my veins.

In a room that holds you
like a guilt-ridden paralyzing cell:

no calls
no mail
no visitors for when you're in hell.

forced hellos
rushed goodbyes
and best wishes for you in the meantime

My face seen as often as God's
can let guilt have its way of owning you
like a dog.

May to March
March to May
The days fall with the promises I make.

Like water
from a faucet
into the sink of your faith.

Little to big: o' brother, you leave me like blood from my veins.
Big to little: o' brother, you leave me like blood from my veins.

We always seem to fall with only words to hold
we always seem to fall with only photos to hold
we always seem to fall with only memories to hold
we always seem to fall without family to hold.
