[Originally by Outspoken]

I hear stories that don't appeal to me
For some reason I don't see what they see
A wasted mind is a waste of time
Where is the happiness they seem to find
Reinforced
When I see their lives
I'm reinforced
Don't believe the hype
Such a little value they place on themselves
But I respect, I respect myself
With my eyes I see through their lies
They're just afraid of getting left behind
Reinforced
When I see their lives
I'm reinforced
Don't believe the hype
Never and I said never, let your guard down
Reinforced
