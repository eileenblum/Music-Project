i see the free which you enslave, 
the walking you keep chained
i see the growth which keep caged 
and i've seen the minds that go un-raged

i see the body robbed of soul 
to be the fuel for your control
i see the standing knocked to their knees, 
and i've seen the human beings you treat 

like machines 

MACHINIST
i am not, i am not, i am not a machine
i am, i am, i am a human being

what the fuck

a stagnant life's a victory 
for the lover of life that never breeds
perpetuate and obliterate 
those addicted to living on their knees
the dealers deplete you, 
yeah dealers beat you like you're drum without a tone

YOU'RE JUST SKIN AND BONES
until you say 
NO MORE, NO MORE
unlike the silent machines who won't settle
THE SCORE, THE SCORE
unlike the lifeless objects they want you to be 

you want your object, well you fucking got it... 

i could be the knife in your backs,
the noose wrapped around your necks
the bullet racing through your skulls
but i'd rather use the force of my spoken word

Let our voices form the weapons 
Our Voices

no silence,  
no compliance, 
in defiance of the rape of growth
