fucked it up again. but i'm not looking the other way.
i see my errors and i know i'm wrong, but it's gonna 
take way more than that
to change my ways and start thinking straight, 
be the person i aspire to be.
own up to myself. turn my life around. 
make amends to my friends, i owe to myself and them.
pledge of allegiance to myself. so i must fucking say: i will change
no more selfish ways, no more for # 1; its done.
arrogance is of the past: so i must fucking say: i will change 
so you gonna try, or is it gonna be the same fucking song?
i must find, i'll strive for
i must find, i'll strive for

HUMILITY. 

so don't lose, don't lose...your way.
don't lose your way. 
i said its time we really take a look at ourselves
and start caring about someone else.
