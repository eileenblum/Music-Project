let me tell you a story about the man who loved to play with fire
he's the backfired rocketship, he's the seed that never splits 
some trees just cant bloom....they'll never 
born in a life of opportunity with every chance to excel
instead took his fucking chances with the cheapest goddamn thrills
he'd do anything, he'd take anything for a moments satisfaction
sweet seconds of pleasure could never measure to his agonizing life
of addiction 

in the dark night, he tries to remember a future so bright
"it wont happen to me, 
it wont happen to me, 
it wont happen to me"
thats what they always fucking say. 

the man who thinks hes-above misery and hurt and harm and pain
is the main who lives his life tightly bound as a slave in chains
in chains
in chains
in chains of a neverending abyss
in chains of an artificial bliss 
and he lives just like a slave
for giving his life away for nothing.
