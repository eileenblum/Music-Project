just take a fucking good look at just what you did;
you set a raging fire in the heart of a kid. 
your words and the message you sent are held 
in my heart as they burn inside my head.
burns, it's burning inside my head, even if 
you chose a different path to tread. 
i guess it was something inside, it was something more to us. 
so you chose a different path from the one you once set.
that's just the cycle of life so take your steps ahead.
that doesn't change one thing in my life
i'll never cease to keep your words alive. 
because i still believe in what was said
i'll hold on to the last thread
i still believe in what was said
your absence doesn't bring my values death 
i guess it was something inside, it was something more to us.
a "hero's fall" can never change what i think
because at the core of my heart this is something more than ink.
Something more than ink....
On a page, on a shirt, on the back of my hand.
Something written in stone, words we wrote in stone.
