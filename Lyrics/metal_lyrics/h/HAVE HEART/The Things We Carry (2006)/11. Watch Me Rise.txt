"goddamn", he said, "i promised myself 
i'd never feel this fucking way 
again, this world has got me praying on my knees 
for one peaceful thought

in my mind, 
my stride, 
my life, 
my time 
is consumed with a thousand thoughts

flying free like a flock of birds 
with no direction or intention of finding home 

it's so hard to think, 
it's so hard to change
when this world doesn't see you any other way 

in this world, they choose to see me, 
they choose to see me
like a setting sun

so it's up to me, 
i have to see me, 
i have to see me
like the rising one 

in my days somebody told me that the rain would always come,
always come to wash away the pain
but nothing changes and this world still wants me down,
wants me down on my knees praying in that rain

"born this way, die this way" 

i'd rather die on my feet 
than live on my knees 
i'd rather die on my feet
so you can watch me, 
you can watch me

WATCH ME RISE 
with the things we carry

the loss, 
the scars, 
the weight of heavy hearts

so i say to the slaves of depression  
CARRY ON
and sing the sweet redeeming song
about living this life free and long

watch me, watch me, 
WATCH ME RISE
for Miles and miles
