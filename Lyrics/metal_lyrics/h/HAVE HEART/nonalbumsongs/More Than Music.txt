[from 2003 Demo]

[Originally by Verbal Assault]

more than music, its more than a new dance 
more than fashion, its more than a posed stance 
more than music, something we live with 
beyond the cheap slogans, an act of love, an attempt to give 
we have seen a lot of kids drift away now they are gone 
but new blood and old ideals will keep our vision strong 
more than music, its our life!
