[from 2003 Demo]

the times have changes and so have they 
these changing times won't change me 
casted aside, lost all my friends 
more important to me, than it ever was to them. 
their beliefs were ran down, but mine stood so tall 
so many close friends i've said goodbye to them all 
lost all support, but the fires still in my heart 
to stand alone is to stand fucking hard 
backs are turned, faces look away 
but convictions grow stronger every day 

if it means i'll stand on my own 
thats the price i'll pay, and i'll pay it alone 
if only i'll stand, then alone i will strive 
remain, sustain 

mountains of trials, solitary days 
but no matter what, the spirit remains 
alone in this crowd, but i'll persist 
temptations and pressure i'l never give in 
my promise is made, my promise is kept 
a passing fad reminds me of all that you've said 
no shoulder to lean on, as lonely as a cloud 
but i've held true, and never been so proud 

...(the) price i'll pay 
for the value, for the truth 
for the meaning of it all...the worth
