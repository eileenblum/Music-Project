Day by day living in delusion
In a world of created of confusion.
So many people immersed in desperation,
Helpless dreamers searching for salvation.

Endless thirst for supremacy,
Stop at nothing â superior primacy.
Insane leaders planning our future,
Certain death this is our future.

Mass murders, terrorist attacks,
Politicians covering their tracks.
Immense circle of depravity,
The driving force of our society.

Made of anger and pure hate.
Like animals to devastate.
All the madness you can see -
Violent society - living insanity.
Violent society - one for you and me!

Day by day dying in delusion,
Suicide seems like a solution.
Selfish acts of inhumanity,
Maybe this is the way that we want it to be.

Made of anger and pure hate.
Like animals to devastate.
All the madness you can see -
Violent society - living insanity.
Violent society - one for you and me!
