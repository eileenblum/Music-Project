Life is empty without sense,
Trapped in madness â a self-defense.
Always living in suspense,
Fill the soul and mind with raging malevolence.

Drowned in weakness and emptiness,
Turning into a state of regress.
All around is colourless,
Slowly fading away into nothingness.

Time to hear the screams
Of thousand scattered dreams.
To find out what it means,
A life of broken dreams.
And itâs not what it seems,
No remission for the sins.
Slowly the body leans,
No life left for dreams.

Scattered dreams â pain is not what it seems.
Scattered dreams â nothing is what it seems.

All is over, hope is gone.
Just a ruin the life has become.
Tortured mind, left alone,
All that will remain is a tombstone.
