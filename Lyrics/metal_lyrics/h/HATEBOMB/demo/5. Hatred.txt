Thereâs no joy and happiness
For me in this world.
Thereâs no happy, sunny day.
I have malice in my brain.

I cannot live no more
With this sickness in my mind.
âCause I cannot laugh at all -
I hate everything aliveâ¦
â¦I hateâ¦

The sun is shining bright - and now it cumbers me.
Deep inside my head - there is insanity
Everything thatâs nice and cute â It drives me mad.
âKill âem allâ â a silent whisper in my head.

Now â I will die.
Thereâs no way â I can hide.
So much pain â in my life.
After all â it will hurt so bad.

There is no solace or forgiveness,
There is no mercy for my soul in hell.
Hellish torment, sufferingâs eternal,
Inhuman pain, Iâm not very well.
There are many who are like me
Together in madness surely we will dwell.
I used to kill, to torture and to rape,
Thatâs why in total darkness I fell.
