Shoving your way through the crowd
And you look so pity proud.
Tough you are, but come to me alone
I will break your every single bone.

You oppress everyone that you see.
You like the world, but grey now it should be.
All you want is to share this evil fate.
But I will send you back where you were created.

I am your worst nightmare and pain,
And I will remainâ¦
I am your worst fear 'til the end,
In darkness I stand.

How to kill and torture is what I know.
Rivers of blood will start to flow.
Dismembered bodies and spatters on the wall.
If you crawl - no mercy I will show.

Now Iâll slice your flesh and rip your guts.
On your face there will be countless cuts.
In the end I will have to wash your bones
And read the spells from some ancient tomes.

I am your worst nightmare and pain,
And I will remainâ¦
I am your worst fear 'til the end,
In darkness I stand.

I donât know how many are the dead ones
All that I have left to rot behind.
Their relatives are still waiting for them?
Actually theyâre waiting just for me.

Now Iâm sitting alone in the dark,
On your body Iâve left my mark.
Silent killings, no one to be found,
A formless body lying on the ground.

I am your worst nightmare and pain,
And I will remainâ¦
I am your worst fear 'til the end,
In darkness I stand.
