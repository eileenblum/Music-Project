Rude, violent and obscure,
Punishment is here for sure.
Try to stand â you will fail,
In this case there is no bail.
Iâm the one that gives you hope,
And the one who tights your rope.
To hear you pray is all I want,
Give you mercy? â No, I wonât.

Feeling tight around your neck
Soon thereâll be no turning back.
With broken legs you try to run,
I just started having fun.
How Iâd love to see you dead
Lying in a pool of red.
Counting every single minute
Youâre doomed â just admit it.

Know for sure that I am stern,
A lesson in violence you shall learn.
Feel the cut of the knife
It will slowly take your life.
Blood will begin to flow
You will pray for a blow.
It is a part of your role,
A simple one - dying slow.

Uncontrolled aggression
In its purest form.
Turns into obsession,
The immortal is born.
Tons of hatred in your face,
Visions from another place.
Your existence is ceased
It is the time of your decease.

Rude, violent and obscure,
Punishment is here for sure.
Try to stand â you will fail,
In this case there is no bail.
Iâm the one that gives you hope,
And the one who tights your rope.
To hear you pray is all I want,
Give you mercy? â No, I wonât.
