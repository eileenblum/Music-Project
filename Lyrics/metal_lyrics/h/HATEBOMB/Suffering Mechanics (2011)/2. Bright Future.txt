Total darkness came in disguise.
A sign from hell for manâs demise.

Death all-around, no mercy found.
Starvation and diseaseâ¦ rest in peace.

In the last moments of a pity life
The world is so cruel and vile.
The only cure for every pain
A fast death with lots of regret.

Global fear â none of us is sane.
Disorder and destruction â no oneâs to blame.
Forward with courage â into a deadly game.
Will out there anyone remember your name?
Tumors and mutations â little kids.
Deadly infections â inner peace.
Vague anomalies â what is this?
Empty minds â endless disease
