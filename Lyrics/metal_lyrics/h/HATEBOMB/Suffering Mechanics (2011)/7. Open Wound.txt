Open wound, blood spills.
Your assâs stretched â in my hands.
I like it, but you donât.
And nothing quivers on your pretty face.

[Ref:]
Long dead you are â cold as ice.
Iâve reached too far â doing my vice.
My methods are bizarre â I am so nice.
What is done so far â you have died in cries.

Open wound, no blood spills
Your ass is gone â your face too.
You like it, but I donât
And nothing quivers on my grimy face

[Ref:]
Long dead you are â cold as ice.
Iâve reached too far â doing my vice.
My methods are bizarre â I am so nice.
What is done so far â you have died in cries.
