So many tries, so many times
Nothing seems to be like itâs used to be
Turned to ruin in a single touch
What youâre doing? Not that much.

Pain is all that you can
Gain, despite how hard you
Try, in the end we all
Die, there is no place to
Hide, or at least to have a
Break, before you start to
Cry, because you know you
Failed and now it has to end.
Right nowâ¦ It has to end right now.

Accept the failure and move on.
Even when you know that hope is gone.
Give a birth to something new.
So it can fail just like you.

Defeat it now or lose the game.
There is no âtry againâ and there wonât be.
It is you who is to blame,
The enemy is inside yourself.

So many tries, so many times
Nothing seems to be like itâs used to be
Turned to ruin in a single touch
What you are doing? Not that much.
Destined, destined to fail, you are
Destined, destined to fail.

Destined, destined to fail, you areâ¦ destined.
