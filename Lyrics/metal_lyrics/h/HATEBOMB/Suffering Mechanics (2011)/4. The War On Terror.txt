Intended to create fear, systematic use of terror.
Blind control for the masses leads to a certain progress.
Self sacrifice in the name of a cold manipulation.
Paralyzed society living in deception.

Itâs hard not to obey or higher price youâll pay.
Drained to the line - everything is fine.
No where to go, no place to hide.
Mass hysteria controlling the minds of the weak.

Since the dawn of time fear is the key.
To keep the system running assuring liberty.
If you are not with us - then surely, youâre against us.
Once you are condemned you have to hide foreverâ¦
Foreverâ¦ foreverâ¦ and ever.

There is no phantom menace, itâs only in the mind.
Who gets the profit? Who pays the price?
The answer is hard to find but future is defined.
Face the war on terror straight into your face.

Aaagggrrrhhh - face the war on terror.
Die - in the name of terror
Proclaim - a war and earn the profit.
Kill - to protect yourself.
Hide - to stay alive.
Find - many followers.
Organize - mass propaganda.
Time - to sell what youâve got.
