Silent move without a trace,
No escape from this place.
Screaming loud inside my mind,
Peace of mind I canât find, I canât find.

The point
Of no return,
End of journey,
Time to burn.
Life in purgatory
Begins,
Time to realize
What it means
What it really means.

Images vanishing in nothingness.
Body and mind soaked in emptiness.
Formless, shapeless, colorless.
The flesh has become bodiless, bodiless

Time to pay
For all your deeds,
Time to plant
The demon seeds.
Useless effort
To escape
For each mistake
You have to pay.

Swoon with pain and anguish.
Hellish suffering.
Think of your last wish.
As itâs the missing link.
Time to meet the master
To him you will obey.
You want it to be faster,
Now you are his prey.

Maybe you donât get it
Itâs hell where you are.
The nightmareâs being repeated,
Hereâs only one law
Thereâs a place for you
And for your friends.
Know that this is true.
It doesnât follow tends.

I looked in the mirror and thereâs no face.
My body is twisted in a painful blaze.
The only color that my eyes can see
Is pitch-black, just like my destiny, my destiny.

Useless effort to escape
Useless effort â time to pay.
