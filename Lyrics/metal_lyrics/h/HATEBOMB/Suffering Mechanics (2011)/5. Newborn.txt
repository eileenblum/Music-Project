Facing the enemy within myself,
Consuming impulse left on the shelf.
Inner struggle, drowned in fear,
A new beginning, murder is near.

Time to kill again after many years of waiting.
Angry, merciless, many lives are fading.
Murder on a daily basis, random choice of victims,
Up till now Iâve done this only in my dreams.

A new life is bornâ¦
The old one is held in scornâ¦
...rebornâ¦ I am.

I have to clean my rusty knives,
To scrape the blood, to burn my eyes.
The blades are cold and I am old,
As Iâve been told my soul is sold.

Now I live my life again with no regret nor mercy.
Doing what I like to do â slaking âcause Iâm thirsty
Hatred is my driving force, anger is my master.
My aimâs to turn peopleâs life into a disaster.

[Ref:]
A new life is born
From the ashes of the dead I will rise.
Praise your lord before
I take you body with the others I despise.
Itâs time to raise
All the memories I buried deep inside.
Too late to stop
Being what I am, and doing what I like
Now itâs your turnâ¦ â¦to burn
Few weeks since I started
My basement is overcrowded
Many have witness their demise
Here is the place where hope dies

A wide selection of tools,
To use them all are the rules.
I hang the bodies on a hook
As it is written in a book.
The one thing I like the most
Is burning children on a toast
Eating the guts and their brains,
The nightmare is running in my veins.

With so many victims left behind
Iâm feeling empty in my mind
I need something new for a joy
Maybe a zombie made of a little boy

So I can enjoy having a toy.
