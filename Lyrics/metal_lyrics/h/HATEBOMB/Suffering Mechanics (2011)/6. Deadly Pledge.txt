You want a fast relief?
Or escape from all the grief?
It has been there for ages.
But now itâs putting men in cages.

Some will fix your mood,
Some will make you lewd.
But since thereâs a man involved
Itâs all made to be sold.

Every day living in theft.
With few friends  you have left.
Wonder why youâre left behind?
Wake up! Stop being blind!

What is natural is not enough,
Seems like you need something tough.
Doesnât matter powder or a pill
What you need is a brain drill.

If youâre high is not enough.
What? Youâre tired of that laugh?
Just raise your hand and test your luck.
From a single time you wonât be fucked.

Inject the poison in your body,
A product of a basement lab.
Donât tell me that youâre sorry.
Just stay away with that crap.
