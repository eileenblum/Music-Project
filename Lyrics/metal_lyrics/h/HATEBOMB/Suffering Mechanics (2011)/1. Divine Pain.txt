Haze of blame filling the mind,
Senseless game is there to find.
Body is here - mind is gone,
All the feelings turned to stone.
Once again the wheel is turning,
Vile flames will keep on burning
Painting picture â broken dream,
Keeping distance â silent scream.

Smart decision is hard to take.
Simple choice is a daft mistake.
Coarse rope tied to the neck
Thereâs no chance of turning back.
Screaming loud inside my mind
There is a picture but I am blind
Shadows hidden in the dark
Signs of fear leave a mark.

When one single drop of tear
Drowns you down into the mere.
Just like shooting with a gun
Feelings turn to senseless fun.
Striving, seeking cryptic path,
Madness slowly turns to laugh.
Ghost of war, can smell the danger,
Chain the mind with hidden anger.

[Ref:]
State of mind â so divine.
Self decline â left behind.
Mental demise â reality of lies.
Time to realize â pain will hypnotize, paralyze.

Visions emerge from deep within
Can distinct if mind is clean.
Unfolding horrors never seen
Itâs a place youâve never been.
Emotions twisted into form,
Nerves are strained out of norm.
Relentless beating, heart arrest
For the mind â the strongest test.

[Ref:]
State of mind â so divine.
Self decline â left behind.
Mental demise â reality of lies.
Time to realize â pain will hypnotize.
