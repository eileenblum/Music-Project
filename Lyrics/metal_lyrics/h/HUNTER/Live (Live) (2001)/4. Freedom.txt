I close my eyes
Look deep inside
All what I see
It's neverending lies
YOU!
You made me feel so grown
And late throw down my crown
So now my youth is gone...

I feel closes of fear
Deep in my brain
All what I feel it's neverending pain
MY!
My pride was silent cry
My life was sacrifice
I DON'T FORGIVE MY CRY!

Now I ask you
Set me free
Pray the heaven
I must stay like a steel
My belief
You should now give back to me
To my eyes can look and SEE...

HATE!
This life that we create
This pain behind the gate
I need to feel my hate
PRIDE!
I introduce my bride
All always by my side
I hate my deadly pride

Now I ask you...
