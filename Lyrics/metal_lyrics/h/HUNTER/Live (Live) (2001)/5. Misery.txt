I feel your pain, sicken war over me
Who help you die? MISERY!
I see your death, lonely road to the sea FORGOTTEN SEA...

You - You can't cross this way
You can feel your pain
Can you hear my crying?
You - You can't breake it down
You can't stop it now
MISERY - YOU'RE INSIDE OF ME!

How could you think
You can win war so mad?
The last one will live!
Award will make him sad
Here comes the rain
Sweet hopes of one
Nightmares for others
THAT'S MISERY!

You - You can't cross this way
You can feel your pain
Can you hear my crying?
You - You can't breake it down
You can't stop it now Can you hear me?

MISERY
I can feel so more real
I can not find myself
I will die... Morbid lie!
MISERY- YOU'RE INSIDE OF...
OF ME!

I feel your pain...
