World, blood, overflow, full of madhate
Now when we are young, we want to survive
Day we've lost liberty - Independence
And created hell for us. TO THE LAST!

Brains fused together in silent crime
Now we are soldiers of THE LIES!

Who told us - You must fight?
Who's defender?
Fate throws lies in your face
Dread in eyes!
Who signed this pact of blood?
Was it human?
Victims of our pure flesh
THINKIN' DEATH!!!

Brains fused together in silent crime
Now we are soldiers of THE LIES!

World, blood, overflow...
