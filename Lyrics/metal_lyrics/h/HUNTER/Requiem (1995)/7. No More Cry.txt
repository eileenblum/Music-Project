All is gone
Expect to kill
You' ll pray to be so real
Lost in war
Lost in pain
You've got wet in scarlet rain
You gotta fight for state's might
SO YOU'LL DIE!
BE HAPPY, NO MORE CRY!

You've lost your life
And not to say
Just no wonder you must pay
Heroe's death-
-THAT'S THE ONLY WAY!
To be immortal simplest key
Stop your tears and be like steel
BECAUSE YOU'LL DIE!
BE HAPPY, NO MORE CRY!

All is gone...
