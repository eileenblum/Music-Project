Hollow scream
You should turn away
Hollow cry
You can't be made of clay
Empty words, empty cries
Do you get it? DON'T FORGET!
NEVER!

Whispers lost
Silence screams so loud
Are you blind?
Our life will be the price!
Empty words, empty cries
Do you get it?
Don't forget! Never, NEVER!
LIES!

Whispers lost - SILENCE!
Cryin' kid - VIOLENCE!
Screamin' soul - SADNESS!
Are you blind? MADNESS!

PROMISE DAY
Don't believe in lies
Are you blind?
Our life will be the price!
Our life, our child
Do you get it?
Don't forget! Never, NEVER!
LIES!

Whispers lost - SILENCE!...
