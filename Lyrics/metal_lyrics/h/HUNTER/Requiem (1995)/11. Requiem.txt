Wake up again hollow sceam of night
To play my fiction shape of darkness
Your madness dream was not illusion
Bathed in blood was night and day
In name your dreamed about your nation
You stole from life so many people
EXTERMINATION - IN NAME OF FREEDOM!
Now you're burning in your hell...

DREAD - so it's a maddening hurt
Death bred invading your suggestions
TO BE - IT'S ONE! Such a fool and ruthless word
All in the crimson day by day
Night soaking you, in scarlet creep again
Into the shape of human shadows - FLASH!
And nestle ground, you listen to someone's laugh
That which for death was given light

Like a torch in fire you're burning alive
Like a flame very lifeless in this dirty game
Madness and fear eating your brain
Now you're fine: DRESS IN LINE!
Like a torch in fire you're burning alive
Like a flame very lifeless in this dirty game
Not any fate, close every gates
CAN'T YOU JUST CRY? YOU WILL DIE!

Wake up again hollow scream of night
To play my fiction shape of darkness
No mercy slaughter was not illusion
All in the crimson day by day
YOU'LL BE BURNING INTO THE FREESING FLAMES
BRANDED BY VISION OF YOUR BLOOD-HANDS
LOOK! IT'S A REQUIEM!
ALSO IN YOUR PRIDE
YOU COULD SUBSCRIBE IT BY YOUR HAND!

Like a torch in fire you're burning alive
Like a flame very lifeless in this dirty game
Madness and fear eating your brain
Now you're fine: DRESS IN LINE!

Like a torch in fire you're burning alive
Like a flame very lifeless in this dirty game
Not any fate, close every gates
CAN'T YOU JUST CRY? YOU WILL...

DIE...
