Going on across the lands
Nobody wants to hear your voice
Bring your news, wisdom of life
In whipping dance of sicken choice

Fearless wretch, insanity
He's running blind to set us free

Falling to his dirty feet
You change your mind
You change your dreams
You have to twist across your lies
In whipping dance of falling size

Fearless wretch, insanity
He's running blind to set us free

Run - RUN to die for right
Only empty laughs at your sensless fight
Fear's creeping to your mind
You're looking for, but you'll never find!

Marching on across your lies
You're searching for your promise lands
Endless chain of living flames
Are waiting for you to burn your hands

Fearless wretch, insanity
He's running blind to set us free

Run - RUN to die for right
Only empty laughs at your sensless fight
Fear's creeping to your mind
You're looking for, but you'll never find!
