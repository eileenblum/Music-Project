Welcome to the Dead Land!
Laughter will captivate Your fears!
And Great Paper...
Shall realize your hopes and dreams!!!

He is our god, who knows well
How to comfort...
So that no-one would doubt!!!
To have no-one in doubt!!!

Fantasmagoria... fantasmagoria...

It is bad when someone...
Arranges the puzzles and discovers that divinity...
Is just a Mere Paper!!!

Then darkness will cover the ungrateful crowd
All will parish!!!
So that no-one would doubt!!!
So that no-one would doubt!!!

Fantasmagoria, fantasmagoria...
Fantasmagoria, fantasmagoria...

Madness is drilling inside our heads 'cos he...
... is a completion of yet unfinished dreams...
Father - comfort us!

You are our god who knows well
How to comfort...
And no-one will doubt!!!
And no-one will doubt!!!

Fantasmagoria, fantasmagoria...
Fantasmagoria, fantasmagoria...
