I cry...
Lonely tears in scarlet rain
- Am I a victim of Your will?
My life goes on...
There are so many questions...
I'm still waitin' for response...
Still waitin' for Your sign...

- I am lookin' for You...
Burn in fire...
I hear Your silence...

The man asked:
- Do You really want to kill me...?
Then he put his gun away...
- So let it be...
My life is in Your hands
I will turn around my friend...
I still keep my faith and now...
I'll wait... Will You shoot at my back???

- Cos' I am (like a blindman) lookin' for You
Who's deaf now?
Burn in chaos
I hear Your silence!
Waitin' (still waitin'...) for Your word
I'm prayin' for Your sign...
Why You let us dyin'...?

Great War goes on...
I can not find Great Reason...
- Would You ever tell me - why...?

Terrible Dark...
There is no escape or hiding
Fate's never seems to change
Neverending cryin'...
Time runs, still blind
Fills like an empty shell... empty shell
I hope You can give me Your sign cos'...

- I am (like a blindman) lookin' for You
Who's deaf now?
Burn in chaos
I hear Your silence
Waitin' for Your word, for Your sign...
I hear Your silence...

Great War goes on...
I can not find Great Reason...
- Would You ever tell me - why...?

Free will...
Some of us deserve to die
In this perfect test of faith...
My life goes on...
There are so many questions...

I'm still waitin' for response...
Still wait...
- Will You choose me...?!?

- I am (like a blindman) lookin' for You
Who's deaf now?
Burn in chaos
I hear Your silence
Waitin' (still waitin'...) for Your word
I'm prayin' for Your sign...
Why You let us dyin'...?

Great War goes on...
I can not find Great Reason...
- Would You ever tell me - WHY...?
