Hi... I'm a dream...
When I die...
You will die with (for) me...
But I can feed...
All Your life to final act of greed
Hear my name...
Sssuckin' voice from Your deep inside
Sensless pain... (isn't it...?)
Now prepare...
To come and walk my way!
Walk my way!

Sweet dreams...

Callin' my name...
You can hear...
What satisfies Your greed
I want You...
Walkin' my way...
I can show You...
What You want to be...

I can see...
King (Queen) of pain
I am proud of You
But do not fail...
Disapointment -
Suffering never ends
Hear my voice...
All You need - I'll satisfy You well...
Don't be ashamed...
ON YOUR KNEES!!!
TO PRAY AND CALL MY NAME!!!

CALL MY NAME!!!
Sweet dreams...

Callin' my name...
You can hear...
What satisfies Your greed
I want You...
Walkin' my way...
I can show You... what You want to be!!!
