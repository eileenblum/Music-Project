Look at the mirror of war
You can see your face
One of billion toys in political case

In the mirror of war...
In the mirror of war...
In the mirror of war you can see your face
You can see your fuckin' fate!!!

In the mirror of war - Killing In The Name!!!
If you're killing someone...
You are killing yourselve!!!!

In the mirror of war...
In the mirror of war...
In the mirror of war...
... WAR!!!

1, 2, 3, 4... father's troops are marching on
5, 6, 7, 8... all around the kids they hate
9, 10 and 11... which child will now dream the heaven...?

In the mirror of war
See the Masters and Slaves
Where the Big Boys play...
Mothers mourn for their babies

So crush the mirror of war!
Fuck the mirror of war!
