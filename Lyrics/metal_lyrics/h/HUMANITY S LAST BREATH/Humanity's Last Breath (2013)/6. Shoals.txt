Like flies, FLIES!
In every crevasse
In the deepest holes crawling in and out
Circling its pray, eating its way through
Laying waste to the ground you stand on

All consuming and all spreading
great crawlers, millions running
Thousands of eyes watching your every move
Thorn limbs piercing the skin
Torn limbs eaten through

Causing violence to the flesh
Causing violence to the flesh

In shoals, hunting for pain
in swarms, like a massacre
Streaming out of the hive
millions of eyes staring

Their hive mind set to destruction
sent from the deepest regions, is this our fault?
We've been exploiting the world for our own cause
now they are here to set it back to its
natural state

Mass producing in an alarming rate
laying eggs inside, eating out the body
Forever hunting you, forever hungry
nothing is left

Mankind must be eaten
