Drained of benevolence
Joy, dried out
I am cursed with consciousness
Experiences tiring me
Impressions weighing me down
Down into the abyss

Cursed with insight
Blessed with nothing
and it's only getting worse
I'm without ignorance
only a fool can ignore
this tragedy that is being

Tellus aflame
Tellus aflame

If you saw the world through my eyes you'd keep 'em shut
There is nothing you can say
that'd make this stop

I am the enemy of earth
threatening your very existence
See it in my eyes
I'm destroyed inside

See it in my eyes
I'm destroyed inside

Cursed with consciousness
I am blessed with nothing
It's only getting worse
I am without ignorance
If you saw the world through my eyes
you'd keep 'em shut
This tragedy that is being
is consuming me
Suffocating my existence

Suffocating my existence

Tellus aflame
Tellus aflame
