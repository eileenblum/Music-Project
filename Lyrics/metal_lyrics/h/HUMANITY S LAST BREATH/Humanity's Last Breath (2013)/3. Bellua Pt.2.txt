Nowhere to run,
you'll be found wherever you hide
It doesn't stop
Give up the fight your time is up
Everything's lost
An embodiment of pain of massive proportion

See the sun go up for the last time
you already know you're dead

It is after me
It is after me

Unmeasurable weight, destroying all life
consuming the sun with a single breath
breathing poison and breeding pestilence
humanity fueling its ever lasting rage
Itâs your fault, you deserve this fate

When the storm hits, you won't be able to make it
Because no light can be shed without a world to shine upon

Run for your life

Monstrous void obliterating everything in its way,
immense and plague infested
Bulldozing its way ahead
No destination in mind, only the intent to erase

Only the intent to erase

Erase everything
Erase everything
