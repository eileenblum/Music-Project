You're nothing but an animal, claiming a holy semblance.
False state of being, I see through you.
You will never be more afraid

I bring woe to your kind
My intent to hurt you has no end
I am the monster created by your deceit
Growing stronger as you feed on lies

Growing stronger as you feed on lies

It is me that you should fear
I am the whisper in you ear
You are the one they'll never find
And I will stand here with a smile
It is me that you should fear
I am the whisper in you ear
You will regret this
But I wont
This is my revenge

I am nothing but your creation
Destined to fulfil my retaliation
You will fall, I will rise
From the ashes of your downfall

I will leave you in the depths

This is the sound of your demise
And the end of all your lies
I am the death of you for without me
You'll be the end of all of us

Nausea fills my existence as you preach
Lies made for controlling and limiting
Getting unjustified acceptance through awe
You're nothing but a fucking animal

Animal Animal Animal Animal.
