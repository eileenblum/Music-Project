Make me blind so that I can avoid the ugly
Is this your creation?
I can only see the wretched filth that is being

That is being

Cannot escape, cannot stand it
I can't see the light, blinded by black
Punish me, evil thoughts blocking me
Punish me god, I cannot see you

Bigotry is the disease of ignorance
bigotry is the disease of man
If we deny having made a mistake
we are deceived and thereâs no truth in us

Make me blind so that I can be spared
seeing the disease that is man

Realizing the false prophet I slowly fade
Violence building inside of me
I am now on nobody's side but my own
Nothing is worth anything,
salvation is just an illusion

Make me blind
so that I can avoid the ugly
Is this your creation?
I can only see the wretched filth that is being

Make me blind
