I felt nothing!
When you fell through the cracks
I felt nothing!
When it came to this
What do you think this is?
Why are you still trying?

Why don't you just stop?
No one wants you here,
your words are plaguing me
What did you expect?
This the only way its gonna be

They will find you,
they will find out
They never stop
It will never end

You always think you're a special case
But you are NOT
We are all the same

Go away and never come back
Spread your disease somewhere else
Go back from where you came
You are not welcome here

You are not welcome here
You are not welcome here

I may not be a saint but next to you I'm god
Your presence fills the air with hate,
we don't need you around here
Forcing me to acknowledge your existence,
will be the last thing you do
They will find you,
they will find out
They never stop,
it will never end

It never ends
