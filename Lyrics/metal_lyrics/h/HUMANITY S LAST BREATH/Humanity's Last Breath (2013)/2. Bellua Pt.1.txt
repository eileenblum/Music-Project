Monstrous void obliterating everything
in its way, immense and plague infested
Bulldozing its way ahead
no destination in mind, only the intent to erase

Only the intent to erase

Collapsing and rebuilding itself
dying and coming back to life
nothing will escape its grasp
Awaken by mans ignorance, the demise of us all

Its baleful gaze, setting fire to man
burning a hole into the earth
Consuming the ground on which it wanders
a ferocious process without an end

Born below
with an instinct to hurt
Born below
with an instinct to erase
