Staring and staring
their grins are haunting me
Marking my last days on this earth

I've been here before, followed by the faces
Thorned gaze piercing my eyes
I am what they despise

Barely grasping sanity

Roaming from place to place trying to escape
They are following me, gazing at me from every corner

Fleeing and fleeing, in vain

Every glance leaving a scar
this visage so ugly it burns my eyes
Horrific semblance of evil
does it want me dead?

Every glance leaving a scar
this visage so ugly it burns my eyes
Horrific semblance of evil
why wont they stop?

Speaking in dialects of hate
mumbling horrors in my ear
The dark language sets fear in me
what are they planning?

I cant sleep, they are outside my door
All seeing and all knowing
they're all ill-willed

Every glance leaving a scar
this visage so ugly it burns my eyes
Horrific semblance of evil
does it want me dead?

Every glance leaving a scar
this visage so ugly it burns my eyes
Horrific semblance of evil
why wont they stop?

Barely grasping sanity
slowly loosing it all
Why won't they stop?
Why wont they fucking stop!?
