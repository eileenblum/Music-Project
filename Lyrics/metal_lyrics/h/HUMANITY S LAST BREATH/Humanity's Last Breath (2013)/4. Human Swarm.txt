The innocence of our race is bleak
our true nature is revealed
That which once shone, turned to rust
Its your turn to feel the consequence
The deed is done
We walk among the rotting voids,
life will be the death of us

Death of us

Skin peeling of off our diseased bodies,
we walk the broken path of nil
The pathetic nothing we've achieved
is just a drop in the sea of failure

We've grown custom to the smell of death
we lust after it
No one can forgive us for what we've done
Skin peeling of our diseased bodies
we walk the path of nil
No one will survive
we`ll stop the wind from blowing

We stop the wind from blowing

The world is cursed with the human swarm
Your lives are forever changed there is no turning back
The world is cursed with the human swarm
There is no turning back
You are forever changed

The innocence of our race is bleak
our true nature is revealed
that which once shone, turned to rust

We are cursed with the human swarm
We are cursed with the human swarm
