I am the muscle
I am the brain, of everything baleful
I am the blood
I am the tears you cry
I dissolve the bonds that tie

I quench my thirst with poison
Living among the scum of the earth

Reign of terror, you will never know its me
Rain of limbs, I am the void following you

I am the reason you don't believe in god
I am the reason you cannot sleep at night
I am the muscle, I am the brain
Of everything baleful
I dissolve the bonds that tie
I quench my thirst with poison

The void is everywhere
In every corner, watching you rot
The cancer is everywhere
You'll shrivel away and die
