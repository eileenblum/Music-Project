I will eradicate every fucking feeling you got!
Make you empty inside!
Make you my slave!
My deeds are good, I got one intention
and that is to please my mind.

I'm sick and tired of being pushed around.
Now I'm standing my fucking ground.
I will make you twist in agony and pain,
Make you do every single fucking thing that I say!

A knife in the fucking back I'm losing track
of my morality and values.
Tightening the grip around her throat your pupils
dilating feeling your life fade away

I decide what's right
I decide what's wrong!
you had your chance,
So take your goodbyes,
I decide your life,
I decide your fate,
So save your fucking goodbyes!

A light in the other end of the tunnel,
a glimpse of light at the end horizon.
My deeds are good,
I got one intention,
and that is to take back what is mine.

You are slowly fading away, your eyes are getting heavy
I hope to fucking god that you will rot in hell!

You are slowly fading away, your eyes are getting heavy
I hope to fucking god that you will rot in hell!

You are slowly fading away, your eyes are getting heavy
I hope to fucking god that you will rot in hell!
