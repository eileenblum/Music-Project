Relationships are nothing but psychical torture,
it tears your fucking mind apart!
It has made me a cynical person and this time
I'll rip you the fuck apart! x5

If you don't pay I won't let you rest, so fucking pay me
or I won't let you rest! Tables turn and now you rot and
you won't come back to me, limb for limb I promise you
we'll take it slow from here.

Your nothing, your useless, just a waste of my time
the only good time in my life was when you died.
Buried beneth my feet I shed no tears,
only a grin on my face is what remains.

Your nothing, your useless, just a waste of my time
the only good time in my life was when you died.
Buried beneth my feet I shed no tears,
only a grin on my face is what remains.

Your nothing, your useless, just a waste of my time
the only good time in my life was when you died.
Buried beneth my feet I shed no tears,
only a grin on my face is what remains.

You are nothing to me!
Fuck your life you bitch!

Before I saw darkness now I see the light
the life I spent with you was just a waste of fucking my time!
