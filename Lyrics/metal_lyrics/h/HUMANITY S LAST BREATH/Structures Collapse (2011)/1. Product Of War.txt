I'm just a part of of their political games,
fighting a war in his fucking name,
I can't - I can't - Figure out why I'm here,
a tainted soul of slavery.

Skull cracks beneath my fucking feet,
I can't see the point of this meaningless war,
they've misinterpret a worthless book just to oppress the weak,
religion is to blame
covering up their true meaning.

Count down your seconds
your time has come
your bound to meet the creator so (bow down)
You product of war, your life is meaningless
do what your told you have no choice.

Covered in blood, I'm engulfed by flames, i cower in fear, am I dying
the ground start to break and I finally meet my creator

Skulls crack beneth my feet!

Covered in blood of the innocents I can smell my own burning flesh,
I'm screaming in pain, inhaling the ashes of the unborn that I've slain.

I can't feel pain

Count down your seconds
your time has come
your bound to meet the creator so (bow down)
You product of war, your life is meaningless
do what your told you have no choice.
