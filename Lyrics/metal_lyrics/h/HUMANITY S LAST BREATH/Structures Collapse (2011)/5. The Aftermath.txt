Why did I still try when there was nothing left.
Why did I keep trying when you pushed me away
I don't even care that you have nothing left to say
I can still repair this even though you're dead

I will never forget that you turned your back, why,
maybe we will see each other when it all goes black

As our lives comes to an end somewhere else a new begins
forget the wrongs forget the rights forget all of our meaningless fights.

I can't feel pain.

As bridges fall and forest burns what we had will not return.
As darkness falls and all turns black we'll be together hand in hand

As bridges fall and forest burns what we had will not return.
As darkness falls and all turns black we'll be together hand in hand
