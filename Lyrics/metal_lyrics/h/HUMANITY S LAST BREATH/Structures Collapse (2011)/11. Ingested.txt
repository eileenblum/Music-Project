Fear thy neighbour, but fear me more!

Placing the first incision close to your heart,
feasting on the pain and suffering,
unable to move, unable to speak,
you are looking for answers that doesn't exsist.

But I can see in your eyes how you scream
when I tear you apart piece by piece.
My acts are justified, my acts are good,
this is for all the fucked up things you've put me through.

By sacrificing you I'll hopefully get my
childhood back,
I will crack open you ribcage and ingest your fucking heart

I am the monster hiding under your bed, I am the shadow
following every fucking step you take!

I am the monster hiding under your bed, I am the shadow
following every fucking step you take!
I am the son you never wanted and I'll make you regret it!

Fear thy neighbour, but fear me more!
