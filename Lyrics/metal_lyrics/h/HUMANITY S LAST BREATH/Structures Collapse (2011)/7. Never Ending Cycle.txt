The world as we know will be laid to waste,
no one will be spared from not the angels and not your gods
We are the final to resist the attack,
citys fall forests burns time's running
out now when the dead walks the earth

We have brought this plague upon ourselves,
distant scream from beyond, there is no chance to survive

We are the last resistance!
Push them back to the grave!

The world as we know it will be laid to waste,
distant screams from beyond
there is no chance to survive!

We have brought this plauge upon ourselves!
We are the last stand!
We are the resistance!
We are the last stand!

The world as we know will be laid to waste,
no one will be spared from not the angels and not your god!

We are the last resistance!
Push them back to the grave!

We are the last resistance,
Push them back to the grave

You'll be fucking dead!
