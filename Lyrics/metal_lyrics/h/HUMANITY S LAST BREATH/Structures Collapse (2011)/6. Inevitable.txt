Inevitable
The end draws near, you're all filled with fear.
On your knees praying your prayers
Drop dead one by one your god has abandoned you

The trees start to wither and you're frozen where you stand
A chill down your spine, a touch by the dead
The trees start to wither and you're frozen where you stand
A chill down your spine, a touch by the dead

You believers brought this upon us all,
you believers brought this upon us all!

Everything you've ever loved is dead and buried,
all your friends are dead, apocalypse is here
Everything you've ever loved is dead and buried,
all your friends are dead, apocalypse is here
Everything you've ever loved is dead and buried,
all your friends are dead, apocalypse is here
Everything you've ever loved is dead and buried,
all your friends are dead
No one will survive this plague, no one will survive this plague

DROP DEAD

Everything you've ever loved is dead and buried,
all your friends are dead, apocalypse is here
Everything you've ever loved is dead and buried,
No one will survive this plague, no one will survive this plague
No one will survive this plague, no one will survive this plague

On your knees again, save your fucking prayers, now close your eyes.
On your knees again, save your fucking prayers for you're already dead.

The end draws near, you're all filled with fear.
On your knees praying your prayers
Drop dead one by one your god has abandoned you
your god has abandoned you!
