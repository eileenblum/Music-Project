You fed me up with another bunch of lies
you dug your own grave and
I'm here to take it all back.

Why can't I feel anymore
I won't regret this ever
even if you scream my name
your life will cease to exist

Face to ground
covered in blood
the look in your eyes
is what I despise
seeing your face fills me with rage
as i open your chest to uncover your blackened
heart.

Satisfying my needs in any way possible
tie her hands
slit her throat
rape her senseless

Face to the ground
covered in blood
the look in your eyes
is what I despise

(I won't regret this, I won't regret this)

You can try but you will not win
you can't beat me
Spread your legs
open wide so I can push it in!

You can try but you will not win
you can't beat me,

See who's smiling now
face down in the dirt
dig deep, dig wide
now you're one
with the ground

Fuck

Satisfying my needs in any way possible
tie her hands
slit her throat
rape her senseless.
