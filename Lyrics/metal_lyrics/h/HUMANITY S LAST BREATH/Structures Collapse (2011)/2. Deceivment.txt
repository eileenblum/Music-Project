Putting a gun to your head, shooting you from point blank range
The brain matter ejects from the back of your head
Blood splatter stains your white dress,
the white dress you wore on that beautiful day
But all that has change, but all that has change.

PUT A GUN TO YOUR FUCKING HEAD!

How you drove me to this is beyond my own fucking senses.
You drove me to a life of disbelieves.

A silvercasing drops to the floor a bullet
penetrates your thick fucking skull
You'll tell your lies no more!

Your decievement will be paid for,
you'll regret that you ever crossed my road,
you will pay with your life you fucking worthless whore

The only thing you'll ever get the taste of
is my clenched fist against your fucking jaw

GO!

(why, why me)

The blood splatter stains your dress that you wore on that beautiful day
The blood splatter stains your dress that you wore on that beautiful day
But all that has change, but all that has change

I have found that the only way is for you to pay

The only thing you'll ever get the taste of is my
clenched fist against your fucking jaw
The only thing you'll ever get the taste of is my
clenched fist against your fucking jaw
