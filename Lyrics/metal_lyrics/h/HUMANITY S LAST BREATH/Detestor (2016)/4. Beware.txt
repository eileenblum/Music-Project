Hate
I am not of pride, but of shame and guilt
I am the single most lifeless person you'll ever meet
You'll suffer me as the worst disease
You've ever had

I can't shake this feeling of emptiness
Just stay away and you won't get hurt
Just stay away
And you won't get hurt

No pride, only shame
I can't shake this feeling of emptiness
No pride, only death
Everyone's the enemy and I'm the target

Everyone's the enemy and I'm the target

Life is a death sentence
This human burden is overwhelming
The gaping mouth of the world
Will finally swallow me whole

Life is a death sentence
This human burden is overwhelming
Stay away and you won't get hurt
This gaping mouth is swallowing me whole

I would end it
But I can't fucking do it
I've tried and tried but it's hopeless
I'm worthless
I am a coward stuck between
My death wish and survival instinct

Life is a death sentence
This human burden is overwhelming
The gaping mouth of the world
Will finally swallow me whole

Beware of me

No pride, only shame
I can't shake this feeling of emptiness
No pride, only death
Everyone's the enemy and I'm the target
