Breathing down my neck, it's right behind me
Ever present evil dressed in black
I can't get it out
Trust me I've tried
All this time

Its torturous skills
Equally precise as hurtful
Its malevolent mind
Just as filthy as baleful
Manipulating me into
Horrendous acts of violence

Get it out of my head

This pain is incredible
It's the only thing I've ever wanted
All is lost, it's no use to try

All is lost, it's no use to try

The Devil is real
He's here in my head
Speaking through my voice
Wanting me dead
The Devil is real
He's here in my head
I can't get him out
Watch my story end
The Devil is real
He's here in my head
Speaking through my voice
Wanting me dead

Wanting me dead

I cut out my tongue
To keep him locked inside
As I am dying from within
Everyone around me smilesâ¨
I can't get it out
Trust me I've tried
I can't get it out
Trust me I've tried
