Dense darkness
I can't see
It's filling my lungs
And engulfing my being
Overflowing with baleful intentions
Wriggling its way, into me

Cracking my bones
Corrupting my mind
Force feeding filth down my throat
Clogging my veins
Bleeding out what remains of myself

What remains of myself

I've become what I'm not
Consumed by ill will
Emptied of life
Filled with death
Becoming one with this darkness
It's cracking my bones
And corrupting and my mind

This barren wasteland that is myself
Emptied of all content
Regurgitating the filth
Ridding this body of humanity

Rid me of humanity
Deliver me from existence
