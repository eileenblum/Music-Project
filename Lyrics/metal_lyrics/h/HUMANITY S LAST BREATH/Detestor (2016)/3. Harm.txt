My lack of humanity
Is only the product
Of the inhumane ways of man

My lack of morality
And absence of sympathy
Stems from the hell that is earth

My existence painted in black
Always assuming the worst
I didn't choose to be of this earth
I didn't choose this human burden

The betrayal of man
Displayed through fumes and concrete
The failure of you and me
Painted on this canvas of dying trees
Living in disgrace
I'm born into this worthless race
On this dead planet

I didn't choose to be of this earth
I didn't choose this human burden

I harm the deserving
I sever the head of the guilty
I harm the ones you love
I am the cleanser of all that is filthy

This filth they embrace
My being set ablaze
In awe I flee
As this world turns to waste
This filth they embrace
My being set ablaze
I didn't choose this human burden

Rid this earth of the human filth
As this world turns to waste
Take the ever spewing mouth of the world
And shove the filth back down its throat
