A bottomless pit, swallowing all
Gravitating towards infinity
Eating the fallen world
Drowning in endless doom

They are here for you
The removers of life
The air is poison
The ocean's dry
They are here for you so run

We're all aligned at the edge of extinction
We're all a lie
Rid this earth of human scum
The sea
Replaced by a barren wasteland

They are here for you
The removers of life
I drink the ocean dry

The many evils that make this world
Are here to take it back
Eating away at the rotting filth
Hell is empty
They are all here

Ocean drinker
Ocean drinker
