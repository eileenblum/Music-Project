Backstreet runnin'
Through the constantinople
Tokyo's callin'
The rats have broken loose
Sixteen shots
The guns have taken fire
Gotta keep a runnin'
The boys have got the flu

The guns have taken fire
And the boys have got the flu
And they're bringin' the city down.. .down. . .down

Everything's red
The sky is on fire
Don't you feel lucky
You just got the news
The punch clock is gone
The bars have been broken 
The walls are comin' down
Make room for the zoo

The guns have taken fire
And the rats have broken loose
They're livin' underground
Make room for the noose

Blew up the city
With a rash of napalm
I'm indestructible
You know my name
Blew up the city
But the rats keep runnin' away

The rich are movin' out
And the rats are taking over 
They only show their face in the night
You can't sleep

The flames are getting higher
And the city's a zoo

Blew up the city
With a rash of napalm
I'm indestructible
You know my name
Blew up the city
But the rats keep runnin' away
