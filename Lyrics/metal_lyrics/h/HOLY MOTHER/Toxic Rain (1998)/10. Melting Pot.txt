Holding on, you left me when my brother took my throne
Stripped me of my shield to die alone
My horse is left, my only friend
We'll pound the streets with bloody heels
Return tonight to battle for my home

Steel...my guns of steel are rusting rot 
Mind...my mind is in the melting pot 

Holy wars of rhyme and reason, watch the money flow
Building bombs of tears, a country grows
Endless cries, a soldier dies 
Another war in time
Power, reaches power, in your mind

Steel...my guns of steel are rusting rot
Mind...my mind is in the, burning in the rot

Steel...my guns of steel are rusting rot
Mind...my mind is in
My mind is in
My mind is in the melting, melting pot
Hey, the light seems to light up the sky
One seems to just wonder why
The world will regret, it's a lie

Holding on, you left me when my brother took my throne
Stripped me of my shield to die alone

Steel.. my guns of steel are rusting rot
Mind...my mind is in the melting pot
