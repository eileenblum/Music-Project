A quiet night on an endless street
The smell makes me fall to my knees
Desire strikes, I've been dealt by the hand
A tooth for an eye, it's the law of the land

I'm defecting your laws, I'm rejecting the sky
I'm reflecting your face, I'm a victim of crime 

I was sent from the sky
I'm destined to die
I'm the bloodline, the river is rolling 
Like a train on the tracks, turn your white into black
I'm alive, and the pain, it is showing

I'm defecting your laws, I'm rejecting the sky
I'm reflecting your face, I'm a victim of crime

The river, oh, the river
It's flowing through my veins
The river

A fight's a fight, it's your last meal
The bulls have returned to the cage
Dust in my eyes, the sweat from the rays
My conscious will lead me, my mind it deceived me

I'm defecting your laws, I'm rejecting the sky
I'm reflecting your face, I'm a victim of crime

The river, oh, the river
It slowly brings you down
The river
