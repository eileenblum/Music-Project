Obsessed, pleasure and pain 
It's the only world I know
Living in toxic rain
And my head is ready to go
My hands are burnin'
The wheels are turnin'
And the butterfly's lickin' the toad
Melting minds will just explode

Toxic rain, another bomb is freezing my head 
Toxic rain, another storm is leaving 
The thunder is bringing us fear again

The walls have crumbled to sand
Yes, the lines are deep in my hands
Guns and toys of modern man
Self-destruction again
What the hell is wrong with the plan
When my mind is leading
The world is bleeding
And the caretaker's making the bed

Toxic rain, another bomb is freezing my head
Toxic rain, another storm is leaving 
The thunder is bringing us fear again

Wars of money try to break me
When I'm broke
Wars of time-delusions of hope
What a joke
When the blind can see
All the criminals free 
You've got nothing to lose
You take nothing from me
And my head spins crazy
From the air that I breathe
I can't breathe 

Toxic rain, another bomb is freezing my head 
Toxic rain, another storm is leaving
The thunder is bringing us fear again

Obsessed, pleasure and pain
It's the only world I know
Living in toxic rain
And my head is ready, my head is ready to blow

Toxic rain...Toxic rain...Toxic rain...Toxic rain
