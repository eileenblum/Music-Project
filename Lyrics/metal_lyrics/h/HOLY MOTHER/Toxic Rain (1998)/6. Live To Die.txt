Alone, don't you want to be free
The road that you left me
Has spent all the best part of me 
Oh, you lost all your taste
You used up my body
And just left my mind lay to waste

Now it's alright
Let your superstitions hide
It's alright
The way you live to die
It's all my reasons
To leave you tonight

At night, you're waiting for me
Lost in your nightmare
I'm under your pillow to scream
The glass, a broken mirror it seems
Shattering pieces, to ruin your life in your dreams

Now it's alright
Let your superstitions hide
It's alright
The way you live to die
It's all my reasons
To leave you tonight

Ladders are falling
The black cat will call
Waiting to bleed all the rain
The number 13 left you crying again
Tied up in ropes try to break... try to break 
Try to break from the chains

Now it's alright
Let your superstitions hide
It's alright, the way you live to die
It's all my reasons
To leave you tonight
