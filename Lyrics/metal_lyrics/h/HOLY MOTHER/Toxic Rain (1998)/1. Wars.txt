Crashing the skies
It is raining industrial years
Following the rivers of soot
Artificial years
The water is stone
All the animals bone
I'm alive
The sky opens up
Swallows all that is bound inside

Wars are bleeding 
Wars are feeding
An artist is painting
Without any hands
A race of in-humans
They won't understand 
Wars are bleeding
Wars are feeding 
Stainless steel houses
With black platinum doors
Hide from the killers
The gamblers, the whores

For every bad feeling of hate
If you give up your flag for a life
They'll commit you insane
Bloodbath...a massacre 
The five walls of silence
A leader who stands tall

Wars are bleeding
Wars are feeding
An artist is painting
Without any hands
A race of in-humans
They won't understand
Wars are bleeding
Wars are feeding
Stainless steel houses
With black platinum doors
Hide from the killers
The gamblers, the whores

Wars....wars....wars

Wars are bleeding
Wars are feeding
An artist is painting
Without any hands
A race of in-humans
They won't understand
Wars!!
