Silver streamers fly across the sky
A rainbow of diamonds, piercing colors to the eye
Snakes that slither, make me shiver.. .why
A golden dust has stole my lust for fighting with the king

Potent wines, delusions cyst my brain
Sanity discolors all that's normal when I'm sane
The blackest black, a fear to close my eyes
To conquer deepest feelings, drawing colors from the skies

I don't remember, addiction.. .alone
I'll fly a pendant of truce as a victory call
To run forever, I hide behind the wall
Hide my symptoms of withdrawal

Subliminally twisted are the minds
They always seem so normal in the incandescent light 
An acid wash to wash away the stain
Poison fills the cavities that rot away my brain

I don't remember addiction...alone
I'll fly a pendant of truce as a victory call
You run forever, I hide behind the wall
Hide my symptoms of withdrawal

I don't remember, anything at all 
Hide my symptoms, I withdraw...I withdraw...I withdraw
