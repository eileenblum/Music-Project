In the dark I'm lying low
In the bed of solid gold
In the field of smoke and stone
Angels come to save my soul

Brothers race to stop the guns
Untie the chain that locks my world

Oh, I'm losing my bet
Yea, the angels are steering my 'Vette tonight 

Broken road and smogging rain
My steering wheel I've lost again
Time to fly, another road
Time to let my mind control

Oh, I'm losing my bet 
Yea, the angels are steering my... 
Oh my god, I'm trying, don't know if I've been lying
Oh, I'm gonna fly

In the dark I'm lying low
In the bed of solid gold
In the field of smoke and stone

Oh, I'm losing my bet 
Yea, the angels are steering my.. . 
Oh my god I'm trying, don't know if I've been lying
Oh, I'm gonna fly 

Brothers race to stop the guns
Untie the chain that locks my world

Oh, I'm gonna fly
