You live at night
There's seven ways to make a dollar
When the sun goes down
You try to face another day
You shade the light
And hit the basement wall
You lie aloud
And you're a liar
Lick the ashes from the firefly
Success has always been your collar
Like the dog that bit the poison bait
Twist of fate 

Shake, shake it till you're
Out of town
Shake, shake it till you're
Out of bounds
Shake, shake it till you're 
Out of town
Electric love
Shake, shake it till you're
Out of town
Shake, shake it till you're
Out of bounds
Shake, shake it till you're 
Out of town
Electric, 'lectric love

Shake, shakin' off the warning signs
Doesn't bother you
That you haven't seen a strangers face
Shake, shakin' all the time
You try to right your way to wrong
Because you think it's right
Stay in sight

Shake, shake it till you're
Out of town
Shake, shake it till you're
Out of bounds
Shake, shake it till you're
Out of town
Electric, 'lectric love
Shake, shake it till you're
Out of town
Shake, shake it till you're
Out of bounds
Shake, shake it till you're
Out of town
Electric, 'lectric love

I am an only child
A little wiser, a little older now
Electric love...electric love...electric love...electric love...electric, 'lectric love 

Stop wasting
All your friends complaining 
What they fear from you
They're lonely...they're lonely
All alone
You've always said you're content

Shake, shake it till you're
Out of town 
Shake, shake it till you're
Out of bounds
Shake, shake it till you're
Out of town
Electric, 'lectric love
Shake, shake it till you're
Out of town
Shake, shake it till you're
Out of bounds
Shake, shake it till you're
Out of town
Electric, 'lectric love
