You live at night
There's seven ways to make a dollar
When the sun goes down
Say you're right

You try to face another day
You chase the light
And hit the basement wall
Say you're right

You lie aloud and you're a liar
Lick the ashes from the firefly
Golden fire

Success has always been your collar
Like the dog who bit the poison bait
Twist of fate

Shake, shake it till you're out of town
Shake, shake it till you're out of bounds
Shake, shake it till you're out of town
Electric love
Shake, shake it till you're out of town
Shake, shake it till you're out of bounds
Shake, shake it till you're out of town
Electric love

Shake, shakin' off the warning signs
Doesn't bother you
That you haven't seen a stranger's face
Saving grace

Shake, shakin' all the time
You try to right your way to wrong
Because you think it's right
Stay in site

Shake, shake it till you're out of town 
Shake, shake it till you're out of bounds
Shake, shake it till you're out of town
Electric love
Shake, shake it till you're out of town
Shake, shake it till you're out of bounds
Shake, shake it till you're out of town
Electric love

I am an only child
A little wiser
A little older now

Electric Love...Electric Love
Electric Love...Electric Love
Electric Love... Electric Love...Electric Love

Stop wasting all your friends
Complaining what they fear from you
Cause they're lonely
They're lonely

All alone
You've always said you're content
Well alright

Shake, shake it till you're out of town
Shake, shake it till you're out of bounds
Shake, shake it till you're out of town
Electric love
Shake, shake it till you're out of town
Shake, shake it till you're out of bounds
Shake, shake it till you're out of town
Electric love
Shake, shake it till you're out of town
Shake, shake it till you're out of bounds
Shake shake it till you're out of town
Electric love
