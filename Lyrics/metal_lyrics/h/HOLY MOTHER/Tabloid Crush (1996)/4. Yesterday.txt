Yesterday's charade
Made us all kneel down and pray
And we thought about
The way we had it made
And yesterday's 'horay's'
Seem a little bit cold today
When I try to talk
I'm lost for words to say

I try to run
Try to run back now
Try to love
But I don't know how
How to love again
I'm giving up
Giving up my vows
I tried to leave
But I got kicked out
All the doors that lead
Have opened paths to run away

And only yesterday

Silence writes a page
In the diaries I once made
But I don't care
Who can read them anymore

Try to run
Try to run back now
I try to love
But I don't know how
How to love again
I try to dream
But I'm all dreamt out
I try to sleep
But I just can't fake it
All the crazy dreams
Have broken paths to run away

Voices I speak in sleep
Tell secrets that I keep 
In the night you've got
Your ear against my door

I try to run
Try to run back now
Try to love
But I don't know how
How to love again 
I try to dream
But I'm all dreamt out
I try to sleep
But I just can't fake it
All the crazy dreams
Have opened paths to run away

Yesterday's charade
Made us all kneel down and pray
And we thought about
The way we had it made
