There's a hole in the sky
Where the rain is falling
The rain is falling, but I

Now we're living
In the lion's den
Time to wake
Time for hunting again
And there's a lady over there
She's looking pretty good to me

Now I'll have to
Rip her family apart
And make a mess
Out of this lonely heart
I never meant
For it to be
What's yours is mine

Call me younger
Wiser, older

My life is yesterday's rain

Ah, ah, ah 
There's a hole in the sky
Ah, ah, the rain is 
Falling, but I...
And all the words
I swore in vain
My life is yesterday's rain

Now I travel through
This foggy night
Travel in pairs
To avoid a fight
Another late night
Guess I'll sleep it off tomorrow

Everything's dying
But this hole in the sky
Shine on down to me
It's beginning new life
If I can wash away the past
You'll come back to me
Back to me

Call me younger
Wiser, older

My life is yesterday's rain

Ah, ah, ah
There's a hole in the sky
Ah, ah, the rain is
Falling, but I...
And all the words
I swore in vain
My life is yesterday's rain
My life is yesterday's rain

You and I are much older
Hold on to yesterday
My life is yesterday

You and I are much colder
Hold on to yesterday
My life is yesterday's rain

Call me younger
Wiser, older

My life is yesterday's rain 

Ah, ah, ah
There's a hole in the sky
Ah, ah, the rain is
Falling but I...
Ah, ah, ah
There's a hole in the sky
And all the words
I swore in vain...
