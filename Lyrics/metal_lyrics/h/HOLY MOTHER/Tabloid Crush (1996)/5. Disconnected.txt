You're diggin'
You're diggin'
You're diggin' in the shit
You're diggin'
You're diggin'
You're diggin' in the shit

Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home
Ain't got no money
It's a riot
It's a heavy load

Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home
Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home
Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home
It's a riot

I disconnected myself
From my telephone
I disconnected
My point of view
I disconnected myself
From my home
And I disconnected myself
From...you

I'm disconnected
From being cool
I'm disconnected
From my old school
I've disconnected
My ball and chain
I've disconnected
You from my brain
I'm disconnected
From the legal shit
I know a man
He gets alot
He gets alot of it

Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home
Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home
Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home
You ain't got no money
It's a riot
It's a heavy load

Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home
Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home
Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home
It's a riot
It's a riot

I made a b-line
To the ATM machine
Lost all my money
On unleaded gasoline
I tried to get my car inspected
Just to find
I've been rejected

I'm disconnected
From your baggy clothes
I'm disconnected
From your earring nose
I'm disconnected
From getting burned
I'm disconnected
From Howard Stern
I'm disconnected
In Ross Perot
I'm disconnected 
In the money flow
Somebody turn the channel
Disconnect me from Geraldo

I'm in America
A hero and a crook
They'll pay a million dollars
Just to write my book
I'll ride the tabloid parade
Don't have to work
I've got it made
Don't piss me off
Get in my way
Don't piss me off
Get in my way

Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home
Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home
Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home 
You ain't got no money
It's a riot
It's a heavy load

Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home
Ain't got no money
You ain't got no home 
You ain't got no money
You ain't got no home champ

Ain't got no money
Ain't got no money
Ain't got no money

You're diggin'
You're diggin'
You're diggin' in the shit
You're diggin'
You're diggin'
You're diggin' in the shit
