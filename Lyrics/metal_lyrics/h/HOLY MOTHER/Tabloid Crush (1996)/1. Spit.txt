Wrong move
Dead inside
Spit in your eye
Fuck you

You're searching for the answers
You're looking from the inside
Always searching for the answers
Another way to kill time
You're movin' with the dancer
And every move a phony lie

Wrong move
Dead inside
Spit in your eye
Fuck, fuck it

It's a do or die

Stealin' from the dog pen
Feedin' from the white lies
Try to catch the A-train
Countdown do or die
Following the leader
Spit in your eye

Wrong move
Dead inside
Spit in your eye
Fuck you

It's a do or die

Spit, spit, spit

I've got the urge
To stick your face in the dirt
And I've got a lot to say
Cause I speak with my hands
So get out of my way

It's a do or die

Spit, spit, spit, spit

So many times
You dig in the dirt
You dig too far
You can't come back
You haven't the answers
You walk the straight line
Always diggin' in the dirt

Wrong move
Dead inside
Spit in your eye
Dig

It's a do or die

Spit, spit, spit, spit
Spit, spit, spit, spit, bitch
