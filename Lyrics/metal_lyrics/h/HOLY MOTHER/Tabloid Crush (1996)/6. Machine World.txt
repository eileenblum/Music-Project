Somewhere, hiding out
From the shame inside
Reach out
Grab a hold of the sky

Give me a piece
Of the broken past
Give me a reason
To say that I can
Give me a piece
Of the life I wanna hold

I don't need
Power in my blood
You shiver to breathe
All the life that you run
Give me a reason to live
I wanna know

Somewhere, January's
Really June
Somewhere, holidays
On the moon

Give me a piece
Of the dog eat world
Give me a freak show
To lose my girl 
Leave me a piece of the pie
I don't wanna know

I don't need power
In my blood
You try to give me every reason
Just to keep my mouth shut 
Give me a piece
Of the money and I'll run

All machines come
The seasoning of
The power that's inside
You got to let it slide
Let it slide
Life on rewind
The only sign of the times

Give me the beat boys
And free my soul
I wanna get lost
In your rock and roll
Let the machines come
Elec-ec-ectric shockin' me

All machines come
The seasoning of
The power that's inside
You gotta let it slide
Let it slide
Life on rewind
The only sign
Of the times

Somewhere, January's
Really June
Somewhere, holidays
On the moon

You gotta let it slide
Let it slide

Somewhere, somewhere
Some, some, somewhere
