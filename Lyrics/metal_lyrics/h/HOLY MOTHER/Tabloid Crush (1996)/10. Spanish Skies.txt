Half blind, hands tied
Sometimes love divides

Midnight summer
In a spanish sky
Latin rythms in the wind
It's like...home to me
Oh, the island's bleached
From it's own rays

Salted air and my mouth is dry
Said to a woman
Under painted skies...hold me
Oh, the island stirred
From a small parade

The stars at night
Won't cross the rine
Lonely isles, domestic wine
Like candy
Oh, we made love
Under the sun's rays

Half blind, hands tied
Sometimes love divides

Oh, oh, it didn't look that strange
From the island's coast
I'll cast a line to
The clouds tonight
Oh, oh, lovers lost
In the devil's fight
Angels come turn
Wrong to right

I was lying there
Thunder crashed
She lit up the sky
Longer hair and
Superstitious eyes
Spells were cast
And now I'm...

Caught in the middle
Of an endless fight 
Good and evil
Meets wrong and right...help me

Oh, the island shakes
From a small parade
Midnight summer
In a spanish sky
Latin rythms in the wind
It's like...home to me
Oh, we made love
Under the sun's rays

Half blind, hands tied
Sometimes love divides
Half blind, hands are tied
Am I hypnotized

I've been hypnotized
But that's alright

Oh, oh, it didn't look that strange
From the island's coast
I'll cast a line
To the clouds tonight

Oh, oh lovers lost
In the devil's fight
Good and evil turns
Wrong to right

She don't, she don't, she don't, she don't...
