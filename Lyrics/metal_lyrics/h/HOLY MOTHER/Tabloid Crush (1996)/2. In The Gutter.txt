Livin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Livin'in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter

Daddy says the preacher man
Is stealin' from us blind
He says it's only money
But instead he's doin' time

I don't like your information
I don't like your attitude
I don't like the way you lose control
I don't like your nasty mama
I don't like your hangman's noose
I don't like the way
You let me know what I'm feeling

You do alot of singing
But you're way out of tune
You do alot of changing
But you're..

Said you're afraid to bite the apple
Sharpen the knife
When you lose your cool

Walked a mile when you made me crazy
Walked away from revenge on you
I don't think it's time
To let you know what I'm sayin'

You do alot of singing
But you're way out of tune
You do alot of changing
But you're...
Daddy says the preacher
Man is stealin' from us blind
He says it's only money
But instead he's doin' time
He's kinda feeling lucky
When the dealer's on his side
His head is in the water
But his feet are still dry

Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter

Hands of time
Sands of time
Hold on tight
When it rains it really pours
Piercing chimes
Your voice is mine
Way too fast
You learned to run
Before you walk and I mean it

You do alot of singing
But you're way out of tune
You do alot of changing
But you're...

Daddy says the preacher
Man is stealin' from us blind
He says it's only money
But instead he's doin' time
He's kinda feelin' lucky
When the dealer's on his side
His head is in the water
But his feet are still dry

Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter 
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter
Livin' in the gutter
Sleepin' in the gutter

Said you were afraid
To leave forever
Sharpen the knife
When you lose your cool
Sleeping with one eye open
I'm thinking of leaving you

Daddy says the preacher
Man is stealing from us blind
He says it's only money
But instead he's doin' time
He's kinda feeling lucky
When the dealer's on his side
His head is in the water
But his feet are still dry
