Seven years ago
When you still had your smile
When you still had your laugh
Always in control
To bring us all alive
To leave us when you died

Walking on the plank
Walking on the wire
Running from the pain
Always start the fire
To throw it all away
Your life fell on the rocks
Traded in your attitude
Retire to the skies

What were you thinking
Who'd you wanna be
What were you drinking
That set your mind at ease
Did you forget us all
And leave us far behind
Now you're only someone
In our minds

Don't you know
That you were loved
You know that you were liked

I know you had shadows
To tell you wrong from right

And all your friends
In all the heavens
Can make you free
To fly...fly

I know there's a limit boy
There's a limit
On your life
I'll see you at the gate
My friend
We'll play it one more time

What were you thinking
Who'd you wanna be
What were you drinking
That set your mind at ease
Did you forget us all
And leave us far behind
Now you're only someone
In our minds

Oh, it's a scary situation
To think it could be me
To think it could be me
To think it could be
It's like I made this highway home
Another dark and lonely road
If there's a god
Then heaven's gonna help me
Another bow
A broken arrow
Another fight with
Life so shallow

What were you thinkin'
Who'd you wanna be
What were you drinkin'
That set your mind at ease
Did you forget us all
And leave this world behind
Now you're only someone
In our minds
