It's cold inside my heart
Oh it's over
It's raining in my mind
Haunted soul
Why was I so wrong
When I'm just a mortal man inside myself
Break these walls, my prison cell

Last night, something went down in Eden
And holy water can't wash away my sins
Oh, now there ain't no leavin'
And danger's calling
Danger's calling me
Call me desperate and scared
Suffering angel
I rise but then I fall 
I'm just sorry for the things I tell
Help me now, this is my hell

Last night, something went down in Eden
And holy water can't wash away my sins
Oh, now there ain't no leavin'
And danger's callingbr&gt;Danger's calling me

Dangerous cries
Blacken the skies
Losing my mind
The heart of a crime

Last night, something went down in Eden
And holy water can't wash away my sins
Oh, now there ain't no leavin'
And danger's calling
Danger's calling

Last night, something went down in Eden
And holy water can't wash away my sins
Oh, now there ain't no leavin'
And danger's calling me
Danger's calling
