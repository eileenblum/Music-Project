I see in deep blue skies
Halls I kept divine
Was there a better time
I hear echo cries
Oh...You're late
It blew my mind

Doesn't anybody want
To let you die
Your diary's erased
To say goodbye

Ten years, home to home
Long nights, nights, nights
Wet nights, winter snow 
Alright...shaken by the blow

Doesn't anybody want
To let you die
Your diary's erased
To say goodbye
Doesn't anybody want
To let you die
Your diary's erased
To say goodbye

Say goodbye, say goodbye my honey
Say goodbye, say goodbye
Don't you take my money now
Say goodbye, doesn't anybody want
To let you die
