Just yesterday
I took the train
So many times
You went away
I searched the
Whole world over
Never looking
Over my shoulder
Your silver linings
Hold the key
Just leave your
Spare change next to me

You took your chances
With the big time
Oh, where's your
Sense of destiny
Oh Heidi of Rodeo
Will you ever
Find your way home
Between the lovers
And the freaks
Livin' your life
Between the sheets

She's all wrong
I took the train
When she was gone
She'll cut you
If she could
Another night
In Hollywood

Her favorite color's
Always greener
Her favorite book
The dates you keep 
You like the
Taste of money
White wine
The limo's runnin'
Your silver linings
Hold the key
Just leave your spare change
Next to me

Does anybody out there
Know her name
Does anybody out there care
She tried to ride the rail
But she couldn't make the bail

Just yesterday I took the train
Yesterday, yesterday
Just yesterday I took the train
Yesterday, yesterday
Just yesterday I took the train
Yesterday, yesterday 

Yesterday
