Herald I'm calling
Herald my friend
My flag is falling
I'm bound by the end
Is anybody home
I live to stand alone
This time you pushed me too far

Red, yellow, black, and blue
The colors on my face
Another way to say goodbye
Everything I learned in school
Never helped my case
They never taught me how to die

And when the sky is falling
Sunday morning
Herald will deal me the king
You went from aces to the joker-the king
It's in the cards
Your life is over
But, see...this time
You're dealin' with me
Oh, dealin' with me

Red, yellow, black, and blue
The colors on your vest
It's your reward for being sane
Maybe I'll just burn the flag
And live like all the rest
So someone else can take the blame

And when the sky is falling
Sunday morning
Herald will teach me to be...
Everything my father left the bed for
To be-the only life my father
Lived and bled for
But see...this time
You're dealin' with me
Oh, dealin' with me

To be, you went from
aces to the joker-to be
Oh, it's in the cards
Your life is over-the king
This time you're dealin' with me...
This time you're dealin' with me
Dealin' with me 
Oh, dealin' with me
