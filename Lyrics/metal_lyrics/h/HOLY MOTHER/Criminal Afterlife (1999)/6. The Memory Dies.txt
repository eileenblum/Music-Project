You lie in the garden surrounded by fools
They're trying to tast it, the evilest part of you
Stretching your life line
You're kicked out of school
Learnin' survival, you live in the waste pool
You're holding a shotgoun, destroying your life
You want it, said want it, said want it
Where life turns cold
You know when your memory dies
Where fire flows
Say it in another life, should have never left it alone
They call you a freak yea, who's different than you
You're hitting the streets to find any new solitude
You choke in the dark, hide your cigarette stain
You choke in the dark, yea you're chokin' it, chokin' it
Where life turns cold
You know when your memory dies
Where fire flows
Say it in another life, should have never left it alone
Always called the bastard child
And no one really cares if I die
Where life turns cold
You know when your memory dies
Where fire flows
Stone and kaleidoscopes, sand on the walls
Serpents and snails are crawling, crawling my inner walls
The floor always spinning when the rain spills the roof
Escaping the fury of it escaping the truth
Where life turns cold
You know when your memory dies
Where fire flows
Where life turns cold
You know when your memory dies
where fire flows
