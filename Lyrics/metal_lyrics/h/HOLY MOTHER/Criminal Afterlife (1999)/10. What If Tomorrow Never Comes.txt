Sold my life ten for none 
Will my savior call me done
Life on land, time falls from me
Red hot sands from burning sun
Oh, my life
Highter pastures, dying sheep
Time for war dance, passions of thieves
All my life...it comes
Just like the way you used my life
What if tomorrow never comes
As if you thought you'd read my mind, mind
Where I came from, kill for needs
Empty hearts fall short of greed
Men in face paint, tribal laws
Winds can change, I refuse to bleed
Just like the way you used my life
What if tomorrow never comes
As if you thought you'd read my mind, mind
What if time stands still for years
Youth and lightspeed, life can freeze 
All my life can freeze
Just like the way you used my life
What if tomorrow never comes
As if you thought you'd read my mind, mind
Just like the way you used my life
What if tomorrow never comes
AS if you thought you'd read my mind, mind
