Caught on a whim, pressure's building up now
All out of wind, it's a frantic race
Politics, lunatics, it's the mad man's law
Traveled the light, blinded brim shaded sun rise
Fought all the laws just to prove I was right
All out of wind, I've been stuck in the mad man's world
Caught in the truth, you feel the lie
Button your shirt, try to lose your tie
Lies, lies
Walkin' a life on a path straight and narrow
Camera shot you a curse pic of dread 
Tryin' to cover a life, under gun by man
Caught in the truth you feel the lies
Button your shirt, you lose your tie
Time can't over feed the lies
Don't you know you could lead this paradise
Caught in the truth you feel the lies
Button your shirt, but lose your tie
Lies, lies
Time can't over feed the lies 
Don't you know you could lead this paradise
Time can't over feed the lies
Don't you know you can lead this paradise, paradise
