So you learned that tonight you'll be lucky if you listen to every word
All this talk of armageddon makes you wonder if you're still alive
Anyway, another toy electronic regulator stopped dead, like they said it would
You try to listen to a fast talkin' power suckin' lunatic
You try to figure out the skip-code, looking for their every clue
Generator powered lights, generator for the weapons of a better world
rewind my science
Rewind my life
So you think armageddon's just a fantasy
A crazy man's just a fool
So you think armageddon's just a lie about the skip-code holy rule
So you're thinkin' armageddon's just a fantasy
A crazy man's just a fool
So you think armageddon's just a lie about the skip-code 
Just another lie, I say, just another...
Rewind my science, rewind my life
So you think armageddon's just a fantasy
A crazy man's just a fool
So you think armageddon's just a lie about the skip-code
Skies are open, mountains fall
Try to stop this crumbling wall
The ocean rises, wash the land
The sun is burning, armageddon's call
Remember when your life was new
Worries were so far from you
Now you're looking to the skies
Your burning eyes...it's armageddon's call
The sun is burning, not far from you
A regulator, just a fool
My science eye, a holy rule
