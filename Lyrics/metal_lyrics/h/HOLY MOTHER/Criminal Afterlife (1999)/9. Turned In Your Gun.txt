Just broke the law
Can't fight about it, gripe about it
Don't sell me short
Can't save our freedom's home
Blame all your allies, our nation's worst fool
Believe there's a scapegoat, the culprit's not you
The foreign code, the information's confidence
Could break the world, and see our nation fall
Expecting our allies to sponser a fool
Decifer our secrets, our culprit is you 
You set a firey code
To save a world unknown
A nation's only hope
But you have turned in your gun
The FBI, a secret service spying eye
They wrote the book, to change our alibies
Blame all your allies, our nation's worst fool
Believe there's a scapegoat, the culprit's not you
You set a firey code
To save a world unknown
A nation's only hope
But you have turned in your gun
Just broke the law
Don't sell me short
Can't save our freedom's home
Expecting our allies to sponser a fool
Decifer our secrets, our culprit is you
You set a fiery code
To save a world unknown
A nation's only hope
But you have turned in your gun
You set a fiery code
To save a world unknown
