Fear my whole life set to speed
time is taken, not enough for me
Just like my age is dying
My friends are always crying
It's not enough to pacify your needs
You stop belonging, but you always put your calling on it
You stop belonging, but you're stranger and you're falling on it
Times are changing, day to night
Cold war, second story, vehicles can fly
There is no cash in money, I'm just a number running
I can't believe that there is pavement on the streets
There is surrender in somebody's eyes
I have been chained to the wall
Future, culture shock, lost in time
My streets, gone to survive without a dime
Looks like my friends deserted
My house is only dirt
There is no room for the hungry on the streets
There is an anger in somebody's eyes
And I am still chained to the wall
At the boundries of this haunted kingdom
I'm a victim, defenses will crack
Paralyzed, I will follow the cycle of the sun
Oh, the path to my freedom
I see the tears fall in some other time
But, I'll never pay for the crime
At the boundries of this haunted kingdom
I'm a victim, defenses will crack
Paralyzed I will follow the cycle of the sun
