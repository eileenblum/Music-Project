Betcha thinkin' that the world is wrong
Betcha thinkin' that the world is sin
Betcha thinkin' that I'm takin' all the wreckage
And I'm leakin' all the info
Just to pull you in
Betcha livin' like a homeless bat
Double takin' watch your back
For me you been livin' every second
Doesn't matter what you're fearin'
Cause you're fearin' every second that you're here
Take it away
I can't take it, can't take it
We're back!....Face of the freakshow
Back, you are a freak
Take another
Try to piss you off
Take another
Takin' nothin' from me
Cultivated, overrated
I'm thinkin', I've been drinking
I've been sicker than a rat at sea
Try to blame me for a suckers fall
But you were dealin' all the cards to me
Take it away
I can't take it away yea
Talkin' to an angel
Bought a ticket to a devils deal
We're back!....Face of the freakshow
Back, you are a freak
Come on up and see the show
Gotta catch a tiger by the toe
Get a freaky trip again
One million dollars
In corporate collars
Sold out forever
All to endeavor
In spite of my share
You took the money and ran
We're back!....Face of the freakshow, back
Take it away
I can't take it, can't take it
You are a freak
