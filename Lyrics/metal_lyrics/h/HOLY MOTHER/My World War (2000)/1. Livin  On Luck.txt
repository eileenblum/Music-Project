Bily earned a right
ticket to another way
Gotta tell his mom
Heaven is a better place
Everything inside
Makes him wonder why he's here
There's no way out
No way out
Everything you hate
Everything is all for you
Typlically amused
By every little thing you do
There's no way out
Oh I...I been lookin' for the answer
Oh I...I could paralyze the dancer
Oh I...broke a mirror seven years ago
But I've been livin' on luck
Blood is on his hands
Of a weaker man in shame
Nothing is for real
He's goin' to the cell again
Oh I...I been lookin' for the answer
Oh I...I could paralyze the dancer
Oh I...broke a mirror seven years ago
But I've been livin' on luck
Billy earned a right
A ticket to another way
Gotta tell his mom
Heaven is a better place
Oh I...I been lookin' for the answer
Oh I...I could paralyze the dancer
Oh I...broke a mirror seven years ago
But I've been livin' on luck
Oh I...I've been swimmin' in the ocean
Oh I...it's a secondary notion
Oh I...Get up, get out, get off of me
Livin' on luck
