One of these days
You'll feel your world collide
Strip your life of all the hate inside
In the garden of Eden
In a world turned black
Erase the damned
That make my mind from turning black
In the nights between us
Let the light turn green
I'll fight the world
And keep my pride and self-esteem
In a temple I've seen her
In a robe of white
She reached a hand to help me
Focus in my sight
Wrapped in the mirror
On the cover of life
I saw the heart that burns
To follow in her light
Oh...yea, yea, no one can save me
Oh...yea, yea no one can save us now
In the shadows of millions
Like a test of fate
I reached the boundaries of imaginations gate
Paralyzed a kingdom
With a world of chance
I taste the ashes of my father
In my dance
Oh...yea, yea no one can save me
oh...yea, yea no one can save us now
Holy winds have come and cleansed me now
Home is haunted
I'm in spirit
Oh...yea, yea, no one can save me
Oh...yea, yea
Oh ...yea, yea, no one can save me
Oh...yea, yea, no one can save us now
