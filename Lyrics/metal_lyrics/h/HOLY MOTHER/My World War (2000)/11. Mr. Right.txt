She's the one that made me change
Blind in love it feeds my brain
I don't belong
I can't convince myself of this
Alone you walk all over my heart
And rip my soul of every part
I'm like a dog
You left me to die in the alley of my home
Away from home
You're beggin' for riotousness
I beg to feed it
Iyr faith so blind
So close to fake
We'll need to seize
To heal an old disease
I could be wrong this time
But I know in my soul that a cold war
Is one bitter pill
A sandstone wall
In the last four hours of light
You wanna leave another city behind
Your bags are gettin' heavy
You can't believe you couldn't charm Mr. Right
You let your ego get away
Holdin' a dream
You spilled it out on the line
You wannna leave another city behind
Your bags are gettin' heavy
You can't believe
You couldn't charm Mr. Right
You let your ego get away
Holdin' a dream
You spilled it out on the line
