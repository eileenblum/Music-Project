You booked us a flight
You took us for free
You got us to sign
Intelligence played on me
Don't care if we die
Your money is king
You never grew up
And you're wondering where's your sanity
Stop playin' the song
Cause all your friends are all gone
You're dying to see me give up
My life is a trip on a carnival ride
You're dying to see me get out
Get out...I'm hunting for you
You painted us gold
And rotted to rust
Our innocence left
When you tried to betray our trust
Inadequate time
When time was for us
You stood in the way
Of the path
Of a long waited destiny
Stop playin' the song
Cause all your friends are gone
You're dying to see me give up
My life is a trip on a carnival ride
You're dying to see me get out
Get out...I'm hunting for you
You're trying to break me
You're trying to crack
I'm tired of breakin' my balls
Your promise is breaking
It's nothin' but words
I'm tired and sick of it all
You're dying to see me give up
My life is a trip on a carnival ride
You're dying to see me get out
Get out...I'm hunting for you
