Huge success
The kind that makes you wonder
I am no test
Repossed
I'm under, I am nowhere
A solitary way
Huge success you never gave away
What if I were high
What if you were evil
What if I were high
What if you were evil
I am haunted
Cool September wind
Fools flaunted
Who cares about sleepin'
Cold numbers in order
Fire in my water
Kept it spinning in my bed
What if I were high
What if you were evil
What if I were high
What if you were evil
