Yesterday's charade
Made us all kneel down and pray
And we thought about
The way we had it made
Yesterday's hoorays
Seem a little bit cold today
When I try to talk
I'm lost for words to say
I try to run
Try to run back now
Try to love
But I don't know how
How to love again
I'm giving up
Giving up my vows
I tried to leave
But I got kicked out
All the doors that lead
Have opened paths to yesterday
Silence writes a page
In a diary I once made
But I don't care
Who can read it anymore
I try to run
Try to run back now
Try to love
But I don't know how
How to love again
I try to dream
But I'm all dreamt out
I try to sleep
But I just can't fake it
All the crazy dreams
Have broken paths to run away
Voices I speak in sleep
Tell the secrets that I keep
In the night you've got your ear
Against my door
I try to run
Try to run back now
Try to love
But I don't know how
How to love again
I try to dream
But I'm all dreamt out
I try to sleep
But I just can't fake it
All the doors that lead
Have opened paths to yesterday
Yesterday's charade
Made us all kneel down and pray
And we thought about the way we had it made
