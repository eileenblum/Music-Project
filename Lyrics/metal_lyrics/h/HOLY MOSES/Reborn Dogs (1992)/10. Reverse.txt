The fortitude she turned to me - Without tears in my eyes
It's nothing new for me to feel - I didn't like to lie
Well I guess you took my heart - I gave it all to you
Like a turn of a new born joy - My hope would end in pain - For when it's died
It's storming broken glass - This wrath can't be denied
Wishing we could help my minds - Standing hereto clime
Sometimes when you are alone - You're writing over me?
Some lines in agony? - I reverse my life to live in this port
