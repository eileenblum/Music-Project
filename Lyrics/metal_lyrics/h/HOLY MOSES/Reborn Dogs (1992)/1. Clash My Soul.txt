Something I know - Nothing in my life - Back down the ground - When it's died
Memories remain- Drenching my soul - Believe into abyss - When I am alone
Reverse my life - Spilling on myself - Demise of our days - When he was gone
Fucking control - From friends I know - Take down my space - When I'm in rage
It's nothing new from him to feel - I hear my sirens cry
There is no chance to save my soul - You left me incomplete
Clash my soul
The situation of my life - It's nothing than a morbid game
Domination calls you - It lets our love wounded end
I couldn't cry - When it's died - Let me complete - All alone
I will unlock my fucking door - To let you pass the open gates
