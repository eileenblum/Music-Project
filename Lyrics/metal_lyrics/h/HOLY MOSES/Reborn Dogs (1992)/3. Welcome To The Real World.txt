Welcome - Behind the void -
It's your buried life
Step into my train -
Ready to come home
Moving to where you can
learn to fly again
Wings of pain -
Don't start in inside your brain
The change has just begun -
You're damned in hell
But you will hear
The voices sing reality
Move on to a new form of
life - In blood
you will be saved in a place you can trust
welcome to the real world
move on to a new form of life - In blood
You will be saved in a place you can trust
Burn upon your curse
In flowers of wrath
