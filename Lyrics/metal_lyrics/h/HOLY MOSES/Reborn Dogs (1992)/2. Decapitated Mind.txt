Decapitated soul of life...
My minds bleeds from your knife...
What I see cannot be real...
In labyrinths that I feel...
Some thing's going wrong with me...
I could never win I see...
Fucking hard to achieve...
It's not supposed to be this way...
Bring me down
Bring me down - Hold on dear - You can go I'm not in fear
Bring me down - Learn to think - And I saw the hell in pink
Bring me down - That's no fate - I hope it never ends in hate
Bring me down - Speak the truth - Illusions drove my youth
Now try
Bring me down - What you need - I laugh for all blood I bleed
Bring me down - Reach a goal - You don't know my fuckin soul
Bring me down - Live to dream - My emotions stars to scream
Bring me down - See your class - Grains of sand are in my hands
