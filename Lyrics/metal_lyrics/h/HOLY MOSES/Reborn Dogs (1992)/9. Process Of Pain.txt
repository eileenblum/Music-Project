Chaos - Infecting - it's self - my life
Enter - circle - from the ending - path
It's your turn in my life
The process of pain
I kill you tonight
Phantom - defiled - myself - to death
I - kill you - I - I - kill you - I - kill you
Creeping - breaking - inside - my mind
Mental - terror - burns - bursting
I - kill you - I - I kill you - I - kill you
