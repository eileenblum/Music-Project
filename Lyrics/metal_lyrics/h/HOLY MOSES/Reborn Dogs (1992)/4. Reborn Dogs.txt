A lot of minds are in my head
You couldn't break me down
The creation did not change
Feel the things you said to

Reborn dogs
Reborn dogs
Reborn dogs
Reborn dogs

You can't bring be down -
Take it from the start -
Wasted to much time -
If you change your mind -
So many things are said
My world I returned to me
The beast will rise again
Me kick ass for my kill
What the hell is going on
The first strike isn't gone
With those people who lie
You don't have to die
