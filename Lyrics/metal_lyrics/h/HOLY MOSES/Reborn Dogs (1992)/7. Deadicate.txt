Evil thoughts inside of me - Wounds that will not heal
Hate in my songs is the way - To ride myself okay
Dwelling deep in my mind - Killing me - Pain inside
Wash my running tears away - With ceremonial blood
Give up - Devote - One's time - Energy
Bleeding heart as a price - crucifying my own ideas
Obloguy of mental surge - In excruciating ritual
Give up - Devote - One's time - Energy -
A noble cause - or purpose - a sacred use - to god
Mesmeric to find the words - Illusions to cut out
Exiled into domnation - Vortex in both souls
Dwelling deep in my mind - Killing me the pain inside
Palpilation pneumatic dead - I deadicate to you... (DW)
Pioneer of a new theory - Full of grotesque inner eyes
Horrorfying - Chronic hunger - Chaos is the realm of fancy
