Here I am to dominate
To day I'll play the part to rule
Your motherfuckin world
Willl lay down inside of me
'Cause your soul prayed to me
My time is your pain
I reign on you
The tempter of the dark
Come on lay blame with me - For the bastard now I am
Your wage crusades of loathing  - To prove my point
Hey close your lips and lay down to sleep 'till death
I'll take you away to my place called home
You can never bring me down - With things you say or do
Shut your mouth and take that stone - To replace my soul
I don't feel sorry my souls lies in everyone
Possessed from ending life - I rule on you fool
Why do you do this - Stop it now - 'Cos in fact you are dead
The walls between us is like absorbing winds of blood
Now it's my time to kill  - There is a way to escape
My bloody curses rules - I got the kick to myself
Charge yourself 'cause my will is - The executing justice
Come kill me one more time before - Before it gets dark for you
I don't feel sorry - My souls lies in everyone
Possessed from ending life - I rule on you fool
You can't be something - You are nothing only shit
Your only verbal masturbate - Promise me to nausiate
Hey close your lips and lay down to sleep 'till death
I'll take you away to my place called home
I crush you rush - From freedom to delusion
Put it in yourself to be - Life cycle is an automation so
I know the day I will return - I'm waiting for you dead
