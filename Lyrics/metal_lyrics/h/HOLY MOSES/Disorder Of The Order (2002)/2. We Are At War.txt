[Music: Andy Classen/Words: Sabina Classen]

There has been an act of war
declared to the world by terrorists
I can't sit at home and watch TV
anger and sadness rules my heart
(what) kind of justice must be done
all the death and pain
now it has to begin with us
the fuckin' bastards have to die

we are at war, we are at war

no regard for human life
united we have to ge
but how far
but how far
torture, death and pain
no regard, no respect
will be ingredients
for human life
we respect
I have to die

we are at war, we are at war
we are at war, we are at war

no one is safe
nothing for sure
crimes against humanity
for a king in hell

Satan's work is done
and we will be none
another holocaust
himan death a bloody cost
a pleasure they need
and we will agree?
the world starts to burn
but no one will learn
is it what I will get
do we all like to forget
do you wanna be safe
something to say
do so
and conquer their way
and delete their way
and delete their way
and delete their way

we are at war

now we have
to ask again
eyes are blinded from the one
fight for what we have to believe
all around burned to ash
bodies, bodies
teacher's lessons
for your life
getting our way
bodies, bodies
burned to ash
getting our way
take our life

we are at war, we are at war

there has been an act of war
declared to the world by terrorists
I can't sit at home and watch TV
anger and sadness rules my heart
(what) kind of justice must be done
all the death and pain
now it has to begun with us
the fuckin' bastards have to die

we are at war, we are at war
we are at war, we are at war

we are at war
