Today is just another day
In which I can hear me say
Break the Evil, Break the Evil
In the sweat of my bed
I woke up in the darkening sun
To see the moon to see the dark
And I leave my home with a smile
When the sun turns into the night
I look up to the sky and see the sign

As I walked along my street
I checked out the echo of my feet
A voice like a shadow of reflections
I'm wondering about my reactions
I just needed someone to talk to
And that can only be you
Today is just another day
In which I can hear me say

Time to run for the fight
Because they run for their right
Its evil has yet to be told before our souls get cold
Today is just another day
In which I can hear me say
Break The Evil, Break The Evil
Break The Evil, Break The Evil
Break The Evil, Break The Evil

Sounds like a whisper, your words
But they will never disappear
I try to flee from everything
Soon I see the bizarre travesty
Respect everything that you leave
Fuck everything you can't believe...

Put down what they pray
For our erth in decay
They prepare us to die
So we scream our cry

Your words sound like a whisper
But they will never disappear
I try to flee from everything
Soon I see the bizarre travesty
Respect everything that you leave
Fuck everything
Not to be a prisoner of their way
We have to slide to the core
Time to run for the fight
Because they run for their right
Its evil has yet to be told before our souls get cold
Today is just another day

In which I can hear me say
Break The Evil, Break The Evil

Today is just another day
In which I can hear me say
Break The evil, Break The Evil
In the sweat of my bed
I woke up in the darkening sun
To see the moon to see the dark
And I leave my home with a smile
When the sun turns into the night
I look up to the sky and see the sign
