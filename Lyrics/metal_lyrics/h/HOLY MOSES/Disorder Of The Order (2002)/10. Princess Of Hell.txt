Princess of Hell - Give it to me
Princess of Hell - It's my decay
Princess of Hell - For your body to smell

These lyrics are simple to understand
There's nothing more for me to say
Into the pleasure of pure feeling
We all think the same you look like me

I was the first - I am not the last
So face the dead - let's start it fast
Survive the mighty flash of thrash

Amps are roaring - power chords clash
Our razor blade edge - hammer the wizard
Double-bass pounds - for the metal blizzard
Wring your axe - to bomb the hall
Blood on my strings - until I fall

Princess of hell - Give it to me
Princess of hell - It's my decay
Princess of hell - For your body to smell

It's your escape from the earth
I open my gates of hell
There's nothing more to tell
From below and not above
I give it to you - my love
I throw it up to spit it out
I throw it up to spit out

There's nothing more to tell
I give it to you - my love
I break your neck for my thoughts
There's nothing more to tell
From below and not above
I open my gates of hell

The thunder roars from the crowd
I follow my advice
Without any kind of lies
I die to stay that way
Much more than I can say
I was young when it infected me

Amps are roaring - power chords clash
Our razor blade edge - hammer the wizard
Double-bass pounds - for the metal blizzard
Wring your axe - to bomb the hall
Blood on my my string - until I fall

Princess of Hell - Give it to me
Princess of Hell - It's my decay
Princess of Hell - For your body to smell

My life is fully insane
I will not leave it all behind
I bleed in my inner fuckin' wound
