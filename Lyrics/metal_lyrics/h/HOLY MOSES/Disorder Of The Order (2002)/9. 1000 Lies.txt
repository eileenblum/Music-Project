[Music: Andy Classen/Words: Sabina Classen]

I don't wanna live without your fantasy
And I like to come in your way to play
I am not that kind
Do you like to change your mind
My love is not dangerous
I've got so much to say

A thousand lies - around us
A thousand lies - around us

Don't lock the door with your old key before
You locked into my inner eyes
My desire is burning inside of me
You taught me your right from wrong
Try to run
I can see
Please be strong
The one who warned me all about
I can tell that I wouldn't be without

I searched the whole world for someone like you
but I feel that you wonder what love is all about
No more sadness
No more bursting out
Two hearts can fit like a fuckin' glove

A Thousand Lies - around us
A Thousand Lies - around us

You taught me your right from wrong
Try to run
I can see
Please be strong
The one who warned me all about
I can tell that I wouldn't be without
Now shut your mouth

A Thousand Lies - around us
A Thousand Lies - around us
A Thousand Lies - around us
A Thousand Lies - around us
A Thousand Lies - around us

an island told me
A Thousand Lies - around us
an island told me
A Thousand Lies - around us
Life went too fast
A Thousand Lies - around us
