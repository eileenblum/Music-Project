[Music: Andy Classen/Words: Sabina Classen]

Crushing into the cranium
of a brain gone far beyond
Are images of chaos
long before we walked on down
Defile the senses
while feelings travel through the space
Recoil the reflexes
to the subjugated of a race

You will gather there tonight - 
you can hear the bullets of my cry
We will turn our amps to ten - 
the battle will start at over again

Disorder of the order - Into the present now
Disorder of the order - A madness will last

The gates of hell are open now - 
we won't be your fuckin' clown
reign of terror will begin - 
we promise it's not the world's end

As the order of life slowly fades away
The ship docks at the bay -
slowly fades away

Disorder of the order
slowly fades away
Will arise from the past
slowly fades away
Disorder of the order
Into the present now
Disorder of the order
A madness will last

Diluting the insanity of the world's scare
Diffusing the reaction
Deviating from obscure normality
The master pleads temporary insanity

Disorder of the order
Into the present now
Disorder of the order
A madness will last
Disorder of the order
Into the present now
Disorder of the order
A madness will last
