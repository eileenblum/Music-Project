[Music: Andy Classen/Words: Sabina Classen]

Although we have never been so close
we feel we are connected to each other
in dreams, desires and goals
Our realms will soon collide
The bond permeates our souls
Closer than a husband or wife
Beyond external strife
Lies our final destiny
In a world forlorn in suffering
There will soon be a gathering
An epic meeting of the minds

It's a Blood Bond - Blood Bond
Through pain and misery
Blood Bond - Blood Bond
Look to the east - Gaze to the west
Blood Bond - Blood Bond
What do we see
Blood Bond
It's a blood bond
Through pain and misery

Keep an eye on the inside
Flowing, burning on outside
Seething energy so we realize
Flowing, burning on outside
Flexing the desire of doubt
Flowing, burning on outside
Keep an eye on the inside
when we need to meet outside

It's a blood bond - Blood Bond
Through pain and misery
Blood Bond - Blood Bond
Look to the east - Gaze to the west
Blood Bond - Blood Bond
What do we see
Blood Bond
It's a blood bond
Through pain and misery

Although we have never been so close
we feel we are connected to each other
in dreams, desires and goals
Manifesting a world inside
Our realms will soon collide
The bond permeates our souls
Closer than a husband or wife
Beyond external strife
Lies our final destiny
In a world forlorn in suffering
There will soon be a gatherin
An epic meeting of the minds
