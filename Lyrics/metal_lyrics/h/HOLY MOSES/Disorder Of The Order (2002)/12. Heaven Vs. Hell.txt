[Music: RodRIGO Gonzalez &amp; Andy Classen/Words: Sabina Classen &amp; RodRIGO Gonzalez]

You go to the church - you kiss the cross
You worship Satan - Baphomet is your boss
You gave your soul to Christianity
Watch your mouth - stop your blasphemy

It's the same old game
Only time will tell
Who will be the winner
Heaven versus Hell

Born to be crucified
Your evil demon will never see the light
You Christian coward listen to you pray
You are blinded by Satan - you chose the wrong way

It's the same old game
Only time will tell
Who will be the winner
Heaven versus Hell

Waking up in horror fright
I know I'll never win this fight
I feel empowered by Satan at my side
You, weak believer, will never see the light

It's the same old game
Only time will tell
Who will be the winner
Heaven versus Hell
