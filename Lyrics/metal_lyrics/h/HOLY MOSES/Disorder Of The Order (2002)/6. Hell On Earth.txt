Believe in my words...it's hell a on earth

It's been a while since I felt so high
But I feel you'll say goodbye?
I will miss you if you just go away
Unbound by the feeling we just had today
It seems it's hard to talk for you
But it's something I would like to do
It will never be the same
Because I am lost in your name

Today I will pay that bill
And I will not think about your thrill
When I woke to find you gone
I have stopped to drag you all along
We are drawn to my desire
Is that the demon you are running for
I wouldn't have to be in love for you
If I locked that door before

I will leave your world tonight
And for you it will be all right
Even though I am in love with you
All that to say - what's it to you?
My heart therefore feels like it's tattoed
With all the thoughts which came from you
You feel okay and I'm still alone
I have to take care of that danger-zone

It's a hell on earth

You cried so long like a huge lost child
You're digging for the answer worldwide
You wonder while they understood you wrong

Why you can't get it on
You told me the secrets of your life
But now you guard them like a lie
I have to cut your pictures from the wall
Before your smile lets me rise and fall
I would like and liked to be at your side
In all your secrecy
Aling your destiny
Within your dreams
And fight for your screams
In dignity
Far away from agony

Far away from agony
When you feel free
But you forced my soul with needles
You turned your lightning down on low
And my love to you has to go like the snow
It's been a while since I felt so high
But I feel you'll say goodbye?
I will miss you if you just go away
Unbound by the feeling we just had today
It seems it's hard to talk for you
But it's something I would like to do
It will never be the same
It's something I would like to say

It's a hell on earth

When wild storms dwell
When loosened elements are tightened by a dream
When I must feel this way
When life has to be changed
