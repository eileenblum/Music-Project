[Music: Andy Classen/Words: Sabina Classen]

Nothing's right since you left me
My life was full but now it's empty
Now I never know where I stand with you
It was so strange how it was fading out
And now I've got something more to say
Before we go away, before I go away

I dont' wanna be alone is that why I'm coming home
But I lie and it's killing my soul
My heart is broken into pieces of it all
Everywhere I try to go I find myself nothing to know

I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I feel it's eating me
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I feel it has to be

I prayed to God - I prayed to Satan
I prayed to God - I prayed to God
I prayed to God - I prayed to Satan
I prayed to God - I prayed to God

I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I feel it's eating me
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I feel it has to be

I will never know but I feel you had to go
You broke my heart when I stood with you
So now my chance has passed me by
I will never know if you really changed your mind

I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I feel it's eating me
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I feel it has to be
I prayed to God - I prayed to Satan
I prayed to God - I prayed to God
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I feel it's killing me
