[Music: Andy Classen/Words: Sabina Classen]

Inside of me - I love to be
I'm ready now - So show me how
Don't marry me - Be wild and free
You're thrilling me - It's for you and me
I like to tell - Pass not away
Behind the wall - You wonder why
You feel it too - So let us do
It's hard for me - I learn to see
It's fuckin' pain - Not more about
I see the sea - You're calling me
Don't let it die - inside of you
Give it to me - It's my decay

I like to leave the world outside
Because all the words I wrote
will not fit to my voice
I'm telling it to you
But it's the last thing I can do
When I see you passing away
This holy fire is going
Deeper, deeper in my soul
I never thought before
Deeper, deeper, deeper in my soul
I never thought before

How can I make to change my mind
Because I wanna make it right this time
it doesn't matter much for you
I am lost in confusion
I have to grasp new illusions
and I'm tired of losing
words like that never crossed my way
but you know - feelings can learn to die
I like to leave the world outside
Because all the words I wrote
will not fit to my voice

I'm telling it to you
But it's the last thing I can do
When I see you passing away
This holy fire is going
Deeper, deeper in my soul
I never thought before
Deeper, deeper, deeper in my soul

Alone in a sea of agony
That will be a lonely way to be
I don't like to make it hard for me
Time will tell our way to stay
I am lost in confusion
I have to grasp new illusions
I'm tired of losing
