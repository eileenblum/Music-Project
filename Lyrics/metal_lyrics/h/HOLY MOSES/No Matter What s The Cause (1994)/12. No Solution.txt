You criticize all that we create
Your life's are filled
With prejudice and hate
We search for tomorrow
For you there's only yesterday
You're enforcing your sorrow
Of a time only you relate to

Innocent - the old feel the shame
For all time - the young's to blame

You're laughing at us
You're hiding in your institution
What's worth fighting reality
When there's no solution
No solution
No solution

What will it take to make you see
Than the majority of people are just like me
Carry on your crusade
Go ahead - plead high treason
But be assured
You're living in hatred without reason

Innocent - the old feel the shame
For all time - the young's to blame
