Blowing the pieces
Belong to the wind
Building the rampart
Until to the aim

Rotting the candle
Trial to the strength
Turning the token
Alone to the goal

You think you - have - the right to
Cry - got in my - way
I have to - pay

Naked in the sun
Washing the pain
Steal your fuckin' smile
Upon your rotten ugly fate

You think you - have - the right to
Cry - got in my - way
I have to - pay
