Get out your pen and paper
Show that your life goes straighter
You got enough from this shit
Piss on my door so that it fits

Upon your tongue - You are done
Pull the plug - Try to fuck

If it helps you with your plan
Like another cause of boil
Pain and problems in your mind
Saved outside and left behind

Upon your tongue - You are done
Kill the will - Beat it still

Be a part of war and pain
Pictured as a hungry man
Tell me, can you feel the heat
When you try to drop me deep

Upon your tongue - You are done
Kill the will - Beat it still
