You know I see you
You know I see
You know I see
You know I see - you laugh at me
I know you don't see
You don't see me
You don't see me
Just sittin' there on ecstasy
The greatest fear for you to be
Is like your stupid look at me
You will never wake up
But now it's too late
Sealed is your fate
Reflection is dead
Unconsciousness meets
Senselessness
Your innocent face
Somewhere in space
No human race
Just can sense humility
Take this, it makes you feel better
Keeps all the truth out of your brain
What's up - you sick
What's up - but you'll see
What's up - you suck
What's up - start wakin' up
