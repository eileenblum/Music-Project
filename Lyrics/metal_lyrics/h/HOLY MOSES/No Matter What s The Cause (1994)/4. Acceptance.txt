Standing - standing in front of the mirror
Staring - into hollow eyes again
Watching - helpless selfinflicted pain
Suffering - under these circumstances
Feeling - broken and misused
Knowing - that I'm living a lie
Acceptance - that I'm unable to deny
Acceptance
Remembering - how it used to be
Drowning - in sorrow and ecstasy
Growing - like a cancer in me
Turning - myself into the enemy
I'm trapped - with my back against the wall
Frustration - takes its all
I'm trapped - with my back against the wall
Frustration - let frustration take its all
No need - no need to talk to myself
Again - no need - to think that I can
Change the way I am - no need
To fool myself around again
Needing - to accept what I am
I feel the need to accept that I'm
Not the one I thought I am
Acceptance
