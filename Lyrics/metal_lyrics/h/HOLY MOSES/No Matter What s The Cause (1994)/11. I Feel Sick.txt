This is the time when we start to die
With no remorse hate starts to rule
Hard to believe
Your image of pain
Spit in the face and win the race

Sorry - I got brain
Sorry - I was born
Sorry - that I still believe
Sorry - I feel sick when I see you cry

You deal with it and it makes you free
Lessons of hate right in your hand
Oh, I feel sick when I try to believe
Get sick when I just try to live

Sorry - I got brain
Sorry - I was born
Sorry - that I still believe
Sorry - I feel sick when I see you cry
For you - I just feel sick - for you
