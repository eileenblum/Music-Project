Trying to believe - you are who I see
'cause selfreflected
I'm not the one I used to be
I hide away
Deep inside my little cares
Ignoring all the time
Your penetrating stares
Hard to control - hard to believe
Hard to hold on - hard to let go

I'm not one of you
We'll never be the same
I'm deaf of your little lies
It's all your filthy game
"Just because"
Is just not good enough
Although the words you spoke are true enough
Just - because - just - a mistake

I'm not one of you
We'll never be the same
I'm deaf of your little lies
It's all your filthy game
Just because - Is just not good enough
Although the words you spoke are true enough
