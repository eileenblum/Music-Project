I - can't believe what I feel
I - can't believe what I see
I - can't believe what I hear
I - can't believe in me

You - try to ignore the signs
You - try to live your life
You - try to deaf and blind
You - try to ignore the starfire

Can't you see - you're denying reality
In this precious time
How can you act so numb and blind
I look at the future and I don't like what I see

I - can't ignore reality

I - can't ignore the pain
I - try to do something and be against the grain
You - try to live your life and don't care what it takes
You - will never realize that all your life's just fake
