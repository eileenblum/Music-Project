This live to live - this race to win
Is like a nightmare - we're livin' in
The sun is stronger - that our skin
You smell like excrements - from human sin
I love and hate you - some kind of fate
You don't know nothing
Just know hate
Not looking forward
Just lookin' back
Now life's behind you
So take your lying pay
The bill is your sensitivity
From now on, real agony appears
Now you know nothing - means everything
It's no more living - just suffering
Now all the answers - begin to work
Let there be light - somewhere
In the dark of your head
