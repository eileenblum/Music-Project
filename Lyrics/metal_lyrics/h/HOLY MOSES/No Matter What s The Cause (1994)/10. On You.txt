I wish - I had - respect - 'cause I don't like me at all
I'm stripped of all my pride
The final process is now complete
I kindly set me aside
I wish - I had - respect - 'cause I
Don't like loyalty - 'cause I
Don't like dignity - 'cause I
Don't like company - 'cause I
Don't like myself - the real me
I'm so fuckin weak
I'm disgusted about myself
I rip my heart out and surrender
To my innerself
How would you react - for yourself
How would you feel - for yourself
If everyone turned their back on you
Respect
How would you react - for yourself
How would you feel - for yourself
If everyone turned their back on you
On - on you - they turned their back - on you
I wish - I had - respect - 'cause I
Don't like me at all
