[Shock Therapy cover]

What has changed me into something I don't know?
Forgotten feelings like I never know
Eyeballs bouncing in a room of blinded me
Careful of feelings I thought I knew me

A man is waiting at the corner screaming at me
Angry hate for myself: the hidden me
A closet of angry words no sight to put them in
Hateful sea of love with no one to put it in

A classic film of yesterday is just today
Once tomorrow, maybe never, I hate me
Bricking myself into the wall wretched sin
Hoping to be by myself, I won't let you in

My product is only second-grade
I hate to discuss what this man has made
Forming in my hands I know it all too well
Staring at the glass I know myself too well

Hate is just a four letter word
