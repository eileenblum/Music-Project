Rise... Down on your knees

The beats of blood and death will crush your empty mind
I am full of hate but I can fuckin' see
When you try to kill me
taste the feel of who you like to be

Lay the Fuck back down

See your fate
Try to rush me out
running out for what you like to see

It's your turn
for what you like
and what you thought

With your war you like to try to open doors
but you will set your own gates into flames

You try to be a great demon god...I rise

Down on your knees
to pray for the horned beast
Down on your knees
get ready to say please
Down on your knees
to pray for the horned beast
Down on your knees
get ready to be a great demon god
For all to see your furious hate
I want to see you down on your knees
to pray for the beast

Pray for you soul - descended from your hell
My power will arise for the world I set in flames
The thunder roars in hell the liar blood falls to the ground

Down on your knees
get ready for the beast [3X]
Down on your knees
pray for beast
Down on your knees
to pray for the horned beast
Down on your knees
you want war
Down on your knees
for all ready to see

I bring you to the slaughter of death
