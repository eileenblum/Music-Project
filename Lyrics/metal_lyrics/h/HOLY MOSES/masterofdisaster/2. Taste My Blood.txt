You can't kill us you cant thrill us
you can't kill us hate in my neck
You can't kill my mind you
can't kill my time
our return is now

[Chorus 2X]
Do it, do it
taste my blood
drink my deadly power
do it, do it
taste my blood
I am the essence of evil

The blood in my veins
blood to sacrifice
fear for the truth
the fear to infect you
Bleeding hearts for a feeling inside
With a force of our mind for visions of death

[Chorus 2X]

Blood for my rise
I rise for my sword to slit your throat

Feel the infection
I want you to feel
I can fill your throne
I'll always be next to you
You will never see
I rise for my sword
chains will slip away
you are a god of lies
endless and it's over now

You scorn my existence chains will slip away
I rise for my sword to fill your throne
I'm the one you called for help
Blood you drink from the river of hate
You can't kill us you can't thrill is
hate in my neck, hate in my back
you can't kill my mind you can't kill my time
and return is now for all to see

Do it, do it
taste my blood
blood in my veins
Do it, do it taste my blood
blood to sacrifice
Do it, do it taste my blood
your blood to feel
Do it, do it taste my blood
to infect you

[Chorus 2X]

You are a god of lies
