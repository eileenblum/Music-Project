I will stand inside my hell
take the hand of death
I don't care what they think
Don't they know about
I need you in my blood
crack the liar's eyes
I have no choice to stay again
before my candles burn out

Yes I am, I say I am, Here I am, The Hand of Death

I close my eyes to feel the touch for my inner rush
I stand in fire all night long and it makes me go
I believe in my fate, so I take the hand of death
I can see that you will die, I keep my candles burning

Yes I am, I say I am, Here I am, The Hand of Death

Get away our lives are closer now
what the hell, what the hell

Yes I am...take my time...I say I am...in my time
Here I am...for my hell...in my mind...The Hand of death

I am the mighty emperor ruler of the dark domain
I don't care how you act you will lose your own respect
I let you fall into my hands to press you now back down
I am satan's angel my candles never burn on out

Yes I am, I say I am, Here I am, The Hand of Death
