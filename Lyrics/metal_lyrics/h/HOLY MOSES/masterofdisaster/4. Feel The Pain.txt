You will feel the pain
don't fuck with me

For my dreams I work all night what to think to find
I don't care to get some sleep for my life I like to bleed
And when it screams in my ears the siren dries my tears
I will suffer nevermore I will always find an open door

That's my hell that's my spell
blood in your eye- son my mind
born to die for a ray of the day

Now to see my return
fall for you
I bleed in mine
Try to fly
to get out of my life

To this one for my line
Fuckin' lies
In all the time
get the one
faster
killing war

Let me run
Faster
Whoever you are
Look in the eye
Give me time, be my son, fuck the war

Feel the pain, feel the pain, feel the pain

To this one for my line
Fuckin' lies
It's on my mind 
get the one
faster
killing war

Let me run
Faster
Whoever you are
Look in the eye
Give me time, be my son, fuck the war

Feel the pain, feel the pain, feel the pain

You will never break my bones
I am what I stand for
I will not spit down on you 'cause I recognize what you do
Your death is coming slow
and you will choke yourself
I will always clear my way
a thing you will never say
And when it screams in my ears
the siren dries my tears
I will suffer nevermore I will always find an open door
