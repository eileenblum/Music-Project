i take you on a journey
through nightmares to hell
you find yourself in wood obscure
piercing, dark and sharp
it haunts you still renewing
your pitiful dismay
this death so near i'll feed you
with bitter taste decay

run
stumble upon rotten bodies
scream
a swarm of flies pours out your mouth

i am the hound of hell
gaurding the gates
dismembering the lost
lacerate the abadoned
torture the vain

i make you bleed a thousand times
a thousand painful wounds
you find yourself in bones obscure
briken splattered croshed

i haunt you till your lungs explode
my fangs rip out raw flesh
my claws cut deep into your bones
the journey is your end

run
stumble upon rotten bodies
scream
a swarm of flies pours out your mouth

i am the hound of hell
gaurding the gates
dismembering the lost
lacerate the abadoned
torture the vain
