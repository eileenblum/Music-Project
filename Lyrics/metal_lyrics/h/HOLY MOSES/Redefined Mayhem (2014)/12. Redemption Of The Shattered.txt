digging deep into the ground
damp earth soaked with  blood
scattered limbs torn off with force
pungeni stench of burning flesh

giving birth to my demons
the funeral of my emotions
my empty eyes are turning cold
my body - an abandoned chapel

the only way to exist in this world
letting my perturbation rot
i'm watching myself with a souless smile
i bury my slain rejected self

giving birth to my demons
the funeral of my emotions
my empty eyes are turning cold
my body - an abandoned chapel

redemption of confusion
redemption of the shattered
redemption of confusion
redemption of the shattered

giving birth to my demons
the funeral of my emotions
my empty eyes are turning cold
my body - an abandoned chapel
my empty eyes are turning cold
my body - an abandoned chapel
