remove the time from your mind
or choose to use - memories abused
create the past - i will qrise
the future holds in my illusions
the sense of the time from my mind
answers of my world - the sickness of my life
cause my past is what i am
today in pain i need to learn to use

fear - is what i am today
sorrow - is what they preach to me
pain - is what i feel in me
let me please get out of time of...

delusion - end the delusion of time
delusion - end the delusion of fear
delusion - end the delusion of pain
let me please get out of my brain

i'm inside in my mind
for my life - adventure times
cycle of birth - no more curse
wandering through shades - no sickness in my mind
internal demons, increased turmoil
protect me from pain - release my brain

delusion - end the delusion of time
delusion - end the delusion of fear
delusion - end the delusion of pain
delusion - end the delusion of hate
delusion - end the delusion of time
delusion - end the delusion of fear
delusion - end the delusion of death
let me please get out of my brain
