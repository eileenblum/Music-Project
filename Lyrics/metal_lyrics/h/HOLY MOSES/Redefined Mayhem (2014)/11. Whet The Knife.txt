please fill me with white light
and make the voices go away
please let me have a small tadte of life
demanding tongues and jaws to appease

whet the knife - take me from death to immortality

purify me - i bloom throught your bliss
enlighten me - i thrive in your blood
give blessing to me - i dress in your skin
redeem me - when i devour your flesh

please lead me from unreal to real
and mske the shrouds of grey go away
please lead me out from being the dark
visions of light and shining from inside

whet the knife - take me from death to immortality

purify me - i bloom throught your bliss
enlighten me - i thrive in your blood
give blessing to me - i dress in your skin
redeem me - when i devour your flesh

purify me - i bloom throught your bliss
enlighten me - i thrive in your blood
give blessing to me - i dress in your skin
redeem me - when i devour your flesh

whet the knife - take me from death to immortality
whet the knife - an apple in your mouth, a carrot in your ass
