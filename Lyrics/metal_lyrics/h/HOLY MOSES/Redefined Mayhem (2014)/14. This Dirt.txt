we are boring and dull
we are on rock'n'roll
we are no kings of sound
we are pain in your ears

we are the nerds from hell
we are all that you hate
we are too many noces
and we like it this way

this dirt will bring you down
to search fot thw timr
you'd better stay away from
this dirt

fuck your hypocridy
fuck pathetic being
fuck your so called wisdom

fuck your reguations
fuck your good ideas
fuck your so alled wisdom
go and fuck yourself

this dirt willbring you down
in search for the rone
you'd better stay away from
us!
