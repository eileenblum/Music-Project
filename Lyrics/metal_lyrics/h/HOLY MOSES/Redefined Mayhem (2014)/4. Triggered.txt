i remeber the past
like with real eyes
i am in flashback
all my fellings are coming back
i don't know what is real

i fall bak into dreams
into black holes
acting poor roles
creeping under my skin
torture's teasing pain in me

triggered - black mass released
triggered - dark suns collapsing in me

i wear the bygone mask
dissociated eyes
staring in fear
all my tension is building up
i'm exploding with rage

aimlessly punching round
striking with hate
unable to stop
blood running from my hands
trigered by fear; exhausted by pain

triggered - black mass released
triggered - dark suns collapsing in me
i cannot see what is real
i cannot feel where i am
it's starting again
it's rising up
escalating with brute force
