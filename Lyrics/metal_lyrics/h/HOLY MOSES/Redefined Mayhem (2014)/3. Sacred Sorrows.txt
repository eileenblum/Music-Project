like a weak lamb, blinded you are following the herd
locked inside yourself and cryinhg as a crock at the wailing wall
suffering will be inflicted as your fears eat you up
turning into an empty shell
rotting in aparty

suffocate in pride

dwell in your sacred sorrows
hide yourself in your own despair
weep and cry - drown in the seas
of your own desperate futilities

hold onto your contrived misery, repeat your sob story
look at your pathetic being, the dying swan is what you are
crown yourself with thorns, play the martyr once again
climb upon the cross and sing your song of thousand elegies

suffocate in pride
your vanity is void
dwell in your sacred sorrows
hide yourself in your own despair
weep and cry - drown in the seas
of your own futilities
just suffering inside seems real
you descend into hell

hold onto your chosen pain, in senseles dreams you decay
in your head you pretend the victim role to play
crown yourself with throns and play the martyr once again
climb upon the cross and sing your song of thousand elegies

suffocate in pride
your vanity is void

dwell in your sacred sorrows
hide yourself in your own despair
weep and cry - drown in the seas
of your own desperate futilities
weep and cry - feel your chosen pain
your depressing life is in vain
