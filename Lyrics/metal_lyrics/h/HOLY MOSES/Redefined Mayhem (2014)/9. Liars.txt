falling through shades of this deception
realities collide - these poor elusive lives
evading the conflict and smiling in pain
ypu swallow the truth to spit the lie

cogwheels of deceivers - clockworks of lies
the grief you pour in wine - the pain you serve in blood
stunned by your halo - poisoned by intrigues

one curse to this god - to whom we prayed
one curse to this king - to whom we paid

the gardens that wither of gluttony's greed
the hunger we suffer you're holding th seed
blindness is sacred - ignorance is bliss
you lie on the tide - you drown in the waves

cogwheels of deceivers - clockworks of lies
the grief you pour in wine - the pain you serve in blood
stunned by your halo - poisoned by intrigues

one curse to this god - to whom we prayed
one curse to this king - to whom we paid
one curse to this land - that we died for
one curse to us - for sheep we were

by day and by night we are weaving
the shroud of your downfall - the flag of our rising
we weawe into it threefold curse - we weave, we weave
we weave into it threefold doom - we weave
