this is the end - don't want to feel the pain
porous bones - desiccated roots
obscure through -  disintegrated mind
think old blood sticks in my veins

burn out my tongue - i won't cry
break my bones - i won't run
cut out my heart - i won't bleed

please take my life and let me die

show me the light when darkness come around
take me to the other side - where fear and hate cease to exist
show me the light when noise encases my pain
take me to the other side - one step ahead of death

this is the end - ages behind
my paper-like skin - tears apart
long deep folds - doomed and revealed
old weak flesh hang down from old bones

burn out my tongue - i won't cry
break me bones - i won't run
cut out my heart - i won't bleed
plese tke my life and let me die

show me the light when darkness come around
take me to the other side - where fear and hate cease to exist
show me the light when noise encasesmy pain
take me to the other side - in the face of death i'll be redeemed
show me the light when darkness come around
take me to the other side - where fear and hate cease to exist
show me the light when noise encasesmy pain
take me to the other side - in sweet relif of death i'll rise
