encounter yor biggest weakness
the mirror of your fears
clenching its jaws in anger
a brazen roar comes down at you

undead dogs
coming to strike you down
tearing your flesh apart
you face your biggest fears

liberty is what you seek
the hellhounds guards the way
a monstrous incarnation
of your worst and darkest self
undead dogs
coming to strike you down
tearing your flesh apart
you face your biggest fears
undead dogs
coming to haunt your soul
you fight against yourself
your suffering is fierce

he bites his teeth dep in your flesh
hauls you downinto lurning shadows of your mind
he giards the abyss, lets nibidy out
once you are in
eternal you're bound
no chance to escape
defeat the undead dog
by pure strenght of will

undead dogs
coming to strike you down
tearing your flesh apart
you face your biggest fears

undead dogs
coming to haunt your soul
you fight against yourself
your suffering is fierce
