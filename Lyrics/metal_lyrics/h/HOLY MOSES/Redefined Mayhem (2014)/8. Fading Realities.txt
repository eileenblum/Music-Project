bad memories surface of horrible deeds,
reality's fading - the world turns around
acts unspeakable suppressed in your mind
delusion become surreal

your grip tightens, but there's nothing to hold
in this wave of understanding it begins to
dawn - what you've done

overwhelmed by darkness to come
ascended from blackness deep within
staring into the eyes of the remorseless
lurking scheming menace

your grip tightens, but there's nothing to hold
in this wave of understanding it begins to
dawn - what you've done

your fortess of cards
collapsing to ruins

in truth suppressed you boil
tearing your mind apart
the ruin membrane inside you breaks

it pours into you - what you've done
in begins to dawn - what you've done

your fortess of cards
collapsing to ruins
