watching - the disappearing soil
desperate - flapping my wings
scared of everything that heppens next
slashing around helplessly - falling into unknown deapths

fear - take me now and drags me down
stripped - nked and all thar's left - despair and hate

watching - quicksand grabbing me
desperate - clining on the ground
scared of wvwrything that happens next
slashing 'round helplesslu - i'm sinking into unknown depths

you think you are safe - you are not - we are all drawn - into th dark

feeling - shadows overtaking me
staring - at penetrating eyes
petrified with horror - unable to move
slashing 'round helplessly - i'm losing my sanity

fear - take me now and drags me down
stripped - nked and all thar's left - despair and hate

feeling - my drained and worn out mind - staring - into my abyss
petrified with horror unable to move
slashing around helplessly - i'm drowning in insanity

alwayse be there back in your mind
hidden in tha veils of self-decepyion
you think tou are safe - you are not
we are all drawn - into the dark

i'll make you sleepless - i'll make you sad
you can't ignore the only way to exit is your death
i'll make you restless - i'll make you mad
all greatness perishes - the only exit is your death
the only exit is your death

alwayse be there back in your mind
hidden in tha veils of self-deception
you think tou are safe - you are not
we are all drawn - into the dark
