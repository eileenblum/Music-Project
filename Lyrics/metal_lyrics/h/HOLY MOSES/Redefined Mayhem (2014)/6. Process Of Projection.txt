hands clenched to fists and foam at the mouth
blood's boiling in veins; the beast bares his teeth
blood pressure gets high
splintering, flittering pictures on my mind
agonizeing respiration - confusing thoughts

i'm like a bomb - don't light the fuse - you make me sore

that's your process of projection
something dangerous that is left inside
that's your process of projection
narrow freedom hurts put the pain outside

like a thorn in my flesh you fall from grace
with every word you make this bad affair even worse
don't stop me now, you light the fuse
you made the sore - you reap what you sow

i'm like a bomb - you light the fuse - you made me sore
i will explode - i'll rip you down
the shock wave tears yu into pieces

that's your process of projection
something dangerous that is left inside
that's your process of projection
narrow freedom hurts put the pain outside

that's your process of projection

you reap whay you sow - i rape what you reaped
you sow rancid seeds - i grin in my face
as i eat what you raped

but now you have no control over me
you're out my life
that's your process of projection
something dangerous that is left inside
that's your process of projection
narrow freedom hurts put the pain outside

that's your process of projection
