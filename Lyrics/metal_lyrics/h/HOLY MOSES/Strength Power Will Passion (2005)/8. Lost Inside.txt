Catching your blood
To sell out your brain
For a tragic house of shame
A worthless game
Living on a dead end land
A violent perfection
Betraying life itself
You sold your soul before
The killing of hope
Was opening up the door of killing fate

Lost inside
All those lies - lies in your eyes
All those lies - I can hear your killing cries
Lost inside
All those lies - lies in your cries
All those lies - I can feel your bloody eyes

How does it feel - to die in your sleep?
How does it feel - to die in fear?

Killing your hope
To rob out your fate
For a nightmare of life
A timeless falling
Screaming at a dead end road
A mortal slaughter
Sacrificing life itself
You wrapped it up in lies before
The claws of evil
Cashing you up like a cheap fucking whore
