Welcome to your world
Stagnant energy attracts itself
Accumulates a life in work
Energy stagnates begins
Take a while for you
To get the instinct waiting to clear
You rule this clutter
Symptoms for eternity

Die - die - meet the war machine
Feel the blinding in your eyes
Blinding from within
Die - die - meet the vibrant energy
Feel the running of your blood
Running from within
Die - die - meet the sacred space
Feel the moving in your soul
Moving from within

Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my flow
Experience a life to work
Look into a vibrant energy
Take a look through
The space in even deeper levels
Feel this clutter
Effecting your empty life
