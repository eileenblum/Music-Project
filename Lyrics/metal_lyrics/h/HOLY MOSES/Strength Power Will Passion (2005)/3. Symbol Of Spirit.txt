Rise
Burning the ghost
Killing the peace
It's getting high on you
A symbol of a spiritual way

Eating the soul
Drinking the blood
It slowly rises on you
A symbol of a spiritual day

Nocturnal angels
Running through the space
Violated virgins of the evil incarnate
Waiting for a heaven in hell
These angels cry
When they start to die

Inspire these minds
So easy to control
Control of fate
Fate to defend

Infected rebels
Selling Satan Jesus Christ
Surrounded by
The guardians of morality
Spreading the disease to rise
Prepared to die
When these angels cry
