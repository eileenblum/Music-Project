Fighting for your soul
The heaven is burning
The silent wars of Satan

Nothing we will believe in
The realms will be dying
The deeper pain of Satan

Hating all your words
The melodyne is bleeding
The darker hate of Satan

End of time
It's the end of time

Killing all your dreams
The death is coming
The black sun of Satan

Reigning all your hopes
The slaughter is calling
Satans open grave

Blackening all your thoughts
The illusion is controlling
The cold blood of Satan
