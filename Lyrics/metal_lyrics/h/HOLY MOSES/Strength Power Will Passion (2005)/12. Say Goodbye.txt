Destruction fills my screaming soul
I will learn to hope
Memories killing through the brain
Born to die
Corrosion in the shades of death
The acid rain of pain
Morbid dreams fighting through the dark
Rest in peace

It's time to say for you goodbye
It's time for you to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye

Darkness fills the endless sky
Silence reigns in your brain
Fragments mixing through your soul
Taking you down
Celebration masterpiece
The latest death on earth
Say goodbye, shouting through the hell
Rest in pain

Violent emotion fills your eyes
Daylight waits to die
Human madness on the edge of time
Power like a gun
Satisfaction bathes in blood
Raised in a nursery
Carnal forge the membrane
Of your dreams
Rest in hell
