Helpless in your soul - killing your hope
Oppressed by masses - in divine resignation
Fields of desolation - to live or die
Deep in your mind - it's not my kind

Now it's time I stare to fight
Kings on earth I cannot find
Born in a dark cold winter night
I prefer the bracing winds of truth

Wrapped up in lies - tormenting my pain
When I hate your face - bearing evil souls
Prayer of defense - pride and power
Cracking the whip - lipstick and terror

Now it's time I stare to fight
Kings on earth I cannot find
Born in a dark cold winter night
I prefer the bracing flames of hell

Now it's time I stare to fight
Kings on earth I cannot find
Born in a dark cold winter night
I prefer the glowing of my soul
