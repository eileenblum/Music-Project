Welcome to a world of lies
A life of killing hope
Spattered by the soils of fate
Welcome to a world of hate
Depression in your soul
The beast of time
Kicked in your face
Locked in your will
Locked in your empty shell

Rebirthing - darken the skies
Forever burn - energy to cry
Robirthing - journey to rise
Anguish behind - the answer is ripe

Welcome to a world of pain
A life of dark buried thoughts
When it turns against yourself
Welcome to a world of hope
Bitterness against your enemy
The breath of time
Kicked from within
Energy in your mind
Vulture in your soul
