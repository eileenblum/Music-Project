I will beat you down

I will beat you down
Deadly dynamics
I will beat you down
Deadly precision

Propaganda death massacre
Learns to play
Corpses screaming
Through the night
In a blood lake grave
Orchestral dark horrors
Learns to dance
Death bells ringing
Through the abyss, rest in pain

Prepared for your mortal coil of agony
Campaigns killing through the earth, born to die
Celebration masterplan the latest kind of art
Death bells ringing through the abyss, rest in peace

Darkness falls by playing with their minds
Products fighting through the mud a total war
Soldiers of victory in a battle of rain
Death bells ringing through the abyss, rest in pain
