Watching myself I slowly die
When I try to burn my pain
Slowly tearing me apart
Nothing creeps down the path
My fire slowly dies
When the eternal echoes cry
Wisdom of the mortal soul
Behind the open wall

All the space - lost in days
All the space - lost in rage
All the space - lost in days
Everything you want
All the space - lost in rage
Everything you want
(you got it now)
All the space - lost it now
When you never had it
All the space - lost in days
Get it now

It's not like were dead
Follow only your instinct
No one can possess your soul
Kiss of face of life
You will rise from the ashes
The carnal flame will arise
Symbolical and mystical
The clearing of your space
