Scrambled to buried ideas
Burnt, barred and dead
Resembling melting snow
Torched to a wimp
Mortified to a marble feast
Bleak, molted and cold
Degrading desolate despair
Raised to a creed

When love dies - when love dies

When love dies - the angel cries
We are god - you are god
When love dies - the angel cries
I am god - god is new

Rusted to an iron ruin
Crude, crossed and dark
Croaking crumbling brick
Desolate to a corpse
Sardistic tide of stench
Spoilt, scrubbed and scourd
Impaling immortal decay
Putrefied to a grave
