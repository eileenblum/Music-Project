Thou the fortress of desperation
May plunge you into doubts
You shall not fear to stride
Across my bridge of inner strength

Is it well worth the price?
they have taken all you gave
In my life I perceived
You haven't seen the light of day

And what you see in your face
It's distrated can't you tell
Let me help you all to see
Take the trail it's just for you

I will live in the world
I will get no amnesty

But my resistance will be burst
It seems I lost your way

Look away keep no restraint
You can't control my own destiny

You have you won reality
On the trail I close the gap

You find it hard to believe
I stand alone await your return

Then we can fight together
Restraint is dissolved just in time
