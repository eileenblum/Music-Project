Ignorant I took my key - open that green iron doooooaaarr
Look around where is that dog - close the door nothing than sorrow

What kind of royal court - I want to safe my holy princeeeeessssss
Here I have to change my life - didn't think he took his kniiiieeefeeee

[2x]
Dogs - everywhere
Fear - in my brain
Pain - In my head
High - voltage in my heaaaaaadddddd

[Break:]
In the land of one black rasquill
Something wrath into my eyes

[Andy Part]

Finished With The Dogs

Dogs Andy

[Break]

Now I've got to fight alone - only here to safe my bones

[2x]
Dogs - everywhere
Fear - in my brain
Pain - In my head
High - voltage in my head

[Andy]
Dogs - everywhere
Fear - in my brain

[Andy]
Pain - In my head
High - voltage in my head

Finished with the dooooogggssss
