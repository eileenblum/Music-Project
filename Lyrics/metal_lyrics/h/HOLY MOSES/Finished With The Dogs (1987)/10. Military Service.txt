You'll be loosing your life everywhere
Who said to you that you are on a right mission
Why don't you think about it illusion takes you but how far

Your life is pain see it now
No hope for you, you are blind, you don't see what you have done
What do you want to control, the third world was becomes reality

You won't be a great soldier, you'll be dead
Why do you work so fucking hard, to achieve your soldiers ideals
As a soldier in this world, you are the losers for the reigns

Road Crew
Enade teim on de rout
Enode kraisi haus ti swat
Go and gat as sam mor buhs
Dount tall mi sad eim on de luhs

Sam mor wiski wan mor smouk
Gat raddi drams and weiers
Torn it ap ju viel de spiid
Luck aut wie blou off jur had

It s for de routcru wi rack al ouwer ju
Its vor de routkru nau wi gone dwrinck wis ju

Insa schou and kraisi kitz
Hatbangos wis bliiding iers
Gools ar waiting biseit de track
Ei sink ist o gutt teim tu fag

It s for de routcru wi rack al ouwer ju
Its vor de routkru nau wi gone dwrinck wis ju
