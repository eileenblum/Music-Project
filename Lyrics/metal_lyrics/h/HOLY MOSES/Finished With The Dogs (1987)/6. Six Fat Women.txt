Sun is burning on the sky - glowing sand, surfriding time
Sex lewd women, coming near, fast muddy navels standing high

On that prickley cactus there - two mosquitoes makin love in the heat
A man in sight his teeth are shining they kiss his heinie

Six fat women in the heat
Like living wracks it's a heap of meat

Roaring noise biting ears - dolly cries the sky's burning
Six fat froogys falling down the vulture's lost his eggs
