Revolution in their minds - could it be the end of time
Let the spirits guide the wind - coming for the kill
Won't live my ancestor - kill just like a tormentor
Death is in the atmosphere - we live in hate and fear

Against the world of death
Proclaim the end of wrath
Against the world of death
Feast the wings of death

This must be the final act - when I see the virgin's blood
I don't see the hand of god - it's the tune of sorrow
You have your inner throne - and that's your crown of death
You have nothing here to gain - term of confusion and pain
