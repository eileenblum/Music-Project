[Break 2x]
Waiting for the bestial death - in that bloody slaughterhouse
Bull's approaching feel his breath - blood's streaming out his mouth

[Break 4x]
Rough he takes me to the rack - his battle cry sounds in my ears
The axe is falling down my neck - nobody knows the feaaaaaaar
I will be reborn - to be free again.....

[Break]
The shamble becomes red in blood - raw meat was eaten up
Blood shreds this sacrifice - it was not a sign of gooooood

[Break]
I'm waking up in horror fright - I know I'll never win this fight
There's something hanging over me - the butcher's axe - no time to flee
I will be reborn - to be free again.......
Shuffle
You are the next victim - the blood I bleed was not in vain
The butcher company will come - to lead you to the slaughter
I will be reborn - to terminate my exercise
Minds are rolling down the streets - blood is dripping from the trees
