Waahhhhhaaaa

About a world so brave and wise - The rising sun sublime
After years back from the war - a new age of time
But they haven't learned a thing - the cold war's going on
It's an old nightmare of mine - the fight it can't be won

[Chorus]
Current of death (3x)

In their minds there is no right - they say my brain ain't right
Leaders, madness in their eyes - give orders to the blind
The fishes in a waves their swimming with the stream
I'm creeping in the desert, drowned in the sea

[Chorus]
Current of death [3x]

Peace and freedom everyday - humanity decays
Is god dead or has he gone - the devil is amazed
Sadness fear in any thoughts, you will die, no way out

They survived the hellish breath, to live on in the....

Current of death........

[Chorus]
Current of death [3x]
