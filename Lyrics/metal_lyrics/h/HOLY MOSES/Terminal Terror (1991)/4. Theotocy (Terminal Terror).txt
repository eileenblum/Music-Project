Require - the evil
When bad things will be
Defense your last idea
Which complete your cry
Crime - moral of god?
Forces into his mind
A power full of death
Power from him
Theotocy
Damnation of eternal hate
All you need theotocy pray
Central to isalm terror
Perfection - is morbid
When pain ends in pain
Describe your last mistake
Which concede your fear
Terror - the terminal way
Breaks into my world
Hear the study of evil
Suffer the ruined time
Damnation of eternal hate
All you need theotocy pray
