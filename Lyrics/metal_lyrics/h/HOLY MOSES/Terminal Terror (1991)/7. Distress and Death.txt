An endless open maze a never
Ending hope
Distress and death
For a nation of the earth kids in
Terrorism never wanted to be born
They have to suffer like
A living carcass
Distress and death
Battle between
The power words
Against their life nation
Without nation
Because of nameless ground
The prophecies chaos can't be
Closer of them
Distress of a dying
Age blood signs
Their coming way
To live or die it
Doesn't matter
Distress and death
Just meaningless
Recognize the words from the
Bible feeling the death behind
My TV without pain
Just see their eyes
And a stream of blood in their face
