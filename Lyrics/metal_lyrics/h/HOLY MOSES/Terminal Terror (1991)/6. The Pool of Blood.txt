You live in psychotic dreams
And time is here for us to act
Now before they try to burn us
Out in their mother love
The pool of blood
Strange new dimension
Of my never ending inner fight
I thought I changed the life I
Lived because it was
The life they gave to me
Mother-father-master
I start to understand
The strange new dimension
Of my never ending inner fight
The pool of blood
The earth
The life
The pain
The death
The bridge of adults the end
The dual substance of us reigns
The controversial line
I start to understand
The strange new dimension
Mother-father-master
Of my never ending inner fight
