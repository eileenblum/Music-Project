Bad moon
Aggression
Frustration
Tradition of fatality
Religious domain
In holy wars Christmas
For the business
And virgin white
For the bride
People who never
Doubt on their ideals
Words written in blood
Eyes of malevolence
No reactions
Of the ruling reigns
Suffocate the upcoming light
Of a new day
Untrue - the truth
Of my existence
Without sense
My words
Against lies
Indiscutable
The why for the
Iranian war
A tradition
Never made for
Invalidate
In respect - but try
To start by
Yourself
Examine
Which
Traditions already
Took possession
Of yourself
