You can't change the world
In this age you will ever
Be until your soul
You see in hell
If you could turn it
Around you
Destroy the things
You need running
Into a deeper void
You peel a dual
Mind in a never saw
Dimension it's hard
To make a choice
For those who see
The day in the time
You stand behind
Your body your
Rules are breaking
Down by searching
For the sunject in
Times of greed and
Blood a shadowill
Come inside in your heart
And thoughts unholy lies
Invocation
Distant mind
Unrevealed
Morbid souls
Deep in your mind
The human race
Malicious horror
In a new decade
It's hard to feel
That deal
Unleashed mind
Is like a game
Malicious horror
New decade
Exploitation in branded pain
