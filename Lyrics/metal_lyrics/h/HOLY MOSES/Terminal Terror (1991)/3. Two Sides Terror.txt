From the past came the death
Around you
Reflection of destruction
Human being as
A bastard son of god silence
Supports the end of paranoia
Terror invades my inspiration
Minds of timeless history
Disturbing my retake fear in
Request for the human immunity
They changed the meaning of expection
Characterize the predatory prime
Passed eternal
Misery to see the signs of misjudge
Consumed by incarnate
Murders where these of kinds of armies
The same in soul and spirit
Have clashed me in repose
