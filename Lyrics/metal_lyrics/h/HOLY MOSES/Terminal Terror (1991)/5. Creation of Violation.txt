Forgotten children
Persecuted from the time
Suffocated from the life
Entombed with the holy words
Empty in their hearts can you
Exist without
Love only in sorrow never saw
The sun of life
Creation of violation unborn
And dead creation of villation
Bury the moral of god curse of
Embryonic cells
No choice of live or death ravish
By parents deals
Incarnation with insane tears
Creation of villation
Captived by the adult laws
Their death executed
By the people of the right
