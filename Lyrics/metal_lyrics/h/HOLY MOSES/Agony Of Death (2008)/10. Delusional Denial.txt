Activation of symbols - to occur the story
Power of cognitions - it's not a fiction
Applications in my soul - trigger the picture
Possessed by bizarre - dreams of a bus

Glance of day - laid in fog - lost in mine
Glance of day - laid in fog - lost in time
Glance of day - laid in fog - lost in crime

Telling the truth - eaten by the machine
List of mundane facts - able to recognize

Catching my brain - into previous day
Observation in mind - hard to explain
Able to recognise - the whole absurdity

Glance of day - laid in fog - lost in mine
Glance of day - laid in fog - lost in time
Glance of day - laid in fog - lost in crime

Confabulation - memory disorder
Delusional denial - disturbance of time and sense
Suddenly stopped - Make me confused
Fragments of reality - After the machines war
Paralyzed on one side - My body didn't recognize
Disturbance in time sense - Disconnection to brain area

Hypnotised brains - somebody holds of it
I can't moving- my paralyzed hands
Perplexity of time - in the mechanism
