Now it's time to start a dream - mental kings in dark nights
Confront the power of forming - killing your problems of evil
Helpless soul to live or die - forced in lies of frozen ice
In your mind never before - weapons to kill painful soul
Helpless in your soul

Soon / Soon - I will raise - Sunrise return - ready to ride
feel the pain / Winds of hate
Sunrise return / enemies will die / You feel the pain
Soon / Soon - I will raise - Sunrise return - ready to ride

Now it's time to turn inside - exciting journey to ride
Turn into a beautiful mind - observation to face the death
Storming winds to hate you all - shining of clouds in rain
Personal smoke to reverse - believe in your giant dream

Now it's time to kill the fear - don't let your strength die
Kings of raven realm - rope your body by my side

Helpless in your soul - is killing all your hope
Imagination of lights - is riding in your night

Soon / Soon - I will raise - Sunrise return - ready to ride
Feel the pain / Winds of hate
Sunrise return / enemies will die / Feel the pain
Soon / Soon - I will raise - Sunrise return - ready to ride
You feel the pain
