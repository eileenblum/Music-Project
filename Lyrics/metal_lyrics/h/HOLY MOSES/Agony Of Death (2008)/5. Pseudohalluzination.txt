I am here alone in my hallucination
In infernal doom of the abyss
Cries of spiritual voice floating evil reign
Before my life is taken from the machine
To return to my mirror

Walking up in a dark snowing night
I see something that seems to come
Frozen dreams of a dying realm
As in a true hallucination
Hate rises no authorities
Consider this decision obscure
Disorder of my dreams with wide open eyes
I can see the cold machines domination
A dark image vivid enough to be
Floating the evil reign in my fear
Shadows of passed eternal years
Unreal damnation to kill my soul

Hallucination - machine is back
Hallucination - ripped by the dogs
Hallucination - world in chaos
Hallucination - terminal terror

Illusions occur when feelings arrives
And anxiety will disappear
My fear Is projected on external objects
Lightening the time when I was a child
Perceives threatening faces and monsters
In the dark shadows at night
I can see the machines killing arms
Like unholy goblins of dead trees
In the fog of my dreams I perceive
Inanimate holocaust objects
As the raw attacking enemy rites
They reach out and catching me

Hallucination - machine is back
Hallucination - ripped by the dogs
Hallucination - world in chaos
Hallucination - terminal terror

I am here alone in my hallucination
In infernal doom of the abyss
Cries of spiritual voice floating evil reign
Before my life is taken from the machine
To return to my mirror

If you find it's hard to believe
Take a step into the living lie
My passion it wants to control
Crystallized dimensions on nocturnal path
Enjoying by ripping the flesh from the bones
Memories passing blacker than darkness
And join my ceremonial circle of death
A diabolic sign in the clouds

Hallucination - machine is back
Hallucination - ripped by the dogs
Hallucination - world in chaos
Hallucination - terminal terror

Hallucination - machine is back
Hallucination - ripped by the dogs
Hallucination - world in chaos
Hallucination - terminal terror
