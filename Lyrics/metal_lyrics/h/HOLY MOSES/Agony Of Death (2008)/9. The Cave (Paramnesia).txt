Abnormality of memory, forgotten meaning of words
My illusions having expired before the machines events
And before the dogs are being expired for the first time.
Why the identity of my disorders is interesting for you?

In the cave I'm caving in - Darkness all around
In the cave I'm caving in - Struggled down for even more
In the cave I'm caving in - I'm creeping along the floor
In the cave I'm caving in - Imprisoned here for ever more

Reduplicative Paramnesia is my delusional belief
Our world has been duplicated and is living in the machine
Relocated to another site, syndromes of my brain injury
It's fractured my skull and damaged the soul of passion

In the cave I'm caving in - Darkness all around
In the cave I'm caving in - Struggled down for even more
In the cave I'm caving in - I'm creeping along the floor
In the cave I'm caving in - Imprisoned here for ever more

A distinct abnormality of orientation for my place
Admitted by my mind to build the illusory house of death
Arise by the machine's motivated denial of human illness
Forcing my hysterical reaction to close the return to home

Convulsive attack of the machine's crucial mechanism
Disrupted by the memory when I had finally realised
Pluralisation of myself when Mrs Greenwood arrives
Considerable evidence that my dream comes true

In the cave I'm caving in - Darkness all around
In the cave I'm caving in - Struggled down for even more
In the cave I'm caving in - I'm creeping along the floor
In the cave I'm caving in - Imprisoned here for ever more

In the cave I'm caving in - Darkness all around
In the cave I'm caving in - Struggled down for even more
In the cave I'm caving in - I'm creeping along the floor
In the cave I'm caving in - Imprisoned here for ever more
