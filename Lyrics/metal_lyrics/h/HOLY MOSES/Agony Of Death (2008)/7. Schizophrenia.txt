When we describe a spiritual dance
All things are chaos in our brains
Paranoid bizarre is our life
No single symptom rising in your soul
All disorder splitting here my earth
Increased by other empty existence
When your person is dying in the sun

Erase your pain - eyes of stone
Arise your life - March of visions in yourself
You kiss your gods - hordes of evil march
Destroy your torture hell - they must kill tonight

When we remain motionless
These are signs of hell catatonia
Splattered dark occur bizarre
An evil killing social distress
All times hearing all the voices
Absence of normal traits
When it includes chaotic speech

Erase your pain - eyes of stone
Arise your life - March of visions in yourself
You kiss your gods - hordes of evil march
Destroy your torture hell - they must kill tonight

Experience of abuse dark trauma
When it keeps killing our lives

Erase your pain - eyes of stone
Arise your life - March of visions in yourself
You kiss your gods - hordes of evil tonight

They must kill!
