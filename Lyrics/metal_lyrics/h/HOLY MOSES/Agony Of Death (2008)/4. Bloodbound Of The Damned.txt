Signed in blood to seal the pact
To face the tears of rain and thunder
What it means to me, I can feel inside
No trust in no one was my only rule
'till I found true passion in believing in you

Bloodbound of the damned
It's our fate, only we will decide
Bloodbound of the damned
It's our fate, together we will survive

I worked so hard to reach my ideal
Tomorrow we will rise, look around you
No one really cares, it's hard to believe
Together we will make it, against your lies
Oh yes, life is pain and they took what we gave

Bloodbound of the damned
It's our fate, only we will decide
Bloodbound of the damned
It's our fate, together we will survive

You don't know us, we'll fight for it
We will full fill your need and drill in your mind
The blood in our veins has a strong device
This passion you cannot control by yourself
We laugh 'bout your try to dominate our life

Bloodbound of the damned
It's our fate, only we will decide
Bloodbound of the damned
It's our fate, together we will survive

Bloodbound of the damned
It's our fate, only we will decide
Bloodbound of the damned
It's our fate, together we will survive
