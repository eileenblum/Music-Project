Periods of detachment from myself
Breakdown from my hellish memory
Extent interfering of my bodies functions
Disrupted from my inner feelings
Resulting from my head, looking for the dead
Physical dissertation of my surroundings
Experience of impaired recall of the past
Confusion in my actually personality

The blood I bleed - we are one
The blood I eat - we are two
The blood I see - we are more
The blood I feel - we are gone

Identity disorder of my own reality
Mental decompensation in my certain thoughts
State of temporary structural separation
Subconscious strategy for powerful splitting
Defensive mechanism to responds the hell
Likely to be a marker of Satans hand
Indicating that they possessed my mind
Weapons to kill over helming events

The blood I bleed - we are one
The blood I eat - we are two
The blood I see - we are more
The blood I feel - we are gone

The blood I bleed - we are one
The blood I eat - we are two
The blood I see - we are more
The blood I feel - we are gone
