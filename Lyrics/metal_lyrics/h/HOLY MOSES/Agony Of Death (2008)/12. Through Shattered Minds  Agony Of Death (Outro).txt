Don't look for a perfect living
Start your own new beginning
Storm clouds in your life are coming
With your painful souls and yearning
Find your reason to love your life
Cut black roses with your knife
The pain is burning like in hell
Before you will feel the spell again

Through Shattered Minds
Do you want to hear my cries?
Look deep into my eyes
Shattered existence
Through Shattered Minds
You are sinking deeper and deeper
If you loose your dreams and keeper
Shattered existence

Fighting flames what they are teaching
You can't reach, sweet loves preaching
From the white gods above their dying
Return to your evil messiah
You are the one who is living a lie
False hopes can't solve your demise
And all the matters in your mind
All your broken promises are wasting time

Through Shattered Minds
Do you want to hear my cries?
Look deep into my eyes
Shattered existence
Through Shattered Minds
You are sinking deeper and deeper
If you loose your dreams and keeper
Shattered existence

Raise your sword against your lies
Walk deep through your shattered minds
Believe in that better day, it is still in your hands
You are not alone in all confusion and pain

Through Shattered Minds
Do you want to hear my cries?
Look deep into my eyes
Shattered existence
Through Shattered Minds
You are sinking deeper and deeper
If you loose your dreams and keeper
Shattered existence

You are not alone in all your confusion and pain
Shattered existence!
