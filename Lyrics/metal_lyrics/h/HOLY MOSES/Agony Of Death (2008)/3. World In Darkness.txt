Buried beneath the holocaust of evil
They never awake from their eternal sleep
Deep dark clouds on their grave are gone now
Passing without opening the gate to immortality

Illusions of Pain - you keep killing me
Illusions of War - world in darkness
Illusions of Crime - you keep killing me
Illusions of War - world in darkness

Darker than all days before the act
Their enemies blood run cold to frost
Mind travelling into the darkest soul
Summoned by the call of destroying lies

Illusions of Pain - you keep killing me
Illusions of War - world in darkness
Illusions of Crime - you keep killing me
Illusions of War - world in darkness

Illusions of Pain - you keep killing me
Illusions of War - world in darkness
Illusions of Crime - you keep killing me
Illusions of War - world in darkness
