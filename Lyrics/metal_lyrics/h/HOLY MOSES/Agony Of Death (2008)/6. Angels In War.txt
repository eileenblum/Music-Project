I never loose my control - when peace has left insane
Please don't rewrite my history - because you can't know what it means to me
Imagine in your head - my screams unheard before
My gift of immortality - will buried deep beneath your soul
My fight until the death in hell

Bloody War - Angels are in War
Enough to bleed - You gonna die
Angels are in War
Holy War - Angels are in War
There's no escape - Sanctuary in sight

So call me up on the phone - away you'll take your pain
You played too hard this fuckin' game - too much stuff is in your brain
Test your ways princess of death - dog hypnotize your world of fools
My eyes on your back is your pain - forgotten evils across that burn
The return of the living dead

Bloody War - Angels are in War
Enough to bleed - You gonna die
Angels are in War
Holy War - Angels are in War
There's no escape - Sanctuary in sight

Creation of a dark winter night - the wolf is baying by your side
You can't torture me - by taking all my holy dreams
As you can hear my sinful cries - I kill you all one by one
When you had made your last mistake - my evil mask will laugh so loud

Bloody War - Angels are in War
Enough to bleed - You gonna die
Angels are in War
Holy War - Angels are in War
There's no escape - Sanctuary in sight

Bloody War - Angels are in War
Enough to bleed - You gonna die
Angels are in War
Holy War - Angels are in War
There's no escape - Sanctuary in sight
