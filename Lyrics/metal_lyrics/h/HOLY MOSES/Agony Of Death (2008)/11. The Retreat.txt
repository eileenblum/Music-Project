Deep in the hill of my island you will find it
Located in the deep forest of mental health
Providing opportunities for all individuals
To practise control over their own lives

Who is me - nobody knows
Who is you - that never shows
Who is us - that used to be?
Who is one - to set me free?

Exercise of real choice without Satan's hand
Without the limits for mental revolution
Forgetting fast life demands and machine's unrest
To keep my personal balance within my life

Who is me - nobody knows
Who is you - that never shows
Who is us - that used to be?
Who is one - to set me free?

Dreams are what keep us going
Even when our minds are dead
Dreams are what keep us growing
Even when our lives are dead
Your lives are dead!

Dreams are what keep us going
Even when our minds are dead
Dreams are what keep us growing
Even when our lives are dead

I feel the cold wind blowing deep into my dark soul
No killing engine humming down under here
The Bloodbound retreat gave me a new born brain
No one can take away and we ride to never land to die

Who is me - nobody knows
Who is you - that never shows
Who is us - that used to be?
Who is one - to set me free?
