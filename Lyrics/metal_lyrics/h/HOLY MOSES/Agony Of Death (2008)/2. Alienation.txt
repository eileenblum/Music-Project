How to detect it and what to do about it
Separation of things that belong together
Splitting apart from community, society and harmony
Antagonism with the machine

Alienation - Souls of shattered illusions
Alienation - Minds of destroyed harmony
Obedience in the machines world of death

Alienated from the film of human beings
Individual subject's estrangement from the world
We are just out to survive apart of the faculties and control
No emotions of my mind

Alienation - Souls of shattered illusions
Alienation - Minds of destroyed harmony
Alienation - Souls of shattered illusions
Alienation - Minds of destroyed harmony
Obedience in the machines world of death

Social defects let you die before you awaken
The domination decides your confusion and pain
No taste in yourself and your surrounding
You stand alone and waiting for no return

Alienation - Souls of shattered illusions
Alienation - Minds of destroyed harmony
Obedience in the machines world of death

In the wood I can see no trees.
The branches do not have the sheets
