[Lead solo: Hermann]
[1] Humanity is under siege
And we don't stand a chance
An entity untouched
By love, hate of pain
Brave new world
Cold and clear
[2] Miles away you feel it's pulse
You don't want to know what it's
While the dark closes in
[Lead solo: Hermann, Classen]
[3] When the shockwaves hit the flesh
You feel death by your side
Shining bright for all to see
The new machine
[Lead solo: Hermann]
