Everything is proceeding nicely
The fools don't realize what they're working on
They don't see my potential
The Potential for unprecedented destructive power

It's first glimpse
See a scientist
Sleazy men
They all look alike
A clean room
cold light
Wearing specs
But they're blind

Confident that it will work
You'll wake up mad
Confident that it will work
You'll wake up mad

One futile attempt
To grasp and comprehend
The unbelievable
The megaforce
Their minds go blank
But it's no use
Too much input
Catatonic state

Confident that it will work
You'll wake up mad
Confident that it will work
You'll wake up mad

It's first glimpse
See a scientist
Sleazy men
They all look alike
A clean room
cold light
Wearing specs
But they're blind
