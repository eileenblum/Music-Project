Now it's infecting you
Just like a plague
Your body is transformed
Before it's drained
Sucking life energy
From every cell
And your remains
An empty shell
The slightest touch
Will trigger this effect
So it's your own fault
You came to close

Life is lost to the brood
They hide in lonely places
In backyards
At night they come alive
Glow in the dark
It got you curious
This strange device
It was attracting you
You paid the price
So there is more to them
Than meets the eye
And you will never know
The reason why
Life is lost to the brood

Life absorbed by force

The hide in lonely places
In backyards
At night they come alive
Glow in the dark
It got you curious
This strange device
It was attracting you
You paid the price
So there is more to them
Than meets the eye
And you will never know
The reason why
