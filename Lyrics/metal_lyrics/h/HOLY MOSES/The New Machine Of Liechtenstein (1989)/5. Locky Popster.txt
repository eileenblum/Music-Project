A mummified voice behind the veil
A distant sound that still reminds me
Of churchbells mourning my success
I want to leave this world behind me
Feeling lonely and confused
I am losing my grip on reality
Can you see me I am sure you don't
My mind's protected from your sanity

Face of a jerk
Eyes of a jerk
Face of a jerk

Can't sleep at night or in the day
'Cos I created something dreadful
A juggernaut that haunts my dreams
Gave life to something that will end it all
Right now I am Drawn into the void
You see I am beyond redemption
This hybrid god that I called forth
It's a sin against creation

Face of a jerk
Eyes of a jerk
Face of a jerk

Can't sleep at night or in the day
'Cos I created something dreadful
A juggernaut that haunts my dreams
Gave life to something that will end it all
Right now I am Drawn into the void
You see I am beyond redemption
This hybrid god that I called forth
It's a sin against creation
