The darkness moves
Flickering lights
The faint impression that it's watching us
But are we safe
It might sneak past
The shattered windshield of this bus
A new machine
Has come to purge
The planet earth of human pest
It's evil force
Is irresistable
The lord of lies performs his final jest

The ghoul of time it's creeping lace
Is stretching fear to infinity
'Til sudden death
With childlike ease
Will free us fools from this insanity
Lost in the maze
Of this new continent
I see no reason to endure my wrath
The endless cave
That wreaks my mind
Rightful successor of the human race

Come take my hand
Unleash my soul
To let it sink into oblivion
'Cos more or less
I lost my faith
Ain't got the will to carry on
Lost in the maze
Of this new continent
I see no reason to endure my wrath
The endless cave
That wreaks my mind
Rightful successor of the human race

Come take my hand
Unleash my soul
To let it sink into oblivion
'Cos more or less
I lost my faith
Ain't got the will to carry on
