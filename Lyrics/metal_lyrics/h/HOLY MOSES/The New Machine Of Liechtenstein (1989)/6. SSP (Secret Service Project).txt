A blinding flash of light
A cry of pain and agony
People search for medicine
No sense in moving underground
Bodies burn and turn to ash
There's no cure to ease the pain
Shining bright for all to see
The new machine

SSP it's not nuclear
SSP it's bigger than before
SSp it's a power of another kind
SSP it's a giant of technology

It's a new kind of machine
impossible to stop
Made of living circuitry
It grows up more and more
It's skeleton keeps changing shape
Mad metal grinding bone
Raw energy runs through its veins
Expanding from the core

SSP it's not nuclear
SSP it's bigger than before
SSp it's a power of another kind
SSP it's a giant of technology

You've been in fear of missiles
You've been in fear of A-bombs
There's been no nuclear holocaust
But the new machine of Liechtenstein

A blinding flash of light
A cry of pain and agony
People search for medicine
No sense in moving underground
Bodies burn and turn to ash
There's no cure to ease the pain
Shining bright for all to see
The new machine
