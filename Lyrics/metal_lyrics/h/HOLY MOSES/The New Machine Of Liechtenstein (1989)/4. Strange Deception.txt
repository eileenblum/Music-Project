[1] He's got blood shot eyes
Skin like wax
He's malding them like clay
Twisting their souls
Aimed and giting deep
Voracious
Fragile minds
He rips them apart
He faints their conscience
We are more than just conditiened apes
He breakes the proud one's will
Now we've got the chance to break our chains
He stools their purpose
We are more so face the fucking truth
You're just machines
He's in service
Of something strange
Something untomed
That won't be denied
Reaping health
He stirs the crowd
Making them believe
His prophecy
[2] That's folic you've machines
Nothing but fucking machines
You can't be anything, but what you are
And that's a goddamned machines
You are a goddamned machines
He faints their ...
He's in service
You are machines
You've done if you don't get into it
