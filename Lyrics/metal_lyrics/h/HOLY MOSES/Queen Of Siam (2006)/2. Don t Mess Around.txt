The dark bar you know so well
Come in through the back door
One more night in red light
Year by year it will never change

Young girls and fat ladies
Too much make up in young faces
Which are already old
Cheap lipstick on the cigarette-tips

(Don't) mess around with the bitch
(Don't) mess around with the bitch

All night or short time
Smoke or simple fuck
Five men ten whiskey
Enough money for tonight

(Don't) mess around with the bitch
(Don't) mess around with the bitch

Hey baby are you clean - you don't smell good
Maybe one sin too much - you don't care if the money is right
Just some bitches in the night...

Hey girl you work with men
I call you a nasty bitch
Call her the way you want it
I call her just a dirty bitch
