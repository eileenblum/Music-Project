In a cold morning in the north of the world
Where the fields are black and dead
There's a storm of ice falling down from the stars
They're squeezing my brain 'til my thoughts are vanished

The queen of Siam won't die

With wings of iron - and eyes of fire
In infernal light - she gets higher and higher
The black gates of hell - in unsupport size
I'm weeping some tears - (they) creep out of my eyes

At the end of the world on a distant island
A lady in night - a gypsy in darkness
Gorgonic eyes will change my mind
Strange woman charms stone into blood

The queen of Siam won't die

With wings of iron - and eyes of fire
In infernal light - she gets higher and higher
The black gates of hell - in unsupport size
I'm weeping some tears - (they) creep out of my eyes

The queen of Siam won't die

Now you can still hear the cry
The life was only a lie
You ought to say her good-bye

Just take a look into her eyes - you'll see
Only heaven knows there is no refuse
She knows all the things you never saw
You're so close to me gypsy lady tell me why

The queen of Siam won't die
