Coming out of nowhere
Moving like a ghost
Look into black eyes
It's the one you love most

Devil's dancer - he's alive
Devil's dancer - he's alive

Take a lot of speed
Distant staring at your face
Playing with a devil's dancer
You know a wolf is on your trace

White horse in stardust
A whisper of the rainbow
You know you'll ride the tiger
The world shivers by a sudden blow

Black wizards on the way
The raven turns the spell
Take another life
And heaven turns to hell

Devil's dancer - he's alive
Devil's dancer - he's alive
