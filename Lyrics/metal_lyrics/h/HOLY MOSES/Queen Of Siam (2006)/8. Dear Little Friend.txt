First saw when I was fourteen
You didn't talk but you were so sweet
Two big brothers were always beside you
A happy family in harmony

We often met my friend
Hours of silence we touched your skin
You kissed sweet curls
You never made someone jealous

Dear little friends you had to go
Hours of fun you gave to me
Me and my friend we loved you so
No disease we had to see

So many places we visited
One dollar - you never asked for more
You were so brave of incredible strength
So slim but no one could kill you

Dear little friends you had to go
Hours of fun you gave to me
Me and my friend we loved you so
No disease we had to see

I tore you out but it was too late
Now you're sticky lying in the dust
No use to cry I need some help
I see your brother - same size pure latex

Dear little friends you had to go
Hours of fun you gave to me
Me and my friend we loved you so
No disease we had to see
