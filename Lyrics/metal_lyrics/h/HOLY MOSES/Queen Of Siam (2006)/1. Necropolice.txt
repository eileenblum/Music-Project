Rotten bodies tortured by shadows
Wicked air over lakes of blood
New-born children with plague-boils
Tearing out the eyes of their mothers

You call it sin he calls it life
You prayed to god but this is the beast
Beware of angels realize
The queen is called Babylon

Dead town dead town dead town dead town
They try to cry - cry out
But files crawl into their mouths
Rain of acid burns out their eyes
But they won't die in our town of hope
