Smokin' and drinkin' it's the law of my life
You don't know but that's the end of love
That's what know it's hard to cry
Don't you see your heart is driftin' like a stone

You perceive a chorus of eternal hate
One should know - never get the trust
It's the roar of life which never can return
So keep on rockin' and believe, feel no pain

And when you're down in hell
You hear the black old bell
You'll try to catch your head
The end of the lie is your dead

Slinky man was crying - storm torturin' rain and hail
There's a smell in my ocean which announces "I'm in hell"
You can hear the voices but you don't believe
It's getting colder know you see the frostflowers in your eyes
And when you're down in hell
You hear the black old bell
You'll try to catch your head
The end of the lie is your dead

If you would knew anything about it
You would believe that the only aim you have
Is to hate yourself
The real satisfaction you can only get
When the souls of all those creatures
Are destroyed by your won hands
Take the demon's eye and you'll see
That the end of your life is the beginning
Of the real end
The beginning of the end of time
You feel the timeless wave
It gets you now
