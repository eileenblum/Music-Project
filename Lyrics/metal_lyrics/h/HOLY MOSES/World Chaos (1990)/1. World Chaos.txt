All pissed of about the way people let things slide
A cancer of society, it makes up your mind
Cheers for freedom camouflage the hostage situation
Learn to think for yourself and survive depression

Don't believe what you see
Don't believe what you feel
Don't believe what you hear
Survive your fear
World chaos
World chaos

Welcome to the world of lies and corruption
Fallen rain from the sky leads us to destruction
Don't believe what you see
Don't believe what you feel
Don't believe what you hear
Survive your fear
World chaos
World chaos
World chaos
World chaos

Don't believe what you see
Don't believe what you feel
Don't believe what you hear
Survive your fear
World chaos
World chaos

Lessons you've been always taught, wrong thoughts in play
It's too late to change the past, see the dawn of day

Don't believe what you see
Don't believe what you feel
Don't believe what you hear
Survive your fear
World chaos
World chaos
