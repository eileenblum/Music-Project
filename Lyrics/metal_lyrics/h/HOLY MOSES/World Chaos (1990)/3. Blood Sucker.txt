Blood - Blood Sucker - You Wimp!
You always win, you never loose, never looking back
You're always looking for the right time to attack
You feel like a king, but you lost your mind
At the top, the need for more, it makes you blind

In this fucking game that you describe as life
There is you, the only one who will survive
Imprisoned for no crime, toyed with like a ball
They know you are waiting just to see them fall

Every fuckin' day, you want more and more
You're never satisfied with what you had before
There's so much talk about what's going on
When will you see that life full of hate is wrong

Day by day you make sure
You will get the most
On and on your fake friends
See you as a ghost
Why do you have that smile
On your fucking face
There will be a time these friends
Will crack your mask

Every fuckin' day, you want more and more
You're never satisfied with what you had before
There's so much talk about what's going on
When will you see that life full of hate is wrong

Blood - Blood Sucker - You Wimp!
You always win, you never loose, never looking back
You're always looking for the right time to attack
You feel like a king, but you lost your mind
At the top, the need for more, it makes you blind
