[music: Andy Klassen]
[words: Sabina Classen]

Dreams of hope hides all our sins
Winter's changes where it all begins
A false belief, that's not fair
Nature's gift, why are they there

I feel something I can't explain
It takes control and gives me pain
There are thoughts infesting my mind
Take a look and see what you find

Summer kills - Summer kills - Summer kills

Summer's heat cuts like a knife
Winter makes summer come alive
Firestorms tear the planet's soul
Human race near its final goal

I feel something I can't explain
It takes control and gives me pain
There are thoughts infesting my mind
Take a look and see what you find

I feel something I can't explain
It takes control and gives me pain
There are thoughts infesting my mind
Take a look and see what you find

Summer kills - Summer kills - Summer kills

Dreams of hope hides all our sins
Winter's changes where it all begins
A false belief, that's not fair
Nature's gift, why are they there
