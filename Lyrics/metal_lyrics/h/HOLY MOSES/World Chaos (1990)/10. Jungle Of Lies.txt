[words: Sabina Classen]

My life's one part of the bloody game
And they changed my fucking name
I'm running away but I'm still here
The human race living in my growing fear

Blinded by the jungle of lies
I can see it in your eyes
Blinded by the jungle of lies
Blinded by the jungle of lies

Burried deep by an ice cold soul
People in control with hearts of stone
We're chained and gagged, I see no way
Turn the wheel and break the goddamn chain

Blinded by the jungle of lies
I can see it in your eyes
Blinded by the jungle of lies
Blinded by the jungle of lies

I don't wanna steal your life long dream
Can't wipe away my terrible fear
You have to erase the fucking desire
Before we all die in the frozen fire

Blinded by the jungle of lies
I can see it in your eyes
Blinded by the jungle of lies
Blinded by the jungle of lies
