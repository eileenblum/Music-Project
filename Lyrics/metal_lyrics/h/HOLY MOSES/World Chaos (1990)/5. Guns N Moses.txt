Hua!
Fuck all the middle class!

Jumping up and down
Like a madhouse clown
She takes her chance
On the Guns n' Moses dance

She's his dream
Oh, it makes me scream
Her clothes look sad
And the rhythm drives her mad

You - fuck all the middle class
Hey you - should try to kick her ass

That's here easy way
She gets lucky today
She collects her prise
Gives them all a rise

Open your ears to the musical rain
When love can replace your pain
- Replace - your pain
- Love can replace - your pain
You - fuck all the middle class
Hey you - should try to kick her ass
