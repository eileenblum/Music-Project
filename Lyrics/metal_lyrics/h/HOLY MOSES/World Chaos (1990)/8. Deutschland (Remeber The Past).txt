[words: Sabina Classen]

There is no other fucking nation
With such a horror decoration
Victorious in the sport of pain
It's icon drove the world insane

Deutschland - Remember the past
You gave us death and war
Deutschland - Remember the past
Your soldier was a weapon's whore
Deutschland - Remember the past
You gave us death and war
Deutschland - Remember the past
When you are one nation once more

Hiding deep inside my head
Don't let it rise from the dead
The sun is shining on the silence
Don't loose it with renewed violence

Deutschland - Remember the past
You gave us death and war
Deutschland - Remember the past
Your soldier was a weapon's whore
Deutschland - Remember the past
You gave us death and war
Deutschland - Remember the past
When you are one nation once more

From the fear you feel inside
Free yourself and take pride
United nation's your desire
Don't make it a trial by fire
