AAAhhhhhh...........
After school they take the gun
No emotions since Vietnam
Millions involved in this case
Plastic blood runs down their face
Living under blind instruction
Our saviours from destruction
Permission to fire with a smile
Do they care if we live or die

Play - that you don't feel the pain
When the bullet hits your brain
Watch out - in this final maze
Bombs don't shape a peaceful race

A reign of fear for tomorrow
Broken bones for our sorrow
Hell on earth is their bloody deed
The fuckin' army is their need

Play - that you don't feel the pain
When the bullet hits your brain
Watch out - in this final maze
Bombs don't shape a peaceful race

Play - that you don't feel the pain
When the bullet hits your brain
Watch out - in this final maze
Bombs don't shape a peaceful race

After school they take the gun
No emotions since Vietnam
Millions involved in this case
Plastic blood runs down their face

Living under blind instruction
Our saviours from destruction
Permission to fire with a smile
Do they care if we live or die
