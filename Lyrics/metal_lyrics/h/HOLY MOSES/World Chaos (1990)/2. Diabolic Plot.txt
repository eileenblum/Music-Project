[words: Sabina Classen]

Jump in the fire
You have the desire
They bring you to the knees
Within your only dream - the sleeze
What do you feel
Is it all for real
The corporate hand of fate
Drives me full of hate

Pay - you pay to play
Play - you play to win
Win - you win the way
On the Strip today

Problems all around
A solution must be found
Do not get caught
In this diabolic plot
A strong will to win
A killer's drive within
But one way to act
Stabbing others in the back

Pay - you pay to play
Play - you play to win
Win - you win the way
On the Strip today
