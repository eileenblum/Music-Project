Come to me
let me smell your scent.
Iâve waited far too long
my bones are frail and fragile.
Take my heart
Iâve felt everything thatâs left to feel.
Take my eyes
Iâve seen everything worth to see.
Take my wooden mask of soul.
Take my ears
Iâve heard everything thatâs left to hear.
Take my mouth
Iâve said everything worth to say.
Take my wooden mask of soul
... to be free again.
