I inhaled the light 
of a thousand suns 
to become what Iâm 
predestined to be. 

Now I gaze at the blackened skyline 
shrouding my longing for freedom 
while I stand in awe of the void 
cemented by so called free men. 

A foot in my own grave. 
My head held high. 
Iâll try to break these chains â 
this is my goodbye. 

Grey structures, 
both shelter and the poison in my veins. 
Will we disrupt this culture? 
They say seasons change. 
They say seasons change.
