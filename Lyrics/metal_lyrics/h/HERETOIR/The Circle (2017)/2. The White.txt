Rise slowly 
from mother earths arms 
while your golden lights 
let me drown in an ocean of beauty. 
Taken away 
from this warm and everlasting white 
and thrown into 
a world of impermanence and hate. 
Striving to find a home 
a purpose 
until I become part of you 
part of you. 

Illuminate...
