Overgrown ruins in my heart. 
I behold the reign of greed 
torn apart... 
there is no forever 
there is no forever. 

Hush now, donât say a word 
Iâll be your saviour 
in the night so cold. 
Embrace you 
at the far off shore 
when the curtain falls. 

But I listened into the darkness 
and beyond is nothing, nothing more 
through eternal night. 

Now I stand alone 
in dust and past 
and devour myself. 
Weâre apart 
whirling and torn. 
Weâre apart 
whirling and torn.
