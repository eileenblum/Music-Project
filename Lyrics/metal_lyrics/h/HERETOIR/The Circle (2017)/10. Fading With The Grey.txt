Iâve heard the cry 
of a dying sun 
fading with the grey 
resembling a last goodbye 
to a better yesterday. 

Just give me hope 
give me truth 
give me love 
and give me life 
in all the colourless nights. 

When lights fall 
collapse from high above 
you and me 
will be fading with the grey. 

I am the white 
I am the black 
I am the grey 
I am void 
yet I am everything... 

Under a hopeless sky 
yearning for answers 
but the void remains cold. 

Numbness 
shattered glass 
pieces of my past 
fading with the grey.
