Undertones of horror Are in the ring of freedom 
Turn down the television And listen for the hungry army 
With a hand to feed them don`t ignore the power 
Of ignorance All the names were changed 
Uniforms exchanged Still dressed to kill 
Because the intent is still the same 
And has been all this while 
Lying under a pile Of lye coated children 
All wearing big smiles They`ve been strip-mauled 
And hauled From their o`hallowed halls 
All classes dismissed Any risk of infection 
Now we all learn From our imperfections 
Now we all burn in our own hell 
But theres no division All you parents Run and scream 
`NO!` Please don`t let it go to Our children 
But they only heard the word `NO!` 
When they needed your undivided attention 
While you were so busy Out funding ethnic cleansing 
Why are you so fucking stupid? Y
ou can`t wash your hands to kill infection
Let the schools burn 
And end this quarentine 
All you parents and teachers 
You`re fired!
