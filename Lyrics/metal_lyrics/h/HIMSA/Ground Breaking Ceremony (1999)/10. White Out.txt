Oh great spirit 
Of resistance 
Help us through this 
Time of turbulent 
Wind coniditions 
Keep our vision pure 
Protect is from this cold hard surface 
And this violent squall 
So we can all find our way 
Back to where we started our family 
Please keep our aggressors at bay 
And our allies near 
Make clear skies before the gray in the name of tradition 
The generations before us 
Have had their own distrust 
In the face of fear 
They felt cold 
Just like we do 
So what? 
So what do we do?
