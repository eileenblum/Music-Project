Daunting colossus eve 
The door opens, expiration 
Hand fed cyclical rotation 
Package pretty invitation 
Appease the retched spiral nation 
Glass reflecting 
Image pending What does this mean 
Hallowed be they name 
Spell this out for the lights 
Blinding me the same thing you love Kills you 
Now we are all one 
One in the same Hole, we fell
For the home coming 
Now we look at ourselves 
Look at our ways 
Look at our waste 
And count down the days 
Left to die in our shells 
We`re gutted and cleaned 
Our hair is just perfect DNA in our cells 
The blood in our veins is real Inhumane 
Slaves to ourselves 
The image we made Of God 
We gave it all power 
To make us repent 
On our knees 
All bets and all theories are off 
No repreive 
No double 
No nothing 
Nothing left 
And nothing less
Then all we`ve been 
Stripped for all we`re worth
Gambled on a pale horse 
And we lost 
Our image of God is a dead one 
This can`t be happening 
Right now the date is here 
We are not ready 
When the stars begin to turn red 
We`ll run and hide
