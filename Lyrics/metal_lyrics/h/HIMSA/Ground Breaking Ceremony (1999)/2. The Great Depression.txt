How misunderstood and unsatisfied can you possibly get 
Negative space - Man what a concept 
Is this still life 
Well let's see the spoon is empty the bowl is empty 
the glass half empty and you are totally full of shit 
How contrived You cried "wolf" now the monkey shines 
And the muses are laughing at your art of living 
It's damn insulting to those who don't have a choice about starving to death 
When the mind is empty the mouth is always screaming 
My soul is empty and my heart is screaming, feed me. 
Now that sounds romantic - oh how romantic 
Oh how brillant How sad How fucking lonely 
You are your only friend 
You are your own worst enemy
No one is going to hurt you 
You do that better yourself 
No one is going to desert you 
You do that yourself 
You are the best so better yourself
