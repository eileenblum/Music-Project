`m open for your arms 
Present in your arms 
In the company of your arms 
I surrender to arms connected to all living things 
Each mindful breath brings me closer 
Raise my heart and sing 
Gala Jai Ma Gala Jai 
Take from me all that is unclean 
Ma! Ma! 
I only live If I let you live
I only feel If I let you speak 
through me I`m the heavens 
you want to touch me I
`m the fire in your bellies 
I am earth you want to dig me 
I`m your water you need me 
I am flesh you don`t need me 
but you sink your teeth into me 
I am earth if you dig me 
You can`t stand your feet without me 
I`m the heavens no one can see me 
I am fire you abused me
I`m the earth you`ve scarred for money 
I`m your mother 
I made love for you and you just fucked me 
Mother fucker 
My love, my blood is clean burning fuel 
My skin will tremble at your touch 
I will erupt for you I will get you off me 
When I skin myself alive 
I will survive
