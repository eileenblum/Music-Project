It's the end
Of our beginning
I've forgotten
Who you really are
I've forgotten
Who I really am
I haven't got time
For what you feel
No I haven't got time
For what you feel
And you do it again
How do I find her
When there's nothing left
And you do it again
I've spent a lifetime
of covering up
