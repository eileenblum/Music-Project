Youâll never haul the heat to the bite of the grind
To emulate
Digression has left this hard to swallow
Sour notes of dissolution
Played off as dissonance
To make believe
Its attraction

Appearance is violating
Scare tactics an all time low
As an art of seduction is extolled

Incinerate
The harvest
Infernal
Burn them out

The sleaze will hide behind evils device

Insensitive conviction
That seeks shelter in parody
Harlot lips will stick with exaggeration
Social armor but a reason to lie
Calling loud for the crutch of acceptance
Just to make the soundtrack more inviting

No more empathy
Fire away
Fire Away

Smoke never clears
The downfall in its blaze of glory
Alter
Moral crux uncover the real decadence

Censor resistance
Censor resistance
Now
Now
Now
Censor resistance
Censor resistance

Smoke never clears
The downfall in its blaze of glory
Alter
Moral crux uncover the real decadence

Domination
The sleaze will hide behind evils device

Disregard the purchase of faith
But donât dare to be defiant
Disregard the solicitation that reinvents contempt

Incinerate
The harvest
Infernal
Burn them out

Smoke never clears
The downfall in its blaze of glory
Alter
Moral crux uncover the real decadence
