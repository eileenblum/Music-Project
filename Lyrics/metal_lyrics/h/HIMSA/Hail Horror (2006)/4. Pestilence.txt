Semblance at auction
The belly of the beast
Target implied
From tooth and nail deployment

Institution of youth culture
From a nation
Self contained

Strategy of dictation
Read and refined
Calculations come full circle
So move away from the light

Live and learn
The value of vice
Pestilence
Youâre all afflicted

Live and learn
The value of vice

It owns you
Like it owns the new dawns
And changelings
Never stop changing

Itâs sole purpose for power
Itâs sole purpose for power

Addiction is cunning
So bite the hand that feeds
The want is calling
Mutinying imagery

There is no answer
There is no answer
For the living dead

Possessing privilege
From the law laid down
Itâs all been said before

Byproduct for ethos and slogan
Create and consume
And then run like thieves

Live and learn
The value of vice
Pestilence
Youâre all afflicted

Live and learn
The value of vice
Pestilence
Youâre all afflicted

Itâs all been said before
Itâs all been said before

Turn out the light
Itâs striking
