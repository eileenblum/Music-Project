Flawless
So red raw and real
The beast of the street
Speaks faceless to me

Fierce
The deepest of depths
Sends daggers and fire
From each sharing end

Summons
Outcry for battle
A living illusion
Straight to the heart

I enter sanctuary
They bury the dead

Makes way
For pain and promise
Dawning devotion
Numbing all in dismay

Stands alone

Lash out
Strength in submission
Giving to exploits
A swift sudden death

Swarming
Hybrids of exile
Outlaws in anthem
Sketched in even script

Screams clean
Sincerity
To break the crisis
Of a vacant past

Words of wisdom
Words as weapons

Destroyer
Youâre course remains unscathed

Destroyer
Youâre course remains unscathed

I enter sanctuary
They bury the dead

As the abyss
Is filled
And forgotten

Conviction
The sign of its times
Translates the quarrel with no objection
And issued
Sarcasm and war
To this distant boy
With more desperate needs

My commune
Safe haven
Secures my temperament
And in retrospect
I prevailed with the ones who saved my life

Destroyer
Youâre course remains unscathed

Destroyer
Youâre course is unscathed

Stand alone
