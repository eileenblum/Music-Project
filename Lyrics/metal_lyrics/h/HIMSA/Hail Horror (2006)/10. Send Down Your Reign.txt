Obey them
The legion speaks out
Carnal realm will not seize

For rewards in pain
Will make its price so eloquent

Incur
Bare witness
Be torn to shreds within these walls

Tyrannize
Elite breed perversity
Formal with hearts on sleeves
Bloodhounds for the thrashing
Made hell-bent and hammered down

Mortified
At the mention of mercy
Assault on dignity is grievous
It's hook
Takes threshold subjected to paralysis

Incur
Bare witness
Be torn to shreds within these walls
Forsaken strangers
Your domain will drain all confidence

On the vow
On the oath
On the realm
Send down your reign

On the vow
On the oath
On the realm
Send down your reign
In sanctions

Lie and thrive

Vehemence
So valiantly vivid
Preying on pretension
Crossed out
To whispers of the crying innocence

Docile
For salvation
Under watchful eye
For repentance
In sanctity
For subjects in their horror show

Send down your reign
Send down your reign

Seal insurrection
Seal insurrection
In sanctions

Union
The code of silence for theory
Pigs are prepared for the spit
A renewed dispute
Clandestine in its origin

Excursion
Neither seen nor heard
Protectors of inner feuds

Exalted
In instinct
And answer to the nemesis

On the vow
On the oath
On the realm
Send down your reign

On the vow
On the oath
On the realm
Send down your reign

Ignore the warnings
Ignore the warnings
