Another whole of nothing
Fit to size
Based on shattered
Bit by shallow
Jump the chance to prove them wrong

Always passing the infinite
With inquisition
Itâs never me
Itâs never me
Itâs never no one
Let it hover
Let it hang like a hex

Among the skeptics and schism
Itâs the hope heartfelt
Scandal
Take flight on the winds of escapades

Wither
Inward
From the alluring stray

The bull of kinship
Propelled by the whip
Sinister
A stern mystique
Wise blood
To black lung
Itâs undying love
Is the heart of this machine

Wither
Inward

The road of corrosion
Unruly
To solitary existence

Suffer
Again

Canât turn back
Lost time
Canât turn back
Lost life
Canât turn back
Lost life

What did they do?
What did they do to deserve this?

What did they do?
What did they do to deserve this?

Conclusion revealing
Each passing wait
Choosing battles
Who lose in culmination
Iâm not the adversary
But I am guilty
Outpouring in ordinary
See all sides but disagree

The road is corroded
With solitary confinement

Wither
Inward

The dust will settle
Once and for all
