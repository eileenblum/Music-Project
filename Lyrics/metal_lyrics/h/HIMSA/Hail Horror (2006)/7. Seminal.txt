Defy
The rumors to whispers
That makes a crass man bound

Defy
Their break in mercy
To consume the myth through flawlessness

Itâs been discovered
What theyâve exposed
Harbors the failures
To what we own
And they comply
To justify
Those shifting winds of conformity

This is a make or break elation
A razor to writs slit recovery
The struggle to botch
Impulsive structure from a slow-handed conspiracy
It Bears to all exploitation
Empowered but uncovered

Seminal
Seminal

Near and dear to our hearts desire
Inception to reign with havoc fist
Call the bluff
On smoking guns
When first loves turn fatality

Defend
Lifeâs note and fact
The tension to tame the iconoclast
Defend
Lifeâs torn out pages
And reverse their sands in the hourglass

Bury the hatchet in the name of progression
Theyâre living on their knees
We walk the line
Stripped and severed
While kindred thoughts build unbearable

Seminal
Seminal

Near and dear to our hearts desire
Inception to reign with havoc fist
Call the bluff
On smoking guns
When first loves turn fatality

Out of step or out of reach
Rapture for the fallen
A piece of them is a part of me
But their voices are left unheard

They never scream
They never starve
They never bleed
They never suffer
And they will never ever understand

Deceive
Those jubilant whores
With the delicate sense in delivery

Deceive
The crashing bores
Whoâve left us hung out to dry and die

Part the seas
And pave your way
To the sirens of new noise
Let the lace be the bait
As the past as the past portrays
While you leave the enemy entertained

Weâll always scream
Weâll always starve
Seminal
Always bleed
Always suffer
We are the sentiment
For we were raised in the shadows
