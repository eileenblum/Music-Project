This is fallacy bled through the lines of secrecy
Born again misfortune skirts the edge of sanity
Bound in contrasts to contradict the depths of violence
So tightly knit drink deep from the marrow of life
But be cautious for what is wished
Locked away from curious minds who seek your death
Guilt and pleasure molds the crimes that fit their deaths
Locked away from curious minds who devour 
The testimony to ignite the legacy

A cancer in the heat of the night prey so faint and still 
Hollow hallowed silence pried behind such screaming winds 
From madness to mayhem so torrent and merciless 
The terror will ring sky high when my blade comes down with spite

When midnight breaks
It's time to strike - It's time to strike

I will strike with malice amiss this vast darkness
And calm this better crave to kill

This is a warning
You felt my warning
Demoralized desensitized condemned 

I am damned
