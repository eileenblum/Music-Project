Carve the eyes out of our heads and slash our tongues if we scream
Throw the noose around the necks of the kin who sew and seek 
For we are distant and too far fetched from the themes of unrest
Diverse in resistance - revamped in defying threat

Its nights like this that keep us alive
They shed our skin by the host of salvation
By the skin of my teeth retributions made serene 

We never wanted it to be like this 
We never wanted sympathy

Those eyes like knives throw a soiled glance of suicide
This torrid struggle is carnage to their fear

Master to servant gagged by tourniquet
Save your breath and savor this moment
For the oath of onslaught in spitting vile
Brings a pompous death to your throne

Its nights like this that keep us alive
