Yearning for the crass in dusk to fall 
I can feel the pulse of a temptress stare
It begs seduction coiled curse a spark of severance
Trite reflection in sacred enlightenment 
Cold divinity is choking and tears at flesh
We scream to breathe - fight for confinement

So live and let die - loveless and goodbye

Deaden the bright of blue eyes and red skies
That captures this deep disturbance
Discovering the destruction of true enemies
Within our selves lay dormant with accusation
In the comfort of self indulgence 
Scratch the itch that spells disaster
To shed the praise in righteousness

Carry this message of confession 
To the addict who still suffers 
With so much to hide and nothing to offer

In this covert glass house of deviance and sympathy
We destroy refuge - we destroy everything
So how will we sleep tonight

Welcome the remedy dead ends of bitter reality
A common count for a sadist and a queen
Embellished devotion hexed from worship
Staggers the relevance of tyranny
Shards from whispers and insight 
Split the clean slate of sanctuary
Subtle overture invades space 
Imposing restrained desire
Infesting each mistake to
Suspend all discipline
They fight for air 
We run for cover

So make me your fledgling and lay me down
