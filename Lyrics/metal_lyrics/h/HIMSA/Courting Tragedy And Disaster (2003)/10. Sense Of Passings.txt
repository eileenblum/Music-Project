Perception brought wisps of irreverence
Lasting days beyond understanding
The stain of grief in stretched emotion
Flaunts the hangings of distant loves

Exit healing - closure's chemistry
Flows like a violent rain to flood
The unresponsive calm - motionless
A bed of nails for me to lay 
Breaks the numb progressive sense 
In losing one to (my) death's arrogance

Half closed slits from razor's cold kiss
Marks remembrance of downward spirals
Seals memory in endless reversals
And holds sincerity in every sentimental scar

Raveled rotations leaves grievous discharge
Idle appease to final descent inflicts the 
Morbid state of purgatorial asylum

Exploit the somber
Obey disorder
Inject evasion 
And embody servility

(I've lost all feeling - I've lost all control)

Symbolic extractions sentenced in struggle
Joins the stillness of isolation
Forged through anguish

Fuck this pain away
