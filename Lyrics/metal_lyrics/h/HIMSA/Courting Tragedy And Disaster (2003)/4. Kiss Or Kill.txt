Kiss or kill at fallen will
Her dark embrace of sorrow spills
Heed the heart at bent knee
Screams farewell from deep beneath
Hate and hide through outside eyes
Craves the ache of our demise
A slower death - subsiding sting
Hush the tones of searing peace
Let it seep in this divine suffocation
She took my breath away
You held perfection
Wrapped in persuasion 

My fallen angel of darkened bliss
The luminous stare of innocence
Reopen the wounds of forbidden loss
Your cathartic mystery cut me twice as hard
Those poisoned lips of tenderness ployed
Pierced through to kill me twice as hard
The warmth of desire
So transcendent and dangerous
When the risk of romance is hopeless
So fucking hopeless

Your presence lingers 
And keeps a sadness in this smile
Each captured moment now lies face down

Sweetness I keep my fingers crossed
As I lay and wait
Lovingly by your side
For one last caress
