Unleashed - he will unleash with brutal backlash
That holds my bane and beauty
I'll grant him vengeance to render them powerless
Punish me bitter battle of bottled beasts
So sick and deranged masochistic masked indifference
Half-hearted possession laden in sate and loathing
Show no mercy to bring them to their knees

Hunt them down

Ignore the sounds of sirens and screams 
Move in for the kill
A cunt and a cutthroat designed in scathing pain
He'll tempt and he'll torment until they fall from grace
Seek and destroy his prey on display

Make you suffer those prayers are never answered
Fiction found fatal skipped straight to tragedy
Stalk and strangle - serenade my inner beast
Seduce this savage and send virtue straight to hell

This pounding turmoil of sadistic egotism 
Is the face of a stranger close to home
And he awakes attached to the anchor
Of impatience and self denial 

He'll come alive
I'll come alive
