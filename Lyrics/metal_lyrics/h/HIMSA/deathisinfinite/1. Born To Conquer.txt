Conceal or reveal, curiosity kills again conversation stained and twisted
I am left suspended held so high, hands bound so tight
Impale me and bleed me bare throw my image in
I am the suspect and the target so let this duel begin
Crucifixion, annihilation motives of idle hands to cut me down to size

I stand defined, arisen and reborn shallowless in every form
I stand accused and victimized but mark my words vengeance will be mine
A martyr dethroned, left to suffer in a hell I can call my own
Wide eyed assumption makes prediction an everlasting scar feel the fear I feel you scarred me for life
Crucifixion annihilation and those idle hands I cut down to size bitter sweet revenge
