Callousness is like shattered glass and like shattered dreams on the floor
Depression sets in to devour all hope and makes you scream for more
Where did you go wrong last chance to get it right
Leave behind a severed soul in the mists of where we part
Leave remains of torrid love and the stench of broken hearts
And it is calling, it is haunting you It is killing you, it is killing me

Heart is crushed with a touch of lust the death of love will reign like blood
Kill the beast and bury your seed a breath of death is all you need
I cannot feel her anymore you know I would love to hate you
And this is my fight for life I refuse to submit
