Focus on dead color new found glory made blasphemy force fed until we are blue in the face
Father in vain keep watchful eye on we the young and the useless
For our blood boils with rage expressed in violent cries of mutiny
Overkill all is lost angel, angel down we will go stepping stones and split wrists
A revolving door of opportunity vital for our survival hold your breath anchored to all that is sacred and holy

And it makes me fucking sick to see how well behaved you all can be
Kill the worth, kill all feeling a facade to conquer and sell your fear
Kill the heart an unconcious death is the fate and fall of all living mortals
Because we are doomed the faith would not set you free
