strident affect with a seer to the throne
first take at the summer, cold sweat stands distressed with dark clouds gather
run them wild, pacing lengths to the flame of the fire
scorched contenders tease the fate of the tempest times
habitual horror trials of sanity
the savoring soul will scream for sovereignty
sanctions for the streets altered states for keeps
crucifiers seek poise with omission in the trade of hives
youngbloods bound to sway the horde
collateral damage drawn aroused on the victims swell
with hooks as hands to downcast rage
dare for havoc in the deadlock ruse
composure from damnation
masochism in a vortex consolation void
chamber of redemption or infirmary
with scars on layers, scabs as warriors
labeled terror labeled honor
cutthroats loose in the eye of their persuasive kill
with hooks as hands
cutthroats loose in the lust of the foreseeable future
with hooks as hands
hold the roar
