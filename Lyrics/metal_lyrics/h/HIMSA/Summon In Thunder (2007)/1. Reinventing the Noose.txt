translation is a loss when the casualties are patterned
with skilling treatment in manics so far removed
co-ordinating symptom is the echo of agony
abuse the flesh to trigger disgust
reinventing the noose whip of loyal lies
live it one at a time, live it one at a time, loathe it all the time
idle asylum ache splinters grace
escape bleeds out recovery
a seep in supply replaced wholeheartedly in a missing link of loss
complexity is hanging high to stimulate withdrawl
society's transparency will pick at collective thaw
everything is a disappointment in theory with sympathy as therapy
feel formal; feel forsaken
forecasting must secure in the cult of industry
when extreme compulsions crowned to revise a score
devoid of emotion with a hex on the wish
hardships will always benefit on choking from the role
