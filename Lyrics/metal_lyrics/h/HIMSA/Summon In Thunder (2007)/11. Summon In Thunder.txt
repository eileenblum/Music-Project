divine wind carries the care of creation's hum
to live in punishment
a prosthetic arrogance-bewildered infinite
wrath will touch thee when times strike trails
left hand path beneath still waters so
summon in thunder - howling down in vain
dear departed flee the site slagged - damned
run for the hills despite the cold neglect, my daunting
depraving in a land of plenty
thriving off the zealous degenerate
glutton summon your prospect of irony
system overload spearheading the scamp
I, tormentor, will the crashing derelict
