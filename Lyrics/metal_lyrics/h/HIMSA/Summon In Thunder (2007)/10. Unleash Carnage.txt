all out violence from creators within
and a cleansing slate rehearsed to inflect
dehumanized ambition for keeping safe
fierce rejectors behest of the voices
evaluate the value of living without being alive
prevailing atomic outcast
blacklisted from their social sifting law to protect
discarded catalyst
a cutthroat in the making to unleash carnage
escaping the fate
forging inspiration in the knife to isolate
silver linings silver settings
enticed from salutations and the siren noise
every enemy is an antidote
