hey, leave me be to torch the skies and your constellations
banned disaster new era chillings my
dramatics are anthems
weaved covertly in surprise hint to reveal
beyond collapsing a sonnets blur by the cons
doom ridden, the light is out
paralyzed by negatives sworn
dead lethal, distance myself
I've found my place to turn
big timber against you all
I've given my certainty in ritual insight
noble stabbings, brokedown and busted
never open me up, but I think I'll stay awhile
