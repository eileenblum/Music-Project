tarnish the crowns, stone them judge and jury
upon the swerves reclaimed in slaved simplistics
refuse and render, defuse and repel
refuse the rue and force a panic in the creed
or devour the virus, suckle the seed, remain slayed
attached to an evil that bares the name
this is subversion - this is humanities coup
this symptomatic, rushed to certain demise, for us all
refuse the refuge, refuse reform
provoking tyrants - send the indictment to the realm
delivered chaos, catharsis but keen, deem defeatist
they are an evil that bares the face
institution of dealing demand, fundamentals for
indoctrination, spineless force to lure the sect and induce
elimination - let it loose, they'll tear from this
ruin them - can't deny the scorned
unveiled brutality - spine its axis
shift to avow an infestation
ground breaking appeasement - to the failed achievement
corruption is protection - so collapse their excess
