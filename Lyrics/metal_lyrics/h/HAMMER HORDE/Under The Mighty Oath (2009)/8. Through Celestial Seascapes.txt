In the wake of battle past mountain and plain
Many lands have come and gone
In a storm of blood and rage
Brave warriors clashing with power of the blade
In an age where iron reigns

Long ships now sail at night
Ancient stars be our guide
Our swords are gathered for battle
To crush without fear
On rivers cold and deep
Through mist and pale moonlight
Ten ships, towards another raid

In the wake of battle past mountain and plain
Many lands have come and gone
In a storm of blood and rage
Brave warriors clashing with power of the blade
In an age where iron reigns

Our northern blood prevails through the night

Enemies shall scream in pain
And burn by flash of fire
By spear and axe they'll meet their fate
Boundless age of Yggrasil
Such is our strenght to win
From glen to glen, great war-cries shall begin

As nameless bodies rest without life
Taken by Valfather
For all time sentenced and forgotten
Shame and defeat be thy name

Denied their faith
All sacrifices have been namde
Death has set thy spirits free

I have sworn an oath to my gods
For great victory
At dusk we strike and conquer

In the wake of battle past mountain and plain
Many lands have come and gone
In a storm of blood and rage
Brave warriors clashing with power of the blade
In an age where iron reigns

The axe strikes deep
Torn asunder, a warriors bane
Thy promise has kept us strong
All-fathers of gods and men

Onward to slaughter, carried by water
Non-believers have been denied
Scorched by fire
End their lives with the torches in the night
Northmen ravage foreign isles
Far and wide by the stars in the sky
Through celestial landscapes we have travelled
