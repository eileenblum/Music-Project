To the fields where the blood of men flows
Lighting strikes as swords sail and heads roll
Many have fallen by the strength of my blade
My rage is undying and my birth-right unclaimed

Battles fought, under the mighty oath
Hammers high
Kingdoms fall by our sword
We praise the gods

Through the forest, to the village, to their homes
None shall stop us in pursuit of the throne

Adorned in armor and blessed with a bear's rage
Blood bound by the oath

By bloodshed and sacrifice made
Beside my brothers on a pagan crusade
Standing on this newly claimed land
Paved with our enemies, won by our hand

Battles fought, under the mighty oath
Hammers high
Kingdoms fall by our sword
We praise the gods

To fatherland with glory and gold
Longships set sail as winds blow
For ages these deeds shall be told
Hail to warriors, mighty and bold

Kill without a conscience
Such is our oath

Kill without a conscience
Such is our oath
