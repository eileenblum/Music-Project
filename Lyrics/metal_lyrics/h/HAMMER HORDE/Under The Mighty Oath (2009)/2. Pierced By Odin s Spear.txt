Northmen draw neigh, by torches
And steel they fight
Blessed by Tyr
Oath of the hammer, void of fear
Odin's Ravens guide my way

To one-eyed god, our legions
Dedicate their blade
To meet Odin where brave warriors
Hail a golden fate
Till then I'll rip my enemies asunder
Banished to Hel is the fate for all cowards

On battlefields northern dragons never yield
Whilst they fight
To foreign shores, cowards flee
And fires roar at night
By Thor's hammer it's their time to die
In their heart of war my kinsmen roar,
"If I must die, I'm ready!"

Our weapons shred their flesh
And severed limbs shall fall
A glorious sight to my eyes
The weaklings scream and
Their women cry for mercy
Fight together, uphold our creed

Throw the altar into the water
Slavery and Bloodshed, no man goes free

Many moons have passed, our iron stained by battle
Greatly satisfied we aare
Countless lands have been torn
And scorched by fire
Hail the gods! For our victories!

Throw the altar into the water 
Slavery and bloodshed, no man goes free

Northern draw neigh, by torches
And steel they fight
Blessed by Tyr 
Oath of the hammer, void of fear
Odin's ravens guide my way

To one-eyed god, our legions
Dedicate their blade
Hail to the Spear, under one eye's mighty will
All kneel, lord of spear
