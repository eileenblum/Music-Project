Heathen rage within my blood feels never ending
Conquest has spread to the home of the weaklings
All who stood before me died, and they grant me 
Glorious battle, 
Ages will know my name, war-torn, men fall
Fates met in defeat, with the sound of Steel comes judgement
Norns weave my fate and Blades carve my wounds Today my death will bring Me to Heimdall,
I hear howlings behind Bifrost Ancestors call me,
Bloodline of ancient pride 
Valkyries ride to take me to Asgard where gods reside

Hail to the fallen ones
We raise our call to honor thy songs
Faith and glory is our right
With ancient guidance we die with pride

Lord of sky fortress, I approach Heimdall
God of sleepless nights, hearer of leaf-fall 
Thousand miles and the future fills your vision
I hear howlings beyond Bifrost
Brothers call me from Midgard, raise pints up high
In drink and feast they honor me
'Till in battle their fate is to die

Hail to the fallen ones
We raise our call to honor thy sons
Faith and glory is our right
With ancient guidance we die with pride
