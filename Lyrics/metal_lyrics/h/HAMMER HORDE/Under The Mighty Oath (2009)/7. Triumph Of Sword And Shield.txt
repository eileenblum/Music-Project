I have stood upon countless bloody fields
With the might of Nordic swordsmen at my side
I have heard one thousand screams of death
By Odin's Will 'Twas my fate to survive
Journeys past and many battles fought
Strong and brave with swords
In hand my brothers died
My longship sails across familiar waves
As the sight of Fatherland fills my eyes

Father to sons, tell tales of battles won
Lands so far and feats of war
Age to age, this tale shall be told
Pillaged god and hearts black and gold

By triumph of sword and shield
The war-cries sound
By triumph of axe and spear
Victory abound
By triumph on seas and plain 
Returneth proud

Clan by clan our heroes have come home
On a quest of many moons they had gone
Prepare the feast and the mead so they may drink
Gather round so we many wecome them with songs

Father to songs, tell tales of battles won
Lands so far and feats of war
Age to age, this tale shall be told
Pillages gold and hearts black and cold

By triumph of sword and shield
The war-cries sound
By triumph of axe and spear
Victory abound
By triumph on seas and plain
Returneth proud
With Tankards in hand
We sing, the Hordes rejoice

Now this tale is forged in stone
How we hacked their flesh and bone
On a path to victory we build our legacy
We will surely feast tonight
And tell our deeds by fire light
Of how we changed the tides of war
To oaths that we have sworn

Northern screams are sold and proud
Let celebration shake their ground
Men and women join in song
And feast and drink till dawn
May the ages know our might
For ancient gods we slay and fight
We have changed the tides of war
To the oath we have sworn

Hail to our brothers, for victory and might!
Bring the feat, much ale we drink tonight!

In celebration my clans all around me!
My faithfulness brought
Great wealth upon me!

By triumph of sword and shield
The war-cries sound
By triumph of axe and spear
Victory abound
By triumph on seas and plain
Returneth proud
