Ancestors call. Hear the thunder blast against the gate.
Black arrows fly from atop the fortress, walls covered in flame.

Pagan sons, may thee be known for braver in war!

Push forward, their line is weakening.
Smash the shields to kindling.
Onward inside, a tomb of ash and stone.

Beyond the gate, royal guards and subjects
face barbaric men in fear.
They've come to receive the power and possessions
kept by wealthy men.

Hailed be heroes of legends and lore.
Immortal skies where the black ravens soar.
Of legends and lore. Black ravens soar...

Courage in battle, bravery in war!

Battle honors ancient Gods, far from home for death and glory.

Inside the royal chamber bleeds.
Nobles litter the ground.
Screams fill the fortress, a mighty and victorious sound.

The sky is touched by flames, the throne room stands before them.
A cowards keep, the king hides in great dishonor.
Among treasure he dies. Blood runs down the throne.
A royal trophy, beheaded, body set ablaze.

With pagan might, brothers fight.
Courage shall hold, despite deep wounds. Hail!
With pagan might, brothers fight.

On this day they leave as heroes.
Legends of war, homelands await their return.

Hailed be heroes of legends and lore.
Immortal skies where the black ravens soar.
Of legends and lore. Black ravens soar...
