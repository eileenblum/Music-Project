As brothers we ride together
Our horses pummeled by the wind
My deeds shall honor my father
My legend will strengthen my kin

With the gods beside us
In victory, our destiny is met
A tale of glory unfolding
A journey to never forget

On a frozen warpath in the name of Winter's Wrath

Strike together! Our fates are woven!
Strike together! Our fates are woven!
By ancient decree!

Grim Nordic warriors, many lives they claim
For the pagan order, with shield and axe they reign

Strike together! With deadly iron!
Strike together! With deadly iron!
We claim victory!

Across icy landscapes, as brothers we ride
On the path of warfare, no fear to cloud our sight

On a frozen warpath in the name of Winter's Wrath

Amongst the mist, amongst the shore
Whirling gales howl thunderously
The wind has no destination
The golden hall calls out to me
