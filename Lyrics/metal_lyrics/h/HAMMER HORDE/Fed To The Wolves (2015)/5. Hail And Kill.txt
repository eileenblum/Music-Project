[originally by Manowar]Brothers I am calling from the Valley of the Kings 
With nothing to atone 
A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride 
Like thunder from the sky 
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her prime 
Hold your hammers high 

Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky 
I was born to die 
Hear me while I live 
As I look into your eyes 
None shall hear a lie 
Power and dominion are taken by the will 
By divine right hail and kill 

Hail, hail, hail and kill, 
Hail and kill 
Hail, hail, hail and kill, 
Hail and kill 

My father was a wolf 
I'm a kinsman of the slain 
Sworn to rise again 
I will bring salvation, punishment and pain 
The hammer of hate is our faith 
Power and dominion are taken by the will 
By divine right hail and kill 

Hail, hail, hail and kill, 
Hail and kill 
Hail, hail, hail and kill, 
Hail and kill 

Rip their flesh 
Burn their hearts 
Stab them in the eyes 
Rape their women as they cry 
Kill their servants 
Burn their homes 
Till there's no blood left to spill 
Hail and kill 
Power and dominion are taken by the will 
By divine right hail and kill 

Hail, hail, hail and kill, 
Hail and kill 
Hail, hail, hail and kill, 
Hail and kill
