Braving the cold
The old familiar storming of
Wind and snow
Ripping from the isle

With sail and oar
I cross unending ocean as
Times before
My back to the wind

Onward to crystal shores and soaring mountainside
Into the frost of northern breath
âNever say die!â

With every season time is withering
Over perilous lands I roam
Far is the passage through abysmal seas
The ever-stretching shadow of home

Wayward I wonder
As ravens are soaring
Through dark skies aloft

The sparks on high
Streak across the canvas of
Winter sky
Cloaked by the night

Star-fields glare
A symphony of celestial
Stratosphere
Polaris guides

The matron of North, empress of eternal ice
Brings forth frostbitten flesh

Spiraled in darkness, haunted by echoing songs
from those who drowned below

Claimed by the sea, so numbing and deep
At the heart of the storm

Felled by the wind, my sail torn to rags
A voyager I am no more

Cyclonic thunder, fire-bolts strike
Pitching the ship to its side

Snow-blinding maelstrom, blizzardous rage
Death-bound to my blackened grave

And as I feel my blood begin to freeze
Never again will I return home

Wayward I wonder
As ravens are soaring
Through dark skies aloft

Braving the coldâ¦

Take me home
