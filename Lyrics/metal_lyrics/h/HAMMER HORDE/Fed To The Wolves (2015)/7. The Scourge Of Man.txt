Darkness awakened 
Arisen with the moon 
Hallowed soil now exhumed 

Bloodshed unending 
Each night slept in fear 
Since the old King first appeared 

He is the one who walks after death 
The shifting shape that hungers for flesh 
Passing through the stone of his ancient shrine 
Beyond the forlorn throne 
To live is to die 

Arriving from Northlands, he strode 
A champion of valor and strength 

âGo now", the chieftain spoke 
"Return this mare from whence it cameâ 

With sword in hand; axe, shield, and spear 
At dawn, he mounted his steed 

The heroâs pursuit of the aptrgangr 
To bring back the head of a King 

Crimson is the forest 
Tracks in the snow 
Where the restless spirit roamed 

Entered the barrow 
The corpse rest inside 
On decayed lips grew a smile 

He is the one who walks after death 
The incarnate curse, the scourge of man 
The bringer of madness, invader of minds 
Beyond the forlorn throne 
To live is to die 

At once, the torch extinguished 
Frost and twilight filled the vault 

Quickly, he reached for his sword 
Before the lich could grasp his throat 

Swinging with force, he cut through the air 
Like the will-o-the-wisp, âtwas was no longer there 

Gripping his steel, he turned to attack 
Feeling its breath on the back of his neck 

Bringing the bastard down 

From stab-wounds came forth 
White worms and dust 

Along with the gilded crown 
Fell the eldest of blood 

Slaughtered limb from limb, 
The King fell to his knees 
Writhing with the sound 
Of a thousand screams 

Fire! 
Fire consumed the headless remains 
Scorching, burning, conquered by flames 

Silenced at last, 
The smoldering ashes were cast 
Into the sea 
(Into the sea) 

He is the one who walks after death 
The incarnate curse, the scourge of man 
The bringer of madness, invader of minds 
Beyond the forlorn throne 
To live is to die
