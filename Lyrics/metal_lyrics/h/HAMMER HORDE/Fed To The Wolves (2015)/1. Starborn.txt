Through darkness Iâve transcended 
Beyond the primordial sky 
Traversing dimensions 
To origins of infinite time 

Vast, uncharted kingdoms 
Clad in dust and gravity 
Worlds dissolve around me 
Chapters torn from history 

Born of burning light 
Cosmic flame 
From astral fragments I became 
The seeds of time, the laws defied 
Starborn creation 

Damned to burn across the aeons 
Immemorial existence 

Born of burning light 
Cosmic flame 
From astral fragments I became 
The seeds of time, the laws defied 
Starborn creation 
(Creation) 

I engage the ever-night with ancient fire 

âRushing forth in myriads, 
as to wage war 
with the lines of darknessâ 
[P. J. Bailey] 

Sky to sky, weaving the web of infinity 
Through the endless void 
Godless tide, drifting so old and ethereal 
A celestial force 

Across the firmament 
Rising from afar 
Cradled by the eternal labyrinth of space 
The firstborn star
