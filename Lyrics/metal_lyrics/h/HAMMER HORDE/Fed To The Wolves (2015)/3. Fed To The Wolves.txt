Broken, starved, war-torn and bled,
Together still we stand
But in the face of blinding fear,
You turned your backs and ran

Reaping riches in great store
By greed youâre led astray
Like daggers stabbed into our backs
The oath you have betrayed

There comes a time when we decide
To be the slave or wield the lash
You've traded in your heroâs pride
Our brotherhood now burnt to ash

Desire and weakness
Your fortune is made
From trust to betrayal
Deceiver

Screams fill the sky
On your knees you beg
Nowhere to run
To the wolves, youâre fed

A traitor dies a thousand times
Before his death is met
Penance in blood
To the wolves, youâre fed

Winter's sign, the first flake falls
Upon this barren field
Surrendered to the will of Gods
Before this blade you kneel

Cowards slain, in fear they fled
By right, we claim our pound of flesh
Eradicated, hunted prey
Unleash the baying hounds of death

In silence and sorrow
You're buried in shame
The circling vultures await you

Screams fill the sky
On your knees you beg
Nowhere to run
To the wolves, youâre fed

A traitor dies a thousand times
Before his death is met
Penance in blood
To the wolves, youâre

Fed to the wolves
Fed to the wolves
Your death is met
Fed to the wolves
Fed to the wolves
Youâre fed

Majesty is yours
Never to feel again
Your place in Odin's court is sacrificed

The wolves will consume
Vengeance must be attained
No rest until their bloodline has run dry

Eye for an eye

Screams fill the sky
On your knees you beg
Nowhere to run
To the wolves, youâre fed

A traitor dies a thousand times
Before his death is met
Penance in blood
To the wolves, youâre fed
