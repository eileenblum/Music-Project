Time and time again 
The horns of battle sound across the land 
Bringing forth the tides of war 

By the spirit of the wolf, 
and One-Eyeâs will, our legions show no fear 
Heralding no master nor king 

Riding on the ageless winds 
Bound by oath - sworn to the end 
Enemies, hear our call 
Born for battle, all shall fall 

Hail to the gods of steel 
Who reign on high â empyreal 
Guardians guide our swords 
Unholy harbingers of war 

From dusk âtill dawn 
Their lives are crushed into oblivion 
Fates are sealed, their death revealed 

Pagan blood runs through our veins 
Let pride and glory be our destiny 
Make your stand, no turning back 

Brothers of freedom arise! 
(Rise!) 
Never surrender 
Kneel before none 
Invictus! 

Take the world by storm 
Show them death and domination 
Piled high are the mountains of the slain 
Conquered with an iron fist 

Riding on the ageless winds 
Bound by oath - sworn to the end 
Enemies, hear our call 
Born for battle, all shall fall 

Hail to the gods of steel 
Who reign on high â empyreal 
Guardians guide our swords 
Unholy harbingers of war 

Unholy harbingers of war 
Unholy harbingers 
Harbingers of war
