Waves of death crushing, a sea of helm and shield
Lightning steel flashing bright, gutted by thrusting spear
Battle hooves blast the ground, grinding fallen flesh
In a choking mist, friend and foe shall bleed
Entwined in chaos, gore of mass fatality

As the field absorbs their drained vitality,
The storm of war is raging as far as my eyes can see
Dripping with disgust, soaked in crimson rain
Churning in torrential execution and pain

Sound the thunder charge and trample enemies
Walls of men colliding, with burning brutality
Waves of death crushing, a sea of helm and shield
Lightning steel flashing bright, gutted by thrusting spear
Battle hooves blast the ground, grinding fallen flesh
In a choking mist, friend and foe shall bleed
Entwined in chaos, gore of mass fatality

Infinite war! infinite war thirst!

Scattered across the ground, a vision of grim defeat
Shattered frames of heroes, as far as my eyes can see
Many moments passed, only the strong remain
Exhausted, terrified, demoralized and maimed

Wounded screaming, death will find them
Corpses rotting in the blood where others die

War thirst! into the slaughter, death has come
Bastards have fallen, one by one

War thirst! into the slaughter, death has come
Bastards have fallen, one by one

War thirst! into the slaughter, death has come
Bastards have fallen, one by one

The courageous who fought were all for naught
Ripping and cutting, trampled to death

Sound the thunder charge and trample enemies
Walls of men colliding, with burning brutality
Waves of death crushing, a sea of helm and shield
Lightning steel flashing bright, gutted by thrusting spear
Battle hooves blast the ground, grinding fallen flesh
In a choking mist, friend and foe shall bleed
Entwined in chaos, gore of mass fatality.
