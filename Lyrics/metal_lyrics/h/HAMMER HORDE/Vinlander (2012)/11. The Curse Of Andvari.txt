Strongest and the eldest son of the Dwarven throne
Guardian of your father's glittering home.
The Gods have killed Ãtr,
Bind them so they cannot leave.

Sent by the mighty Hreidmar, Loki quests to find the one
Who could provide compensation for the murder of a son.
To free the Gods from bondafe and the blood fued it could bring --
Exploitation of Andvari and the curse of his magical ring. 

The Curse of Andvari

Returning with gold that they sought after,
The cursed sons have killed their royal father.
Oh, foolish regin, this ne found wealth is mine. 

Taking Ãtr's wergild to possess it as his own,
He ran deep into the forest to indulge in greed alone.
Spreading breath of poison so that no one could go near.
Twisted by Andvari's Curse, behold the terror, Dragon Fafnir.

Ill-tempered, my brother. I will return for revenge
Rise Sigurd!

Foster-son Sigurd, with Gram by your side, you're a hero to all.
Time you must bide, in trenches deep.
Strike pounding thunder, Fafnir must die! Sigurd!

Stabbing pain from trenches deep, into the ground the dragon bleeds.
Stabbing pain from trenches deep, into the ground the dragon bleeds.
Whispered words of treachery, sent to kill for Dwarven greed.

Fates will claim eternally, the poison-breath of endless greed.
Dragons band, this nightmare killed by tempered blade of Sigurd's steel.
