Haunting woods and misty fields, slaughtering shadows fly. 
From a forest shroud, stalking prey. No witnesses to testify. 
Tales of ghastly warriors devouring men alive. 
With ferocity, now spreading fear across this barren countryside. 
Visions of coming war! Hunters of weak and of strong! 
Feral beasts and champions in raging flight, they're side by side. 
Hunting you and everything alive.

Deep within the forest path or in the silent fields. 
When you see them you will try to turn and run. 
You're too terrified to scream or move, 
they smell fear in your blood. They are riders of annihilation. 
Faced with your mortality in sight of imminent death. 
The raging force will take away your breath. 
You're too terrified to scream or move, 
they smell fear in your blood. The mystic power of the Wild Hunt.

The huntsmen ride on blackened steed to whisk away our lives. 
They are charging in a massive wave 
above the fields in smokey skies. 
Bearers of catastrophe and heralds of dark times. 
Best to not step in their path, and when they come divert your eyes. 
Visions of coming war! Hunters of weak and of strong! 
Feral beasts and champions in raging flight, they're side by side. 
Hunting you and everything alive.

From a realm of mystic power, thousands ride, the hunt is on. 
Death to fearful and brave beholder. Consumed by raging horde!

Beside the hunting hounds that cry, swiftly they fly, 
silent they come. Riders of annihilation. 
Even if you run and hide you will never 
escape the hunt. Riders of annihilation.

Deep within the forest path or in the silent fields. 
When you see them you will try to turn and run. 
You're too terrified to scream or move,

The raging force will take away your breath.
