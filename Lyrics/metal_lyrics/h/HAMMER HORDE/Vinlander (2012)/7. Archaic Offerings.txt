Power of the falls, silence of the stream. 
Fierce and calm in harmony.
In the balance of all things, I recieve an
Offering. In the forest hall, whisper of th
Leaves. Peace of mind comes over me.
Dwelling with the spirits in the
Kingdom of eternal green.

From mountains high, may the healing waters
Flow to the waiting veins of life below.
Climbing from the valley of creation,
In secret solitude they grow.

Altering design, in the woodland keep.
Weaver of the winds, in which I breathe. 
Origin of life, cradle of divinity.
Birth of season, cycle of the globe. 
Final trace of melting snow. 
Retreat of winter, energy of light bestowed.

Reviving the way in natures domain.
Reflecting the light of wisdom.
Insightful men shall comprehend.
The balance of wilderness kingdom.

From wolves of forest to ravens of sky, each
Bird, beast and man under Sol's warming light.
What bounty before you be not 'less they died.
Returneth to soil, bring forth new life.

Follow signs as wisdom shines
On caverns in your mind
Magnificent gift of endless power.
Freedom calls from the wild and raw,
As Winter turns to Spring.
Will you accept archaic offerings?

From wolves of forest to ravens of sky, each 
Bird, beast and man under Sol's warming light.
What bounty before you be not 'less they died.
Returneth to soil, bring forth new life.
