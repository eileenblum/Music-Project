Eyes of the moon, show me my father's doom.
Reveal his resting place, send me your ancient grace.

"Far and wide, past Northern sky, the tired sword from
My hand has fallen. I have gone on a journey long to battle as my father before me."

Palest lord, bearing witness to a tragic sight.
Lunar glow, bathing his corpse in an ancient light.
Wisdom and peace please come to my side
My sorrow has pushed me to my knees.
Breathless, I writhe under rising tide
As the pain cuts through me like the coldest breeze.

Led by ancient light

Finding no answers in the coldness outside
Under the glow of the great lunar eye.
"I do not care if I live or I die"
Surrounded by grief in the silence of night.

Find the strength of warrior-kind, your destiny
Is waiting. A voice had spoken through the misty
Breeze, telling a tale from across the sea. Granting
Stillness to my misery.

Time has come and time will tell
The price of my destiny.

I understand the deeds of his hand.
The courage of man, the pride of the land.
Far we will go with the risks proud men take. 
I will stand, I will sail, I will kill and enslave!

Ancient might!

My time has come to face the waves
I will unleash my rage upon waiting foe.
Pride, power and prosperity:
These will be my weapons of domination!
