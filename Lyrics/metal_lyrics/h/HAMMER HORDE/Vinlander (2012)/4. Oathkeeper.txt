Dark shadows of perils in a land without thrond,
Choking under current where wicked waves churn.
Oh, cruelty of fate, when will he return? Guardians of kin,
Thy treacherous seed. Traitors in absence of glory!

Campaign to fight in the mightiest war. Surely he died,
Despite prophecy and lore. Riches to steal, ours to explore.

Slaves to our own, tortured and killed. Why do we live to
See evil fulfilled? Oh, what do I see on the ridge line above? As he
Arrived on champion steed, restoring our passage to glory!

He is Oathkeeper, slayer of shame. Ending an era of pain. 
Killer of fear, triumphant one, wielder of the ancient law.
Wielder of ancient law.

Charging white riders smash dogs of deceit, splashing
With carnage under blades where they meet.
Dispatching our foe with a furious call.
With God-like fury, killing them all. 
Majestic sight of "Sword-bearing sage"
A birth of new hope, the end of an age. 
From this day forth, all minstrels shall sing.
"This is the saga of warrior-king!"

[Solo: Mininger]

Hailing from Northlands of majesty,
Praised and revered is our warrior-king.
Submerged in the darkness of treachery.
Such was the past, now by glory we're free.

"I release you from the jaws of pain,
No longer will you feel the bite of agony.
Their lives have been cast into Hel by my royal blade.
The honor of this land is restored by the oath I have kept."

He is Oathkeeper, slayer of shame, ending an era of pain. Killer of fear, triumphant one, wielder of the ancient law. Wielder of ancient law.
