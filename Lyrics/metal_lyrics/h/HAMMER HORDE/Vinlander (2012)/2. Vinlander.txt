Light rays of the foreign sun now warm my tired face,
in the vastness of this calm and wild place.
Dragonheads ashore, onward to the newfound world.
My men and I now feast our eyes on land of endless trees,
a rewarding sight for braving months at sea.
Chaos forming, thunder storming, wind and waves crashing.
Many a sturn and sun cross the horizon.
Camps are raised and fires blaze, exploring western plains.
Many a star and sun crossed the horizon.

Deep in wilderness, under share of canopy
Set out to explore and map our destiny.
Out of the brush he came, a boy with crimson skin
and with hungry eyes the warriors welcomed him.
Dragonheads ashore, onward t the newfound world.

Laughter sounding everywhere, the night was cold and clear.
Soon the boy was lost in endless horns of mead.
Ravens watching in the dark, as embers start to fade.
To the gods, a sacrifice is made.

Wrath of Odin, crushing rope, they raised him by his throat
and by the morning sun, for our lives they'll come
Hanging lifeless in the darkness of the cold forest.
And by the morning sun, for our lives they'll come.

Vinlander, you did not sail to die, but death you'll find. Lost beyond seas.
Vinlander, on your voyage wide in endless time. Smashed by savagery.

Lives are cut short but our pride is not for the taking!
Death we shall greet. To my kin, I bid thee farewell.

Vinlander, you did not sail to die, but death you'll find. Lost beyond seas.
Vinlander, on your voyage wide in endless time. Smashed by savagery.
