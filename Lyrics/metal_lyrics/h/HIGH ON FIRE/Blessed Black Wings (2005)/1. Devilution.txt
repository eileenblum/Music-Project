Man's done, Babylon, eat the fruit divine,
wasted labyrinth
Snake's tounge, lies sung, master of disguise,
poison conqueror
War torn, plague born, live in ancient wrath,
executioner
Shapeshift, lives sift, pain in the child's eyes,
last rite spoken - Devilution

Web spun, death comes, bring the blackened tide,
rising war god
Blood lit planet awakes the lurking time,
raging maelstrom
Arcane macabre diety arrives
spewing hellfire
Twisted acrid abominating guise,
promised vengeance - Devilution

Dark king suffering, know the elder's toll,
deceiving millions
Men hung, pain comes, worship me or die,
as you lie broken
End all wars call, stand your ground and try,
hopeless victim
Man's done, Babylon, eat the fruit divine,
wasted labyrinth - Devilution
