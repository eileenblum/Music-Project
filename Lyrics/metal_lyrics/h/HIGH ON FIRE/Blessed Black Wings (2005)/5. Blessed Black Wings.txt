Long to live the path that saves my soul
away adapted forced to live so low
Gone's the will to want to see the light
somber visions cause the path I've strived
Sooth the sayer revels in my death
some would think I'm just a lunatic
The blood I bleed must be black indeed
speak the devil in my time of need

Blessed black wings

Subterranean the house of worms
enter in and let my voice be heard
They call to me bearing evil grins
accounting all here is the den of sins

Blessed black wings

Pleasure's treasures leave me hypnotized
blacking out, follow the trail of lies
Demons seen with a knife in back
eat your mouth out with your cocaine slack
Shadow powder makes me come alive
walking zombie mumbles depressed sighs
The blood I bleed must be black indeed
speak the devil in my time of need

Blessed black wings
