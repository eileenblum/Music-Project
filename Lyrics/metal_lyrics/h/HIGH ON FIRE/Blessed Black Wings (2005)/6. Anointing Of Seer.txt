Onward the seer,
glass ships of fear, maruder's path
Gaze in her eyes,
sacred and wise, prophecy
Lost in her trance,
in her eyes the flames dance, foreboding
Truth of her days,
black endless rays, shows the skryer

Damsel in chains,
for love the bard reigns, destroyer
Skills surpass strength,
towers that quake, song of doom
Unsinkable stars,
bring powers at large, the day they mote
The shaking of Teir,
sonic psalm terrors, chains are freed

Come to me champion
your life has been sieged in me
Calling from distances
yearning to be set free
