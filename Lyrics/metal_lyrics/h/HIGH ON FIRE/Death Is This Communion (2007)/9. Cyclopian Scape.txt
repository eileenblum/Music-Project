Reptile race crossbred down through the golden age, human haze
Lemurian throne taken and usurped by th alien drones, controlled and honed
Atlantian keys sunken and destroyed by catastrophe, left wandering
Bloodline kings slither down through society's reptoid dreams
Cataclysm to the elder tribes
Aununnaki have survived
Continents underwater shrine
Ocean vaults holding time
Say ye grace unto the serpent line
Unviel curses and their lies
Contemplate the lengths they'll go to rule
A there fangs dig into you
