Howling tracks of Hell track coming,
Black storm on the rise
They fill out temples with their lies

The snakes come slithering
Anarchy
Chaotic hunters rise
Spit in the evil eyes

Stand our ground with hate and fury;
Fear that comes will die
Our enemies have come to life

Now they exalt the fiend
Shotgun
Your nightmare's not a dream
They'll choke you and your screams

A clashing comes,
The haunting presence controlling all that breaths
It's brought the world down to it knees

The hounds of hell are freed
Desolate
And with their bite, disease
His evil never sleeps

Sacrificing sons and daughters, rolls the war machine
The tyrant fills his destiny

The snakes come slithering
Anarchy
Chaotic hunters rise
Spit in the evil eyes
