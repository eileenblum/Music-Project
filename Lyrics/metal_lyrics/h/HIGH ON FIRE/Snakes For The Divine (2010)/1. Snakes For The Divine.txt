Sinister Sister shall fall to the blade of my knife
Child of doom has begotten the power to rise
Sacrifice, morbid stories
Blood trickles down through histories

Given your sentence, you're handed the snakes of divine

Black as the devil, the night of the goat has arrived
All of the beaten the holding the sway and shall thrive
Fangs of the venomous reptiles

Suffering peace the endless time
Rise up, fall down
Gazing at gold, the ancient crime
Rise up, fall down
Cities come alive and they will die
Rise up, fall down
Ten thousand years are left behind
Rise up, rise up tonight

Given your sentence, you're handed the snakes of divine

Suffer the scourge by the powers invested in night
Running the course of the wolves and they're killing our kind
Oh, how their claws come ripping

Suffering peace, the endless time
Rise up, fall down
Gazing at gold, the ancient crime
Rise up, fall down
Cities come alive and they will die
Rise up, fall down
Ten thousand years are left behind
Rise up, rise up tonight

Blacked out sky, and beliefs in pillars time
Manifest death and our killers come to life
Breaking this spell and end my master's life

Repelled
Repelled
