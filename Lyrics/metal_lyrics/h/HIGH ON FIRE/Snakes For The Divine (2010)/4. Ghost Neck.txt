Feeding the needs of a desperate survival
Criminally active, not by choice
Overdosing on the mutual garbage
Skeleton the end unfolds
Empty raptured withered human
Cloaked dejection your demise
Shackled laid upon this dead prisoner
Screaming the waste, a deadly voice

Choke conjection and confusion
Surprised you're standing on your feet
Diabolic accusations
Pharisees are not to teach
Buy contempt and your conviction
Crushing others with disease
Horns are showing through the halo
Heroin is such a feast

Morning fever speaking in a vice
Dead deceiver
Sinking in the ice
Madman's sorrow

I've seen things
You're nothing
Believe me

Speaking in a voice
Morning fever
Sinking in the ice

I've seen things
You're nothing
Believe me

Running the circus like a leper
Licking your wounds, an injured hound
Fucked up, doomed and desecrated
Reside six feet underground
Mauled and incapacitated
Lame and dumb are at your feet
Never mind the true conception
Madman's sorrow is what you eat

Feeding the needs of a desperate survival
Criminally active, not by choice
Overdosing on the mutual garbage
Skeleton the end unfolds

Feeding the needs of a desperate survival
Criminally active, not by choice
Overdosing on the mutual garbage
