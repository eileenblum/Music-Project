The sanctioned annihilation
Death tax to the third world equation
The movement of the masses
Exodus of a populous
Breaking the sealed nightmare
Fire, flood, plague have come here
Mouth of the sword delivers
Spine, tendons, shakes and shivers

A light of basking lament
Father of manifestations
Mother of all creation
Gives doom to generations

Its bastard abomination
Humans with sickly faces
The soulless contradiction
A makeshift apparition
Lying in a pool of distance
Not knowing where the truth is
Standing in a graves museum
Lie down, and sleep this victim

A light of basking lament
Father of manifestations
Mother of all creation
Gives doom to generations

The fire hail raining
The storms torment destroying
Now come the angels threshing
Welcome to world extinction

We have been gathered here to
Die in this blackened nightmare
The psalm that separates us
Onto a pain in death

The place of Armageddon
Condemned and cursed the countdown
The terror of war and famine
The end of all we know is here

The sanctioned annihilation
Death tax to the third world equation
The movement of the masses
Exodus of a populous
Breaking the sealed nightmare
Fire, flood, plague have come here
Mouth of the sword delivers
Spine, tendons, shakes and shivers

A light of basking lament
Father of manifestations
Mother of all creation
Gives doom to generations

The sanctioned annihilation
Death tax to the third world equation
The movement of the masses
