Dream being thrown down aloft between from the icy sky
Careful what to seek for inside the frozen mind
Permaglaze reflects this world distant to the thawed life
Frost clan blows the war horn without a fear or guise

Messiah of the glacian heir cold born to rise
Sullen boots impact upon deep the tundra ice
Glorify your greatness, sealed deal cold compromise
Catch the sun to melt these forborne galactic eyes

Plateau of Leng
Winter in veins Hammers arise
To melt through the ice
Dream being thrown down aloft from the icy sky
Careful what to seek for inside the frozen mind
Permaglaze reflects this world distant to the thawed life
Frost clan blows the war horn without a fear or guise
Messiah of the glacian heir cold born to rise
Sullen boots impact upon deep the tundra ice
Glorify your greatness, sealed deal cold compromise
Catch the sun to melt these forborne galactic eyes

Plateau of Leng
Winter in veins
Hammers arise
To melt through the ice

Sail the seas of endless night
Despotic warlord casts his blight
Sons of the north abide
Frost child of abhorrent line
Feed the serpent, drink the wine
Granite heart, unrepentant

Frost hammer
Frost hammer
Frost hammer
Frost hammer

Plateau of Leng
Winter in veins
Hammers arise
To melt through the ice

Frost hammer
