Serpent came to Eve from Tiamat
Immortality was known by man

Oh, how dark we pray
Oh, how dark we pray
Oh, how dark we pray
Oh, how dark we pray

Spirit assassin dressed in black before your shrine
A woman's coffin sending shivers up my spine
Nailed are hands upon the cross so intertwined
A saintly mother sacrificed before your hive

They drink the life
They eat of flesh

Oh, how dark we pray
Oh, how dark we pray
Oh, how dark we pray
Oh, how dark we pray

The brain washed ghost of thought endless lies have come to bind
Four thousand years of mystery surrounding the signs
The Children scream aloud when pain and guilt align
The failing mass of contradiction in their finds

They drink the life
They eat of flesh

Oh, how dark we pray
Oh, how dark we pray
Oh, how dark we pray
Oh, how dark we pray

Shadows on the day of philstia
All will have to seek of Visigoth

The Serpent came to Even with a message from Tiamat
Death and immortality was known to man
Three had become four and five
Lilith had taken to conception
and was cursed to unearth where demons
and man did not dwell together

Oh, how dark we pray
Oh, how dark we pray
Oh, how dark we pray
Oh, how dark we pray

Serpent came to Eve from Tiamat
Immortality was known by man
