Calm your heart and make it still
Take your time and get your fill
Dust and boots lay on the floor
Fix my head behind your door
We give our souls and find tomorrow
We laugh in death and kill the pain
Our sins and thoughts are left inside
Darkness the cave in which I hide
Work your art and do it well
Took the road to living hell
Past is then and now is now
Escaped the reaper with our vow
We give our souls and find tomorrow
We laugh in death and kill the pain
Our sins and thoughts are left inside
Darkness the cave in which I hide
Blood of hearts, abandoned psalm
We war in minds to make it calm
Sort my head to make a mess
Game of chess, no pieces left
We give our souls and find tomorrow
We laugh in death and kill the pain
Our sins and thoughts are left inside
Darkness the cave in which I hide
Brother, brother hear me, death has come to pray
Woman, woman hear me, the tomb is where I lay
Father, father hear me, the tomb is where I lay
Woman, woman hear me, watch the words you say
Calm your heart and make it still
Take your time and get your fill
We give our souls and find tomorrow
We laugh in death and kill the pain
Our sins and thoughts are left inside
Darkness the cave in which I hide
Woman, woman hear me, death has come to pray Father, father hear me, the tomb is where I lay
