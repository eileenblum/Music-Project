A place where sunken ships
Never venture again
Sucked in by the vile catchers abyss
Panels and dials confuse
On and off are amiss
Lost track can the voids return us
To this
We canât find the direction of now
Compass and Earth are turned upside down
Appearance vastly fades
From the radar screen blips
Cockpit askewed and caught in
Strange mist
Pilots or hope of life
Ghost will never be found
Pay the price, missions sunk or just
Drown
We canât find the direction of now
Compass and Earth are turned upside down
Fleet ships and squadron aces
Disappear in the sound
Vorticies and portals mysteries found
On the way where the devil lay
Supernatural crowns
Graveyards, our dead will never be found
We canât find the direction of now
Compass and Earth are turned upside down
