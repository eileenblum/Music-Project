The great awakening and I donât feel better
Some of us take the pain
And the monsters are real
I could lie but its hunting us
As the fates draw nearer
We foresee the absolute
And the jackal is here
You can see me flying above the rift
Watch me diving, play the risks
I could see a long way off
Like a lighthouse keeper
The insane and the somber crowd
When doom whispers here
Hunter from a slight of wing
Iâm a run kill catcher
Saw things from a hawk eye view
Falls a prophet of flight
You can see me flying above the rift
Watch me diving, play the risks
You can see me flying
Watch me diving
From the wrist, the Falconist
A kill to make the day
Got a monsters feather
Think your gonna take me down
Iâll win this for real
Having been on the higher ground a
And I shoot from the lever
Iâm a bird of prey
And your kill in my eye
You can see me flying above the rift
Watch me diving, play the risks
You can see me flying
Watch me diving
From the wrist, the Falconist
Hooded raptors
Bow from perch to Earth
Creance kept val chatri viced
Alright!
The great awakening and I donât feel better
Some of us take the pain
And the monsters are real
You can see me flying above the rift
Watch me diving, play the risks
You can see me flying
Watch me diving
From the wrist, the Falconist
Weâve lived a thousand years
And death had left alone
The á¸¤ashshÄshÄ«nâs fate is forged
On deeds of golden thrones
