I magnetized, I realigned the terra force field view
It solarized with winds of fire like giants cosmic do
A last chance ship ascends, our lives and hopes depend
The capsule holds surviving ghosts of sacred souls that flew
We travel back when time began to view the mythos true
Samsara change, caved mountain range, expose the race that knew
A last chance ship ascends, our lives and hopes depend
A gift aspired, that made us slaves while mining gold and crude
The twin suns locked in cadence, vast magnetic pull
Nibiru speculation now confirming truth
A solar wind as time begins to birth us man anew
A race of giants dimension spires to help them travel through
A last chance ship accends, our lives and hope depend
Accursed beings, galactic schemes, explaining overdue
The twin suns locked in cadence, vast magnetic pull
Nibiru speculation now confirming truth
I magnetized, I realigned the terra force field view
It solarized with winds of fire like giants cosmic do
A last chance ship ascends, our lives and hopes depend
The capsule holds surviving ghosts of sacred souls that flew
The twin suns locked in cadence, vast magnetic pull
Nibiru speculation now confirming truth
