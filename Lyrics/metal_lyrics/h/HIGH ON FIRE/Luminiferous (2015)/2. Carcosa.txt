We have moved though time
Contemplate gold signs
Majik eyes a must
Dragons in the dust
Papalcy, the cult of existence
My demons run at resistance
Conjure life, inject the conjecture
Psychic anomaly catchers
The waking dreams align
Cross thread my rivalâs mind
Twin suns burn our fate
Collision worlds of great
Implore our earthly feet
In silent tragic means
Cosmic throne, earth and its citizens
To understand our existence
We have to dig and instruct the children
The beings of death that instilled them
The waking dreams align
Cross thread my rivals mind
Brain to flower of life
Waking up to time
Never have to die
Growing our third eyes
Papalcy, the cult of existence
My demons run at resistance
Conjure life, inject the conjecture
Psychic anomaly catchers
The waking dreams align
Cross thread my rivalâs mind
We have moved though time
Contemplate gold signs
Majik eyes a must
Dragons in the dust
Cosmic throne, earth and its citizens
To understand our existence
We have to dig and instruct the children
The beings of death that instilled them
The waking dreams align
Cross thread my rivals mind
