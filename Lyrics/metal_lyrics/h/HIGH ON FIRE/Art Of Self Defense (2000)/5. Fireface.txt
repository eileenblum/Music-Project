To be rising chief I have traveled a hundred fold days
Wandered dark wilderness, ravens have gathered my ways
Holy man, vision quest, dancing dawn reflects his gaze
Return to the clan with the scalps of the men who betrayed

Medicine Man has concocted a potion to see
Animal Spirits have filled me and leads what's to be 
Runningwolf, eagle eyes, blood running cold in my veins
Great Spirit laughs as my enemies run from my reign

To be rising chief I have traveled a hundred fold days
Wandered dark wilderness ravens have gathered my ways
Look in my eyes your demise is what is fueling my rage
For I am the one whom by others is called Fire Face
