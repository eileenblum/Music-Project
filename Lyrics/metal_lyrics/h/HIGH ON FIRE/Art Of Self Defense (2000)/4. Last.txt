And you crawled in the room with the serpent
And they sucked from your body the poison
Then the Cyclops arrived there to warn you
And the Whore entered in to adore you
Seems like life has dawned to fade away

Ice bards' ship the frozen bodies
And the ones in the Son are immortal
Then the skeleton hands you the needle
You were born to this day from the cradle
Seems like life dawned to fade away

Reaper's scythe harvest time is upon you
No more use for abuse in this body
Father Time gives the wings now to free you
In the coffin your destiny's beat you
