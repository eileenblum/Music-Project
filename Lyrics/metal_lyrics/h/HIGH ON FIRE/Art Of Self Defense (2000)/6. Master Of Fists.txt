Anger flows, warriors call
Focused eyes see thru them all
Teachers death was a con
Jeet Kun Do avenging one

Streamline form, flying kicks
Warriors fall from powered hits
Mesmerized speed and fury
Numchuckas crush skulls with their flurry

Snap of the dragon
Crack like a whip 
You cannot defy
The Master of Fists

Bender of will
Defender of bliss
Enters the dragon
The Master of Fists
