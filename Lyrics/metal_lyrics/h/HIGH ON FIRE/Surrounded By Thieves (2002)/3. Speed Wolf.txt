Befriend a bastard, a thief as your brother
Heard him say what's yours is mine
Careful when gouging yourself with what's holy
I see through your transparent lies

Skeleton symphonies play psalms to tell you
Your venom has blinded your eyes
Make sure your rope is real strong when you hang me
Better make sure that I die

Your name became Judas the moment I helped you
Should've just let it all lie
If Mammon's the reason for killing your hero
Choke on your evil disguise
