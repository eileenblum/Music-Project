Now you are lost and can't find
Gazes the teeth and white eyes
Lost all your reason, insanity
Nowhere to run, could this be

Chills up your neck, down your spine
Now you must run for your life
Monsters prevail, insanity
Nowhere has swallowed your being

Run from the blackness of night
Evil has you in its sight
Adrenaline madness won't let you be
No one could hear your last screams
