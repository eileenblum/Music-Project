Beyond the mountains of ice
Exists a creature of frost
His secret lies in the skies
Eternal legend survives

His powers unknown by man
To catch a glimpse if he can
Wandering deep polar caps
Communication with saucer

Abominable nomad
The ancient monks know his clan
The time of yeti will rise
Because his ways have been wise

The yeti's feet take flight, upon the tundran ice
Carries the saucer's key, upon the space bound seed

The yeti's feet take flight, upon the tundran ice
Carries the saucer's key, upon the space bound seed
