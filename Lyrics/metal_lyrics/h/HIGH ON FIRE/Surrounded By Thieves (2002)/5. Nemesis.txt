Come, enter the feast, eat flesh of kings
Hands crying blood, scourge making way
Sonic its sound, destroyer comes down
Feet plant on Earth, forcing the toll
Wasting what was, reap what you sow
Hammer of death delivers the blow

Invincible throne, tormenting hate
Eyes of the god, sombering souls
Dark is the cape, a dissident's face
Holy the war, laying in wait
Lashes that burn, crucified mass
Looked for the light, but death betrays

Devil's hooked tongue, black takes away
Ashes arise, clouds of their faith
Hatred becomes the infidel's graves
Unveil thy cloak, forge the mine curse
Demon seed womb, dictator's birth
Come to conspire control of the Earth
