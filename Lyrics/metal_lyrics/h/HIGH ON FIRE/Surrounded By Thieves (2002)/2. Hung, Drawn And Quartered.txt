The candle has burnt through, the wax that once covered my eyes
The Pharisees told you, but you knew of the black serpent lies
Come all ye losers, don't you know you're the children of life
Follow me now and we'll burn down the pillars of time

The evil has come and the darkness will cover the light
Above the legions, who will slay the poor and the blind
Warriors that follow, won't you read the sign and the time
Stand now in battle and we'll crush the clan and their kind
