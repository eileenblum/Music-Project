Icy caverns
Holds man traveler
Ancient relic
Reveals secrets

Transform human
Beyond mortal
Learnt forboding
Sacred tempest

Up to their bridles in blood
The wars of the Earth have begun
The sunless age comes so it seems
The cities surrounded by thieves

Rich man he lusts for gold
Still there are slaves to be sold
Woe to the one who had saved
The cities surrounded by graves
