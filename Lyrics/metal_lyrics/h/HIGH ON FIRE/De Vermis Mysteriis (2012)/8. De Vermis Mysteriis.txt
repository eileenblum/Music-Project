De Vermis Mysteriis, awkward and curious, anoesis has opened its face
Kathulos, conjurer, tests of pain, Hasturers, pupils of black show their faith

Wizards, Hypoborea, craft of Khem, torn of the acriment write of their place 
Winds of Zaar, origin traced, blue of skin, nuclear phase takes a race lost in time

Lance of kings, string of hate, obsessed upon morals and taint that obeys winds and kinds 
Perpetrate, land affixed, Acheron escaping the scrolls and a fate of their shrine 

Long live traveler
Winds now die
Dark place creature
Destined night
