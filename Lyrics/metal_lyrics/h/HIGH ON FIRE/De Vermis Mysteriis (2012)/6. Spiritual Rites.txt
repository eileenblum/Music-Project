Ablaze with searing power
Sands of time will count the hours
Upside down turning faster
The come to burn the bastard 
Read ethereal runes engraving
Appease the mass's craving 
Heretic accused, a trial
Inquisition, last denial

I'll scourge your ghost
Salvation's tomb
Dark fanes my cloak
Deny my power and I'll burn you as the dead is

Demon knows your name this hour 
Careful that it doesn't follow
Tiania elder bearing 
Brings death amongst this hearing 
The wrath of priests are hollowed 
Abominations followed 
Awake to a death ancestor 
Wrong the place to please the master 

I'll scourge your ghost
Salvation's tomb
Dark fanes my cloak
Deny my power and I'll burn you as the dead is

I'll scourge your ghost
Salvation's tomb
Dark fanes my cloak
Deny my power and I'll burn you as the dead is
