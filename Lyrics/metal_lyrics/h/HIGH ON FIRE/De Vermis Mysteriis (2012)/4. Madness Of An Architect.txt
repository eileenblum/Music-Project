Black Stygian soil, conjures craft made undo times fertility
A karmic move you know the darkness always comes in threes
An alchemist finds frozen secret left behind the deeds 
A wrath upon the humans less beyond this point society

Evolutions of a birth, a rhyme to tell this crimson tale
Evoke the faithful creed, the sacred secrets of society 
Vanarian wars exploit the blood of Stygian wise men, alchemy
Forgotten magic secrets shamed
