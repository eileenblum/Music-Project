Drug of days, time malaise, shape taken enters the line
Ceremony ingest a poisonous fate know to time
Alchemy, black lotus ferment is carried afoot
Betwixt among relatives hiding a past that's a fold and aloof

Be thy eyes ancestors reign
Past attune and paravased 
Serum drunk reflect and chased 
Bloodline trip enters their graves 

Priestess of a timeless cup, the taker has looked through old eyes 
To see why of religion's course, my brothers path goes so wide
Killers maze, the holy's rage dreaded down under its size
Spirits tread, the lives gone dead, a risk to expose my face, my demise

Be thy eyes ancestors reign
Past attune and paravased 
Serum drunk reflect and chased 
Bloodline trip enters their graves 
In the winds of time blowing on
Of the hourglass Balteazeen
