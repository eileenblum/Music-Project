Knuckles thrash their way to find a skull that just can't hide
I duck and slip away to an uppercut and hide the feint
Lament and cry aloud as the opposition finds his deadly trap
Concuss the blow and find the targets places pinpoint, exact

Darkened goal reveal strength as my enemies see my war inside
Look defeat is chopping down to seek and death defile his demise
Allude and cover up anticipate the strike
Hardened punch deigns the vision of a face... and prize

The blood amongst this cage, the fiend within my rage
A ring of circumstance, heart is with me

Knuckles thrash their way to find a skull that just can't hide
I duck and slid away to an uppercut and hide the feint
Lament and cry aloud as the opposition find his deadly trap
Concuss the blow and find the targets placed pinpoint, exact

The blood amongst this cage, the fiend within my rage
A ring of circumstance, devil with me

A puppets shadow dance, unkind the fall of chance
A prophet's mammon for your life
A cage of blood for your beaten size

The blood amongst this cage, the fiend within my rage
A ring of circumstance, devil with me

Bloody knuckles
