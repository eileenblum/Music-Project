Riding on roaring winds, facing the future
The bone â breaking power leads to the other side
The pure metal gives us the strength to this life
Wonât give up till the music unites

Time is a lightning, itâ running so fast
But we are free now, letâs ride through the universe
We take the chance thatâs the way, so itâs right
This is our real life what we have to find

After all bad things I want to find my way
When all of my dreams seems slowly fading away
I follow the sign and I know there is no return
Now it is time to start when my heart begins to burn

Like a mighty hurricane
Rising as high as we can
Itâs the path we want to run
We donât want to change our life
Keep together to survive
All our fears seems to be gone

Time is a lightning, itâs running so fast
But we are free now letâs ride through the universe
The pure metal gives us the strength to this life
Wonât give up till the music unites
