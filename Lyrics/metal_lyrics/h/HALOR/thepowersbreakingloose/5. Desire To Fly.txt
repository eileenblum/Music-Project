Have you ever felt
The sky is so far
And weekdays press you
Deep into the tar

Thereâs nothing left to stay
Your dreams are far away
Thereâs no more reason
For you to stay â no way

Leave the earth behind
The long dayâs killing grind

Spread your wings and show
For all the world to know
We can reach up to the sky
Desire to fly

Have you ever heard
The call of the stars
Have you ever seen them
Through the clouds

Feel the power inside
And never hide
And youâll see weâll free
Again tonight
