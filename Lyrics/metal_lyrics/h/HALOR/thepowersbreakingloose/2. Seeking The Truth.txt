Youâve built your world, your empireâs completed now
Founded on mistakes and lies
Your smiling mask â shelter covers and protects you
But thereâs something you cannot hide

We know all your masters called treason and money
Devilish contempt and the crime
Seasons can change, but weâre all the same
We fight never hide till we die

We searching for light
The light, shining bright

We are seeking the truth
We run through all evil
Seeking the truth
We swear by the sky
Seeking the truth
Through eternal light
We will see the candlelight

The devil is waiting, itâs looking for weak ones
Thereâs left no place, nowhere to run
The predatorâs hunting the innocent victims
Remorseless fight has begun
The gates to the dark side are open in front of you
Showing the way you must go
Vultures are watching the dead ones above
But you know once they will lay below
