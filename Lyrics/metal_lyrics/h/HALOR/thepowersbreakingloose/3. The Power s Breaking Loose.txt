Iâm standing on the hilltop when the hours go passing by
Iâm staring at a point where all the mountains meet the sky
The sun is shining high above but fear is all around
Something makes me restless and my heart begins to pound

Black cloud gather, silent wind blows, but it makes no sound
I see the storm is getting closer, something shakes the ground
The silenceâs dead now, it is gone, thereâs left no place to hide
The powerâs breaking loose and I canât stop loosing my mind

The powerâs breaking loose
Lightnings through the air
The powerâs breaking loose
Thunderâ everywhere
The powerâs breaking loose
Fear in the twilight
The powerâs breaking loose
Iâm witness of the mighty forces fight

Raindrops - just like million nails â are piercing through the air
The wind is taking everything leaving only despair
The raging chaos discreates, itâs running through the land
Iâm running for my life Iâm just a fistful of sand

The devilâs flying on on wings of death
Taking our last breath
Weâre small creatures, we cannot fight
The natureâs got the might
