I walk the dirty streets tonight
Black haze covers the town thereï¿½s no more light
And when the night is coming
Darkened thoughts run through my tired mind:

Weï¿½re alone ï¿½ and our hearts are made of stone

Oh, let me see the chance to be free
Oh, help me and forever we will be
Oh, let me see the chance to be free
Oh, help me and forever we will be

I feel the icy kiss of dawn
Frozen nails are tearing me apart
And when the morningï¿½s coming
Everything seems still to be so dark

Weï¿½re alone ï¿½ and our hearts are made of stone

Oh, let me see the chance to be free
Oh, help me and forever we will be
Oh, let me see the chance to be free
Oh, help me and forever we will be
