With lightning speed
Worldï¿½s under my feet
Riding the sky
Horsepowers cry

With burning heart
Press button ï¿½startï¿½
You mustnï¿½t slow down
Youï¿½ll fall behind

Horsepower
Running and flying devilish angel
Horsepower
Only you and the divine wonder
Rolling wheels
Ride the wind and climb the hills
Silence seems to be dead
By the roar of horsepower

Come on! Youï¿½re slow!
You mustnï¿½t say NO!
Weï¿½re chasing the light
Just follow me tight

Forget crawler lane
Itï¿½s just a game
Of screaming pistons
Tires grinding stones

Horsepower
Running and flying devilish angel
Horsepower
Only you and the divine wonder
Rolling wheels
Ride the wind and climb the hills
Silence seems to be dead
By the roar of horsepower
