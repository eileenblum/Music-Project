Youï¿½ve broken the ancient law
Youï¿½ve called the demons of war
Youï¿½ve played with fire, you pay the price for sure

Face to face just you and me
We unleash our hates
Stare into my eyes and be afraid

Face to face by the light of the full moon
At the gates of the dawn we wait
With loaded guns we march into doom
One of us wonï¿½t see the sunrise again
