Faceless hunters shoot down from the hills
In the valley the city is bleeding
Mortar shells plough the walls on the streets
The flying bullets are screaming

O-O-O weï¿½re still alive
Leaving the pain for behind
O-O-O weï¿½re still alive

Weï¿½re facing the fear ï¿½ The shadow draws near
Trying to take our breath away
All hope is lost, gold turns to rust
Bullets fall down from the sky
Like pouring rain

The sniperï¿½s waiting in the safety of distance
His fingers are tight on the trigger to kill
Watching the innocents looking for shelters
Waiting for the moment ï¿½ the nightmare is real

O-O-O weï¿½re still alive
Leaving the pain for behind
O-O-O weï¿½re still alive

Weï¿½re facing the fear ï¿½ The shadow draws near
Trying to take our breath away
All hope is lost, gold turns to rust
Bullets fall down from the sky
Like pouring rain
