Tell me what you see when you look in my eyes?
Tell me what you think? Whatï¿½s deep inside?
Who do you think I am, staring into my face?
You donï¿½t know me, youï¿½ve never felt the evil embrace

I roam the darkest side of the world
Followed by lost souls as black birds

Itï¿½s the final warning ï¿½ dept is calling
Now itï¿½s time
Thereï¿½s no more wonder ï¿½ the roars are louder
Demons take my lifeï¿½ Final warningï¿½

Donï¿½t try to save me! I can never escape
Iï¿½m trapped inside the endless seas of pain
Youï¿½ll never understand meï¿½ You donï¿½t even try
No one sees the lonely tears that I cry

I roam the darkest side of the world
Followed by lost souls as black birds

Itï¿½s the final warning ï¿½ dept is calling
Now itï¿½s time
Thereï¿½s no more wonder ï¿½ the roars are louder
Demons take my lifeï¿½ Final warningï¿½
