Thereï¿½s no way out, Iï¿½m trapped in my body,
The words try to break through my skin
The thoughts are eating the spirit inside me
What is this hell Iï¿½m living in?

Circle of lies ï¿½ full of emptiness
Mirrors of the blackened souls
Ignorance and greed, lies, envy
Destroy life, the freedom falls

I stare through eyes of the fate
I live my life on the blade
Iï¿½ll carry on, always proud
Though I know thereï¿½s no way out

Iï¿½m chasing my dreams that I never can reach
Fighting invisible ghosts
Iï¿½ll never surrender, I fight my own battle
But Iï¿½ll never own the force

I stare through eyes of the fate
I live my life on the blade
Iï¿½ll carry on, always proud
Though I know thereï¿½s no way out
