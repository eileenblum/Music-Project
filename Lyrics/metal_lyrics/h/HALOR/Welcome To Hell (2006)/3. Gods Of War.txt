Standing and waiting for the ultimate command
The Platoon is ready to strike
The sunï¿½s turning black and the hellï¿½s breaking loose
Roaring thunder hits the ground

Marching through rain of fire
One step closer to the end
Fighting with burning desire
Overkill the last command

Gods of war ï¿½ gods of war ï¿½ gods of war
Ignite the world
Gods of war ï¿½ gods of war ï¿½ gods of war
Ignite the world

Running through blood and tears, bodies and bones
The warmachineï¿½s hungry for life
Feeding on everything that it can take
Endless suffering all around

Marching through rain of fire
One step closer to the end
Fighting with burning desire
Overkill the last command

Gods of war ï¿½ gods of war ï¿½ gods of war
Ignite the world
Gods of war ï¿½ gods of war ï¿½ gods of war
Ignite the world
