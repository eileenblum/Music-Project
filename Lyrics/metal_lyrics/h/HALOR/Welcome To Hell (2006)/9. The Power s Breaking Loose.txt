Iï¿½m standing on the hilltop when the hours go passing by
Iï¿½m staring at a point where all the mountains meet the sky
The sun is shining high above but fear is all around
Something makes me restless and my heart begins to pound

Black cloud gather, silent wind blows, but it makes no sound
I see the storm is getting closer, something shakes the ground
The silenceï¿½s dead now, it is gone, thereï¿½s left no place to hide
The powerï¿½s breaking loose and I canï¿½t stop loosing my mind

The powerï¿½s breaking loose
Lightnings through the air
The powerï¿½s breaking loose
Thunderï¿½ everywhere
The powerï¿½s breaking loose
Fear in the twilight
The powerï¿½s breaking loose
Iï¿½m witness of the mighty forces fight

Raindrops - just like million nails ï¿½ are piercing through the air
The wind is taking everything leaving only despair
The raging chaos discreates, itï¿½s running through the land
Iï¿½m running for my life Iï¿½m just a fistful of sand

The devilï¿½s flying on on wings of death
Taking our last breath
Weï¿½re small creatures, we cannot fight
The natureï¿½s got the might

Powerï¿½ Powerï¿½ Power

The powerï¿½s breaking loose
Lightnings through the air
The powerï¿½s breaking loose
Thunderï¿½ everywhere
The powerï¿½s breaking loose
Fear in the twilight
The powerï¿½s breaking loose
Iï¿½m witness of the mighty forces fight
