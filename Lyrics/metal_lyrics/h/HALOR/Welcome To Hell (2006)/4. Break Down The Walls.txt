Time has comeï¿½ to batter down the bridge behind you
The fate is done for youï¿½ and all your dreams come true
Now way backï¿½ your heart is pounding now in your neck
Time to hit the roadï¿½ never, never look back

Just shut the door
Just shut the door behind you
Exile the trouble out of your mind

Break down the walls
Break down the walls
And let your spirit to be free for sure

Reach dreamlandï¿½ the power and force is just in your hand
Canï¿½t you see the signï¿½ now itï¿½s time!

Just shut the door
Just shut the door behind you
Exile the trouble out of your mind

Break down the walls
Break down the walls
And let your spirit to be free for sure
