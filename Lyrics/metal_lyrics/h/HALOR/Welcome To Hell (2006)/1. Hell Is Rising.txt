Ride on the wings of sound, like demons in the night
Burn ï¿½ burn to the core, the madness owns you mind
War of flesh and blood - 	just donï¿½t wait for the dawn
Devastating volume of amps will always call

Lightning strikes ï¿½ burning nights ï¿½ we kill the silence
We are the metal machine that spits fire in your face

Hell is rising ï¿½ Runs through our veins
Angels crying ï¿½ and going insane
Hell is rising ï¿½ Breaking bones
Forever burning in our hearts and souls

Try to stay alive and overcome the war
Cry ï¿½ cry for your life ï¿½ the storm will take it all
Scream for mercy, but be sure that it wonï¿½t help
Masters of the underworld pull us back into hell

Lightning strikes ï¿½ burning nights ï¿½ we kill the silence
We are the metal machine that spits fire in your face

Hell is rising ï¿½ Runs through our veins
Angels crying ï¿½ and going insane
Hell is rising ï¿½ Breaking bones
Forever burning in our hearts and souls
