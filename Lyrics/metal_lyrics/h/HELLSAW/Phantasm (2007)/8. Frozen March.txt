Clear was the night - the moon cast a shadow
A cold breath - touched my skin

Unchained I commenced my journey
Yearning to be closer to this power
My strife turned to struggle
Attracted by the light, one step at a time

The higher I rose, the more rock behind me
My surroundings changed
Drenched in deepest hate

Stones - snow
Cold skin - frozen lips

Storms forced me to my knees
Frost weight hard on me
But no thought of relingnishment
Driven by the sight that enthralled me

At the end o my path - my mind was sick
Too high and too cold
No pleasure did I find - I was driven by more

Stones - snow
Cold skin - frozen lips
