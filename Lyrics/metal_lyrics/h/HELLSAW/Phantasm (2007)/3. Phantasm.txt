Once - I didn't sense dolefulness
My soul was strong, stronger that it seems to be
Still nothing is like then

Once - as my fate was high
The rage on the lot I suppressed
Still nothing is like then

Hatred - doesn't leave me anymore
Dolefulness - lets me get algid

When was the day
On wich it used to happen?
When I believe in my memories
There were too many

Timeless, I experience my enviroment
The thought on the future, it makes me sick
Still I don't want do die

Revenge, seems to be a solution
If not today, then even tomorrow
Still I don't want to die

Lost - in self-pity
Lachrymal - end my nightmare
Hope shall embrace me
