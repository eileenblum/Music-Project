On days like these
It returns
Solitariness in their faces
Emptiness and bewilderdness

On days like these
Nothing is moving
Freedom lies in the wind
Pains decay in temselves

Do you feel the same breeze of hope?
Have you imagined freedom like that?

Between wounds and reality
Spirit can be felt
Catch it, honour thee

Do you feel the same breeze of hope?
Have you imagined freedom like that?
SpÃ¼rst Du den selben Hauch Hoffnung?
Has Du Dir Freiheit so vorgestellt?

Remain silent until you turn to dust
He carries thee into infinity
