Fog, scening of fresh new
Is crossing the landscape
Homeland - covered by power

Silently overbeared
All torments, all pain
The interaction, the victory

Quietly and devotional dressed
Moistness surrounding anger
Scoff, contumeliousness - mescapable

The power that wins
Honours - doesn't destroy

Day catches a glimpse of
The lake, the woods
Now tranquility dwindles
Tranquility - will return
