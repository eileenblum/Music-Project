I remember the wrath
The mountains with a soul made of ice
Bruised and sick within pain
Resembling a lifeless body

Fear fills your eyes,
And you flee from yourself
No soul can stand this
No one will heal you

Is this a flight into infinity?
My scream echoes through the world!
Your gaze is empty and weak like your soul?
You have the eyes of ice
