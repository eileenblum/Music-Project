I am empty, desperate and depressed
The sadness entrenches itself deep in my heart
My heart beats heavy as thunder in winter
Sighing hurts, I canât breathe

Am I able to think clearly?
Does my reasoning rest in its own elixir, trapped?

Now I lift my head from the lake of tears

Can't bear myself and my reflection anymore
I hate everything around me. I need to kill!!!

Am I sleeping? Am I dreaming? Am I awake?
I don't know anymore
Am I screaming? Does it hurt? Am I crying?
What do I want?

Time - I need time!
Space - I need air?

Convulsions force me to the ground
Screams resound around me
Going far into the world
I wished I could be this sound
