End time â the horror's birth
Agony â proliferating like the Black Death
Awakened in a dream â Satanâs son
Rotting corpses â a demonâs spawn

Mankind destroys itself with violence and hope
I curse these unworthy ones!
Let your thoughts be free
I shun your son â Fuck you!
We deny your father â forever â bastard!
