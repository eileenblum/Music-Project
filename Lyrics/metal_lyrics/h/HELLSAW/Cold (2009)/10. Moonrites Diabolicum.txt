As far as it seems to be - for us
So strong is his power
A full moon is shinning tonight

Through rock and stone his might is blazing
The fire's crackling echoes in the wind

Thoughts you can hate
In the calm glow of the night
Dreams you want to live
In your moment of loneliness

Your ritual - your soul's agony
Your ritual - the fight against your sadness
My ritual - soul searching
