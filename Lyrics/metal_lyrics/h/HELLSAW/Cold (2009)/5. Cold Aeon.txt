Our souls will grow cold

Cold aeon â Hate is released
Cold aeon â Death is made for ice

Our souls will grow cold

Landscapes buried in ice and snow
Seas glistening like the morning dew
All life is dying

The northern lights invade the skies
The horizon â immersed in blue splendour
Our world is cold

Cold fog blacks out the sun
End of time â end on earth
All life is vitrified in ice

Cold aeon â Loneliness
Cold aeon â End of time

Our souls will grow cold

Time stands still
Nothing but silence â everywhere
Forever â loneliness in eternity
