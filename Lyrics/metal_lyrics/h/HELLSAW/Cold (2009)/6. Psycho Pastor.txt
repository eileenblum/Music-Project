"Geht ihr guten in die eÃige ruh
Get fan uns ir sÃ¼nder"

Everything began in the year 1415 with the birth of pastor Ludwig â
Raised in Christian surroundings and under the aura of god and family, he was exposed to religious customs from childhood
In his youth â already â he uttered the desire to serve god and Jesus
His entry into the church as a young acolyte was accomplished, protected and secure, Ludwig rendered his cardinal every service

But as the plague devastated his family in 1435.
His vision of god changed, he doubted his existence
(his mind would become his foe)

He knew how to use the hunt for the evil
That had haunted his land, for his own purposes
Women, children and the dying sought help and protection in his church
It must have been hundreds!
It must have been hundreds!

Within holy buildings the victims of the plague were abused
He carried out experiments on skin, limbs and the psyche until death

The bodies he buried on his premises alive or dead
Repainted in the likeness of Mary â the virgin and mother

Nobody found out about his doings
Nobody was interested in his actions

Ludwig hanged himself in 1451

"Geht ihr guten in die eÃige ruh
Get fan uns ir sÃ¼nder"
