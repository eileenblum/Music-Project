Mysterious is the suicide
Souls free of revenge
Tortured and begging for mercy
United in infinity

Moments in fear, the scream for hope
A lightning storm, in the grater of despair
Screams for attention, unheard in eternity
Cursing, hating, I await the fall

I deny your condemnation, I curse your sight
Banned thou art from my suicide

Imprisoned by demons, embrace by death
A never-ending journey

Pitch, death and sulphur
Barren is the ground of hell

Screams coming down from the red mountains,
In a paradise of wrath

Begging pleading for mercy
My revenge for the avengers

Sensing freedom, against all morality
Bow to me - for me - mercy will not be granted to you
Desperation is felt by every bastard
In eternity, I will come back again

Led by strength,
Following the mystic path
In my paradise
Into your misery

I deny your condemnation, I course your sight,
Banned thou art from my suicide
