Destroyed and forgotten
Hated and loved
Sacrificing my soul, I have lived my dream
Fooled and betrayed
Fought and slain 
I long to be free

Inhaling the tranquility by the lake
Forgotten is the day it all began
A symbiosis of my mind
And nature lets me face my inner self

My journey was far, itâs time to arrive
Do I want to live or be what you want me to be?
Perhaps I am my own best friend

Destroyed and forgotten
Hated and loved
Sacrificing my soul, lived my dream
Fooled and betrayed
Fought and slain
I long to be free

At times, the energy overwhelms me
An intimate memory from the past
Am I speaking to myself?
Am I speaking to all of you?

My journey was far, itâs time to arrive
Do I want to live or be what you want me to be?
Perhaps I am my own best friend

Silenceâ¦

I have no thoughts
I have no thoughts for others
