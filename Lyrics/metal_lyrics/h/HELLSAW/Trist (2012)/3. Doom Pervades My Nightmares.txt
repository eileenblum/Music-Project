I feel the rain cooling down my skin,
Can smell my blood seeping to the ground.

Itâs dark in my room, only stars are shining.
I am alone, I am afraid.

Doom pervades my nightmares
Doom pervades my nightmares

I am dreaming of her, sheâs hurting me.
Cutting me, leaving my alone
In my lake of blood.

Wake up with slashes, tears in my eyes.
Want to sleep again, to dream away.

Doom pervades my nightmares
Doom pervades our nightmares
