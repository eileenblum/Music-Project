You could see the dread in her eyes
The fear of evil
She was driven
By the seemingly inescapable

She fled from torture
Straight into their hands
She was mutilated and burned
Spat upon and humiliated

1450 the beldame died
1450 her screams burned with her
1450
The witch is dead

All the lies they spread
Will never be forgotten
The sinners of the past
Are wearing the same cowls today

1450 the beldame died
1450 her screams burned with her
1450
The witch is dead

Under their sign of the cross
They can murder
They were murderers of humankind
Under the regime of god

Crucify them
Hate them
Torture them

Hunt them
Torture them
Murder them
