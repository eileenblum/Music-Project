A new dimension opens
All depressions conquered

We will fly, the storms are ended again
You must raise the banner of blasphemy

The evil returns
All liars burn

We will fly, the storms are ended again
You must raise the banner of blasphemy

When autumn arrives
The air cools down
The sun and the fog
Embrace our mountains
The time comes to let
The winter in and rest again

Short days
Long nights â A small kind of winter sleep

Trist light
Black mind

Winter is raging
Winter is calling

We will fly, the storms are ended again
You must raise the banner of blasphemy

Winter is raging
Winter is calling
