Itâs so dark, my heart is pounding
Itâs so silent, I hear nothing
Itâs so cold, my sweat freezes

My lips freeze and split
My skin is blue and burned
My thoughts, they are cursed
My bones, they break like ice in the spring

Through hell, with satan by my side
Into paradise, a journey without hope

The devil is calling my name
Purgatory is warming my skin
The devil is calling my name
Purgatory is warming my skin

I am approaching closer and closer to the heat
My sweat is melting and with it all my fears, my fearsâ¦

Closer and closer, until I reach his realm
I am his soldier, his Lucifer on earth

My body, it grows and becomes strong
My skin, is clean and smooth

My thoughts, they are bedevilled
My bones become unbreakable, harder than steel
I am the beast

The devil is calling my name
Purgatory is warming my skin
The devil is calling my name
Purgatory is warming my skin
