Everyone knows the feeling of remorse,
Nobody escapes its reproach.
From where does
This understanding arise?
Where does the play
Between god and evil come from?

The link between what has passed
And evolution is the key.
The continuous analysis and comparison
Of your actions makes you forgive,
What you once thought,
However difficult it is to forget.

Remorse - A phantasm?
Remorse - Is only a human emotion!
Remorse - A phantasm?
Is only a human emotion!

Will the errors of the past be forgiven,
Or even forgotten?
You would be better to forget,
Your companion will remind you of yourself.
If you regret what once happened,
You are fated to repeat your mistakes.

Remorse - A phantasm?
Remorse - Is only a human emotion!
Remorse - A phantasm?
Is only a human emotion!

For as long as we think about it,
It will never end!
