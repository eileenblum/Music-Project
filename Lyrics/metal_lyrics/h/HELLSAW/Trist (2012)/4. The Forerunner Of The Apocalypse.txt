The sky turns black and with it the sun
Itâs getting cold
The rain changes to ice
The sky is turning sulphur now
Itâs getting dark

A storm is coming and transforms the place
Into a unique landscape
All life is buried by these icy stones
No more life

So, let us walk in the fields
Hand in hand with your fears
To seize the end

We will gaze at the rocks
The icewind blows
And the hail destroys

The forerunner of the apocalypse
So close
The forerunner of the apocalypse
So close

The earth is trembling
The volcanoes are erupting
Forests are burning, the seas are raging

So, let us run to a place
A nowhere place we donât know

Where is the life? Where is my home?
Where are the woods that I adore?

Who knows when the end is coming?

The forerunner of the apocalypse
So close
The forerunner of the apocalypse
So close
