Only a trist dreamâ¦

Overwhelmed by a dark haze
Heavy as a rock, crushed by its weight
A subtle cold breeze, constant, but yet unknown

Only a trist dreamâ¦

No end, nothing to hold on to
My goal seems so far away

This lonely landscape
These dismal fields
And this burden too heavy to bear
Into eternity, into exhaustion â Into death

I feel Iâm trapped in an unreal sleep
That does seem to end
It will not end
I am dead
