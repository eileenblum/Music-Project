The pain drops black - out of my heart
Depressions embrace my dark sick soul
Voices called from the field beneath
A never ending story of old told pain

The thoughts - my dreams - their wishes
The spell - my might - their rise
You are the spirit in my veins

The end of my daydream

I hate you
I hate you - fuckers

My cries for fate are too still
Silence is the end of all days

I hate you
I hate you - bastard

The pain drops black - out of my heart
Depressions embrace my dark sick soul
Voices called from the field beneath
A never ending story of old told pain
The thoughts - my dreams - their wishes
The spell - my might - their rise

I hate you - all
