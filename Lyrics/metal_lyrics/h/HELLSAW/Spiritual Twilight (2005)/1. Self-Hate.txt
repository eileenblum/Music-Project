Once I had a vision - in - my mind
A soul traveller I - should be

Distances and dimensions - woods and seas
Shadow places - sand and stones

As I stood in the fog, iced rain on my skin
Unhallowed shadows take my mind away

Caused by depressions, self-hate
Reign of pure black

Caused by depressions, self-hate
Visions from the depths of death
