Now the start of our journey is coming
All our hope and our feelings will guide us
We travel long, but not far

Stones and ice, in an arctic sky
Like fire in dead bodies' eyes

You are the spirit in my eyes, fire and ice
The call of the woods is in my veins,
Nature embraces me

Now I am gone from this world - forever
My infinite spirit cannot leave this place

I am the essence which crosses the waves of time

You are the spirit in my eyes, fire and ice
The call of the woods is in my veins,
Nature embraces me

Now I am gone from this world - forever
My infinite spirit cannot leave this place

I am the essence which crosses the waves of time

You are the spirit in my eyes, fire and ice
The call of the woods is in my veins,
Nature embraces me
