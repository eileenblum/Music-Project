Through the night and through the sky
Rides the wanderer far far high
Winds and storms embrace this guy
By the march through the nightly sky

Winds
Storms - nightly sky

The march of revenge it shall be
Thousand of tortures he left behind
With his bloody axe he murdered
There is no survivor

Summon his forces
Hear my call

All cries for hope are failed
And now the wanderer is marching on

Summon his forces
Hear my call
