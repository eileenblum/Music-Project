Be welcome all.
Come by your own free will in the middle of his demolished place.
Where the storm reigns, the light of the autumnal day vanishes
And the winds announce the going of the dusk.
Noisy Birds warn that it grows dark and the stars celebrate the dominion of the dark fall.
A dark mantle covers me, my arms are rising
A blue light radiates from my damned spirit, the circle is closed,
The fire dances, the sword in my right hand and I clame with pride your keys:
Lilith- Beleth- Emmon- Nebiros, hear me now,
Will be born tonight, bringing its seed of unconditional sin,
Is agreed it and you know it, all those will be condemned,
Passion emerging from the darkness. Enchantment beyond of all the created
Could not have more purity.
Arisen Angel from shades, I appreciate your presence. Glimpsed by all dark.
Agadicc- Damiere- Obegor- Taliareth.
I summon to you, I am thankful to you and I send you from return to its beautiful empire.
It has been born before the dawn, it has destroyed the divine despoliation.
With its magic a new circle has emerged and by its maiden originated from the twilight
...my torment has concluded
