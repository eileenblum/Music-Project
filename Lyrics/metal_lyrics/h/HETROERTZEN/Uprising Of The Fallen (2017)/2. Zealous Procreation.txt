My crowning battle is approaching 
Amongst bloodshed and suffering 
I am the challenger I do not fear 
This is the exceeding step 
A leap into the red depth 
I shall conquer I will never fear 
The disciple stands triumphant and shouts in jubilation 
Brooding shadows sweeps across the lands of spiritual poverty 
Bestowed upon me are a thousand rays of fiery Light 
Stricken in grandeur developed 
Yesod! 
I am the challenger I do not fear 
I shall conquer I will never fear 
Turbulating around in my own filth 
Close to be broken 
I catch a glimpse of the end of the Black Tunnel 
Oh, atrocities of the suffering 
Brought upon the challenger 
Sickened to the core of fleshly existence 
How I've lived in times of confusion and disillusion 
Forevermore my fate is sealed
