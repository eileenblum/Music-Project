Contemplating the rising sun on the Horizon 
Revealing the cities of old 
Warming up my hands and piercing my eyes 
The feelings are no longer cold. 
Uprising 
This Morning Star is the Eye 
It is beginning; it is glory 
An elliptic entrance 
Which is the Serpents eye. 
Praised be the Morning Star 

Pure ancient sin impregnating the female 
The drop of Life falling from the cup of Death. 
The luminous hands touching your skin 
The sight with eyes shut. 

Ra-Amah the sun child 
Born in the reign of Osiris 
Died in the arms of Anubis 
Beneath the clouds flying fast and high! 
Warming up my body and piercing my soul 
To show me the only True Spirit 
Of the Gods and the Stars 
Of love, hate and lust 
Uprising 
Praised be the Morning Star
