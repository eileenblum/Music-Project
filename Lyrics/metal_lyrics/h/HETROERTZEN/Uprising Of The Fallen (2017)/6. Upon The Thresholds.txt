There lies and urge deep within and a will to unlock the Depth 
The spark that burns hot and penetrates through the Will 
I breath from the Fires that are filling the Temple 
And cleansed be in the name of the Father 
Bear thine given name as a mask veiling your face 
And expose thine True Self 

I will dive into ethereal sleep 
I will cast you into the plague-ridden world and open the Skies 
To uncover, to break the boundaries of metaphysics 
And sayeth unto Him, the Most High 
I beseech thee, O Lord 
Dwelleth within me and lurk in the shadows of my Soul 

Look up! See the shadows form by rebel Angels 
Shield me from tainted infiltrations 
Lest thou hast stood upon the fallen cross 
dost thou know of the thresholds there of 
Enticed by the mysteries 
Begotten and uplifted 
Sworn in silence 
Brought up by universal structure 

Deliver us from Nothingness and stagnation 
Stop at nothing to silence the betrayers 
Tortured souls cries aloud 
Elemental sacrifice, oh, Serenity! 
Oh, Crucifixion!
