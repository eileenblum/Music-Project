The inner outmost being of brightness 
Spits its venom upon you 
And call out like a man in grief 
Youâll see there wonât be no brighter days 
Only the blue dawn of the morrow 
As a strike of Armageddon reach your way 
And the Earth will fade to black again 
You are reminiscent of an age past its Time and Space 
Before the dawn of creation 
and the end of the perpetual circle 
And now shall reveal the destruction of time 
Path Bearer 
Who carries two crosses 
One saves 
The other annihilates 
Coagulating blood and gold made Flesh 
Embodied powder of the Sun 
The Greater of the Greater 
Path Bearer 
Who carries two crosses 
One saves 
The other annihilates
