A bloody legacy 
A cold worlds judgement 
Shadows and flames lurks on the blind. 
With diamonds and rubiesâ¦ 
The innocent shall pay the price. 

Oh, dear Lord! Why hast thou forsaken thy children? 
Uprising breaking the lines of sanity 
Piercing the clouds of the Kingdom 

Facing the vaults of Fear and Temptation 
Becoming one with the burning Spirit 
Falling back into Earth. 
Redeemed. 
Descending from the Tree 
Crossing the Desert. 
Royal! 
Fading away beyond feelings 
Trembling vessel of dirty evil 
Forthcoming precious Egregore 
Core of horrors and clemency 
You never rest. 
You never die! 
Who shall see the Mirror 
Who shall climb from the Pit 
Who shall fall from the Cross 
Who shall wash away the WorldÂ´s Sin.
