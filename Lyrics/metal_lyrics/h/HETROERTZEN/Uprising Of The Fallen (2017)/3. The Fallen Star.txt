Through fires of clean devotion, 
we look up to the blackened universe 
longing for you to touch our foreheads 
and crystallize our spine 
The Dragons flags upraised. 
A few words spoken. 
Hand by hand with the enemy 
while crossing the trapezoid in flames. 

Smoking screams of Ego and Pain 
in this lair of Hunters. 
The blood sealed cross with the mirrored Krist. 
Eucharistic trance of demonic Martyrium 
and impious obsession. 

Beyond falling lights from the black Veil 
The Spirit, the Waters and the Metals 
They said it was meâ¦ and you 
Looking at both sides of the Mirror 
Tormenting each other in order to learn the Mysteries. 
Praising the invisible Teachings 
and swallowing pure Wisdom 

Awoken from lifeâ¦ 
Holding no limits back. 
Alone with my kind.
