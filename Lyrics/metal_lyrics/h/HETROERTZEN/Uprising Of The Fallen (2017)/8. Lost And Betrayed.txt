Lost and betrayed 
You never tried 
The fruit is gone. Your soul is dying 
The shadows of Apocalypse are crawling fast 
With empty eyes you are bounded by the past 

Slowed by tempestuous winds of sand 
You cannot even see the palm of your hands 
Drowned by the dense dust of time 
Only waiting for the last remaining sign 
Nowhere else to walk but towards the dusk 
With nothing more than your withered husk 

Still persecuted by visions and tormenting bells 
Your wishes come true in this dying life of living hell 
But! You finally escaped the flock 
And behold, you stand at the door and knock. 

No matter if your soul is burning or frozen 
So the last shall be first, and the first last; 
For many are called, but few chosen. 
A never-ending walk in this path of madness. 
If therefore the Light that is in you be Darknessâ¦ 
How great is that Darkness! 

âWhoever exalts himself will be humbled, 
and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.â
