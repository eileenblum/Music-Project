Ah, to walk about in the withered lands 
To wear the Greatest Seal 
The Serpent's Lock is embedded in my chest 
Prying eyes repudiated for seeing its secret Truths 
True protection upon the astral planes 
In the perception of the unseen 
And all that is hidden 
Cloak me from the impure Ones 

Cometh! Brethren! 
Let us wield the Serpent's Key 
No false Gods nor Demigods 
Will lay their wretched eyes upon us 
We will dominate the Sun 
And sin by the eyes of "God" 
We will venture along our Path 
To the primordial age and of higher Civilization 

Between Darkness and Light will I stride 
Stripped of sensation of emptiness and pride 
Act as in a play set in earliest of times 
Eternal battle-cries heard until the very last chimes 
Make the Hidden manifest and the manifest hidden 
Transfiguration given by a power in Oneself 
Translate my spirit into Nature! 
Abide by my soul 
Transform, transmute!
