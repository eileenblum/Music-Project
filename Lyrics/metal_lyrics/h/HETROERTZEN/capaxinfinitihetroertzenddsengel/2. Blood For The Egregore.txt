[performed by Hetroertzen]Man, raise your head and build me a tower
towards the heaven.
We do not fall into the mud and cry.
We should never accept the pain of living.
We who have the grail inside us will make a feast in
the golden city
for those who search in the shadows...

Scream and silence for the symbol of death.
Salt and water for illumination.
Wine and fire for resurrection.

We will step upon the cross
We will squeeze the worms
We will suck their veins until they face the light.

For those who have fallen in love
with the one who stands behind us.
Here is the cup
Here is the whore
Here is the beast

We will curse the life of the unworthy
We will take out their hearts and burn their tongues
We will ascend to the furthest realms beyond death
And we will, yes we will turn into serpents.

Master!
