[performed by Hetroertzen]Imuates
Our spirit will save us
As this light endures us to continue until the end.
This world is our cross but the serpent is our Krist.

IA

Let there be darkness once again for the imposter
whose name is nothing but abomination.
To the black virgin whose face us purity,
her body is our temple.

To the birth of the shining star that breaks
a nation in sorrow.
To the fallen from grace and splendour,
whose presence keeps us united.
Haunting... Waiting.

IO

Holy consciousness that will be carried out
into perfection.
Enigmas revealed to the crucified souls
and crying spirits.
The ordeal... The skull... The kiss...

Behind the veil, there is light.
Behind the veil, there is truth.
Behind the veil there is salvation.
There is salvation.
