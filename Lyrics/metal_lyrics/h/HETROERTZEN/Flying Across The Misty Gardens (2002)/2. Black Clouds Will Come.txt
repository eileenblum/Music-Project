Black Clouds will Come 
Over the world of light
And will rain
Blood of angels raped

All will be darkness
And no one can be saved 
Thunder and lightings
Forever dominate

Never more the sun 
Over our head will rise
Eternal night of death 
Black clouds will come

Deep rain will fall in the land of death 
Wet creept sleeping
Dyng like me

Black clouds will stay
For all eternity
No god can come 
No lord shall go

Nothing  byt cloudest sky
Nothing but death/night rain
Nothing but sorrow 
Nothing byt candless
Lighting the earth to the end
