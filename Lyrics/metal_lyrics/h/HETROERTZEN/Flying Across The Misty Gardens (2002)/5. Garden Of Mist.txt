As I awake 
From the cryptic shadows
In search of my art
Trembling in pleasure

Flying across the mist
That crept below
My tears and my grief
I cry for thy

Twilight becoming night
Mistic hands of death
Fullmoon
Epitaph of my dreams

Garden of mist... eternal
No sun, no life can be
Only silence wispers
And the charriot of trees

The frozen fallen leaf
Mark my way to exist
My dimension of sorrow
My soul becoming free

Quiet status angels
Defuse and pale to me
Whitness of my past
Inside the freezing mist

Twilight becoming night
My kingdom of quietness
Mountains
Paradise of tears

Garden of mist... eternal
No sun, no life can be
Only silence wispers
And the charriot of trees
