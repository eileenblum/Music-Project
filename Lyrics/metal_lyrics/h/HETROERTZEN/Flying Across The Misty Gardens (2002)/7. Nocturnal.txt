Trought the window
I can see my past
Far away as the clouds
Of the nightsky

Walking trought the graves
Silents waiting
My final return
Soft as mist I fly

The howling winds carry out
These forest parfum
Of cascades and snow
I miss you night of doom

Places where I haunt
Angels souls to raped
I am alone in vast lands
But quiet in eternity

Mountains where I saw
My nearly end

But now I am dead
And no one knows that
I am forgotten memory
I all universe

I am nothing but grief
Eternal image of sadness
Infernal spawn lost
In places and times

In the silent night I scream
And echoes answer my call
