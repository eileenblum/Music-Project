âTrembling into the Infinite Dark Abyss
I took inspiration from You - Star Shadowâ

The Red Flame is in my Chest.

I saw a Mother emerging
from the Blackest Sea
Fishlike belly and the most precious face
White empty eyes as a Cave of Ice...
Black hair like a Million of Worms
And whispering as deep as a Thousand Nights.

U-an

I saw a Huge White Worm
Crawling from the Hole Profound
Long arms appointing the Sky
Horrid blood red eyes
A pale face without form and Silver jewellery
His voice was  Pestilent wind of Sadness

A-nu

I saw a girl like a bird falling from the Sky
With burning wings naked like a Fullmoon Winter
A crowned serpent from each breast
Radiating eyes and mouth
Her voice was a Terrifying Scream
Causing Death and Extinction

Ea

I saw a boy playing a Black Trumpet
He came from the Firemud
Black smoking eyes and mouth
Red body and a Flame on his head
He is the Spirit and his voice was bright and Strong
As an Explosion of a Blue Sun.

Adamu

The Purple Flame is in my Forehead
