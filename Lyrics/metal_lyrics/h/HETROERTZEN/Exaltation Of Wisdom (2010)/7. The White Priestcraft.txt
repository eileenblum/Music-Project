Holy, Holy, Holy is the Line of Cain!
Sacred is the Legacy of the Serpent.
Lift up you arms if you are Worthy
to witness the Fallen Cross
Break your senses while the Black Angels
Guide you into the Path of Suffering
There is nothing but Pain...
It is just the Beginning.
The Angel of Death Commands you.
To Suffer... He is The Lord you God.

When the Cross is raised
all Brethren shall Obey Thy Wishes
And all the Chosen Ones
might Perish before Daring to see Thy Face
Because there is no Heaven without Hell...
No Magick without Pain
And no Light without Darkness to Shine into it,
There is no Beginning without End
And no Ending without a Beginning.

Now when the Cross has fallen
There is nothing but Eternal Peace...
So it shall be at the End.
As the Light of Agitation
has been Eclipsed by the Absolute Emptiness.
There is no Life without Death
and no Death without Eternity.
And as I was on the Cross and saw the Light
In The Illustrious Ordo Scio.
There is no need of eyes in the Total Absence
Ad nor a body to Fly Towards the Unknown

All Hail Lucifer!

Only He is The Way
âAnd the Light Shineth in Darkness
And the Darkness Comprehended notâ
âMaher Shalal Hash Bazâ
Sacred is the Legacy of the Serpent
Holy is the Line of Cain.
