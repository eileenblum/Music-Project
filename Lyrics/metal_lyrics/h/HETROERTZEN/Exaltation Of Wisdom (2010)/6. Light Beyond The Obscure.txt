Millions of Souls waiting
at the Giant Gate of Light
In this Temple of Sorrow
No Star and Moon shines anymore
Just the Rays of the Afterlife blinding Us.
Like the Most Terrifying Beast
The Angel of Perdition opens his mouth
In this Solemn Moment
when We all in Spirit
will receive the Sacred Eternal Flame.

An Oracle between this World and The Other...
Now when the Veil falls we see the Truth
And Destroy Our Enemy!
The Only Hell were ever here!
Peace is the Absolute Darkness
Which came before this Light
But the True Light lies far beyond the Dying Sun
There is no Form, no Matter, no Time, no Pain, no Death.
The Endless Hole of Nothingness
Devours all False Light shining in Space.

Darkness is patient and will finally embrace the Whole Creation.
The Mouth of âEvilâ swallows all Human Souls
Smashing all your Gods and taking away the sense of your Life
But the Unknown Sparkle Cannot Die!

And when your Fall is approaching
They shall Cast you Down...
If you are not able to follow the Left Hand Path.
Knowledge is the Key... Wisdom is the Gateway...

IA LUX! IA KHAOS!

Release your Spirit and join Us!
