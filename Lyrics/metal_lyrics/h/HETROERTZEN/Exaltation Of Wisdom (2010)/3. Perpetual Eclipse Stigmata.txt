Dragons shall breathe Fire upon Humanity
When the Tree of Life comes unto this World
The Sun shall be Blackened by the Moon
as it never been before
Take us Oh Lord!
We do no need this anymore!
We seek the Cosmic Belt
and the Last Ray taking Our Flesh

Listen to the Voice of Chaos
Follow the Call of Nothingness
Close you eyes and witness
the pure Fright without fear
Feel the Cold of Darkness
Take away your Soul
Spit upon the Face of âGodâ.
Thy Will Be Done.

Prayers of Plague emerging from the Grey Smoke
Chanting True Blasphemous Choirs.
Three white dressed girls walking in Cataleptic Trance
Old bones burning slowly inside the Trapezoidal Coffin.
Witness the Zenith of Dome like the Dead lying down
Kiss of Innocence... Embrace the neverending Madness
Blood dripping into the Mouth of the Impure
Dressed in Scarlet... Feed the Horror &amp; Sadness
Raise the hands and Appoint the Stars
Behold the Chalice filled from the Snake's Tongue
Here is the Poison Of Ecstasy for the Chosen Ones
Don't resist the True Call from heaven
Sing the Sacred Unholy Songs.
Black Smoke is emerging Now
And the Prayers of Plague Arise!
