Incense of Cracked Human Bones
and a Glass of Human Blood
Vision of the Cranial Cave
and a Lightning into Emptiness

Voe Bor Ekna Ashtar

Speak The Name... Enma AI!
Hypnotised by the Blue Flame
Blinded by a Shadow from the Purple Stone
It is time to Renounce yourself
If Enlightened you wish to be
As those who seek entry here.

Boil your mind in Coldness inside the Tunnel
See yourself flying over the Fog. 
Use your eye (The Eye) and see âHimâ watching you.
Sleep and hear âHisâ voice after a Restless Nightmare
Feel His hand touching your headâ¦ 
- Follow the Words of the Serpent Priests -
- Crawl on your belly as the Ancient Ones -

Is not this the Real Magick?
The true sense of the Symbolism and Allegory 
Here is the Royal Art and the Mystery of All Mysteries.
The Throne awaits until the Final Triumph is Complete!
âMay the Spirit of this skull (The Skull of the World)
Raise against you if you betray the Path of the Only Salvationâ
Now Dress the Scarlet Diamondâ¦

Vajra!

Donât see Below 
Donât follow the Illusion
Sign your Pact without return
And you will see âThemâ while travelling 
Beyond the Stars.
