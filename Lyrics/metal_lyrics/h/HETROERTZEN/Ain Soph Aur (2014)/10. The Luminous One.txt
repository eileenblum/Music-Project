Benedictus qui veni in nomine Domine. 

All are one and one is all. 
Their kingdom is not of this world. 
Those who from heaven to earth came 
And those who travel across the sky. 

Those whose name is mystery of all mysteries. 
And here we do their sacred work. 
We who have their mark and sear their essence. 

Darken to enlighten. 
Take to give. 
Destroy to create. 
Die to live. 

Oh thou Luminous One! 
Thou who see us all 
And give us the sign to reunite 
As that time immemorial. 

We gathered and established your temple 
And followed the stairs to your grace. 
The gates are opened. 
The aye is shining! 

Now this time which come to pass 
Like an old graveyard long forgotten. 
Sealed the faith of those who held the keys. 

No one shall speak 
No one shall know 
About the things that are coming. 
They who seek shall not fearâ¦
