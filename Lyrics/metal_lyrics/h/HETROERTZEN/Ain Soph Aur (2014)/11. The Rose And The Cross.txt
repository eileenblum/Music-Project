My hand is the hammer and the nail. 
My eyes are now the destiny. 
My voice is death in this world. 
My dagger is the star that lights your flame. 

Your body is the plague consuming your thoughts. 
I am the serpent inside your mouth. 
When I pour the wine upon your head 
You look into my shadow while I take your breath. 

Then you feel the Christ! 

You come with old life 
And face death. 
But there is no way back 
Once I have baptized with water and fire. 

Death with Love. 
You wish the Light! 

The kiss of death and dropping innocence. 
The flower that came back to life. 
And the snake that died in love. 

I show you the way of the cross. 
And your rose will kill a star tonight. 

You wish the Lightâ¦
