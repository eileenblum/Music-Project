We are the first and the one 
We are the last and the all. 

We summon the spirit of Anubis 
We attend the setting sun. 

With fire through the light to the night. 
The calling for Neburah 
And the opening (of A) 

One obelisk shining 
One obelisk burning 
Two times infinite 
And the gems sparkling as a thousand stars. 

Those who know where to seek us 
For we know where they are 
And henceforth call their names 
When we watch through the mirror. 

The sun (of YHVH) shall never rise again 
When you find yourselves as you really are. 

We show you the skull and the cross bones 
Because there is life after death. 

You shall see when your eyes are shut 
And trough pain and fear you shall arise 
To the scarlet king 
And contemplate the fallen starâ¦ 
â¦ Behold the angel of light.
