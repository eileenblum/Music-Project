The source of life crossing the Eye
Existenceâ¦ Extinction.
Chaotic consumption 
Beyond worlds of infinite power inside our bodies.
Emanating blackness
And a storm of white Fire.
Our hands to the Egyptian Sun
Warming our soul and Spirit.

A new dawn will shine in gold
For we are their children and carry on their legacy.
To the old Priests and Masters.
For the new leaders.
Brothersâ¦ Sistersâ¦ the time is upon us.

Through pain and fearâ¦
Through lust and love.
We shall prevail.
The Sacred Structure shall never fall
Because we are its pillars.

A new dawn is coming
A new beginning will emerge.
From dusk to dawn
From shadows to Light
And from the depths to the stars 
Two Gods of old and two towers.
Two ways and one single gate
To the sacred eye of the Serpent.
Look up from the depths
To the stars.
