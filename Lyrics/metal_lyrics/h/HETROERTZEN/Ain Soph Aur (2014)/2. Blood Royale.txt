And the serpent (of old) whispered
The cross became a tomb
And the tomb became a womb.
The veil of death reveals its secrets and it says there will be no more tears.
Birth, death and rebirth.
Blood is life!

A spirit caught in the mirror
That takes us into the light
Because we chose darkness.
We who comprehend its language
And the mind of the reptiles.
We who see the eye inside the trapezoid.
Of that unfinished tower.
Which pyramid shall be erected
In the astral realm
By those who have experienced symbolic death!

Our work have been insulted
By the one who claim himself âThe  Almightyâ.
Whose nature curses our bloodline
In revenge for the wars fought in the heavens
From time immemorial
Long before the valley of tears.

Our sign shall prevail within our brotherhood.
The cross, our symbol of misery
Has fallen under our feet
And once again our spirit has risen.
The truth will set us free.
You and me as one
Consecrated in blackness.
Sealing our fate.
