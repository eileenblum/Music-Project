Men of god and angels of light
Distinguished as hunters and prey
And as angels and demons
That walked the lands
And swam the oceans

Were the giants
As it is written
When the civilized man spake
And called the Great Duke
Of the ancient worlds
The hunters listened from afar
Enshrouded their spires like caressing silver tongues
To reach for the fruit of the astral life and further

But the citizens had not fallen
Not had they fallen in vain
For they are instructed
And hence the civilized man
Can never divulge in the state of mind
Of the hunter

But the civilization beheld their mysteries
Encounters and relations with unknown intelligence
And they pled their consciousness
Circulating in the current
Spirit Eater
