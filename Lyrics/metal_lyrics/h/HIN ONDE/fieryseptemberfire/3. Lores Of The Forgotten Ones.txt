For Ages Have Inquisitive Minds
Endeavoured To Enter These Woods
To Seek The Secrets of Our Sorcery.

But Those Who Trespass These Forests
Can Never Leave Her Alive.
Many Have Tried To Escape The Sea.
But Seas Are In Control of Our Might.

And The Storm Will Rise,
And Th Seas Shall Roam
And All Their Ships Will Sink
Now Only The Sea Whispers The Name
Of The ones Who Judged Their Wicked Fate.
