Glittering Mails To Warriors High
Strongest Blades To Men of Steel
Blades Upon Which We Shall Rise

We're The ones With The Paganheart
Proud Is Our Spirit,
Our Will Is Hard
We're The Ones With The Paganheart
To Conquer Back What Once Was Ours

Blades Which Will Cut Your Throats
Endowed With Unimaginable Strength
We Will Reduce You To Silence...

And So The Night Became And The
Battle Begun
One By one We Cut Down The Enemies
We Are Less In Number, But Our
Will Is Strong As Steel.
And So We March Under The
Banner of Ancient Pagan Empire!
