Awakening At Dawn, To Horns Alarming Call.
Ships From The West Had Been Seen Heading
Towards Us. With The Sign of Cross They Would
Come To Enslave Our Land. In Vein They Spill Blood
Because Blind They Are To See. We Never Will Be
Slain, Our Heritage Will Always Remain.

Over These Hills
Along These Lakes,
In The Spirit of These Woods,
In Wind They'll Hear Our Call.

They'll Feel It In Their Heart As It Flows Through
Their Veins. With Northern Pride And Honour Will
Northmen See True From False. And False Men Will
Not Long Rule These Lands. There Will Come A Time
When Northmen In Our Spirit Will Draw Their Blades
Again...

No Matter How Outnumbered We Saddled Our Horses
Took Our Swords And Our Shields.
And Towards The Seashore Each one Headed.
Soon Realized Our Foes That We Can Not Be
Persuaded To Their Will.

But Neither Are We Here To Die.
We Came For Our Honour And For Our Heathen Pride.
After First Horse Galloped Ahead No Steps Were
Taken Back... Berserk We Fight!

And We Ride Forth,
And We Ride Forth,
Until Last of Us Will Fall.
