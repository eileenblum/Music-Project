Only short time to us allowed before the urn
Like flames of solstice the let us burn
Skyhigh let us be in the fire ascending
Earth stays below, the spirit heavenwards tending
Ukko, you mightiest of all
To you we raise our toasts
To unite you with all our living
With all our dead once more

Fare now forth
The rune-might is drawn
Strike in the wilderness
Hammer in the woods

Ruler of the rain
Master of winds
Fare now forth
Ukonvasara

And when the seeds have been sown in the spring
To the ashes of our past slept kin
We raise our chalices to embrace your might
Galdrs shall be heard spiralling towards the skies
Ukko, you mightiest of all
Old man of the sky
High above the clouds you dwell
In the center of the sky
