I broke off a branch of rowan-tree
And sensed the sign of an approaching gale
I drank the Ukkoâs chalice
And summoned the spirits of storm

At the crown of the mythic world
I raised my Galdr
Forceful rapids, the infinite sea
Echoing between the hilltops

Endless thirst for wisdom
For water of the fountain black
I shall carve silver from wood
On stormcircle, burning, flaming blue

A journey through a lifetime
On luckless lands of north
Answers hidden by the winters veil
Destinyâs driven, forgotten, forlorn

Just tears of silver upon the water of deepest black
Longing for a new spring
When the olden shant, shall in circles echo mighty once more

âNoskaat norosta myrskyn henget,
Hiekasta hevosvÃ¤kit,
Miekkamiehet liettehestÃ¤...â
In the center of the sky
