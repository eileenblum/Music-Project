Beneath the darken autumn sky
Towards the great unseen
Scent of the calming sea
The world is closing in for sleep
Now moon sets its flaming path
Upon the waves of darkest black
With stars burning ever so bright

Forger of skies
Master of winds
Sail with us on this perilous journey

Guide your way with the light of your stars
Carry us with the breath of your wind
Guard our journeys beyond the sea

Raise the winds
Calm the storms
Great firmanent divine
