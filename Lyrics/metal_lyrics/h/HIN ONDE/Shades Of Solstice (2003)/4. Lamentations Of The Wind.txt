It seemed to him
Like he had wandered for at least a lifetime
When a whistling sound unknown came to him
Like lamentations of the wind

He longed to immerse his sword
To Tuonelaâs magical water
Make for himself
The deadliest weapon ever known

A whistling sound
Like lamentations of the wind
In the old forest began to drive him
Towards insanity

Finally he noticed a black river
Streching before him
He had reached his dream
But it was just the halfway of his journey
He knew the return from Tuonela
Would be even more difficult
Than finding it ever was
