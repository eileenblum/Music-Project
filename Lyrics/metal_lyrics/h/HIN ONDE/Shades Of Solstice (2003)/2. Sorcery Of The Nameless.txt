On a nameless meadow
By ageless time
On a borderless field
The dreams drift on by
By rhythm of the moon
By melody of the fire
This moment is longer
Here slows down the time
Similar steps behind
Canât grand a new beginning
The scent of the purest
Primordial night

Winterâs pale light, stretches its cobwebs
Through these shadows, livelier than ever

Each bright sphere of the moon
Gleams in magic
The nightâs sounds of wild
Accompany the beats
Of this out tuned dance
Until silence
Cuts in deep and claws
The branches are barely moving
Yet the windâs howl splits ears
One sight can cover more
Till cores, till cells, till meanings
For a glimpse of a lifetime
For a second of eternity
Turn warmer the blood again
Assemble the breath of life
