The archaic traveller
Iâve touched the sky
Followed the universal steps
Far beyond mortal understanding
Iâve danced with elementary powers
At the nameless meadow up high

Iâve tasted wisdom
Iâve tasted pain
For a great eternity Iâve existed
The eternal spectator
The archaic traveller

The equilibrium unbalanced
Behold the wrath of gods
The fury of the elements
Vortex of cosmic chaos

The archaic traveller
Iâve seen planets being born
From the supreme primal chaos
Iâve sailed the storming rivers of time
Since the beginning
To these times of the ends

But mortal remember that:
Rooms are small in Tuonela
Underground chambers narrow
No moonbeams, no sunshine
Desolate may your lifeâs morning be
But more desolate the deathâs evening
