Longer grow the nights, until days are everdark
And from frostbitten soil rekindles the skyâs fire again
And the age old song of the new day, echoes over campfire, calling back the light

Ferns whistling beneath my weary feet
Sunâs last orange beams twinkle from the midst of fluttering leaves
Through treacherous bogs, above the dykes
Towards the bleary sights of sundown twilights

My horse galloping, my gown flittering
On the mountains clefts and gullies
Endlessly cheerlessly these crests are looming

Each day as I wander, I feel like home
Every night by the embers fire I dream the regions I go

Longer grow the days, winning over the nights
Until fire sets its blazing wings beyond your reach to sleep
And the age old wind of the new night, blows back the shades from the worldâs edge
