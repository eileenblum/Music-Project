[Music and Lyrics by NRQ]

Night arrives again in the northern woods
Cloaking all light under its dim hood
All is silent except for the winds mellow croon
Echoing in the midwinter night

And when shadeof the swan reflects from ice
You will know that someone has died
And when the wind blows from the north
you can hear the souls cry

And in the moon's pale light
Death took the form of an swan
Up from the depths of Tuonela it rose to its wings
Age old song of death it sings

And when shade of the swan reflects from ice
You will know that someone has died
And when the wind blows from the north
As she silently flies through the nightskies
