[Music / Lyrics by NRQ]

The ravens have returned
To the snowy hills
Winter is here again
But this time it is forever

I hear the winds summon me
The winds call my name
I hear the winds summon me
It's time to meet again

The time has arrived
At last
This is the fimbulwinter

See the dark clouds form in the sky
The winterstorms arrive
Flowers of frost abloom
I can hear the icy winds call my name

I hear the winds summon me
The winds call my name
I hear the winds summon me
It's time to meet again

The time has arrived
At last
This is the fimbulwinter

This is the fimbulwinter!
