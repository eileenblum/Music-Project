[Music by NRQ / Lyrics by NRQ and Wircki]

Once on my wintry journeys
Resting in the gloomy light
Of thousand stars in sight
My sword by my side and my hood pulled warmly over me

I filled my lungs
With chill scent of the night
And closed my eeyes for a good night's sleep, I closed my eyes

I saw two ravens circle in the sky
Soaring high, within the treetops they flied,
One came down to me and croaked in a weird language that strangely made
perfect sense to me

"If it's knowledge you seek, please do
follow me, I will lead you to a man,
the greatest man of all"

[Ref.]
I cleansed my soul in the thousand lakes,
Bathed my heart in the streams of knowledge,
I cleansed my soul in the thousand lakes,
Bathed my heart in the streams of knowledge

I followed the ravens across the woods
Until we came to a place near mountains root,
There was an cavern carved in stone,
Carved in Stone
An old man stood there alone
One eyed he was, cloaked in hood
Softly he spoke, invited me into his hut
He showed me things I couldn't believe

He showed me places I didn't know existed,
He teached me wisdom far beyond my imagination

[Ref]

Be hailed ye God of gods
Be hailed ye all wise
O' Odin all knowing
Be hailed, ye hailed be
