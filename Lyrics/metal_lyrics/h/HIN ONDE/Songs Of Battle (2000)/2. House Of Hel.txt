[Music and Lyrics by NRQ]

Follow me into the water
Across the river
Follow me to my death
Into a new world

Cold dark and misty
Adobe of the dead
In the world of Nifelheim
The House of Hel

Guarded by Garm, the House of Hel
Gjoll the Impassable encircles the realm
Helheim, world of the dead where no life dwells
Once you have entered you'll never leave

Follow me into the water
Across the river
Follow me to my death
Into a new world

Hraesvelg the corpse eater
Watches over the realm
In the form of an eagle
He makes the winds blow

Guarded by Garm, the House of Hel
Gjoll the Impassable encircles the realm
Helheim, world of the dead where no life dwells
Once you have entered you'll never leave
