[Music by NRW &amp; Wircki / Lyrics by Wircki]

From Tuonela the worms crawl to earth to gnaw the living
To bring forth the death on whose formless shadows I ride
From the soil of dreary lake Alue arrive the worms with Manala's fire
To burn the living to ashes!

[Ref.]
And thrice on a summer night
Lake Alue foams sky high
It's burning ash fills lungs of life
It's shores scorch dead black

In the shades of this devastation I seek the dying
Under fiery skies where only swan who glides is a burning kind
Evoke the end, unleash the deviltry
It's time for the harvest of mine

[Ref.]

Hin Onde - Burning the Lake Alue
