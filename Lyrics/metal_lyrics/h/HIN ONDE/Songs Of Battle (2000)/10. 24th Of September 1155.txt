[Music by NRQ / Lyrics by Wircki]

Awakening at dawn, to horns alarming call
Ships from the west had been seen heading towards us
With the sign of cross they enslave our land
In vain they spill blood because blind they are to see

We will never be slain
Our heritage will always remain
Over these hills, along these lakes
In the spirit of these woods they'll hear our calls

They'll feel it in their hearts as it flows through their veins
With northern pride northmen see true from false
And false men will not long rule these lands
The warrior in us will wake again!

We will never be slain
Our heritage will always remain
Over these hills, along these lakes
In the spirit of these woods they'll hear our calls
And we ride forth, [x3]
Until the last of us will fall!

No matter how outnumbered
We took our shields, saddled our horses, drew our blades
Towards seashore eachone headed
Our foes realised we can not be persuaded to their will

But neither are we here to die
We came for our honour and for our heathen pride
After first horse galloped ahead no steps were taken back
Berserk we fight
And we ride forth, [x3]
Until the last of us will fall!
