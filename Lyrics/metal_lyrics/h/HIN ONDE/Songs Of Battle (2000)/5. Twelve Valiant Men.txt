[Music by Wircki / Lyrics by NRQ]

Take the breastplates of your ancestors
Pick up the shields and mighty swords
Take the powerful helmets and saddle your horses
The horn has sounded for the sign of the battle!

[Ref.]
Onwards to battle they rode
Twelve Valiant Men
Unsheat your fathers' swords
Warriors from the north

Through snow and ice they bravely ride
With flags raised up high
The banner of the ancient pagan empire
The sign for their enemies to die!

[Ref.]

Swords swing, steel sings, no mercy to the enemy!
Onwards the enemy marches under the sign of the cross
