New day is waking and i
Can't seem to find my way out
I'm trapped inside my world
And I'm not coming back
I hear the voices calling
That speaks and tells to do
There's no refusing in their words
Orders I must follow through

[Pre-Chorus:]
See them walking hear them talking
Playing games helplessly your mind
I've come to play with you
Simply nothing you can do

[Chorus:]
We're eye to eye
Good day to die
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood it's a good day to die

I do not care for laughter
Something I've not done before
My mind recalls the beatings
Till I could see no more
Again the voices calling
That speaks and tells to do
There's no refusing their words
Orders I must follow through

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

People all around are laughing at me
Just can't figure why they are so happy
Must've never had abusive daddy
Must've never had to kill your mommy

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
