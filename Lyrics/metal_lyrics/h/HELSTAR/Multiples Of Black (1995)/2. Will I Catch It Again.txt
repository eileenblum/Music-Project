Take a look at my sad face
It's the only one I have
I'm chasing a cold dream
That I may never find

[Pre-Chorus:]
I've played and I've gambled
Never denied my faith
I'm calling, please save me
You can hear me pray

Blacking wears my star
Is life burning out
I'm reaching you're out there
I know you're very far

[Chorus:]
I'm out here alone
Don't know where I'm going
The dream is flying by
Will I catch it again

I will make this dream come true
If it's the last thing I do
Deep inside the pain still curls
I'll be someone in the world

[Chorus (x2)]
