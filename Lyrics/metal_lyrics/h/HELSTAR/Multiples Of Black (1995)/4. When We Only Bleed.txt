Longing for the answers, I'm searching my mind
Reaching for a darkened tomorrow I find
Deep inside our soul and blood are the same
On the outside a destructible fame
To accept so many times we try
But all we want to do is make each other cry

And I always wonder who's to blame
We're only taught how to play this game
Racial walls saw no otherwise
Pessimistic all the hate the despise
But now I think it's time we open our eyes
Or children of tomorrow keep paying the price

Segregation through the years has grown
Still we're made of same flesh and bone
So what we speak in different native tongue
The good book said we were made as one

[Chorus:]
Can't you see we're all the same now
Can't you see we're all the same now
Can't you see we're all the same now
Shame it shows when we only bleed
