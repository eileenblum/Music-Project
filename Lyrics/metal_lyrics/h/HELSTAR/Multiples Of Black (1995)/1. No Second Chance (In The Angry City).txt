Deep in the angry city
The hatred starts to wake
You and the boys and their turf
Another chance to take
Mom and dad told you
Never steal or hate
Vandalize to compromise
Duties through the night

[Pre-Chorus:]
Frustrations only grow
A face of hatred shows
Rivalry is all you know
To rule the streets, to run the show

[Chorus:]
To prove your grounds
You proudly take a stance
Its time again to fight
Its time to dance
The hour is here to take a chance
Turn back and you take a second glance

You wear the uniform
That picks your side
You were danger to help
Feed your pride
Influent leaders
Control pressure closes in
Fight you must or die commit
The final sin

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Another city boy played with
Killing toys
Toys that took his life
His mama cries
You have nothing left
To confess
So troubled child
You can rest
Come tomorrow whoï¿½ll remember
Whoï¿½ll know you
Your stay has become nothing new
Weï¿½ve accepted your ways
Life in the angry city
Where youï¿½ll find no reasoning
Where youï¿½ll find no pity

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
