I closed my eyes and sleep
Came on so strong
Began to dream and
This is what I saw
Change in the sky
I'm shorter of breath
The silhouette, a black mask of death

[Chorus:]
No one ever tried
So now hear our cries
As heat and darkness rise
Black silhouette skies

Seemed real so scared
I shook away my sleep
Ran out to see
A sky blue and clear
Struck from terror
From the blackened sight
Like heavy rain birds
Fell from the sky

[Chorus]

I close my eyes just
Wishing for sleep
So I can dream of a sky
I once knew
The fight for life we must
Live locked away
Black silhouette upon
Night and day

[Chorus]
