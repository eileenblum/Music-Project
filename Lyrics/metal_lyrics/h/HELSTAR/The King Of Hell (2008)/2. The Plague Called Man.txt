Murderers, the world falls dead
Beautiful blackened skies
Reflect upon the streaks of red
Nothing, is what we are
A bottomless pit of darkness
IN search of souls to scar

Witness, the lawless swarm
Self inflicted holocaust
Worship the God of Scorn

The plague called man
Ruler of barren horizons
And vast empty lands

A manifest dream of desolation
Dark shadows spread across
All of his deadly creations
Death incarnate, our world euthanized
Lying in state,
Mouring our own demise

Witness, the lawless swarm
Self inflicted holocaust
Worship the God of Scorn

The plague called man
Ruler of barren horizons
And vast empty lands

Creator of cataclysms
Agent of destruction
Apocalyptic visions
Relent to these seductions

All of our tears are shed in vain
For spitting at God
Vengeance is slow and filled with pain
Destitute, unholy vision
Deep is the slumber
That calls us into submission

Witness, the lawless swarm
Self inflicted holocaust
Worship the God of Scorn

The plague called man
Ruler of barren horizons
And vast empty lands
