The morning star, I covet your throne
Denouncing your slaves I claim as my own
Master of darkness, creator of lies
Burdened with envy my beauty despised
I born of fire I will not prostate
He made of clay I will seal his fate
My music of beauty now music of sin
Devouring mankind I will draw him

Bow down to the king of hell

A blackened heart you've sentenced to die
Tears are falling, falling from the sky
Your angel of light now an angel of darkness
Eternal betrayer, the tormenting temptress
I curse the heavens as I fall
Angels gathered one and all
Descent from heaven your final command
Denounced, condemned into fiery land

Bow down to the king of hell

Blackness fills your sky of blue
Smoke and fire is my hand of doom
Falling from grace bringing hate divine
Pain and sorrow fill their hearts and minds

The war in heaven you think you have won
The battle for souls has only begun
Good and evil now given birth
Hate will spread upon your earth
Breather of death and destruction I am
A prince of deceit, the lord of the damned.
