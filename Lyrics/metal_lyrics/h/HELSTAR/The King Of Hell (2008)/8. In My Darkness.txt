Deep inside this cavity
In the caverns of my soul
The eternal pit of rage
Begins to overflow

Choking every ray of light
No one hears their killing pleas
Consuming every drop of life
Only I can set them free

I keep searching
For the things I can never find
Dark thoughts keep lurking
Cruel and unkind
There is no refuge
Only hatred that transcends
I cant stand the deluge
Of tears for the condemned

In my darkness
I am the waking dream
In my darkness
I reign supreme

Ill find peace
In the solace of despair
Anguish released
On the naÃ¯ve and unaware
Shrouded in the glory
Of my lovely scorn
Deviant story
Of the broken, ripped and torn

In my darkness
I am the waking dream
In my darkness
I reign supreme

I'm your savior
Your betrayer
Liberator
Your enslaver

Demonic voice
Infiltrates my mind
I will rejoice
As reality unwinds
On my killing spree
Your sins I will erase
The last thing you'll see
Is my fucking stoic face

In my darkness
I am the waking dream
In my darkness
I reign supreme
