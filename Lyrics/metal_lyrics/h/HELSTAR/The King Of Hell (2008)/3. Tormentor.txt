I'm the cross that you bare
The darkness of the sky
I'm your crown of thorns
Your never-ending cry
I'm the rusted nails
That pierced your hands and feet
I'm the pointed spear
That's buried in you deep

Now it all begins
The torment never ends
How much must you bleed?
To fill my lustful needs

Oh now the torture's sublime
Over and over you die
But I'll keep you alive
So the hatred inside me can thrive

I'm your Via Dolorosa
The thirst that will not be quenched
I'm the place of the skull
With claws firmly entrenched
I'm the dogs that surround you
The dislocation of bones
I'm the spit on your face
Abandoned and all alone
Now it all begins
The torment never ends
How much must you bleed?
To fill my lustful needs

Oh now the torture's sublime
Over and over you die
But I'll keep you alive
So the hatred inside me can thrive

I'm the whips that shred your back
The sun that burns your skin
You are but the forsaken
I'm the anguish within
I'm the dust in your eyes
The softest kiss of betrayal
I'm the pain in your side
The final abhorrent exhale
Now it all begins
The torment never ends
How much must you bleed?
To fill my lustful needs

Oh now the torture's sublime
Over and over you die
But I'll keep you alive
So the hatred inside me can thrive
