I feel pain because I can
I feel pain therefore I am
Focus on the twisting, turning
Focus on the breaking, burning
Self inflicted ways of bleeding
Pain addicted, always needing

Merciless and unbending
Misery unending

Pain
Pain will be thy name
Pain
Pain will be thy name

It takes me to the darkest place
Envelops me in its cold embrace
It takes me to where time stands still
Where pain destroys but does not kill
I feel pain because its real
It is God before I kneel

I feel pain, it speaks no lies
I feel pain, it hears no cries

Pain
Pain will be thy name
Pain
Pain will be thy name

Poised and calm, endless sting
A silent bomb, my dearest king
Sliding down the razors edge
My loyalty to you I pledge

The veil of blood that coats my skin
My panacea, perpetual sin
Rancid smell of sweat and steel
Scars that never mend or heal
Shards of glass that slice and tear
Rotting fetor fills the air

I close my eyes and lie in wait
For precious pain to seal my fate

Pain
Pain will be thy name
Pain
Pain will be thy name
