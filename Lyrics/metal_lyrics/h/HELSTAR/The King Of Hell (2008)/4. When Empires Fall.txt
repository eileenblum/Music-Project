Global warming, mammoth the storms, disease inflicting such pain
Prophets of doom, unleash this hell, complete devastation
Blood red skies showers of acid rain
Environmental abuse takes its toll, natures anger prevails

Humanities logistic waste of time
Parasites sucking their own blood dry

When empires fall
Well see them crawl
Awaiting deaths call

Horrid eyes stare through a mask of deteriorating flesh
Terror struck beyond belief as chaos multiplies
The day has come for man to pay for his sins
Destroying and changing, the failed rearranging, life form slowly dies

Festering fate spreading out of control
Toxic breath embraces their souls

When empires fall
Well see them crawl
Awaiting deaths call

Watching your loved ones die
Hearing the helpless cries
The wage for man made sin
This is the end

Humanities logistic waste of time
Parasites sucking their own blood dry

When empires fall
Well see them crawl
Awaiting deaths call
