I see you wince in agony
You scream in prayer but no one hears
Get off your knees and stand by me
I'm here to cleanse you of your fears

I know your hearts desires
To bathe in heavenly fires
To be the king of kings
To have the knowledge of all things

This weight is far too much to bear
The whole worlds coming down on you
You think those people even care?
About the pain that you'll go through

I know your hearts desires
To bathe in heavenly fires
To be the king of kings
To have the knowledge of all things

Pleas for mercy fade into the night!!

This chalice will not pass from you
The blood you sweat smells of your doom
Your fathers words have all been lies
Take my hand, you'll never die

The garden of temptation
The garden of temptation
The garden of temptation
