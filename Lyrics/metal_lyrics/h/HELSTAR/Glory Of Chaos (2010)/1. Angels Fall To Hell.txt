Your houses are burning
You'll be the one to bend your knees
Your flock is lost and not returning
Exposed what you hoped no one would see.

The innocence you stole was never yours to keep
Hell is what sow and hell is what you'll reap.

Hidden in your shrines
Where all your secrets dwell
You can't deny the crime
When angels fall to hell.

Clutching at your golden chalices.
Disintegrating quickly into dust
In the safety of your empty palaces
The luster of your lies has turned to rust.

The path you paved has led the lambs astray
Dismembered faith lies rotting and decayed
Gaze upon you with a jaundice eye
Hell awaits your soul when you die.
