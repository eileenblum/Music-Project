Spread your wings black vulture
Feast upon the suicide culture
War is my way of life
A foreigner of peace and a native of strife.

Monarch of Bloodshed
A crown of shrapnel wrapped around my head.

These are desperate acts
They're more than just vicious attacks
Terror is a weapon of the weak
It's the only way the world can hear me speak.

Monarch of Bloodshed
A crown of shrapnel wrapped around my head
Monarch of Bloodshed
Killing zone to avenge the dead.

Blood soaked sand
Contaminated holy land
Bullets to anoint
Oppression past the breaking point
Prayers to recite
Bombs wired to ignite
I choose my time to die
My soul will tear a hole up in the sky.
