Famine, war, destruction almost pleasant to the view
Natural catastrophes, so tell me what is new
The picture you are painting says doomsday's on rise
A Glimpse of apocalypse, all we see in our eyes.

You are pandemonium
You are the madness that lives in our minds
You are pandemonium
You are the sadness that's keeping us blind.

Selling only fear and the rise of discontent
Assassination of truth, monocracy turned violent
Enabler, instigator, the bringer of all grief
Blessed are the horrors the panic on which we feed.

Only negative deception, corruption, lunacy
A system failed surrounds us, collapse of society
Anarchy, nihilism, the worse is yet to come
Lawlessness, disorder, to frantic news succumbed.
