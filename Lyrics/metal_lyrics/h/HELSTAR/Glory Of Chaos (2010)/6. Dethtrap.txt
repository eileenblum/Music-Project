Welcome to my sick philosophy
Welcome to insanity
Into my sadistic game of desperate survival
For pleasure, my amusement, twisted revival

No one escapes my asylum
Scorched alive or sliced by the pendulum

So many have tried
Before you that died
Clues to unwrap
Inside my deathtrap

Inside my muse you will partake
Scanning your every move you make
In which room does death await in there
Once you step into the killing zone
there is no time to spare

How much can you take the lunacy
How long before you break into frenzy
Do you stand a chance in this puzzle of despair
One wrong move you meet your fate,
with every turn beware
