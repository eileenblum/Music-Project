Punishment, vehement sweat
A searing pain you won't forget
As vicious as my hounds of war
Come living hordes to settle score
A vacant stake to immolate the beast like you

What of the ash that remains
Are we not the same
The lifeblood that runs through our veins
Why can't they see
The worst enemy is the one shouting up to the pyre

Repent in fire
As you ignite upon the mire
Repent in fire
And pray that your forsaken corpse expires

Blasphemous, such influence
Manipulate the innocent
Starving wait our hounds of war
Clawing out your coffin door
A sacrificial mound awaits the pest like you
Cry his name while fire tears your flesh in two

Now look at those we have slain
We bear this sword in vain
The curse lay in cinder's remains
Soon they will see
Our worst enemy is the one shouting up to the pyre

Ominous with bane from hence
These mortals bathe in ignorance
More vicious than their hounds of war
Beneath the dirt where once was gore
Soaring from the dust the beast will thrust on you

What of the scars that remain
Yet to heal the pain
A wound that time has sustained
Vengeance is swift from our fangs

Bitter and starving we hunt through the night
The mortals shall fall to my enchanted bite
Your wings up towards heaven won't lift off the ground
Tied to the stake and bound

Repent in fire
As you ignite upon the mire
Repent in fire
And pray to the devil for you shall not expire
