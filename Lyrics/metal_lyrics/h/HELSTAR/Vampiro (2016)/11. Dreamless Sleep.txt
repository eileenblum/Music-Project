As sure as sun sets in the west
My frigid caress at her heart's request

Pleading, crying
To join the dying
Death is more than just a dreamless sleep

She'd endlessly grieve to be without thee
I proceed, to give unto her as was taken from me

Crying, pleading
Love lies bleeding
Death may be but just a dreamless sleep
