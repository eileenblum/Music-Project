Stowaways, and so they walked the plank
We were searching for the given treasure
Impatient hearts the dream seemed too far
A raging sea causing fear and pressure

Shipwrecked but only for awhile, we'll build again
Sail through stormy wind and rain
Hungry hearts holding on to faith
The sea will calm, we'll conquer once again

[Chorus:]
Abandon ship, for those who dreamed to small
Abandon ship in the sea of shame they fall
Abandon ship again we sail alone
Abandon ship their dreams become unknown

Years have passed and so the story carries on
The expedition, where answers may be unfound
Sailing through horizons, we've never seen before
Healing the wound, never looking homeward bound

[Chorus]

[Solo]

A time ago, courageously they joined
All as one, we shared that golden dream
The course grew rough, their weakness took control
The journey to success was not all it seemed

Who has the will, who dares climb aboard
Sail beyond, where there is no truth, there are no lies
A destiny where time will tell
The vision of our dreams is still gleaming in our eyes

[Solo]

[Chorus]
