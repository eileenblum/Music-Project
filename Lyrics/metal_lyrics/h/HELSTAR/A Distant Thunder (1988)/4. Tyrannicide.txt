[Solo]

The silence is broken, by nightmarish dreams
You have been chosen to finish the deed
Our tyrant is falling, we must make a stand
You have the calling to take his command
Once he was strong, he conquered the weak
Now he is gone, it is he who we seek
He is in hiding, protecting his soul
He's tired of fighting, so go for his throat
And then cut out his heart, you'll take over his throne
And from there you will start
Fall of the tyrant. Death to the tyrant
Kill the old tyrant. Tyrannicide

Once you have found him, the task is half done
You should surround him, so he cannot run
Pull out your dagger and give him a slice
Laugh as he staggers, yes laugh as he dies
You will be bound to do unholy things
You drink the nectar the blood of your queens
Fall of the tyrant, death to the tyrant
Kill the old tyrant. Tyrannicide

A faceless leader you shall be
Pitiless and cold, the epitome of tyranny
The world you will control
You will live to kill and they will live to die
No one escapes the tyrants grasp
Not them, nor you, nor I

[Solo]

Now your alone, decrepit and old
You won't be dethroned, your the last living soul
You destroyed all of those who once bowed at your feet
Now the question you pose, who is left to defeat?
Day after day, you pray for the end
No one hears what you say, you're your only best friend
You've past the point of insanity
Now the world's your asylum
But you won't be set free
You'll wait for the end of time
Then you'll be cast into the ominous silence of death
