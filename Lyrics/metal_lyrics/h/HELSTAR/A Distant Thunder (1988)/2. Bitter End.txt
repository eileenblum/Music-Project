It's been fifty years behind us
But the war is still raging on
There's a killer deep inside us
Who yearns to see the dawn
All our comrades who have perished
They have met their destiny
Now the bullets that we cherish
Right now is all we need

[Chorus:]
We must fight for our right
We must find what you call sanctuary
It is kill or be killed
Only death from above sets us free

In the field of honor
In a zone that has no time
Where blood is thick as water
To murder is not a crime
One goal that we're headed for
To claim our victory
Attacks upon the land and shore
Men die endlessly

[Chorus]

[Solo]

The poison we have tasted
Has blinded our minds
The cities devastated
It is he or I defined
This boy is never coming back
The gun is my best friend
Trained to kill one in his tracks
On the road to the bitter end

[Chorus (x2)]
