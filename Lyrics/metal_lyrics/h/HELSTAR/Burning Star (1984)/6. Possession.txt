You play around with me if I were a toy
After taking my life full of joy
And still around when I don't want you near
You only wish is to fill me up with fear

You're possessing me
I don't like what I see
You're possessing me
Oh! just let me be

You're controlling my thoughts day by day
You tell me lies and wrong games to play
And like a fool I do as I am told
While you just laugh as you steal away my soul

You're possessing me
I don't like what I see
You're possessing me
Oh! just set me tree

Daylight's fading, I'm lost and confused
It seems to me this game I'm gonna lose
Going insane our job is being done
Now are you pleased to know another
One you've won

You're possessing me
I don't like what I see
You're possessing me
Oh! just let me be

You're possessing me
I don't like what I see
You're possessing me
Hell! I don't want to see
