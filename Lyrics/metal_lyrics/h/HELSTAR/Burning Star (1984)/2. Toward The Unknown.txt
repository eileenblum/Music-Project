The vultures thrive, the senseless drive
The battle raged with wrath
The warrior rides with sword at hand
Conquering his path
No one knows just where he goes
When the dust all clears
For he's nowhere to be seen
Some say he disappears!

Castles tower overhead
The warrior rambles on
He never stops to grace the night
He rides to meet the dawn
Kings beware immortal man
He'll surely strike you down
Determined in his lasting will
He's come to wear your crown

Look up to the mountains
Watch over the plains
Watch over your kingdom
The warrior's come to reign

Beware the stranger
He wants your throne
Riding aimlessly onward
Toward the unknown
Look out!

So if you see a cloud of dust
Headed straight your way
Forget about your pride to ride
And lead your knights to slay
You better turn and run like hell
It's best you stay alive
For cowards know a different pride
'Cause they are still alive

Look up to the mountains
Watch over the plains
Watch over your kingdom
The warrior's come to reign

Beware the stranger
He wants your throne
Riding aimlessly onward
Toward the unknown
