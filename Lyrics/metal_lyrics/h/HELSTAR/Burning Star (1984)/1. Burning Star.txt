I see a new star rising
Coming from the east
White hot and shining bright
Time to kill the beast
Hot winds blowing on you
World's spinning round
No time left to run
Knocks you to the ground

Going down in fire
Flames are getting higher
Burn through your desire
By him we weren't inspired

On a path of destruction
Lie the flesh and bones
Of those who marched against him
This judgment's shown
Long years he's awaited
To once return
Bring back fruit of justice
All else shall burn

Going down in fire
Flames are getting higher
Burn through your desire
By him we weren't inspired

I saw a new star rising
Came up from the east
To rule the world
Set up for the feast
Long years he's awaited
To once return
Bring back fruit of justice
All else shall burn

Going down in fire
Flames are getting higher
Burn through your desire
By him we weren't inspired

All hail! Burning Star
