Midnight-can you hear the wolves are howling
No light- but the evil ones ore prowling
Pitch black - and their wicked eyes are on you
They attack - 'cause there's nowhere they can find you

Swirling you round, taking you down
You're the chosen one
You're looking back, you left your track
So now you run with the pack

Run with the pack

Screaming wind - from the valley of the dead
They'll win - the soul from you of which they led
They lie - but you listen just the same
You cry - but now tell me who's to blame

Swirling you round, taking you down
You're the chosen one
You're looking back, you left your track
So now you run with the pack

Run with the pack

Midnight - can you hear the wolves are howling
No light - but the evil ones are prowling
Screaming wind - from the valley of the dead
They'll win-the soul from you of which they led

Swirling you round, taking you down
You're the chosen one
You're looking back, you left your track
So now you run with the pack

Nowhere to hide
So run with pride
You run with me
You won't be free
Why don't you see
It's not a dream
No turning back
Run with the pack

Nowhere to hide
So run with pride
You run with me
You won't be free
So now you run, run, run...
Run with the pack
