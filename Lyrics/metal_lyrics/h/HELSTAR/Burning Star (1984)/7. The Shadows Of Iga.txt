Black as the night
Cold as a winter's wind
Out on the prowl and ready to strike again
And though you never see them come in
You better believe they're there

They lurk in the night
But you can't see them
You don't hear a sound not even a scream
And though you don't believe they'll coming
You'll regret you didn't beware

Never turn your back on a shadow
Cause when they're coming you don't know
They fly like the wind
And bite like a tiger
But you'll never see the Shadows of Iga

Never believe you're in an empty room
Because your doubts will be answered all too soon
And though you don't believe in running
You'll be better off if you did
Some call them thieves
Some call them murderers
But nevertheless they don't take prisoners
And though you don't believe they'll come in
Just give them reason if you dare

Never turn your back on a shadow
Cause when they're coming you don't know
They fly like the wind
And bite like a tiger
But you'll never see the Shadows of Iga
