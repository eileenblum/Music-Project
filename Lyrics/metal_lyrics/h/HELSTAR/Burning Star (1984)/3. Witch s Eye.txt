High atop the mountain's crest
Where evil spirits dwell
There lives a witch who holds the key
To the flaming gates of hell
She rules over the dark land
The mighty queen of sin
She casts upon us all a spell
Her magic creeps within

Take heed to the word of the blind
They tell you no lie
Never look straight into the - Witch's Eye

Far beyond the sea of blood
An angel spreads his wings
Set loose by the hand of God
A message this angel brings

She has broken all our dreams
Transferred them into nightmares
She has silenced all our screams
And now we look up in despair
The witch's eye has caught us all
Across the burnt lands we plea
We hear her laugh as we die
This witch from hell has come for thee

Take heed to the word of the blind
They tell you no lie
Never look straight into the - Witch's Eye
