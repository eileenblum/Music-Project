Take a spin on the wheel
Your life's on the line
Will it ever slow down
Until you're out of time
Don't you realize
The stakes that you've chosen to bet
Don't you know
What you're playing is Russian Roulette
Leather is so appealing
And makes people crave
Lust just melts you like butter
And makes you its slave
Take one or the other and you'll want to give
But together there's no telling how long you'll live

Leather and Lust
Don't you just treasure the feeling
Leather and Lust
Don't you find them so appealing
Come on girl you know
We've got nothing to hide
Climb aboard now and we'll take that long ride
We've been riding so low
Till you scream in my ear
That gets me up
And I'm shifting right into high gear
Leather just lures you
And makes you all want to see more
Lust just gets you rolling all over the floor
You've been rolling so long
Don't have time for a breath
Hey you better all stop before
You screw to death

Leather and Lust
Don't you just treasure the feeling
Leather and Lust
Don't you find them so appealing

Better beware if you know what is best
So do if you dare but give your head some rest
Cause you don't know what is coming
For you if you catch some disease!
