Color distorts logic
Envolkes hatred
Dividing man
Religion a tool of war
Thou shall not kill
Except for me
Politicians
Behind their jovial faces
Making secret deals
In secret places
Money changes hands
Life is never spared
The weak are oppressed
The leader turn away
The kids are being sold
The game is called control
The homeless are a problem
Crime is the answer
Pretending its not there
Won't make it disappear
Injustice runs rampant
In the home of the free
If you don't believe what they do
Then you're wrong
Violence, so they can pray in silence
Murder to prove a point
We are not created equal
Hypocrisy
Indignation
Greed
Dominance
Power
Defiance
The struggle for space
Radiation
Exploitation
Military defense
Starvation
Life is dying
Because of ignorance
We live in a mass of decadence
Impoverished ruins
Caused by prejudice
Escape through drugs
Is inevitable
The scourge is ineffaceable
Extended hands
Only want to take
Naivet?
Has no place
What a disgrace this life we live
