Rising through the sacred grounds
From the landscape vast and wide to see;
In the distance far
Where light shines in your yes;
You're blinded, beyond thoughts
In your mind, those dreams
That haunt you down to bleed
The might of the men; whose thoughts look
Them straight through their blinded eyes
Whom they lay the tasks for
To teach us of our sins
There is a keeper who looks
Into his crystal ball
To watch and command
All the people who come and pray
To his image of a man
As they look to him they bow their heads
And kneel in the court yards
To await his sermon
As a figure of monk rises to the stand
Discloses his hood
To pray a command
Mass has now began
(All hail) me!
Who's in your minds
And will command
All (our lives)
For those who seek
(We seek) my guidance
Are to give themselves to me
(Blessed be) me!
Who is the lord thy god to be
For this the time, now (in fear)
You all should be, willed by praises
Of faith and love to whom (to you)
Alast the time is near, for I must
Speak these words so you can
Hear the benediction
I am the lord!
For all must say amen-to a man
Here in the fields
Someone is calling my
Name: words for
The righteous:
(speak my son)
And words for
Those who are blind

Deceitful deceiver
You liar of man
Here this our God!
Make this man pray
