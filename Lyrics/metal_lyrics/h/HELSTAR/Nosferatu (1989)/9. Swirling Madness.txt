I have seen the morbid faces
I have felt the awesome pain
I nave traveled to these places
It was just a game
If you seek the ultimate pleasure
I know the place you wish to find
A panacea of sadistic treasures
Waiting to unwind
Swirling madness lose you win
Swirling madness time to play
If you beckon they will come
Sadist of a different world
Once you call you cannot run
Behold how hell unfurls
They breathe life into his nightmare
And they are waiting for your scream
They will take you to their lair
A place you'll never leave
Swirling madness lose you win
Swirling madness time to play

[Solo: Andre]

Eternal pleasure
Eternal pain

[Solo: Harry]

You will bask in the shrouded darkness
Enjoying very ounce of pain
Agonizing every bit of pleasure
You've but yourself to blame
Drowning in the swirling madness
Your addiction has brought you here
You have laid your body out
The consequences are too clear
