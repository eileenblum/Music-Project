Dusk, I rule the night
And rest by the light of the day
Blood, I thirst the blood of the corpses
That befall me
I, I have a lustful need to kill
Deep in my heart
You, you are the victim I've chosen
To prey upon

And every night
You'll feel my bite
You won't be scarred
So be prepared
To feel the pain
Your life I drain
And then we'll be
Baptized in blood
I am the prince of darkness
Bow before me
Fall, succumb to my trance
And be mine for eternity
Time, centuries have come and gone
But still I remain
Black, yes, I am the dark
That puts the light to shame

And every night
You'll feel my bite
You won't be scarred
So be prepared
To feel the pain
Your life I drain
And then you'll be
Baptized in blood

Trapped in my web of terror
I gloat as you squirm
Drooling with anticipating
Catastrophic implications
The ripping of your flesh
The blood I've longed to taste
To quench my thirst, no time to waste
The life you spill I'll drink with haste

[Solo: Larry / Andre]

Wait, patiently stalking my time
To strike again
Fate, plea as you may
But none can save you now
Dawn, the only enemy
That time has placed on me
Back, back to the crypt
That houses my undead soul
And every night
You'll feel my bite
You won't be scarred
So be prepared
To feel the pain
Your life I drain
And then we'll be
Baptized in blood
