I'm the one you fear
The voice that chus out your name
I'm out for new blood
Tonight your soul I'll claim
You're the victim I endure
Parched I watch you sleep
Awakened to my stare

In trance you're falling deep
To sleep per chance to scream
I'm the prince of phantoms
Who's not inhabited hell
My telepathic powers
Weave you in my spell
Excuse my icy touch

I'm of corporeal structure
Join me in twilight existence
Eternal youth with one puncture
"To sleep per chance to scream"
Soon I'll have my kingdom

I'll be lord of the dead
In the land beyond death
Where even angels fear to tread
Can't you believe your eyes still
That I am for real

Do I send you a chill while I'm having my thrill
As I watch your blood spill that gives me my fill
For me another night for me another kill

The acrid smell of blood
I taste with my breath
Your last cling to my cloak
Next sunset you'll rise
Into immorality
Vampiric afterlife
Imprisoned for my needs
"To sleep per chance to scream"
