Ah - oh; she rides like the wind
Praise her world
Long live Seyreon!
On yes, she goes on -
- Aieliaria and Everonn -
I can see the starlight
Fading from me
Hear; there -
She calls
Whither in darkness befalls

There Novia rings
In fear for my
Soul, that she sing
In my dreams
Calling my name, Everonn -
On -
Aieliaria Ann
Princess of the
Winds she commands;
Natures goddess heir
knows only one single care
Over the clouds
She's aware
Who plagues her world
In despair -
Echoes from her winds
That he's calling
Everonn is falling
Novia is singing
Her siren voice bring -
Yet, still she hears
His voice calling

On yes she goes on
To Seyreon
And where will
She find that
You've gone
Novia who's captured
His dreams
Still she
Searches ever on
For Everonn
Still searching on
Novia will sing her
Last song, to Everonn

Aieliaria

Hear, when
You call to Novia
It's deadly to know her
Still they call her Novia
You'll sin just to know her
For she is the one
The Desolate One!
She'll tell you lies
A witch in disguise
Seducing your eyes
In trance you're hypnotize
