Do you want to sleep
Where your dreams never end
To dwell alone
In me dead of the night
Become a corpse
So your soul can carry on
Death brings new life
Will you ride with morning dawn
Spin the "wheel of death"
Through away your pride
Your choice has been made
The noose hangs in your mind

Suicidal nightmare
Suicidal nightmare

You wait for the call
From the voice of unknown
The "dealer of death"
Suicide is his name
Your body grows numb
And your blood is running cold
Your life just flashes by
While your soul is being sold
The packs been made
The dealer smiles wide
The wheel of life stops!
In black sleep you drown

Suicidal nightmare
Suicidal nightmare
Suicidal nightmare
Suicidal nightmare

In your sleep a vision creeps
A dream you've not found
Just a nightmare
Made of molten black flames
Your soul tries to run
From a laugh known so well
But there's no escape
Once you fall into hell

Suicidal nightmare
Suicidal nightmare
Suicidal nightmare
Suicidal nightmare
