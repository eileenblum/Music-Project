When the sun sets above
And there's nowhere to hide
Her refuge, the dark black sea
She hails only one
It's the dead of the damned
Her moan whales, through sea to sea
Her eyes glow a light
That compels you to feel
Her lust that is sweet to kill

In through the night
Your day slips away
Casting two shadows
When she is after you

In the black of the night
Her mist roles in
The children of sin are to die
The blood of a lamb
On the crest of good
As she kills
There're cries the sky

Angel of death
Your the princess of darkness
Your angel of death
In the shadows behind you
Angel of death
Are they crying for mercy
Your angel of death
Is now inside of you

Ride through the skies
In their eyes up above
And down cast their blood in vain
The children of sin
Now belong to the night
Their souls without flesh and blood
Taughting and haunting
The sinners of the land
As she laughs in the darkness
Burning the hands of man

Angel of death
Your the princess of darkness
Your angel of death
In the shadows behind you
Angel of death
Are they crying for mercy
Your angel of death is dead
