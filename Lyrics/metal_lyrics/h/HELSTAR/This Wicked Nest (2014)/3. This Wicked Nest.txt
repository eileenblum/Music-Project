We've come to an impasse on this day of rage
This bomb is armed and ready to engage
Your way of thinking is heresy
Amidst the turmoil these is clarity

Resist, defy, confront, up rise

Simple minds to distress
Trapped in this wicked Nest
Feeble minds to infest
Wrapped in this Wicked Nest

This is the new of brutality
Hope for the hopeless through tyranny
The way to freedom is apostasy
But death will find you for your ideally

Simple minds to distress
Trapped in this wicked Nest
Feeble minds to infest
Wrapped in this Wicked Nest

Lines are distorted, Perceptions contorted
Eyes once opened are closed, Shifting the blame
Misdirecting they shame, Hoping to not be exposed
threatening damnation, A full scale invasion
Rivers of blood in the sand, For your protection
The natural selection, Sarin gas covers the land

There is no way for us to co-exist
The laws that bind you slice right through your twist
Gunfire erupts within the temple halls
The death toll rising as martyrs fill the walls

Simple minds to distress
Trapped in this wicked Nest
Feeble minds to infest
Wrapped in this Wicked Nest
