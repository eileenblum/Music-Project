I am the bringer of dark dreams
I am the passage of sorrows
These are last lips that you'll taste
I'm the destroyer of your tomorrows

I am the end of time
The end of the line
The place of no return
Eternal black

My presence will fill you with tremors
In silence I come from the shadow
I am not demon nor god
My name is not cursed nor hallowed

I am the end of time
The end of the line
The place of no return
Eternal black

Never diverted
I cannot be cheated
I will forever
Bring you to never

I cannot offer salvation
Your soul is mine to harvest
At birth you were condemned
To walk these corridors of darkness

I am the end of time
The end of the line
The place of no return
Eternal black
