It was a nightmare unreal, but I started to feel,
could it be be paradise
Into the tunnel of light, dissipating the fright
suddenly paralyzed
And the sky opened wide and no vision of hell
But my soul felt so lost when the heavens were crossed
in twilight I dwelled

This dream takes my away
From the anguish of life
The dream takes me away
From shackles of strife

Out in the sky
I heard souls cry

Such a passionate peace once you become deceased
like the eye of a storm
As the rebirth begins renewed from all sins
and the cold grows warm
Then the voice of a deity says it's not your time
Such a saddened emotion hurled out of the ocean
of dark tranquillity

This dream takes my away
From the anguish of life
The dream takes me away
From shackles of strife

Into pain we are born and  to death we are sworn
changeless destiny
We will all come to pass into vaporous mass transcend eternally
And the souls who have seen the light on the other side
Will let out a cry I heard int he sky as they subside

This dream takes my away
From the anguish of life
The dream takes me away
From shackles of strife
