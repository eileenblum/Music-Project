Vengeance, it puts things in motion,
the life blood of every cause
Dissident uprising crushed beneath governing laws
Manic disorder, conspired by the ruling regime
Fear is injected, mass viral infected, they scheme

Justice and freedom are words that will sting
Insurgent battle cries to bring
The Fall of Dominion
The Fall of Dominion

Affliction, spreading disease to ethnically cleanse the diverse
Neutralize thinking and remove what they call perverse
Plunge into chaos by feeding us lies as the truth
Bio-terror to kill and control our youth

Justice and freedom are words that will sting
Insurgent battle cries to bring
The Fall of Dominion
The Fall of Dominion

Fear is the tool that secures your alliance
Fear, this weapon that insures your compliance
Spreading the plague that will bring about the war
Bathing in the blood of the wretched and the poor

Silence, shattered oppression, voice of the discontent
Terrorizing terror government
Flags that rise are only meant to fall
Authority will be the one to crawl

Justice and freedom are words that will sting
Insurgent battle cries to bring
The Fall of Dominion
The Fall of Dominion
