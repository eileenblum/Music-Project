Every day I wake into the black
Every breath I take and can't get back
Every day's a deeper shade of grey
Everywhere I walk there's only rain

Ingratitude for this solitude
A soul adrift in the sea
Crucifixion of time, my affliction is life
Ha death forgotten me

My life is a ting made of the past
Seen though the shards of looking glass
Deep is the dark that fills my lungs
Sharp were the words that sliced my tongue

Ingratitude for this solitude
A soul adrift in the sea
Crucifixion of time, my affliction is life
Ha death forgotten me

Afraid to fall asleep and never wake
Every inch of me begins to ache
Who knows what will become of me
I'm wondering what it's like to be set free
Reliving pains of blows from long ago
It's razor wire scraped across my soul
Will something come to kill this dying flame
The voice of death is bound to speak my name

Thought the end i know is drawing near
I face each day alone in fear
I wait to sing my last heroic verse
This blessing is not a blessing but a curse

Ingratitude for this solitude
A soul adrift in the sea
Crucifixion of time, my affliction is life
Ha death forgotten me

Ingratitude for this solitude
A soul adrift in the sea
Crucifixion of time, my affliction is life
Ha death forgotten me
