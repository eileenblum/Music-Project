Pray for the destruction of the ones that do not heed
Sacrificial offerings given to icons of greed
Spreading words of slander, gods of gold will now corrode
Deny them all salvation for these sins do not erode

Magormissabib
Kingdom of lies and savagery
Magormissabib
Children of famine and treachery

Raiders come to plunder they slumber peacefully
Upon them retribution for traps laid in secrecy
Chaos and bedlam in this land of idolatry
Echoing wails of horror mark this day of infamy

Magormissabib
Kingdom of lies and savagery
Magormissabib
Children of famine and treachery

Them time to be butchered has come
Atrocities cannot be undone
Iniquieties never absolved
Order so quickly dissolved

Bring on them disaster like the down pour of the rain
Condemned to spirals of fire and everlasting pain
Forsaken are the gifts of blood upon the charred altar
Forever known as terror in the valley of slaughter

Magormissabib
Kingdom of lies and savagery
Magormissabib
Children of famine and treachery
