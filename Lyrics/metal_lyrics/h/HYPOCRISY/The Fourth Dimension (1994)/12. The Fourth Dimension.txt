As my soul leaves the body
On a free ticket to hell
To a floating unknown
For a vision of you all my life

The impression reaches my soul
As I see my destiny
A panic goes through my mind
As I see myself slowly die

Wake me up from this nightmare
I cry out "Make it stop!"

Get me back in my body
I'll never, never leave it again
Never trust your own instincts
On a journey to hell

I can't leave my body lying
Like this
I try to reach out
And grab it
And wake myself up
Oh, God!

I feel a pity
For all that died
Cause I'm stuck here, in hell

Wake me up from this nightmare
I cry out "Make it stop!"

Get me back in my body
I'll never, never leave it again
Never trust your own instincts
On a journey to hell
