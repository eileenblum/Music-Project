Rise from the depths of hell
Destroying all that's good
Crush Christians and let Satan loose
Spread your wings
And give us a sign
Let us know the time is here
End of religion, torture, love and sacrifice and fear

The true believers will only survive
The real freedom
The rest will die

The path will lead me back
The way back to darkness
In hell I'll stay
To fulfill my long command

Whoever will never ??? again
Will prove how ???
They'll walk back on the path
The path with the ones
When Solomon is here

The earth will be like a desert
Hell will rise from the sand
My life will always be endangered
As long as they hate ???

The true believer
Will only survive
The real freedom
The rest will die

The path will lead me back
The path back to Babylon
In hell, I'll stay
To fulfill my long command

Ah
