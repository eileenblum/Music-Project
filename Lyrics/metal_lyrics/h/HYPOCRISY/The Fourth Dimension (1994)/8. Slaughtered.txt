I am alive to make you pay
I am alive to take your life

For thirty years I've waited
Finally, the time is here
Hunting you down and destroy you
For betraying me

Lying about your religion
Hereby, I sentence to death
Don't you ever be preachin'
About the things you don't understand

Reach for eternal fire
Reach for the death
Betray the liar
I capture your soul

I'll cut your arms and legs
So you can't get away
Your blood now will pour through your ???
Won't you let me go

Your scream will give me pleasure
To see you suffer
You're my unmoving treasure

The betrayer paid in blood
