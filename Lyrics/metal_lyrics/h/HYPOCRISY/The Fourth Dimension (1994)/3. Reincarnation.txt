You feel the warning
From behind
The truth is buried in a wall of time
Threw the sorrows of your life
You ain't getting ahead from this Christ

I feel an evil approaching me
The voices calling me on
Silence
The only sound is the knife through the air
Hell
Is where I'll be when I'm through with you

I give up my needs
To get ahead
Cut and ripped through your clothes again
Cut wide open
To drink the wounds
You feel the power of no remorse

I feel an evil approaching me
The voices calling me on
Silence
The only sound is the knife through the air
Hell
Is where I'll be when I'm through with you

Silence
The only sound is the knife through the air
Hell
Is where I'll be when I'm through with you
