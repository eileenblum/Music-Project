Your time will come to face the truth
You only live to die, to die in pain
People like you, you were only meant to suffer
For a ??? of your own state of mind

Wandering right through
You make me puke â bljuvat'
You prefer ??? to die

You remain in your own bile - gorcina
Though always
??? way to be

???

Where will you go now?
??? of torture
We're coming up to offer
You know in the end you will suffer
Rise, king of hell
???
No one will care
What do you do with your life?
