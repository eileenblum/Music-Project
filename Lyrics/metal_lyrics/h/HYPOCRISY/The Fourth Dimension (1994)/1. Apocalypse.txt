Since I was a child, I saw my own way,
Who is god and who is not.

I'm so sick of hearing you preach about heaven,
All this bullshit about paradise,

Read all the signs...

The Christians must be stopped
From spreading all the lies,
The only way to get to them,
Without fear, when the sun is a god
Have mercy
It's the ending... of your life.

As my mind slips away,
I see no end of this misery,
The only truth is myself,
I can't go on this way
No!

Read all the signs
You're the sign

Are you forgetting
To the end of the rainbow,
My own
All alone I know... won't I'll be there...
NO!!

With a stab in the back,
Have mercy,
It's the end.... of your life

When the son is the path,
Have mercy.
It's the ending of your life.
