Beware of the north wind
It will take you away
Put you to sleep
Terrified
Swept up your body
You will be left to rot with the leaves

You will stop breathing
As you pass away
Suffocate
Your skin turns blue
The eye:
The eyeballs roll in the back of your head
The north wind will pick you up
And take you on a journey to hell

Wind of evil swept over the earth
Kills all the living souls
Cult of Cold
Gather 'round for the storms
Worship them,
Watching them do the works of evil

The earth will be dark as death
No existence of life
Death, cold and emptiness

You will stop breathing
As you pass away
Suffocate
Your skin turns blue
