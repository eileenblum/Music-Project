[digipack only]

Tortured in flames
For my belief
That will take me to hell
One step closer to death
I release my anger to be free

[Monk-style chanting:] (Feel alone again)

I feel no guilt for the lost ones
I'll strangle and suffocate
[more chanting]
I look around and see all the pain gone

(Feel alone again)

On digipack there is song called "The Abyss" but there isn't "The Arrival Of The Demons".
