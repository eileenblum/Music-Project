Born of murder
Society's pain
A misfit
And a total insane
People want to lock me in
And throw away the key

I am the lord of the dead
Get me away from this ????
I have to put you straight to ???
Take my body and make me burn

I feel the evil inside
Demons of hell will arise
I will let them burn the hell
Dead

I'm receiving eternal life
My soul is ready to burn

For the price I'll pay
To make you suffer
To never return to my body

I am the lord of the dead
Get me away from this ???
I have to put you straight to hell
Take my soul and let me burn

I feel the evil inside
Demons of hell will arise

I am the lord of the dead
To prove to the minions in hell
I have to put you straight to hell
Won't you leave my soul as we burn

Freedom is death
Freedom is death
Death

I will return
Eternal life
Yeah, for the price
I will make you suffer
