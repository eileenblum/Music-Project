Out they come to your rescue,
To drag you off the street
They gave you food and shelter
They'll leave you to bleed

They'll take all your money
Destroy all your goals
They're killing for religion
Then go lookin' for more

Wretched scum of the earth
They are waiting for rebirth
A relief from this labor
But they need a slave to do the work
You want an answer
They will use you 'til you die
They'll brainwash and convince you
That you will end up in Paradise

The day is old
They see through your mind, too
Down and out
You can't see up out of the gloom

Another way to bullshit the youth
To burn all the lies
They fill you up with this bullshit
They will make you lie

Then they'll cover the earth
They are waiting for rebirth
A relief from this labor
But they need a slave to do the work
You want an answer
They will use you 'til you die
They'll brainwash and convince you
That you will end up in Paradise

Ah

Wretched scum of the earth
They are waiting for rebirth
A relief from this labor
But they need a slave to do the work
You want an answer
They will use you 'til you die
They'll brainwash and convince you
You will end up in Paradise
Liars
