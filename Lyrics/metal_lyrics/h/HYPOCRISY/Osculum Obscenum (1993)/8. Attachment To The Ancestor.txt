Crippling ways
of religious innocence
of ?
and now get me naked
osulum obscenum is
destroy the audience Christ
pestilence and slow death
decay to touch the mighty ??

the (pain in their eyes??)
to come here seeing this arrival
with the sorrow, torture, abuse
my power!!

for serenity, time has come
but will you feel the knife
or the (remainder??) Christ

the voice when you turn your back
no will, it's time to die
read it in the book of life
the darkness is my salvation!!

got to see eternal life
? will take with you ? your might
pestilence will save your soul
you will be exposed to agony
