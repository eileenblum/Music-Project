Reality! my fault, as i cut you deep. My deacon knows as i cut you with this knife.
??? ??? ??? ??? ???
The energy! provided by the blood on the sacred knife that's in you
this sacrifice i give to you my lord ??? ??? ??? king of hell
Theres no control, a bloody gore, hanging from the ceiling, i cut wide open your body,
I feel a-live!!!! Their fate they decide, I release avenge on your mankind.
Love will float away, as i tear the body apart, Mental Emotions never AGAIN!!!!!!!!
