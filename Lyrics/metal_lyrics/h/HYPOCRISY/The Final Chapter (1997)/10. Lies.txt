Is this the end of time, and how come we are still killing ourselves?
Going back and forth.
Loose control.
Always try to open new doors.
Don't get too close, you might disappear.
They will bury your bones, in the sand.
Break away, from the waves.
Into the oceans of, lies!!!
[whispers]
All those lies.
All those lies, is what you get.
All those lies.
All those lies, is what they're feeding to you.
All those lies.
All those lies, that will stop your quest.
All those lies.
All those lies, it's a dead end.
Don't cry to freedom, for survival.
It's a one way ticket to death.
Face reality.
End up without traces.
Don't get too close, you will disappear.
They will break your bones, into sand.
How come this cold world, exists?
Why am I made this way?

All those lies.
All those lies, is all you're given.
All those lies.
All those lies, is what they're feeding to you.
All those lies.
All those lies, is what will stop your quest.
All those lies.
All those lies, it's a dead end.
All those lies.
All those lies...
