(Yeah Yeah !!!!!)

Learning through pain
To feed your mind against yourself.
To become an exterminate machine.
Deciding (on) the freedom of the earth.
Read my mind as I read yours.
(Do/Did) you see what I feel?
I control your life and thought(s)
Don't you try to (block/wipe me off/out)

I am creator.
Universal dominat(ion/or)
The source of eternity
I am the black hole

A flick of my finger(s)
I['ll] push you off the edge.

I choose to destroy your mind, like the fires can be stopped.
A profound, appalling hatred that many years you've watched us kill.

I am creator.
Universal dominat(ion/or)
The source of eternity
I am the black hole

With a flick of my finger(s)
I push you off the edge.
With a flick of my finger(s)
You('ll) disappear.

I am creator.
Universal dominat(ion/or)
The source of eternity
I am the black hole
