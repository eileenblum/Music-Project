How far we can take the crown.
With a look through centuries.
We turn the page, with weapons of rage.
It's an enslaving machine.
Slowly we exterminate.
We gotta fight for the right,
or there'll be nothing left.

[chorus]
In the end, we will conquer.
What was once, our world.
We will take it back,
through the window of time.
[end of chorus]

One by one we will break you down.
We will fight 'til the end.
One by one, we will kill them all.
'til there's no one left.

We've been destroying, other worlds.
This is just another planet in line.
They try to control us, and make us slaves.
But I know, we'll survive.
[repeat chorus 1 time]
We won't let you go.
It will be twofold.
We will take it back,
through the window of time.
