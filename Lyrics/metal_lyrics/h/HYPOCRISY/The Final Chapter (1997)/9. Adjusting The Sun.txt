Reach for the sky.
Dare it for quest.
It will make you blind.
There is no end.
And reach the stars, and planets, solar systems afar.
Is there anyone out there, to our lonesome prayers?

You think you know the answer?

God.
Satan.
Would not be without the other.
Murderers.
Cowards.
Power.
Money.
It is all for the pleasure.
Cowards.
Martyrs.
God.
Satan.
Would not be without the other.

Religion, a rotting machine.
Religion, you think its presupposed too long?

You think you know the answer?

Satan.
There would be none without the other.

It is all for the pleasure.
