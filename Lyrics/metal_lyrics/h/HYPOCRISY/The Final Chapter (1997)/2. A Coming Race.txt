Why all this searching?
The answer's always been near.
It is our destiny.
Away from a screeching people.
Waiting to destroy ourselves.
They can't interfere with history.

Nuclear creation. For eternity
(Looking for others) (they can't be strained/that can't be seen)

All I wish they would land here.
But it's too late now.
Time is dying (I told you)
(We've fallen to our own decay)

[again]
[SOLO]
[scream]

In the other dimension.
Time will no longer exist.
No one never grow old.
Something mankind will never resist.
Try destroying it, (I told you)

[chorus x2]
