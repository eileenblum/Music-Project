In a time of death.
I'm running through my head.
Is it just another suicidal dream?
I lost control.
They begin the work.
Realities are a major terror.

Into suffer, my life would follow.
Know-it-alls, but can't see, what's been done to me.
SAVE ME!
Murdered before livin' life.
Better take your weak into the morgue.
Your lame I can awake.
SAVE ME!
I'm fighting to exist.
Needles and instruments strapped in my head.
I will never be the same!!!

Here we go!

There's nothing left.
They explore my brain, spinning through me as a funnel.
There's gotta be an end.
My execution's near.
There will be no tomorrow.

Know-it-alls, but can't see, what's been done to me.

SAVE ME!
Murdered before livin' life.
Better take your weak into the morgue.
Their lame I can awake.
SAVE ME!
I'm fighting to exist.
Needles and instruments strapped in my head.
I will never be the same!!!
I will never be the same!
NEVER!
NEVER!
NEVER...
