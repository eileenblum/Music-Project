Slip inside into the chaos/confusion
I don't know when to stop
Get myself wasted
Run around like a madman
This stuff will take another time.

I can't control myself
I don't know why
The devil's in my hand
He's pouring me another round
Feelings coming
I know I'm over my head
Turning slowly into a deadly game

Show my ass in all the public places
I'm too drunk to care
Puking contest. Touring nightmare
I'll do anything for a laugh

I can't control myself
I don't know why
The devil's in my hand
He's pouring me another round
Feelings coming
I know I'm over my head
Turning slowly into a deadly game

Reality floats away
I'm falling too fast
I need another drink
So I can despair
No!
