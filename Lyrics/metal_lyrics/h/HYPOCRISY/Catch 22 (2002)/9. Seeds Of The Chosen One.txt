Seeds of the Chosen One
Inject the Holy whore
To make the ultimate child
Laboratory rat that fucked with Mother Nature
It's like a Russian roulette

This time I know we went too far - Playing God
It will hit back on us all
Is this how it'll end you can count me out
It will never last -- A lethal game

We're on our way to see the ending
We're on our way to get erased
Time is tickin' -- Mother Earth's twisted
And we'll all loose control

Scientific murder
I knew I'd begone
You and I are not included
Step aside -- Move away
I'll move alone

Now I know we went too far -- Playing God
Time is Up for the human race
We've passed the point of no return
We're already out of the game
You and I
We will never last -- A lethal game

We're on our way to see the ending
We're on our way to get erased
Time is tickin' -- Mother Earth's twisted
And we'll all loose control
