I realized I never should be born
In this world where money talks
The honesty of systems can be won
When the power of dollar is running the life

We're closing our eyes
How could we be so blind
That we can't see what's going on?

The world's on edge of madness
It's burning out with frustration
We're never satisfied. It's never enough
We can't get enough

Trying hard to make an extra buck
To roll ourselves in luxury
We get our bottoms' overload
So we grab whatever we can take
Blinded by the dollar sign
A disease that burns through our minds.

The world's on edge of madness
It's burning out with frustration
We're never satisfied. It's never enough
We can't get enough

We are the world on edge of madness
It's burning out with frustration
We're never satisfied. It's never enough
We can't get enough
Its never enough

I realized I never should be born
In this world where money talks
The honesty of systems can be won

The world's on edge of madness
It's burning out with frustration
We're never satisfied. It's never enough
We can't get enough

We are the world on edge of madness
It's burning out with frustration
We're never satisfied. It's never enough
We can't get enough
Its never enough
