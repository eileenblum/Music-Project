Can't you see the devil
They curse away your life
What were your impressions?
They will blow your mind

It's time to cleave up your worst enemy
And see how bad they bleed
Trapped in your own cage
Sliced from humanity

How does it feel
To be locked up in your own free world?
Trapped in the shell
Another dead end for another dead man

Four walls are closing in
You're screaming but you can't be heard
You better believe it
Another dead end for another dead man

Oh. Strike back with your anger

You'll face against the wall
Just another day
Been watching over you
What you wanted to see

You stole the years
But you can't feel the difference
Your futures assigned
You're now part of the system

How does it feel
To be locked up in your own free world?
Trapped in the shell
Another dead end for another dead man

Four walls are closing in
You're screaming but you can't be heard
You better believe it
Another dead end for another dead man

Use your anger
Reap revenge
Use your anger
Don't turn away
