You haven't thought since the day you ???
It's like a hemorrhoid that fucks with my life
You look at me like you've never seen me before
Do you think I care?
You're just another trick

Snap out of it

What are you remarking?
I don't want to hear you no more
I'll no longer talk to your ass
Decision comes on every whim

If they're screaming, I won't hear it
I know your kind. Snap out of it
Filled with anger. Filled with hate.
I know your kind, you're just a waste of time

You try to twist it.
I spit in your face
I don't see a reason to argue
Why do you compliment?
You're just wasting your breath

Oh. Here we go
Snap out of it

What do ???
I don't want to hear you no more
I'll no longer talk to your ass
Decision comes on every whim

If they're screaming, I won't hear it
I know your kind. Snap out of it
Filled with anger. Filled with hate.
I know your kind, you're just a waste of time
