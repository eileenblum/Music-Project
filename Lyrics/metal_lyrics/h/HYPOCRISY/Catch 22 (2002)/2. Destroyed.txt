I lost my dignity, I lost who I am.
My biggest problem is; I've become civilized.
Take my ???, known by no one.
My clock is ticking.

Don't even tempt me
I'll rip a hole in your life.
Leave me alone.

When you think I'm on the top
I reverse and tell you all to fuck off.
I will not be destroyed.
I refuse to be destroyed.

Oh.
So you thought you knew me?
Where I stand?
I'm sorry to tell you, you fuck
And sorry you won't buy it

Get a life and leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
Yet there you are.

When you think I'm on the top
I reverse and tell you all to fuck off.
I will not be destroyed.
I refuse to be destroyed.

Don't even try to tempt me
I'll rip a hole in your life.
I don't understand why you even
Spend the time on my life.

Fuck you and everything you stand for
You and all your fucking magazines.
Don't even try to touch me
I'll rip a hole in your life.

When you think I'm on the top
I reverse and tell you all to fuck off.
I will not be destroyed.
I refuse to be destroyed.
