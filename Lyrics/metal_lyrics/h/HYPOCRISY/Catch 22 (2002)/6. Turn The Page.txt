Hey! Why don't you ever stop?
You're shittin' on yourself and shittin' in the wind
Rage, you're spitting out the bones
And I'd like to think you don't understand.
Die! Why don't you fuckin' die or run and hide?
Ha! Ain't got the fuckin' time to hear you fuckin' lie.
You're driving me crazy
Knock it off, I'll fuck you up
I've made enough to hold the top
You give me no choice
Die! Why don't you fuckin' die and run and hide?
Shit. Just talk your fuckin' shit
Spinning lies
I hear it's calling
Judgement Day
I feel it's calling your name
I see it's coming
Rolling in
'Cause we may never turn the page
You're face. Just hate your stupid face
Don't wanna be around you when you are near
Dig yourself six feet under
You'll never ever come back again
I hear it's calling
Judgement Day
I feel it's calling your name
I see it's coming
Rolling in
'Cause we may never turn the page
Do you think I care what's on your mind?
I don't wanna see your ugly face
I got no time. I run and hide.
Turn you upside down
Don't wanna waste our time
Send you straight to death
I'm gonna put you down in hell
I hear it's calling
Judgement Day
I feel it's calling your name
I see it's coming
Rolling in
'Cause we may never turn the page
