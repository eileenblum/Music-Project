Yeah!

Another victim of violence
A new era of hate
Is coming your way
On different levels of pain

Who will be saved?

Radio controls your mind
Get on-line
I' m on your screen
Skinned from behind
Make you writhe

I am your digital god
A new generation of religion
I am your digital god
Coming to get you

A new dimension of messiah
Accept and move below

I am god

Erase away yesterday
And live with the program
Brainwashed minds
And stay on the line
Now your brain is fried

I am god

Radio controls your mind
Get on-line
I' m on your screen
Skinned from behind
Make you writhe

I am your digital god
A new generation of religion
I am your digital god
