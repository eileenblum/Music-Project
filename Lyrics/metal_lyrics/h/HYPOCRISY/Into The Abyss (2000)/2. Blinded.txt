Try to run and hide
They'll get you.
The shadows arrive
Now, it's too late

Blinded by God

The hell, man, is here
Ooh, millions died in vain
Time is running out
There is no way to escape
And you chose the pain

Whoa!

Priests, pagans,
And faith; they're dead
Ooh, nothing will be the same again
Blinded by God

The hell, man, is here
Ooh, millions died in vain
Time is running out
There is no way to escape
And you chose the pain
No escape

Hold the cross; death is near
Burn the cross; The end is here

Bloody death

The hell, man, is here
Ooh, millions died in vain
Time is running out
There is no way to escape
And you chose the pain
