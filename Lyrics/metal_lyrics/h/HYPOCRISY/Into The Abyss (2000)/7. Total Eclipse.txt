Though hate is a blackened art,
May your eyes all be upon me
Open me up to take the life
Forever, I'll be free

Cults are on my mind
Rise into the sky
A usurping sun
It will be the final eclipse

Drowned in the Red Sea
Rivers are running wild
Delusions become hunting souls
Just the thing to set us off

God has been denied
Universal genocide
In pain we will lie
Creation of the demon sky

The god of the fire is born
To come and take control
Nothing is left behind
Mortal we are the earth

Now, you're dead and gut upside down
Hell is folding in
The fiend are rising from the ashes
We will take their dead

Take their dead

Cults are on my mind
Rise into the sky
A usurping sun
It will be the final eclipse

God has been denied
Universal genocide
The pain, we lie
Creation of the demon sky
