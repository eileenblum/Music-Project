Legions of world domination

These bastards came with a method of hate
Suicide, the end; prayer for death
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Armageddon, our earth they cast away
The ghost of the devil has cursed us from here

The angels cry and run in vain
Satan's victory, earth will stand inflamed
Oh, the holocaust is falling in
Legions of world domination

Your killings always burning black
Murder and the sky turns red
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn crosses upside down
Yeah, so that we see the sign.

Walk with me through the flame
Teach this world; things it's done
What we say; burning down
Evil world; have no life

Just choose death to come in the light
It's the teacher's way

Here we go!

The angels cry and run in vain
Satan's victory, earth will stand inflamed
The holocaust is falling in
Legions of world domination

The angels cry and run in vain
Satan's victory, earth will stand inflamed
The holocaust is falling in
Legions of world domination
