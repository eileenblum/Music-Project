Since the day you were born
You always dreamed of a normal life
But disease that now it's been out on you
Oh, you can't take it no more

Forgive me for doing this
It hurts me more to see your life
But, for your own good,
You must die

Good-bye, my love
I'm taking your life
Ripping you from me
To slowly slip away

I'm putting your sick body to sleep
So you can have a peace of mind
Good-bye, my love
Killing you with my bare hands

You try to put up with a fight
As I try to squeeze your throat
Looking at me, eyes wide
Blood's squirting out

Father gives, the father takes
To decide it's the child's fate

Good-bye, my love
I' m taking your life
Sparing you the pain
To slowly dream away

I'm putting your sick body to sleep
So you can have a peace of mind
Good-bye, my love
Killing you with my bare hands

I'm holding your body
My mind is so overwhelmed
Don't cry for me not yet!

Good-bye, my love
I'm taking your life
Sparing you the pain
To slowly dream away

I'm putting your sick body to sleep
So you can have a peace of mind
Good-bye, my love
Killing you with my hands

Good-bye, my love
Good-bye, my love
Good-bye, my love
