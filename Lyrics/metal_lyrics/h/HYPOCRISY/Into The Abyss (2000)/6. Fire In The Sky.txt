Yeah!
Like a fire in the sky,
They came to earth
To put the life on the run,
To hide and observe

Basic destruction and chaos
People running for their life
Secret abduction for their research
You can scream but you can' t hide

Running from the shadow
Can I ever be free?
Struggling for my life
What do they want from me?

The invasion of your private life
Has only begun
A light has split the sky
There' s nowhere to run

They don' t care what you're feeling
They only do what has to be done

Running from the shadow
Can I ever be free?
Struggling for my life
What do they want from me?

Lying on a cold bed
Faces hard to see
Wake me up and take me away
So I can breathe

Running from the shadow
Can I ever be free?
Struggling for my life
What do they want from me?

Lying on a cold bed
Faces hard to see
Wake me up and take me away
So I can breathe
