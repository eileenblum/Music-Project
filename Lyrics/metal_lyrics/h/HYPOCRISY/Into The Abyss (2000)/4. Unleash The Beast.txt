In my visions, part of you see your ??? for your own
The ??? populace runs for your cult
You never seem to get what you gave up

You made a prison of your faith
Just before you pass away
Entrapping your mind in your box
For me, it's a consequence I'll deny

Oh, I'm squeezing in
Oh, I'm deep in guts
Oh, I remove your skin
Oh, I'll never stop

Bye, bye

I'll put your head beside me
So you can see me reform in your blood
Your skin becomes an angel
And fuckin' worshipped as God

Your son decided to go with me
But, there's nothing much left of you
Thanks for standing beside me,
Now I'm through with you

Oh, I'm squeezing in
Oh, I'm deep in guts
Oh, I remove your skin
Oh, it could never stop

Oh, I'm squeezing in
Oh, I'm deep in guts
Oh, I remove your skin
Oh, I'll never stop
