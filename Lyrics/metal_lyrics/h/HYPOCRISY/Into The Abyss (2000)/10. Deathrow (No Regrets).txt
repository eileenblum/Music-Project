I am no savior
And I ain't no saint
They will take me to the electric chair
Yeah, Ha ha ha

No remorse
And no regrets
For those I've sent straight to hell

I have my demons
They're all here in my cell
They're all here and follow me everywhere

My hate controls me
And gives me strength
My only protection inside the walls

Dying. Desiring. Crying. Dying.
Dying. Desiring. Crying. Dying.

The walls are closing in
My cell is getting smaller
Soon, all the pains must cease
Life will end here

My final days are coming
I can wash away this pain
My body's getting colder
Oh, I feel so unafraid

Dying. Desiring. Crying. Dying.
Dying. Desiring. Crying. Dying.

The walls are closing in
My cell is getting smaller
Soon, all the pains must cease
Life will end here

My final days are counting
I can wash away this pain
My body's getting colder
Oh, I feel so unafraid

On death row.
