A thousand kills and I' m back again
To give the earth a big chill
My many faces just a trick, a disguise
To fool you into my trap

Nowhere between
I am the devil
I will control your mind
So let's begin
You'll feel my anger
A new creation of me

An event you'll know by seals
It ain't here
I am the falling angel
You beware

And your sin grows depth with pride
Hell is here
I am the king,
I'll take your heart on your grave

I'll do whatever it takes to win
To get control of your life
I'll show you things that you would never believe
And then you will be mine

Nowhere between
I am the devil
I will control your mind
So let's begin
You'll feel my anger
A new creation of me

An event you'll know by seals
It ain't here
I am the falling angel
You beware

And their sin grows depth with time
Hell is here
I am the king,
I'll take your heart on your grave

I have created...
