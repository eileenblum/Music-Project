A pain worse than anything else
or maybe I'm dead, both trapped in a cage
Alone in my body now a shell deserted or is this the end of my age
Crushed into the bitter end
Is the thing's I cannot avoid
Drowning in a circle of hell
They won't let me exist on my own

[Chorus]
Slave to the parasites
I can't get away
They won't leave me be
Slave to the parasites
Here they come again
There is nowhere to hide

Seeing my life crushed
I'm all alone
digging into my life
deadly thoughts

The night is fallen
I know they are comming around the bend
They use me as an experiment
which I don't understand

Crashed into the bitter end
Is the thing's I cannot avoid
drowning in a circle of hell..
They won't let me exist on my own

[Chorus]

They won't get me this time
I can hear them coming closer
I'm not afraid to die
But I'd rather die than someone control my mind

[Chorus]
