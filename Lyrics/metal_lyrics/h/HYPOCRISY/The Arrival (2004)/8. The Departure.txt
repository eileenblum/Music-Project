I came back to life
Naked and tied to the floor
In the corner of my eyes
I saw them coming through the door

All is black
All is white
I open my eyes and faced the airborn lights

[Chorus]
I stared into the eyes of eternity
I've seen what no man's ever seen
I stared into the eyes of eternity
I've been where no man's ever been

I cannot move
None of my sences respond
I prepair myself for the life beyond

And as I look around
I realize I'm all alone
The dark so wide so wasted
It chills me to the bone

Suddenly I'm rising up in the air
My mind was burning
Think not [?] about despair

I said farewell to the body they're stealing

All is black
All is white
I open my eyes and face the airborn lights

[Chorus]
I stared into the eyes of eternity
I've seen what no man's ever seen
I stared into the eyes of eternity
I've been where no man's ever been

[Guitar Solo]

I wish I could scream
Or fade right back into the dream
But something here just keeps me awake

And I'm cut wide open
Maybe they search for my soul
This is more than a human can take

And don't tell me I'm dreaming
I know what I saw
I'll feel alive like I've never before

[Chorus 2x]
I stared into the eyes of eternity
I've seen what no man's ever seen
I stared into the eyes of eternity
I've been where no man's ever been
