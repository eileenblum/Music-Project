[lyrics by Dan Swan]

In the dimension beyond the twilight
A soul is waiting to be reborn
After a lifetime of repenting sin
A new life is about to begin

But something went wrong that fateful night
And the cosmos went berserk
A fusion of the heavens
And the sphere where the dark ones lurk

Hell grows stronger; your soul is at stake
You're granted life only to die
Dscend into the black.

Born Dead Buried Alive
Standing at the gate waiting for the dark to arrive
Born Dead Buried Alive
The army of the undead
Now possess your blackened soul

You'll never know life on earth
Doomed to forever walk the land beyond
When the final day arise, you twisted self will rise
The dead shall inherit the earth

You belong to the fires of Hades
You get your lifeblood from the river Styx
Hell in all its glory
Will forever be your dwelling place

The restless dead eagerly awaits
The day of maturity, the end of mankind
Crack the surface of the earth
And let there be hell.

Born Dead Buried Alive
Standing at the gate waiting for the dark to arrive
Born Dead Buried Alive
The army of the undead
Now possess your blackened soul
