[Lyrics are by Dan Swan]

When you were born, that's when I died, it took too long to realize
I am white, your black, I'm slowly turning to gray
Like a disease you break me down and cry
You're the king, I'm the fool

I'm your eternal prey.

Die! Let me regain control
Die! Let me reign in my own soul
Die! Let my life return
Die! I'd do anything to see you burn!!

What I create you desecrate
Fueled by endless hate
How can I win this war?

This war against myself?
You're the king, I'm the fool

Die! Let me regain control
Die! Let me reign in my own soul
Die! Let my life return
Die! I'd do anything to see you burn!!

If I decide, it's suicide inside of me
How will I know you won't follow me?

You tricked my mind, you made me blind, but I finally can see
There's no escape. Cerebral rape, you're my destiny!

You turn me on, you turn me off
Like I'm a fucking machine!
You tuck me in, you throw me out

Now all my thoughts are obscene!

Die! Let me regain control
Die! Let me reign in my own soul
Die! Let my life return
Die! I'd do anything to see you burn!!

Die! Let me regain control
Die! Let me reign in my own soul
Die! Let my life return
Die! I'd do anything to see you burn!!
