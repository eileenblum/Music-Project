Can't you see them coming?
Cannot see the sense of me
All of them decide
Deciding our ups, downs, and misery

Addicted to fleshly skin
Enough for me to swallow and take in
Two worlds collide
One with all the: one with all!

This is the way we serve
It's deadly when it's being wiped away
Both too precious to behold
and praise the new...

[Chorus]
The new world is here to wipe out our lives
The new world we can't survive
The new world left God in everything and everyone
The new world does not include us

Everyone will feel a need to pleasure
To wicked the future race
There will be no more beliefs
All religion will be known
All religious ways
Losing their ability
They'll erase all our memories

No more scriptures
No more lies
No more fucking lies!

This is the way we serve
It's deadly when it's being wiped away
Both too precious to behold
and praise the new...

[Chorus]
The new world is here to wipe out our lives
The new world we can't survive
The new world left God in everything and everyone
The new world does not include us

God, in decay, just making all the rules
Earth, finally, forgot the tombs
Hell Is where I'll be
After my eyes can see
Preceding our, we are the misery!

Hate throughout the end of genocide
Smell of burning flesh inside all, everyone!
Death is coming down, now when we will survive
We're gonna die!
[Chorus 2x]
The new world is here to wipe out our lives
The new world we can't survive
The new world left God in everything and everyone
The new world does not include us
