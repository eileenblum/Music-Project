I woke up screaming from a nightmare
That seemed so real
A horrified vision of the skyline
Covered up in steel
I stumble outside, everything around me had changed
I could not believe my eyes
I stare into a world rearranged

My heart was pounding faster
Am I awake or still in a dream
The vision of final disaster
The vision of empty streams?

[Chorus]
I see a dead sky dawning
A lethal encounter of the first degree
I see a dead sky dawning
No mercy for you, No mercy for me
I see a dead sky dawning
A lethal encounter of the first degree
I see a dead sky dawning
It's the end for you, It's the end for me

The world is silent
Only the life from above can be seen
Mercy comes and blinded me
All fates creates and within for me

It' s not of this world
Our senses disappears
Something within me tells me
It's the end of humanity

My heart was pounding faster
Am I awake or still in a dream
The vision of final disaster
The vision of empty streams
Released from this nightmare
Let me wake up to find the world I knew
But then I see the things that surround me
I realize we are the chosen few

[Chorus]
I see a dead sky dawning
A lethal encounter of the first degree
I see a dead sky dawning
No mercy for you, No mercy for me
I see a dead sky dawning
A lethal encounter of the first degree
I see a dead sky dawning
It's the end for you, It's the end for me

It's the end for me
They've come to take me away
Remembered as their prey
The execution right now taking flight

[Chorus]
I see a dead sky dawning
A lethal encounter of the first degree
I see a dead sky dawning
No mercy for y ou, No mercy for me
I see a dead sky dawning
A lethal encounter of the first degree
I see a dead sky dawning
No mercy for you, no mercy for me!
