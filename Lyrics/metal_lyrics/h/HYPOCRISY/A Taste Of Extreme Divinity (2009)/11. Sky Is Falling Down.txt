Sky is falling down
Sophistic energy
A crack in the core
A burning sodomy for liberty
Feel the neon dots that's tattooed in your flesh
Cause they don't want you to think in any different way
Psychotic preferences
A state of reinvent
And now the new world has just begun
Scream all you want
While they drill the holes
Lobotomy will set you free

Cyanide sacrifice
Laser beam sanctuary
Transit life, suicide
Bad dreams do come true

Sky's falling down
Pull the plug
Terminate, innocent, tranquilized
Cannot wake up

Back in the womb
Waiting for the rebirth
Tube stuck in your veins
Monitored by machines

Back in the womb
Waiting for the rebirth
Tube stuck in your veins
Monitored by machines
Electric pulses feeding your brain

Sky's falling down
Pull the plug
Terminate, innocent, tranquilized
Cannot wake up
Sky's falling down
Take me home
