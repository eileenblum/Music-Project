Bright lights
Is there anybody out there?
From the sky something's coming my way
It knocked me down, I'm paralyzed except my mind
Something else is in control of me

Strapped down to a bench I lie
Performing surgery, I'm open wide
My life just got simplified
I can't believe I'm gonna die

Dwelling in the unknown
I won't see tomorrow
They're stealing my life
They're drilling into my soul
I can't see tomorrow
I am out of time

Dwelling in the unknown
I won't see tomorrow
They're stealing my life
They're drilling into my soul
I can't see tomorrow
I am out of time

They keep me alive so they can test my strength
Pumping my body dry
I cannot feel anything anymore
I guess this is my goodbye

Strapped down to a bench I lie
Performing surgery, I'm open wide
My life just got simplified
I can't believe I'm gonna die

Dwelling in the unknown
I won't see tomorrow
They're stealing my life
They're drilling into my soul
I can't see tomorrow
I am out of time
There is no tomorrow
They're stealing my life
