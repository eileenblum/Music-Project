One's loss is another's pain
When someone falls then the others gain

Misjudged and stripped down to the bones
The industry is getting rich on the poor
They'll make you bleed out your anger
No one will ask you for your forgiveness

The quest for the sign
Will stop at nothing
Follows the book of lies
Your god told you to look for the sign
Suck 'em all dry like a parasite

Kill a million people
And kill another million more
They don't believe in what you believe
It's not your gods' call

Misjudged and stripped down to the bones
The industry is getting rich on the poor
They'll make you bleed out your anger
No one will ask you for your forgiveness

The quest for the sign
Will stop at nothing
Follows the book of lies
Your god told you to look for the sign
Suck 'em all dry like a parasite
