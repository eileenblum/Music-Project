Symbols and signs painted everywhere
Predynamic hieroglyphs
A path, a stargate
Armageddon awaits on the other side
Storms of hate will plow over the earth

Science working to crack the code
Bury the gateway, let it go
Don't let them through
Can not gamble with the human race

Solar - empire
Resurrection of the atomic god
Solace - deceiver
Searching for another host

Through the black holes
Travelled for lightyears
Looking for another world to reign
Rebel attack with intelligent masses
Exterminate the enemy with full energy

Science working to crack the code
Bury the gateway, let it go
Don't let them through
Can not gamble with the human race

Solar - empire
Resurrection of the atomic god
Solace - deceiver
Searching for another host

If we can not confirm this
Then it doesn't exist
So bury it down again for a thousand years

Solar - empire
Resurrection of the atomic god
Solace - deceiver
Searching for another host
