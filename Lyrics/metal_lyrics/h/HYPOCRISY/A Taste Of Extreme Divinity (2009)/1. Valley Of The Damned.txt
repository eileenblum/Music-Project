The way of life
Read between the lies
Blind man preach to the deaf
The sacrifice in a holy battle
No one will forget
Limping through the ashes of the remains
No soul was saved
The great genocide
Our fates are sustained

In the valley of the damned
The battle's on
The troops of death
The falling army marches on

Hiding from the sun
Lurk them into darkness
Forbidden to be seen
Spirit of the evil gods
Triumph army of the ghost

Their victory inside
The enemy mutilated
Now lays before their feet

In the valley of the damned
The battle's on
The troops of death
The falling army marches on

Strike down the opponents
With wrath from below
The fallen angels' army
Will march to the throne
March

In the valley of the damned
The battle's on
The troops of death
The falling army marches on
