Everything is build on conspiracy
Nothing has been changed
We just smile, accept everything
Why do we turn our backs and walk away

It's hard to tell right from wrong
It's all a conspiracy
Like blindfolded cattles
And lead us on til the end

We all are living in a twisted society
Nothing's gonna stop them
When the truth won't set us free

Tamed
Filled with fear
