You call yourself a god
I call you a liar
I'll take your crucifix and stab it straight through your heart
Reclaim my past, don't need no sympathy
I only wanna be me and not live in your religious fantasy world

Brainwash the weak
Steal all you can steal
Defenseless minds of the dumber kind
The church is working overtime

The book of lies becomes alive again
Translated, twisted, read between the lines
The ancient book is still alive
And now they can not tell the truth from lies
They convince you that you're nothing
And nothing but dirt
If you don't contribute
You're no son of god
Donate your life and money that you earn
If you wanna see the light you got to sacrifice

Brainwash the weak
Steal all you can steal
Defenseless minds of the dumber kind
God is working overtime

The book of lies becomes alive again
Translated, twisted, read between the lines
The ancient book is still alive
And now they can not tell the truth from lies

Don't wanna live in sin
They will make you learn
If you're gonna sin
Then you're gonna burn

The book of lies becomes alive again
Translated, twisted, read between the lines
The ancient book is still alive
And now they can not tell the truth from lies
