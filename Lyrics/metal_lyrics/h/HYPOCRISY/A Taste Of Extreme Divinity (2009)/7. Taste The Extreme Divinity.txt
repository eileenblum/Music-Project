Treasure hunts in suicide land
The hurting never stops
It's time to meet your enemy
Bleeding games with buried anger
It will be too late
When you're done you'll plead insanity

Drown them in the dirt
Energize the will to kill
Never say a word
Strike them where it hurts
Torture with all you got
A taste of extreme divinity

Stealthy shadows of the mad
Lionize his victory
Legacy of a sick twisted man has been born
Razor sharp brain with desire
Desire for the kick
The kick to kill

Drown them in the dirt
Energize the will to kill
Never say a word
Strike them where it hurts
Torture with all you got
A taste of extreme divinity

Psycho dances with a knife
He comes for your flesh
Knock you down, tie you up
Feel the blade break your skin
