The cryogenic holocaust
Slows down the disease
Give us all a taste of your miracle
We're thirsty for your medicine
The hate burns in our eyes
It's kill or be killed
It's in the nature of the human races' weak mind
To be exterminated by ourselves

Just stab their hearts for nothing
Your greedy souls scream in envy
Kill them all
Release the anger
Weed out the weak
You don't need them

Weed out the weak

Exterminate the riff raff
No one will miss you anyway
Clean up the world with an iron fist
Start the harvest of the dead
There's no room for the weakend mind
There's no room for you
There is a new religion coming around the bend
And it's called fuck you

Just stab their hearts for nothing
Your greedy souls scream in envy
Kill them all
Release the anger
Weed out the weak
You don't need them

Weed out the weak
Stab them all
