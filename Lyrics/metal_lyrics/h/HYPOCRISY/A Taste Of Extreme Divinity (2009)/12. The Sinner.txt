[Digipak bonus song]

Raped by the retribution
A failing justice at it's costs
Demanding true redemption
And regain what you've lost

In the shadows of the weakend kind
Lurking for its prey
Shapeless, worthless, gutless souls
From behind the desk they'll make you the

Sinner - They'll send you out to the front to be the
Sinner - Where the bullets reign
Sinner - Just aim and squeeze the trigger, you are the
Sinner - You are the scape goat betrayed by your nation

In the name of democracy
Rules the country with an iron fist
But the stench from the gutter
Says that they are leaders of hypocrisy

Shapeless, worthless, gutless souls
From behind the desk they'll make you the

Sinner - They'll send you out to the front to be the
Sinner - Where the bullets reign
Sinner - Just aim and squeeze the trigger, you are the
Sinner - You are the scape goat betrayed by your nation

It's brothers in arms
Shattered by your feet
Sacrificed for democracy
Left behind at the enemy line
By the land of the free

We fight...
We die...
