[Verse 1]
Are you blind to see me?
I think I know what you need.
I crucify you for your disbelief.
Buried lies that you kept
I pull it out of your flesh
And you will never sin again.

I am God.
I am the only one.
You need me.
Put your trust in me

[Chorus]
Let the knife do the talking.
I'm gonna set you free.
Let the knife do the talking.
I wanna see you bleed.

[Verse 2]
I'll give you hope and I'll give you pleasure.
And you won't say "No" â just put your faith in me.
You seek salvation â I am the one that you need.
I'll bring your sanctuary!

I am God.
I am the only one.

[Chorus]
Let the knife do the talking.
I'm gonna set you free.
Let the knife do the talking.
I wanna see you bleed.

[Verse 3]
So, I'm on a mission to heal the world for good.
And some don't just stand in my way.
Don't get in my way!
Kill. Kill. Kill. [repeat in background]
Let the knife do the talking.
Let the knife do the talking.

[Chorus]
Let the knife do the talking.
I'm gonna set you free.
Let the knife do the talking.
I wanna see you bleed.

Let the knife do the talking.
Just believe in me.
Let the knife do the talking.
I wanna see you bleed.
