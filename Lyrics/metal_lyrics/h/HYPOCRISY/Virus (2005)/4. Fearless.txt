[Verse 1]
I don't care what you need.
I only do it to please me.
There's no one who sees it from my point of view
You're pulling me left and right.
I've had it up to here.
It's making me sick to see you alive.

Enough of conspiracy
'Cause you cannot win.
Like a bomb I release my anger.
I'll be peeling your skin.

[Chorus]
I'm gonna walk away.
You won't be holding me back.
I'm not afraid of you
So just get out of my way.

I'll destroy your life
'cause you were pulling me down.
You reached the end of the road
So just get out of my way.

So just get out of my way.

[Verse 2]
Be my enemy
I'll turn your life into dust.
Take everything you've become.
Just crawl back where you came from
And disappear from here.
Your life has taken a turn for the worse.

Enough of conspiracy
'cause you cannot win.
Like a bomb I release my anger.
I'll be peeling your skin.

Like a bomb I release my anger.
I'll be peeling your skin.

[Chorus x2]
I'm gonna walk away.
You wont be holding me back.
I'm not afraid of you
So just get out of my way.

I'll destroy your life
'cause you were pulling me down.
You reached the end of the road
So just get out of my way.

[Verse 3]
I know your kind.
I've tasted before.
You spitting out all of your lies.
I push you up against the wall.

[Chorus x2]
I'm gonna walk away.
You won't be holding me back.
I'm not afraid of you
So just get out of my way.

I'll destroy your life
'cause you were pulling me down.
You reached the end of the road
So just get out of my way.

So just get out of my way [decrescendo]
