You've got the will to kill 'couse you don't give a fuck
They're gonna lock you up and throw away the key
You've been plaing with your life, nothing's gonna stop you now.
You fuiled by the hate you've got inside
Terminate, you've got to sacrifice their flesh
Bleed for the Gods that live beyond
Stabbing work of art from their graves -- they will arise
All you need is hate when all th hope is gone

You've got the will to kill 'couse you don't give a fuck

You fuiled by the hate you've got inside
Terminate, you've got to sacrifice their flesh
Bleed for the Gods that live beyond
Stabbing work of art from their graves -- they will arise
All you need is hate when all th hope is gone

Dead is your soul
Your hope is gone

Craving for another killing

And now their lives are falling
As you're forsacking them all
Their bodies weak and starving
Death will be the final call
The sacrifice you giving
And all the lives you have drained
In God they seek forgivness
It's all in vain

Their faith will be in vain

Craving for another killing
His needs remain the same
Feast upon the sacrifice
Muder keeps him sane

Their faith will be in vain

And now their lives are falling
As you're forsacking them all
Their bodies weak and starving
Death will be the final call
The sacrifice you giving
And all the lives you have drained
In God they seek forgivness
Their faith will be in vain

Your hope is gone

Craving for another killing
Craving for another killing
Craving for another killing
Craving!!!

And now their lives are falling
As you're forsacking them all
Their bodies weak and starving
Death will be the final call
The sacrifice you giving
And all the lives you have drained
In God they seek forgivness
Their faith will be in vain

And now their lives are falling
As you're forsacking them all
Their bodies weak and starving
Death will be the final call
The sacrifice you giving
And all the lives you have drained
In God they seek forgivness
Their faith will be in vain
