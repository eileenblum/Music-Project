They'll take your life away
They will push 'til you go insane
Raped, they steal your every heartbeat
Until you fall down dead
They monitor every step you take
And watching all your thoughts
Another small piece in the puzzle, no one cares,
'cause you're being controlled

They can see all mistakes that you'll make
How long will it take until you break
From authority's eyes, we're just a virus, just a frame
A world in technology we can't remain
We're caged within ourselves, afraid to never be healed
We're trapped within our world, our lives we lived are sealed

Never can we live again
They have already set the rules
And the law is your only friend
Obey them and they'll erase you too
Sneaking up on your private life
Leads society to suicide
Now they move into our minds
You try to run but you can't hide

They can feel all the moves that you make
Stay away from the light
Is this the way that you and I have to live?
A world in technology - there's no escape

We're caged within ourselves, afraid to never be healed
We're trapped within our world, our lives we lived are sealed

Forever struggle through our lifetime
We'll never tell the truth from lies
Swallowed by our fears we'll never retreat
The smell of freedom is finally cut

[Solo of Gary Holt]

We're caged within ourselves, afraid to never be healed
We're trapped within our world, our lives we lived are sealed

We're caged within ourselves, afraid to never be healed
We're trapped within our world, our lives we lived are sealed
