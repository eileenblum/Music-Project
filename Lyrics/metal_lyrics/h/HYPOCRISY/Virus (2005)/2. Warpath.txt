We arise from the ashes below
To battle and crush the holy war
We'll spread our seeds to change history
A genocide delivered on your doorstep
They will perish in the everlasting flame
And we demand a new great victory

A new era has begun, the world is falling
And darkness triumphs, the emperor has made his call
And now the time has come for us to dread his warning
The terror will reign, death upon us all

Hell is here, no escape
Hell is here, Mother Nature's raped

Fueled by the hate we plow across the burning nation
With blood dripping from our hands only to keep the essentials from our past
The great army of the black horde is marching on
Through the remains of the slaughtered men

A new era has begun, the world is falling
And darkness triumphs, the emperor has made his call
And now the time has come for us to dread his warning
The terror will reign, death upon us all

Screams we hear in vain, of souls that turn into dust
Lives flushed down the drain, bodies left to rot

Nothing remains, only death

Earth a wound that never will heal
A new beginning will rise through the debris
Blood that was spilled, obliterated mankind
Life's lost
There's nothing left to claim

Terror will reign

A new era has begun, the world is falling
And darkness triumphs, the emperor has made his call
And now the time has come for us to dread his warning
The terror will reign, death upon us all
