A cocoon binds my skin, it wants to keep me alive
I am the great messiah of the fallen paradise
Destroyed by my own creations, I cannot cope with life
The truth you think you know so well- it's just a big lie

You live to fear,

You lay yourself to rest
Programmed to crawl- it's just a battle with hell
We are the prey, cannot break this spell

We are the slime that kicks in the dirt
We are the plague spreading through the world
We are the disease- the virus eating away
We are no one, we're just living to die

We're just a lie,

We're just a fake
I can't wait 'til I'm finally dead
Erase my numbers and hope to never return again
Computerized

We are all neutralized in a world
That's controlled by machines

You live to hate,

'til someone presses delete
The things we do- it's just a battle in hell
We are the dirt- can I break these chains?

We are the signs that caged in the dirt
We are the plague spreading through the world
We are the disease- the virus eating away
We are no one, we're just living to die
