[Limited CD+DVD Edition Hidden Bonus Track]They say you might think that I'm your biggest fool 'cause I'm not walking away.
It's time to move on
I don't have time for you.
You're just fooling yourself.

You better watch out!
It shows on your face â a lethal friend
You better watch out!
I've seen it before â your knife in my back!

You're lyin' to say no one believed in you including yourself.
Who are you, what d'you want?
You know you talk too much,
It's burning a hole in your tongue.

You better watch out!
It shows on your face, a lethal friend
You better watch out!
I've seen it before, you're laughing from my back

You better watch out!
It shows on your face, a lethal friend
You better watch out!
I've seen it before, you're laughing from my back

You better watch out!
You better watch out!
