Let me take you to a quiet place
Where I can drain you in peace
I will teach you a new meaning of fear
It sets me free to hear you scream
I will spray you full with my holy seed
I'm gonna baptize you with my warm cum
I've been waiting for this moment my whole life
When you become my chainsaw-butchered whore

You're my whore

Violated, blood drenched, naked

I cannot hide my feelings, my feelings tell me more
A sickness I've been given, a sickness that's so pure
Come here and let me taste you,
Your blood that tastes so sweet
Reach out and seek forgiveness
You're my chainsaw-butchered whore

[Solo - Tgtgren]

Don't you try to run and hide from me
You cannot escape, I won't let you escape from me
You're my trophy and I'll never let you go
I need you alive 'cause I wanna watch you die

Violated, blood drenched, naked

I cannot hide my feelings, my feelings tell me more
A sickness I've been given, a sickness that's so pure
Come here and let me taste you,
Your blood that tastes so sweet
Reach out and seek forgiveness
You're my chainsaw-butchered whore

Look in my eyes and watch the chain as the engines going berserk
A gush of blood that sprays my face as the blade is breaking your skin
Screams are freezing, you're chopped into pieces - nothing is left of your limbs
A life may be lost as I tear you apart but at least you're out of your misery

Fear me, I'm coming for you
Fear me, I'm coming for your flesh
Fear me, I'm coming for you
Fear me, I'm coming for your flesh

Let me take you to a quiet place
Where I can drain you in peace
I will teach you a new meaning of fear
It sets me free to hear you scream
I will spray you full with my holy seed
I'm gonna baptize you with my warm cum
I've been waiting for this moment my whole life
When you become my chainsaw-butchered whore

I cannot hide my feelings, my feelings tell me more
A sickness I've been given, a sickness that's so pure
Come here and let me taste you,
Your blood that tastes so sweet
Reach out and seek forgiveness
You're my chainsaw-butchered whore

I cannot hide my feelings, my feelings tell me more
A sickness I've been given, a sickness that's so pure
Come here and let me taste you,
Your blood that tastes so sweet
Reach out and seek forgiveness
You're my chainsaw-butchered whore
