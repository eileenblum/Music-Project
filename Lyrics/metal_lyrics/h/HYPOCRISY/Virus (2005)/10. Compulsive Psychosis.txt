I am still on the loose, with vengeance of hate
Thirsty for your blood
They have examined my brain but I'm still insane
Nothing can cure my hunger for your flesh

I see your face
You're getting pale

I do whatever I please, I'll bring you down to your knees
I'm in it for my own sacrifice
I am God, I am overloaded, another soul is stolen
My body is boiling, uncontrolled

I stab you dry
And watch you die

I hear the dead
It's calling my name, they say I am the one to be blamed
I see the dead
It tortures my soul, I only did what I was told

Stabbing all my enemies, let them fuckers bleed
Hang 'em high from the trees, feed 'em full with energy

Screams in agony, my mind is turning black
There's no way you can stop me now
You're a bleeder, a cheater, a dead man receiver
I am in control of your life
I hear the dead
It's calling my name, they say I am the one to be blamed
I see the dead
It tortures my soul, I only did what I was told

I hear the dead
It's calling my name, they say I am the one to be blamed
I see the dead
It tortures my soul, I only did what I was told
