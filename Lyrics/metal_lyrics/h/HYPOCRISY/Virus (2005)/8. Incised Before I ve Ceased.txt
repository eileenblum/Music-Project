I'm wide awake but I don't feel alive
Drain my blood and wait for me to die
Cut me open, knives slashing my flesh
Black empty eyes that drills holes in my spine
They remove my organs, limb by limb
Drink my blood, my heart will stop to beat
Where am I, what do they want from me?
From the blade's work I'm done

Take me away from this hell
No matter how much I'm screaming
They won't stop cutting me
I don't need this surgery

I don't wanna live, I don't wanna be
Incised before I've ceased
I don't wanna feel, pull the plug on me
Incised before I've ceased

They pulled me up, there's nothing left of me
Fold me up 'cause I'm dead
Turn off the life support you don't need me no more
I am shredded
Don't you dare put me back
I'm not your human surgical experiment
Just turn me off, why can't you stop?
Your work is done
Gather my flesh

Take me away from this hell
I don't need this surgery

I don't wanna live, I don't wanna be
Incised before I've ceased
I don't wanna feel, pull the plug on me
Incised before I've ceased
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna be
Incised before I've ceased
I don't wanna feel, pull the plug on me
Incised before I've ceased

I don't wanna live, I don't wanna be
Incised before I've ceased
I don't wanna feel, pull the plug on me
Incised before I've ceased
