MURDER!
My only crime was being born.
RAPING!
The only thing I really enjoy
Tie her down to bed,
Pillow on her face,
Pick up a knife and start to... CARVE!

Desperate,
She starts to wake up,
She can scream all she wants,
It just makes me stronger,
CARVE!

Suck your blood,
Withered body lying around.
Feel my cuts
I'm pulling life in alarm
Becomes a reality.
Feel the pain as I peel your skin

She lying there spread wide open,
Taking her last breath on this earth.
Ripping out the infant
While I am fucking it up.
Smash its head with a hammer
Now I am fed.
No use crying cause you'll be next.
