(It cannot (can no) longer be denied / They can no longer deny)
The government's coverup frights your life (far to long?)
Keep your mouth shut, (of / for) what you have seen
(Or / All) (your / the) body parts (will / were) spread around
For trying to prove the missing time

For those who have seen the terror has begun
Not for the things you've been through
But the things you (know / done)

(It's on an / in an institution)
(Where you will stay for the rest of your life)
There's no therapy, justify the mind
Revealing all that of your soul
There's nothing you try to get treatment for.
REQUEST DENIED!!!

[Whispers]

[Scream]

[Chorus]

The memories of (the encounters / these hours)
Will never go away
I'm (scared / scarred) for the rest of my life
