[Kiss cover]

Well, it's a strange way
The way you look at me
And it's a hard time
Time you've been givin' me
Come on and open up
Open up to me
So you can realize
That I could set you free

[Chorus:]
Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted days

Well, it's a strange place
That you've been livin' in
And it's a strange line
You've been deliverin'
I think I like it
But I'm not really sure
Don't wanna to fight it
Just wanna feel some more

[Chorus:]
Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted days

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted days...
