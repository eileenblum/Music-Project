Take the gun, put it to your head
Pull the trigger, now you're dead
Slave race abandoned
Another crucifixion ??? from beginning
Like a motherfuckin' massacre
Take your ball sack and pull it
Like a bone tap crushing through your scalp
Fall into submission heavily

God can't help you now
Jesus died upon the cross
Damnation
Your turn next

This is war

Start assault with people
pissing on your crucifix
They will come for you
Pain's growing through you

Warrior against mice
break 'em down to burn
We cannot compete
Spoils of war

Growing wave
of the crime
The killing art
Break your pride
Feel no pain
all we need
It's a lesson learned
from the world

Like a motherfuckin' massacre
break your bones like a bullet
Break the bone into ???
fall into submission heavily

God can't help you now
Jesus died upon the cross
Damnation
