Temples with darkness
Slipping away through pain
The fear of emptiness
Helpless, I'm being drained

Through the anger I would have seen
My life getting no better
Never will I be free

Thousand between lies and reality
Makes no difference
for here and ??????

Through the anger I would have seen
My life getting no better
Never will I be free

Temples with darkness
Slipping away through pain
The fear of emptiness
Helpless, I'm being drained

Through the anger of what I have seen
My life getting no better
Never will I be free
