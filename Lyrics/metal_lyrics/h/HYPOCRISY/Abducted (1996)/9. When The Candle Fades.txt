The sky turns black
We're all a bunch of ??? ghouls
Dreams are reality
Just the same
Just another crucifixion
one more cross nailed to the ground
The beginning of the end
has just begun

Lights getting dark
The real pain's yet to come
Call out the magic words
Forever change to the flame
another thing turned to ashes
Blessed by the dark

When the candle fades
The pain closing in
When the sun turns black
You release your blood and fade away

The candle light
You take your life and dwell in emptiness
Running away from the pain

Body with empty souls
cryin' to be free
But this is just the beginning
of the end
The seance is catching up with you
Tortured by the past once again

The time stopped
But nothing's forever
What comes after death?
It never ends
You release your blood and fade away

The candle light
You take your life and dwell in emptiness
Running away from the pain

You release your blood and fade away

The candle light
You take your life and dwell in emptiness
Running away from the pain
You release your blood and fade away
The candle light
You release your blood and fade away
You release your blood and fade away
You release your blood and fade away
