In 1994
something else took control
They came and grabbed me
as I was sleeping in my bed

They moved fast
Watch over your thoughts
To come to me
??? hate
they've come to stick it in my brain
What?

Suddenly, I was in another room
Terrified
Cannot scream, cannot move
Paralyzed with fear
Where am I?
Why is it happening to me?

Some say "It's the chosen one"
What's going on?
They can't fool with the light
I knew they would come

I must have fainted
'cause when I woke up
they were all gone
What's going on?
No!

Now, when I look back,
I remember
I could not move or scream
The fear
I lost all feeling
Will they ever leave me alone?

I must have fainted
'cause when I woke up
they were all gone
What's going on?
