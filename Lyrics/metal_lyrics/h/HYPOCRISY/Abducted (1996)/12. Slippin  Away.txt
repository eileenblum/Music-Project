Filled with anguish and confusion.
Realise the nonsense of existin'.
Stuck... to a meaningless life
and no change for the better.

Send a kiss from jail.
Can this a dream bless me now?
To undo the pain,
my soul will slip on...

Don't tell me 'bury the pain'
As I bury the knife in my body.
Slowly slipping away
To another dimension.

My soul is drifting away in vain.
A man greets me on the other side.
'Welcome to hell.'
Here it's my turn.
Send a kiss from tomorrow.
Endless dreams that we've held.

Don't tell me 'bury the pain'
As I bury the knife in my body.
Slowly slipping away
To another dimension.

Bury the pain
As I bury the knife in my body.
Slowly slipping away
To another dimension.

Bury the pain
As I bury the knife in my body.
Slowly slipping away
To another dimension.
