Wide awake for the whole event
Never been such a plague
They will die to survive
Turn around and walk away

Walk into the fire
Watch the flames
They will die for you
'cause you were chosen

In the form of a voiceless dream
Never be afraid of death.
The immortal life can take it's toll.
You am I, as I am me.

Never trust the wise men
They will push you off the right track
And when they throw these demons before you
Just be prepared to strike back

Priests and Christians
Who will know from the truth?
You will not fill your empty cup
'cause you are a god
