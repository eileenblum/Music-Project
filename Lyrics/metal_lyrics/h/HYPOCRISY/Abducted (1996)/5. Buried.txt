Like a drug,
I love the taste of flesh
You aren't awake
to pay for death
Life in gulps
You struggle for it
You will drown, then bleed to death

One down and more to kill
to clean up this world
Hunt down
As their bodies ripped up
to get the adrenaline pumpin'
Yeah! Oh!

Your remains of a butchered body
Throw 'em in a coffin
Buried six feet under here
to never see the sun
or breathe the air
Your flesh will be decayed

Murdered, buried, forgotten
Another life destroyed

Gave up this body
For another realm
My body gets warm as I fill you with my cum
Squeeze the cold, pale body
as I fuck it

Murdered, buried, forgotten
Another life destroyed
