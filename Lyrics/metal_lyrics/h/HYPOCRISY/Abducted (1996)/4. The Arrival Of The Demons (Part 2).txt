As the full moon rised
in the sky,
it awakes.
Master, bring out the dark
forces upon me
I live for dying
and to kill
Watcher,
open the Gates of Death

Reach for the silence
Reach for an end

With a knife I release my blood
not afraid to give away my soul
for the elder gods
Sign away in blood
Now perform the sacred rite
Cut apart the immortal god

Reach for the silence
Reach for the end

We gather around
the circle is completed now
the time is right
for the arrival of the demon
