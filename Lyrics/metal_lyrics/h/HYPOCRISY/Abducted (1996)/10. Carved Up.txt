Murder
My only crime was bein' born
Mayhem
The only thing I really enjoy

Tie her down to the bed
Pillow on her face
Take out the knife and start to
Carve

Desperate, she starts to wake up but
She can scream all she wants
It just makes me stronger
Yeah

Psychopathic behavior
Shredded body lyin' around
Feel my cuts
A move in life
That I love

Lunatic nightmares
Becomes a reality
Feel the pain as I peel your skin

Uh

She's lying there
Split wide open
Taking her last breath on this earth
Ripping out the infant
What a fuckin' living

Smash it's head with a hammer
Now I'm fed
No one would know the crime I committed
Not even me.
