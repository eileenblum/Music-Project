Walkin' into the fire
I'm trying to find my soul there
Can I ever feel the warmth?
I am in need
I hope they find me soon

The voices I hear
are trying to control me
Need to clear my mind
or never survive
Suicide
the only solution
Blood is too bold
for their retribution

I have lost all my beliefs
But now I chase the truth
and it hurts
It is so ???
???
This is the only way

Slashing my arms
to let the blood free
Soon to get away from the pain
I have lost
all my beliefs
to a world of hypocrisy
Not afraid to die
Just an empty soul
in cosmos

Once I tried
to make a difference
But now I'm chasing the truth
Only the pain I have earned
and deceit runs through you

??? in their eyes
???
take pride in their development
Can't walk away from here

The voices I hear
are trying to kill me
Soon to get away from the pain
I have lost my belief
to a world of hypocrisy
Not afraid to die
Just an empty soul
in cosmos

Once I tried
to make a difference
But now I'm chasing the truth
Only the pain I have earned
hard deceit runs through you
