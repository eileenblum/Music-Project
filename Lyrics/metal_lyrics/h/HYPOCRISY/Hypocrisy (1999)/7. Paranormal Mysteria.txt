Ohh!
Ohh!
Years of torment rising from your souls
Soul destroyer,
Death is in his gaze
Reconstruction of the feelings
Locked in you
Molesting and burning
Going out the ???

I made you
I believe in you

You only exist
'cause I created you
From scraps of dead ???
From my hands you will be free to do
You won't need the ???

Making new body
Creating new body parts
Continue to crush and ???
Oh, raping and destruction
For the end
That is like destruction in itself

I'll destroy you
I'm releasing you

Now what in the world
Will try to bring me down?
I'll close my hand
I'll only destroy you
'cause I wanted to
To show the power I own
You won't survive my thought control
It's tormented for the soul
