You can't beat me
You can't beat the demons, I insist
I'll come to take you away
To a better place where you can rest

I won't stay forever
Just 'til the end of time
I won't make it better
I'll be there 'til you die

There's no end for your pain
Just as long as you fight it
It is all just a game
To see how long you can take it

I won't stay forever
Just til the end of time
I won't make it better
I'll be there 'til you die

Gotta wait 'til the end
Be the reaper's hand
Gotta wait 'til the end
Be the reaper's hand

Yeah

I won't stay forever
Just 'til the end of time
I won't make it better
I'll be there 'til you die

Gotta wait 'til the end
Be the reaper's hand
Gotta wait 'til the end
Be the reaper's hand
Gotta wait 'til the end
Be the reaper's hand
Gotta wait 'til the end
Be the reaper's hand
