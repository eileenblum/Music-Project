I squeeze until you're dead
I can feel it
All your energy is low
You better believe it
I'll destroy you in my arms
You will be gone
In time, you see the things we've done
I'll see you in hell

The killing gives me
All the pleasure
Just to see you fade away
And turning to stone

Yeah

I squeeze until you die
I can feel it
All your energy is gone
You better believe it
I'll destroy you in my arms
You will be gone
In time, you'll see the things we've done
I'll see you in hell
I'll see you in hell
I'll see you in hell

I'll squeeze until you die
You will be gone
In time, you see the things we've done
I'll see you in hell
I'll see you in hell
I'll see you in hell
