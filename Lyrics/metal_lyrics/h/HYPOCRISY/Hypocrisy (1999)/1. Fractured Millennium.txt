Yeah!
I came from second universe,
My travels far.
Oh, mankind, I'm not pleased.
Is this the way you're supposed to be?
You're free from decay.
Doesn't anyone care anymore?
Killing your own world,
There's nothing to stop you.
Can't you see what you're doing?
It's gotta end
Or nothing will be left.

Dying planet.
Mother Nature bleeding,
She will die.
Burning planet.
Burning lives,
Indulging will commence

I'm scraping out in soil,
But there's nowhere to grow.
??? people rule
But you won't quit
No!
Ready to strike back
Ready for death
Armageddon waits near
For the rules of this world
You gotta go on 'til you die.
We're plundering and your money and
Power is all you believe.
Praying to God who don't exist.
Can't you see what you're doing?
It's gotta end
Or nothing will be there.

Dying planet.
Mother Nature bleeding,
She will die.
Burning planet.
Burning lives,
Indulging will commence
