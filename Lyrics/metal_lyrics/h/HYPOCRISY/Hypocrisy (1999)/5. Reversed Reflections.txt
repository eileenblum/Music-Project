On the edge of insanity
Lost from the world
Sticking an hand into the soul
To disappear from this Earth

Nervous again?
Do you offer some help to me?
You're running out of breath
Do you see about me?

The drugs don't work anymore
Give me some to ease the pain

Damned by the dead
Cursed by the dead

The guilt is hanging
Over my shoulder
To the lights of taking
My cause will never end

Burn
I will burn
I'm screaming hard
I can't be heard

The drugs don't work anymore
Give me some to ease the pain
The drugs don't work anymore
Give me some to ease the pain

Damned by the dead
Cursed by the dead
Damned by the dead
Cursed by the dead
Damned by the dead
Cursed by the dead
Damned by the dead
Cursed by the dead
