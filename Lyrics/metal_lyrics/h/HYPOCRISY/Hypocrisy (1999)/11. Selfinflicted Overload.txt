I've been bred
For the termination of life
As humans fill the earth,
They'll destroy it and divide

??? dripping from my head
Their terror never ends
And when I see my face in the mirror
I just want to take my life

Do you hunger for life?
I'm taking mine
I won't get 'em all

Terror from the past
It's haunting me
Just leave me alone

Selfinflicted overload
Illusion breaks their thoughts
Would you all ???
Would you want to be alive?
Selfinflicted overload
The taking of their life
Breaking your world apart
Would you want to be alive?

Time will tell
If their ??? on my side
I thought I saw the future
But there was nothing to see

Do you hunger for life?
I'm taking mine
I won't get 'em all

I'm being ??? again
It's haunting me
I'm running out of time

Selfinflicted overload
Illusion breaks their pride
Would we all ???
Would you want to be alive?
Selfinflicted overload
The beating of their life
Breaking your world apart
Would you want to be alive?
