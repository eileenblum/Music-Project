Aaahh!
Shredding apart with the knife
Waiting for death
Cutting my veins wide open
Free from the lie
I am ripping it from my head
Living my life like the end is here
I can't take it

Tonight we are gonna pay
Suicide never felt so good
Dripping blood from my head
I'll never fail to die
Look and you'll know why

I'll recover and strike
I can't see the light
Lord, hallucinations appear
My omen, God, the angels of vindication

Breathe Slowly
I am in this world
I can't expose my soul
Breathe Slowly
I'm ending this life
Ready for vengefull God
Now

It's a big fuckin' lie
It's the other side
Blow your fuckin' mind
With bullshit lies
Listen and decide
When you're fuckin' dead
Cheering on the war
Face to face with the devil

Tonight we are gonna pay
Suicide never felt so good
Dripping blood from my head
I'll never fail to die
Look and you'll know why

I'll recover and strike
I can't see the light
Lord, hallucinations appear
My omen, God, the angels of vindication

???
I am in this world
I can't expose myself
???
I'm ending this life
Ready for vengefull God
