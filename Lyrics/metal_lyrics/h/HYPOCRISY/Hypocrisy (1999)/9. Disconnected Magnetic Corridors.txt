Breaking up the silence in the night
It's like running around erasing ground
It can't be done

For the first time I tried to really try
It's not easy for a blind man to see the signs

I've seen the future and the end is here
Please forgive me, 'cause I've been there

Seas ran by and by and far and wide
It's easy to see right through your fingers and hide

Fighting for the freedom nowhere found
Feeling all alone in the fight
Running around in circles in the mind
I'm supposed to keep it all inside

I've seen the future and the end is here
Please forgive me, 'cause I've been there

It's not too much time left for us to breathe
That's my story
The end is closing in

Seas ran by and by and far and wide
It's easy to see right through your fingers and hide
Seas ran by and by and far and wide
It's easy to see right through your fingers and hide

Relief as my body tries
To get by
The light behind these cracks of glass is so bright
