I can feel the sorrow build inside my mind.
The purpose exists at the price I had to pay.

Freedom!
Freedom!

Is this the life I had to live?
I pretend there's nothing to complain about.
Am I locked in a circle that can't be broken?
Or is it just a paled, empty dream?

The vault is closing in and I can't breathe.
It feels like I'm underwater and I can't swim.

Is this the life I had to live?
I pretend there's nothing to complain about.
Am I locked in a circle that can't be broken?
Or is this just a paled, empty dream?

Is this the life I had to live?
I pretend there's nothing to complain about.
Am I lost in a circle that can't be broken?
Or is this just a paled, empty dream?
