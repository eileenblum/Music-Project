You can't beat me!
You can't beat the demons, I insist.
I've come to take you away.
To a better place where you can rest.
I won't stay forever.
Just 'til the end of time.
I won't make it better.
I'll be there 'til you die.

There's no end for your pain.
Just as long as you fight it.
It is all just a game.
To see how long you can take it.
I won't stay forever.
Just 'til the end of time.
I won't make it better.
I'll be there 'til you die.
Got a way to the end.
Equilibrium's end.
Got a way to the end.
Equilibrium's end.

No!!!

I won't stay forever.
Just 'til the end of time.
I won't make it better.
I'll be there 'til you die.
Got a way to the end.
It will be for yourself.
Got a way to the end.
Equilibrium's end.
Got a way to the end.
Equilibrium's end.
Got a way to the end.
Equilibrium's end.
