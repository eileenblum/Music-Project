You displease my eyes!

Some say that God's ear.
I'm yours 'til you find my lust.
Holy day almost here.
To molest, this evil corpse.

[Chorus:]
Depravity.
Lustful blasphemy.
Their gathering brought you to me!
At the altar they recently found you.
Running loose with hellish condition.
The angels soon will be dead.
All believers have to walk in Hell!

Call my name, I will hear
And the christians will cease to exist.
I curse, thee whom I seek
Darkening, will soon be here.

Wait, sacrifice my life.
With this evil unholy knife.
We are looking down to a god.
Fuck Jesus Christ!

Slaves of mankind, believe your lies.
Useless, beggars, believers - I hope you die!

Dying, for God, I'm not with him.
Crime is in our hearts.
You not reveal!

[Live version part:]
Crying, curl up and die
My eternal oath - you shall see!

[Chorus]

Sacrifice a virgin's body life
Would you be a servant, for Satan or mankind?
Sacrifice a virgin's body life
Again I speak: Fuck Jesus Christ!
