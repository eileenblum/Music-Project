Thanks to: Lars (bananen), Johanson (our sound man) for always making sure
that we have the loudest and best live sound, Mattias (daddy / manager), Kamijo
(second guitarist live) for babysitting and getting us on the right flights,
bus, boats and so on. Nuclear Blast records (none mentioned, none forgotten)

Special Thanks to: Our fans that would not let us quit and all the magazines
and zines (thanks for a killer support). We will release a new studio album
"Hypocrisy" on May, 25th 1999.

"Hypocrisy Destroys Wacken" is available on video (the whole concert from
Wacken and from our own private videos 1993-1998), too.
