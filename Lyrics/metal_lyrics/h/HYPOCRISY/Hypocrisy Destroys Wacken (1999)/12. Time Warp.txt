Drifting empty outer space.
Looking for euphoric end.
Searching for the perfect end.
Running for you useless.
They'll try to break your empty mind.
Leaving all your crew behind.
Coming to reality.
You're sucked into the time warp.

Burning, without the use of fire.
Your emotions getting higher.
Can you take it anymore?
Really enough to keep you down.
Your life has just begun.
Will this ever end?
Coming to reality.
You're sucked into time warp!!!

Digging up the missiles from your silo line.
Computer images from the bomb inside.
Yeah!!!

Ahh!

Project system turning for a burning flesh.
Everything is dead.
Ahh!

Try to end this like you choose it.
But you will always always always ??? to never get away.
Burning for a hole inside.
You know they've got the further way.
Will this ever end?
Coming to reality.
You're sucked into the time warp!

Here we go!
