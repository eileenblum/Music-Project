Burn in the night, fight
they go away the nightmare rise
you know they're never right
fight, fight
they know they already know they die
great hate alive
great hate alive
whether you fight die
yeah burn in hell
great ruling hate
they die for you, yeah!
(growl) yeah
when you realize all the lies
(growl) lies
this is hell this is your destination
this is I!
you shall all know the wonders of your soul
(growls a LOT)
find my Satan
sacrifice
the lies
Lucifer is here
