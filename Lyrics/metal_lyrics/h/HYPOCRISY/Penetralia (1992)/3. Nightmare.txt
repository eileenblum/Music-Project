You wake up in the middle of the night,
wallowing in sweat.
I'm the worst of dreams you ever feared.
I'm in your dreams - I'm in your soul.
You never get away from here, and that's my goal.

You've always tried to run away...
...but I'm in your dreams - and I'm alive!

Whoa ha ha...

I rule your dreams!
I am your - NIGHTMARE!

You can't get out, you start to scream.
Praying for all yours: "End at dawn!"
Is it dream or is it real?
I came not for flesh and blood.

You're longing for delight...
don't you know, that you already died!
