Sacrificed and bruised for eternal life,
by the cross he will die.
In the name of evil,
Lucifer rules the world.

You and me and the holy ghost,
we destroy all the unholy souls.

Your fate is fulfilled,
you live your life once more.
Why can't you dying?
you're standing here like before!

Take my hand, I show you what pleasure is!
Come with me to Satan's dreamland.
Welcome to my Reich, where nothing's holy ground.
I scheme your soul.

To escape is to die!
