[Translated by Violator and Kristoffer Hansen]

Screaming through the soul.
You're thinking like a god.
Satan not surprised.
The darkness has arrived.
A smash between the eyes.
You're helping cure this eye.
Glibly closing in.
No one hear you.
Scream!
Impotent god!
Why won't you die?
You're full of lies.
Go to hell!!!

Think you'll be reawaken.
He thought to be in one.
It would be a desire to be immortal.
The bloody corpse is rot.
They fear they'll burn like fire.
My phantom wearing scars.
Satan wants your head.
So now you'll bleed for me!!!
Evil disgusting rots.
Spit in the face of your god.
Going in Jesus and priests; you'll mental and physically die!
