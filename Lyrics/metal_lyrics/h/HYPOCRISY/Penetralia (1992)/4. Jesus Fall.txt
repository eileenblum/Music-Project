Why aren't you damned to hell?
We can feel your concerns
Jesus fall, we will (stab?) you
Face it without war. Die!
Destroy the priest
Please die! God's away!
You will die!
Satan, god of emotions
Come and lead us astray
So we can return now
To enter the holy (canopy?)
Yeah! Jesus Fall!
We will see!
Now you all see him bleed!
Sacrifice for fire is here
Rushing from Satan ?????????
We will take only what we need
You will die Lucifer is here
Destroy the priest!
Please die! God's away!
Jesus Fall!!!!!
