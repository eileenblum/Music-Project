So, you think you're a god!
You're nothing but a piece of shit,
and if I get my hands on you,
you will slowly die!

Oh the church of God
preaching all the shit
I'm not scared of you
I think Jesus,
GOD IS LIE

I rule this world,
and Satan's son was sent.
Son of evil, heart cold as blood.
Father Satan give me your power!
To create a new world.

Assemble at the gate,
and we'll be as one.
Reaches night, the end of dawn, evil.
GOD IS A LIE

All my slaves and await,
obey me and you die!
