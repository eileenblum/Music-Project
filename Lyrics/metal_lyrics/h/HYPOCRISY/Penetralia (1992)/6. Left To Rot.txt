The power of darkness - you never believed.
A prince of evil - to conquer your dreams.
I said why you don't perish friend of the unjoy.
I put you mercyly in to show you my power.

Die for me in hell!
So I can get rid of your smell

Martyr from the sky - your love will turn to hate.
No more lies - you never see the light of the day!
You must pray...

Give me your hands - I cut them off.
Watching you standing - so you don't fall.
You start to crying - I steal no tear.
You Liar - I have no fear!

Die!
You must hate...

"I break you down in hell...
...I'll steal your show and to (abort) you forever."
