Like a flash through the sky
He felt reborn
Something went through his mind
Now he knows he will never ever be alone again

Running into a certain death
Like a warrior he will fight
Getting thrown into this hell
For his beliefs he will die

The war has harvested another life
But his spirit is alive
Someone else will carry on
On the battle field
To face his destiny

Running into a certain death
Like a warrior he will fight
Getting thrown into this hell
For his beliefs he will die

Didn't anyone explain to you
Why you lay here and bleed?
Fight a war that can't be won
Die for your country's freedom
Freedom has never been so far away
They will die in vain

A soldiers life is taken
His family in great sorrow
Once a young boy, now a dead boy
His country send him to hell

To hell

Running into a certain death
Like a warrior he will fight
Getting thrown into this hell
For his beliefs he will die
