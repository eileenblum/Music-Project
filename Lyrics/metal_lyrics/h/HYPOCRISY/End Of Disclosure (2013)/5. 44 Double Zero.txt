The sun goes up and the sun goes down
Where do you think you have been?
You know that something's wrong
And you get the chill
The chill that tears you apart

Flashbacks from the terror
Your soul is starting to bleed
You pray for miracles that are gonna set you free
Your freedom is already goner

You're 44 double zero
You're 44 double zero

A cry in the dark and a blurry view
Bodies floating in the dark;
They scream: kill me, kill me
Don't wanna suffer no more
Begging the enemy, you won't get no sympathy
Your life has turned into dust
Strapped on a bench
Now they're in your head
Turning your memories to rust

Flashbacks from the terror
Your soul is starting to bleed
You pray for miracles that are gonna set you free
Your freedom is already gone

You're 44 double zero
You're 44 double zero

Float in a dream
Your life's been robbed

Youâre 44 double zero
You're 44 double zero

Float in a dream
Your lifeâs been robbed
