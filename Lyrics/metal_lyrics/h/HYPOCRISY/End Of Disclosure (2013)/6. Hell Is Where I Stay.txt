I was born a dark night
Time stood still
The sky turned red and Jesus wept

Feeding my perverted pleasure
The taste of rotten flesh
No entering to the pearly gate
I am home

Hell is where I stay
My destiny pulls me down south
I 'm home again
Hell is where I stay
It burns inside of my veins
I'm free again

Like a bullet straight from hell
I'll snatch and slaughter your soul

So you think that you can trick me
Hypocrite to the core
I give you a lesson in violence
As my hammer crushes your bones
Lay and bleed and bleed for me
Do you feel salvation?
I know all your tricks

Feeding my perverted pleasure
The taste of rotten flesh
No entering to the pearly gate
I am home
Hell is where I stay
My destiny pulls me down south
I'm home again
Hell is where I stay
It burns inside of my veins
I'm free again
