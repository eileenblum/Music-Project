I am your fear
I am your revolution
I'll change your life
I am your tumor
I sting you
I'll set the venom free
Like an ever floating stream
I'll make you weak

To reconnect your DNA
It's time to adapt
A new eraâs born
A new dimension unfolds

The return of the gods
The creators of life
To restore the earth have finally arrived
The return of the gods
Let the morning come
Let the dawn show its face
Time to balance the human race

There's no rich, there's no poor
Only gray faded memories
The truth will change your beliefs
Religion becomes the disease

To reconnect your DNA
It is time to adapt
A new era's born
A new dimension unfolds

The return of the gods
The creators of life
To restore the earth have finally arrived
The return of the gods
Let the morning come
Let the dawn show its face
Time to balance the human race

Governments and banks are falling
Everything turns to zero
Revolution is finally calling
The world is done with hypocrite heroes

The return of the gods
