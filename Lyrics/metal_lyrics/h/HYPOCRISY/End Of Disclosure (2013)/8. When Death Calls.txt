Another day, another murder
The troops of doom are marching in

They rape the women
Just kill them all
Beg for your life when death calls
You try to fight back, it will be your fall
They crush your life when death calls

Hear death call your name

They move like shadows
Dark as the night
As demons they fly
Where they come from, no body knows
They're here to collect our souls

They rape the women
Just kill them all
Beg for your life when death calls
You try to fight back, it will be your fall
They crush your life when death calls

Tortured people hanging high
Burning corpses on the ground

They plow through the cities
Leave nothing behind
Just ashes and smoke
it's burned to the ground

Save thy, save thy, save thy
Save thy children
Save thy, save thy, save thy
Save thy women

They rape the women
Just kill them all
Beg for your life when death calls
You try to fight back, it wilt be your fall
They crush your life when death calls
