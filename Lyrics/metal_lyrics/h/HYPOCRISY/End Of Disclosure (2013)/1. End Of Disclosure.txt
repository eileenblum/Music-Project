I'm sitting on the moon looking down on you
And watching what you've become
The new world order has a plan for you
A great deception that will make you numb

Fantasy invasion from the sky
Trillion dollars secret funds
This is a new pondÂ 
Only for the selected ones

End of disclosure
Now the countdown has begun
End of Disclosure
Before they kill everyone

Don't speakÂ 
You will disapear
They're gonna erase the truth
Mass genocideÂ 
70% will die
It's too late for you

Fantasy invasion from the sky
Trillion dollars secret funds
Drilling cities undergroundâ¬§
Only for the selected ones

End of disclosure
Now the countdown has begun
End of Disclosure
Before they kill everyone

They are gonna nuke the world
When they're hiding in their Bunks
Slaughter us like animals
