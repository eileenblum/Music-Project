So you think you live in a safe world
You better fucking think again
Just waiting for the moment of truth
To erase me and you

I hate, we hate, we all hate what you stand for
I pay, they pay, we pay the price for your lies
Time is ticking and we cannot sit and wait
To let those fuckers kill the human race

The new world order
United we fall
It will come crashing down
The new world order
United we die
It's all a lie

Spray the skies
Toxic rain
We're living to die
Mind control
We can only wait for the mass genocide

Mass hysteria in a dead grey world
It's ticking like a time bomb
Feel the tension in society
You can sense that something's wrong

I hate, they hate, we hate all that you stand for
I pay, they pay, we pay the price for your lies

The new world order
United we fall
It will come crashing down
The new world order
United we die
It's all a lie

They steal your dreams, then expose you
Vaccine to everyone
Mind control, let the people live in fear
The truth will never be told
