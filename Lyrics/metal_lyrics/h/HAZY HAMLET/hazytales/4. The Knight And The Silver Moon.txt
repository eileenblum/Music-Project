[Part 1. The Battle]

Riding across the Balcans
searching for a new adventure
the heart is so far away
beside your love that awaits

But now your friends
- the sword and the horse -
has been guiding him
for the next battle

(A next battle)
It's coming on
where the death spies on
the cross and the faith in god
the reason for your shed blood

Under a Silver Moon -
the innocence of a broken heart
Under a Silver Moon -
behind the fury of the knight

Your princess cries in the castle
enclosured by walls of memories
she carries a new life
another warrior that will die -
(By the Kings! By the Cross! By the Might!!)

And the blood of the knight disappears
are not for being defeated, his tears
the battle has really been lost
but the fate separated his heir!

Riding across the Balcans
the crusaders found their doom
and nobody understands the passion
between the knight and the silver moon . . .

[Part 2. The Redemption]

My Knight, do you hear the music?
Do you hear? They are calling!
See the Valkyries
See the angels
Your moment is now!

You win, your blood is not in vain
Do you feel, they are taking away your pain!!

A better place is waiting for you
(In the court of Valhalla)
Beside Odin, Thor and Tyr
(In the court of Valhalla)
In the court of paradise
(Is the court of Valhalla)
Beside God and the angels
(We know your sacrifice!!)

The innocence in your heart
made of you one hero!!
