There are you crying in your ship,
Enclosured by Fears.
You left behind your land
And your people full of tears.

You remember the threat:
The tyrant forbade the union,
Forbade the commerce,
And now is left the dominion.

The true king lost his head:
There is not fall when you're dead.
Maybe this is the fate of kings:
Die by the blade of guillotine.

What's gone wrong, I can't see straight.
Been too long, so full of hate.
And I think that you are not blind
To the ones you left behind.

Sad is the war and it's innocent blood
Sad is the cross and it's suicidal followers.

King of nothing: where's your pride?
King of nothing: you should have tried.

Now your land is dominated.
Your land is in the hand of the tyrant.
You have nothing left,
Only the colony and the faith of a better future.

But king, do not worry:
You will be a hero,
Your life will turn to story,
But you will never look to a mirror.
