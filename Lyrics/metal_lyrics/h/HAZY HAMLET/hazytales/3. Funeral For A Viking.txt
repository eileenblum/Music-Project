Gods of the elements
this is the season of fall
Darkness covering my vision
blood staining the wall

Day after day
the time seems to drain
The truest things
taken by the rain!

The final battle has begun
I hope to be reminded as a brave
'Cause there's nothing beyond the ashes,
except the memory!

Day after day
the time seems to drain
The truest things
taken by the rain!

Like a warrior
one battle will bring my sunset
Ancient lore
I will return to my holy land!

Set me in my boat
and let me go
I will return to the thunder!
To my gods!
Make me ashes,
eternal return by fire!
