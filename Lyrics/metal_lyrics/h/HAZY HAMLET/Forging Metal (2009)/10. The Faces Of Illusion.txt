[Music by Hazy Hamlet; Lyrics by Arthur Migotto]

You give your life to men and god
Trusting in lies and empty words
And when you most need them
You find you're all alone...

And when you look up to the skies
You understand the humans threat
A black vultures flock
Coldly await your death...

[Bridge]
âOh god!
The ground has vanished from beneath my feet
Oh I've been walking over a bridge of sand
Will I ever find the end? The bottom of this pit?â

[Chorus]
Unforeseen sandstorms
Have never gone so far away
Filling your eyes with sand
And loneliness
Beyond a velvet screen
Lie the ones who pull the strings
Playing with your innocence
Oh, believe!
Every time the curtain falls
It's disillusion!

Beware the crowd,
They just want to watch you bleeding
A black vultures flock
They just want to hear you screaming!

[Solo]

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

God, humans, vultures and strings
The faces of Illusion...
The faces of Illusion...
Face the faces!
Face the faces of Illusion!
Face the faces!
Face the faces of Illusion!

Oh god!
