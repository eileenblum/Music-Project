[Lyrics by Arthur Migotto]

There It comes... 
The serenity in It's eyes suits perfectly the drizzle that now falls. 
Can you hear? 
The edge of the blade to provoke the fields, as It whispers us the lyrics of our requiem... 
Who would wonder the closest friend of the reaper could feel such tranquility for the spreading of death... 
What shall be of you when standing before The Shadow? 
Will you face your Executioner? 
When the drums of battle are the ones to beat the time, which shall you drop first? 
Your sweat? 
Your tears? 
Your blood?! 
Not even GOD dares to answer, for the fusion of this fluids took no part in the plans of his creation... 
Kneel and pray my friend for I have seen it in my nightmares and there shall be no mercy at all! 
Kneel and pray my friend for this is the beginning of the end...
