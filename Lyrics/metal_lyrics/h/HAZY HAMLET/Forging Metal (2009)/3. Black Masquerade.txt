[Music and lyrics by Hazy Hamlet]

There's a mask for each of your sins.
There's an indulgence to pay for each violation.
There's a scorn for all that exists. -
But how: if there's nothing beyond all this?

[Bridge]
Under the light
Theater of doom
Denial of life
Wretchedness is soon...
The cold of the night
My spirit will burn
Needed "to do right":
To hide and not learn!

Before the cross - tears in vain!
Representing ourselves in the stage again...
Cover your eyes not to see your life.
But until there in darkness stays my heart!

[Bridge]

[Chorus 2x]
Beneath a black masquerade!
Oh, black masquerade!
"We surrender!"

[Solo]
[Chorus 4x]
