[Music and lyrics by Hazy Hamlet]

Gods of the elements
This is the season of fall
The darkness covering my vision
Blood staining the wall

[Bridge]
Day after day time seems to drain
The truest things taken by the rain!

The final battle has begun
I hope to be reminded as a brave
'Cause there's nothing beyond the ashes, except the memory!

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Like a warrior
One battle will bring my sunset!
Ancient lore
I will return to my holy land!

Set me in my boat
And let me go
I will return to the thunder!
To my gods,
They make me ashes,
Eternal return by fire!

[Solo]

Gods of the elements
This is the season of fall
The darkness covering my vision
Blood staining the wall

[Bridge]

[Chorus 2x]
