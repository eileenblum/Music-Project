[Music by F. Nakahara, Hermano F; Lyrics by F. Nakahara]

I start to hear the screams
Fear echoes deep in my heart
In everywhere destruction begins
And now... now I know who you are

All's falling by your side
Now I know your destination
This is the beginning of night
The end of god's creation

[Bridge]
The black moon is rising
Between the mist and the battle sounds
The council was conspired
And decimated one by one

[Chorus]
Blood and fire now were joined
In the taking of the throne
Now I know who you are
It's all in the holy writs
Now I know what you came for
The Emperor! Is your name...
Your name...

All the idols begin to fall
There is nothing more to see
Emptiness is covering this place
Something new is rising here

All's falling by your side
Now I know your destination
This is the beginning of night
The end of god's creation

[Bridge]
[Chorus 2x]
