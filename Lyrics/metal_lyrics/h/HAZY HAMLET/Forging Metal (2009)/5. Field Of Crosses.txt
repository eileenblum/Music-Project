[Music and lyrics by Arthur Migotto]

No wind will ever blow away this pain
Each candle lights an urn to seal
Feel a warm now's falling, they're tears shed
From all those who have remained
But no they can't wash away all the stained blood
Like the haze in the dawn we'll fade...

We have signed a treat
With the old lady in black
Whose skill in the chessboard can hold
King sanity in check

We've embraced the souls bearer
So now welcome home
Don't expect too much
For the guests find just too late we are...

[Chorus]
Never going to stop seeding this field of crosses!
The harvest is fair, I see it in the smile of Death!
Never going to stop seeding this field of crosses!
The harvest is fair, we're meeting beyond the black!

Oh! A field of crosses
All will be left from our Mother Earth
Watch the black rain is now falling, they're consumed souls
Burnt with the hope
When the atomic flower rose and the sun shone red
All this place we call home is doomed...

And who will pay for our sins?
Those not even born!
Who will drink the polluted water
Where we bathed our dreams

We held hands with the bearer
So now welcome home
Don't expect too much
For the guests find just too late we are...

[Chorus]
Oh! Down we go!

[Solo]

Bloody wars, wicked deeds
Death will laugh last bearing souls of our kids!
We create our own destiny
Why have we chosen to seed
A crosses field? Crosses field...
