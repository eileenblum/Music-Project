[Music by Hazy Hamlet, lyrics by Arthur Migotto]

Head to the gas stop
Fill up the tank
Of our good old Ford
As well as us, he needs some fire

Steel-born machine
Our V8 sings
With the hardest songs
Rocking the highway, rolling tires

[Bridge]
We'll be taking our hammers down
As long as there are sparks to fly
From inside our souls
We are songsmiths
And our Metal'll never stop to glow

[Chorus]
We'll be forever forging Metal! Metal!
Bang your heads, we are
Forging Metal to the world! Metal!

Before we're leaving
We get two six-packs
And then hit the road
Today the highway is our home

There's nothing better
Than a couple of brews
And a crazy crowd
Waiting to rock all the night long

[Bridge]
[Chorus 2x]

Oh, you always say you love it, huh?
I wanna hear it from your lungs!

Metal! We're forging Metal!
Metal! We're forging Metal!
Louder!
Metal! We're forging Metal!
Metal! We're forging Metal!

[Bridge]
[Chorus 2x]
