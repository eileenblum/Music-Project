[Music and lyrics by Arthur Migotto]

Six days to create this world
And everything here
Was in a perfect harmony
What intentions had then god
To spend a whole day in
The seeding of humanity?

[Bridge]
Dreaming power
Is born the first illness of world
Dreaming power
It has no soul... We've got no soul

[Chorus]
Beasts! Of mankind...
Rise! It's god's creation
Hands of fire seeking the control

Was god planning to retire
Or joking at his toys,
Giving us some of his power?
Play a role of god on earth
Create destruction tools,
Metal beings with demons eyes

[Bridge]
Burning, dying
Feel the wrath of your own son
Burning, dying
Hands of fire... Demons eyes!

[Chorus]
Beasts! Of mankind...
Rise! It's god's creation
Hands of fire seeking the control
Beasts! Of metal...
Rise! It's revolution
Hands of fire losing the control!

[Solo]
Oh, our chance is gone
Our burning greed has won
We were left behind
In the search for some control
We've created a metal ghost
A billions eyes beholder!

[Chorus 4x]
Beasts! Of metal...
Rise! It's revolution...
Electrified eyes,
Who's under control?
