[Music and lyrics by Arthur Migotto]

Rise! Take thy sword back to fight!
Thou shalt meet no victory fleeing...
Thy soul still is a beast to tame!
Burn! Let thy damn weakness burn!
Follow the hot Muspell winds
Baptize thy heart in Surtur's Flames!

Feel the battle...
Make thy battle...
Free thy battlecry...

[Chorus]
Pulsing courage
Chrome Heart!
Find thine instinct is thy guide
Mighty razor
Chrome Heart!
Find thy strength comes from inside
For Thou hast a Chrome Heart...

Hear! Hear what the plain says!
Many will meet death on these fields...
But thou shalt not be one of them!
Ride! Once more thou must ride!
Thy brothers wait for thee with pride
And dawn must see that thou couldst stand

Hear the blade sing...
See the blade shine...
Feel the blade inside...

[Chorus]

Hel whispers to thou crawling in thy skin
But cold Niflheim's not thy home...
Rise thine own seat aside of Odin
At the Golden Hall! The Golden Hall!

Feel the battle...
Make thy battle...
Free thy battlecry...

[Chorus]

Chrome Heart... Chrome Heart...
