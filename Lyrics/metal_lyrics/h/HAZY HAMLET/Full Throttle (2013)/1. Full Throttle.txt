[Music &amp; Lyrics by Arthur Migotto]

Floating in this dust mote
Stranded on the Planet of the Idiots
Dystopian tale
Wicked pipers lead all to a wasted trail

[BRIDGE]
Ignite it! Lifeâs short and still
Thereâs a lot of gas to burn
Feed the fire! Gotta join the ride
Before the lightningâs gone

[CHORUS]
Full Throttle
Feel no regret! Feel no remorse!
Embrace the road
Full Throttle
We have forged the chains we wear
Time to grind'em all, break free
Consecrated skullsroad
Ballasts on the wings of the savage hawk
Dare to crush belief bones
Reason is the fuel that makes life engine roar

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

Ride! Ride! Go!

[SOLO]

[CHORUS]
