[Music &amp; Lyrics by Arthur Migotto]

Chase the trailing glow of milky way
Break away from rising sun
Night and day, apace gone
So ride! The route of rejoicing
Life is going on

[BRIDGE]
Leave some old thoughts behind, Oh
Release the beast inside, Oh

[CHORUS]
Faster, faster rides Odin
He dared to raise up from Hlidskjalf
To live an ancient dream
Faster, faster rides Odin
The One Eyed God is running wild

Odin has transformed Sleipnir
In an iron horse

Take a breath of insight and wildness
Blow it loud on Gjallarhorn
Wake The Nine, wake them all
And ride! The highway of relish
'Till The Twilight falls

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]

[SOLO]
[CHORUS]
