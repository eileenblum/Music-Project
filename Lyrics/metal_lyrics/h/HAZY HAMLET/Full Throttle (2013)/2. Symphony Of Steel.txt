[Music &amp; Lyrics by Arthur Migotto]

Noon breeze is chilling
Ladies feel the neck skin crawl
Raging dogs start barking madly
As dead sparrows fall
The mighty sun is fading
To a dark blood red
Sky above is turning deep black
Right above our heads!

[BRIDGE]
The earth is rumbling
Motors crying
Guitars screaming
This is Heavy Metal!

[CHORUS]
Bang your heads
We play out loud
The Symphony of Steel
Bang your heads
We play out loud
The Symphony of Steel
Symphony of Steel!

Clouds going round and round
A set of lightning strikes
Tornadoes blowing off
Cars and motorbikes
Each roar of thunder
Houses raze to ground
Frantic servants running, screaming
As the church burns down

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]

Among the desperate cry
A scary crackling blast
Huge craters open up
To swallow all that lasts
A burning stage ascends
Fiends are all around
Hell is really breaking loose
To hear us play it loud!

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]

Symphony...
Steel Oh Oh
We play out loud!
