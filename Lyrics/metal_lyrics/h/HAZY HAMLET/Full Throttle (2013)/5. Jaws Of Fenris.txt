[Music &amp; Lyrics by Arthur Migotto]

[TYR]
Dark was the future of Aesir
Death was the future of all
Odin has learned from the Norns
Gods would meet end in your jaws
So I have been sent by the Father
To cease this fate, to bring you down

[FENRIS]
You are deception,
Worst of the beings.
The hand the fed me,
In my jaws it bleeds.
I may be bound here
But in the end I'll be free!

[CHORUS]
Jaws of Fenris [4x]

[TYR]
Odin had offered his left eye
He had hanged for nine days and
nights
Pain's such a small price to pay
When value succeeds sacrifice
In silence I take my duty
Recover balance so justice reigns

[FENRIS]
You call it justice
Suffering and pain?
You trusted rumor,
Gave me no chance.
I may be bound here
But we'll meet in the end!

[CHORUS]

[INTERLUDE]

Bastard! Liar!
Killer! Tyrant!
[TYR]
You were betrayed by your pride!
Bastard! Liar!
Killer! Tyrant!
[FENRIS]
You'll feel no mercy in my bite!
No!

[SOLO]

[INTERLUDE]
[CHORUS]
