[Music &amp; Lyrics by Arthur Migotto]

âI honored the fallen enemy by placing a stone on his beautiful graveâ
[- Manfred von Richthofen]

Open! Open the gates of hangar
The cavalry boy with dazzle in his eyes
Is ready to conquer the sky
Eager! Eager to start his own count
Squadron can see his naivety and youth
Marriage of pride and virtue

[BRIDGE]
The Albatros looms up in heaven
In insolent red, Fear it spreads
The legend is born

[CHORUS]
Red Baron, Red Baron!
Crimson blood covers the sun
Oh oh oh! Red Baron
Red Baron, Red Baron!
The rise of the devilish guns
Oh oh oh! Red Baron
Red Baron! Red Baron!
Shot down! One by one to the ground
Engage and fire, enemy falls
A new trophy shines on the wall

Feint death! Flying Circus' in town
Storm in the night, head-shot in flight
The Bloodiest show on the earth

[BRIDGE]
The almighty Fokker trespasses
The enemy lines, a negligent dive
The Free Lord is dead

[CHORUS]
Red Baron, Red Baron!
Crimson blood covers the sun
Oh oh oh! Red Baron
Red Baron, Red Baron!
The silence of devilish guns
Oh oh oh! Red Baron

[SOLO - CHASE]

[INTERLUDE - FALL]

[SOLO]

[INTERLUDE - ASCENSION]
As his soul ascended
An astonishing sight
Above shiny heaven
Below dark as night
'Twas dozens of eagles
Shading sunlight
Warriors praising the one,
The tamer of winds,
King of skies

[SOLO]

[CHORUS]
Red Baron, Red Baron!
Crimson blood covers the sun
Oh oh oh! Red Baron
Red Baron, Red Baron!
The laud of the devilish guns
Oh oh oh! Red Baron, Red Baron
