[Music &amp; Lyrics by Arthur Migotto]

Oh, cold shadows soak the aftermath
Impaled eyes repressing wrath
The hourly voice coaxing your ears
A mellow one to fool your fears

FEAR! The very heart of liquid times
The overture in fascist chimes
Imposition! Prohibition! Prejudice!
Faith leads to Hell what Reason is!

[BRIDGE]
Rise, rise, rise!
Vengeance strikes tonight!

[CHORUS]
Vengeance... It's vengeance time!
Vengeance... Vengeance arises...
Vengeance... It's vengeance time!
Vengeance... Vengeance strikes!

Hmm, hey wicked Voice! How are your dolls?
Your Grace, young lady awaits!
Madam J. - do thou recall my love?
Whore! Thou hast bedded another one...

All aboard! It's almost time!
Grab a rose, give me a smile
Canvas' yours to paint your fate
Hail and farewell!
Valhalla opens its gates...

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]

Revolution begins... A new age is rising
Canvas' yours, paint your fate
Fate is yours, it's all in your hands
Time for Vendetta
