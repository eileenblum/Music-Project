I see them all around me, you must see them too
Choose your path with care or you become a victim of the fools
Mind your step watch where you tread, or you'll be pulled inside
They'll suck out your humanity 'til they bleed you dry

We're all living in the land of the living dead
We're all living in the land of the living dead
You will find no solace, the machine never stops
Hunting you like a zombie, stalking you 'till you drop

Be on your guard on all times, you're safe neither day or night
If you find yourself surrounded, don't give in! fight! fight! fight!
They almost had me once or twice, I almost can't avoid
I was lucky to escape, with the skin of my bare teeth

All before their time before they reached their prime
They lost the joy of life, beware - you're next in line!
Don't rely on past beliefs alone, to keep your standards
Rule that you abandon, can become your own commandments
