Behold - in dream apocalypse all Satan's kingdom come
The dawn of doom in wrath entombed, let souls in fire be one
Beware deceitful daughters, sinful sons of Abraham
For calamity will catch you and despatch you if it can

Fear you God, as God is your fear - the end is nigh
Through this Gos, this God of fear - we sin here, then in fear we die

Deniers of divinity who refute the 'perfect mind'
In valley of temptation, whe the blind have led the blind
In heresy - in blasphemy - in apostasy will burn
In escasies of agony as the horned beast returns

The Book of Revelation - this book of Hell
From days of old the tales unfold, the end ov days compel
The lessons they taught us, have just sold and bought us
Our fate debased by supplification, the faithful needs must fear

Above a blood red sea a blood red moon will rise
The sacrament shall feed the sacrifice
Deus quaerit solum ulciscendi

God. Judgement. Heaven. Hell.

Friends of futurology, supersessionist and all
Who gave you new theology you impressionistic all
Does it please you, appease you, does it vindicate your state ?
Will you kiss the whore of babylon as the seventh seals your fate ?

Fear you God, as God is your fear - the end is nigh
Through this Gos, this God of fear - God sins here, then in fear we die
