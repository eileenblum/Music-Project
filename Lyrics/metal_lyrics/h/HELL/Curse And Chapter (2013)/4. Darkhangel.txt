Majestic light of Baphomet, O formless laughing one - whose might unmarred the maker's mind unmade
Shine forth upon this acolyte - as one with me become, let the flames of Lilith claim those God betrayed
"O Masters of Dimensions, thou unsleeping lords of sin,
From lade of sulphur's fiery void where demons dwell within..."
From thy kingdom will come
Read the rites, cast the spell, call the chaos lords of Hell
Son of Caim, Orobas, Shub-Niggurath, Beelzebub, Haagenti, Astaroth
Let the earth begin to burn

And all things will come to be, when the spirit is flesh - Mine the magick, the mystery, till he comes
Rise from out of destitution - through pain I rise above - soon will come the restitution of our love

I have walked the ways to other worlds, I see what none have seen - the Union of Opposites foretell
A life unchained through knowledge gained has sanctified my dream
With prayers arcane, I raise the Darkhangel
"O patriarch of parallels, in vales of slumbering sin
The candle, hell, the book compel, all demons welcome in..."
Through thy kingdom will come
Read the rites, cast the spell, call the chaos Lords of Hell
Barbatos, Orias, Amdusias, Naberius, Ipos, Valac, Zagan
Let the Earth begin to burn

All commandments be cast away, here where fears are all passed away

[Solo - Bower]

To this kingdom we come
Read the rites, cast the spell, call the chaos Lords of Hell
Agares, Vapula, Marchosias, Samigina, Vine, Sitir, Beleth
Let the earth begin to burn

I have travelled through time's portal, supra mortal have become,
This night of Pan, I greet thee as a friend
I decades yearned for your return, to see thy death undone - what fools abhorred, endured I to the end
Speak to me now in tongues of angels, life devourer, wisdom giver
Through the vision, through the voice, through the veil, thyself deliver

Rise from out of destitution, through pain I rise above
Will come the restitution of our love...

Into my loneliness comes the sound of a flute in dim groves that haunt the uttermost hills,
Even from the brave river they reach to the edge of the wilderness. And I behold Pan...
