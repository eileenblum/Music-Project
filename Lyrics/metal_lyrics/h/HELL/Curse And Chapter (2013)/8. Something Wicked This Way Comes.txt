Where the veil is thor asunder
Where the dark devours the sun
Where the Nemhain feast and plunder
Something wicked this was comes ...

I am the whore the bleeds desease upon priapic turgour
I am the scum which seeps unseen from reason's rotting corpse
I am the fear which warps the minds of all in twisted splendour
I am the end - I am the source

Seven tongues to speak the story, seven times my will be done
Seven shades of nightmare's darkness, all your fears to me succumb
By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes

I am the worm within your gut which sucks your dwindling lifeblood
I am the fly that vomits acid on your weeping eyes
I am the beast who laughs so cruelly as I rape compassion
I am your nemesis - your spirit's compromise

Seven souls relese the story, seven crimes to blight the sun
Seven shades of nightmare's darkness, all your fears to me succumb

You can't see me, but I'm waiting in the corner of you eye
I am alive

I am the black of night, my darkened shroud shall all-encompass
I am the reaper's scythe which steals your life,
I am the succubus who draws delight from devastation
I am the fallen one - it's time to pay the tithe

Seven oaths to bind the story, seven words all faith to shun
Seven shades of nightmare's darkness, all your fears to me succumb
