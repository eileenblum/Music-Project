Unholy are the holiest of all, the truth be told
And soulless are the soldiers of the onward Christian soul
The retrograde insanity true profanity shall install
All Hell be loosed where old excuses paralyze freewill

This is the time - this is the day - this is the age

The symmetry of their salvation strangles like a curse
The rapture of the verse and chapter birthing something worse
With sanctimonious ritual the canonize their dead
But with sword and fire and crucifix their gospel has been spread

This is the dawning of the Age of Nefarious - the wretched rise in answer to the call
As in my mind I crystallise the things in life I most despise - this plague they share with us
So join me now in prayer my friends, and may their faith make martyrs of them all

The living lies of history were written by the hand
Of those who had the might to prove His right
To save us? Enslave us? Spill our blood upon the sand
Till we chose to turn their faces to the light

And meanwhile, in the ministry, the unhappy few await
In the hope that as they give, they shall receive
As the notion they're nothing in this solitary world
Leaves them desperate for something, something to believe

Evangelistic vultures dig their claws into out time
Irreligious ministers grow far beyond their prime
There is no chosen path, no sense to anything at all
The song of life's litany as all prepare to fall
