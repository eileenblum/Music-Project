"Dearly beloved brethren, we are gathered here this night
In the sight of our redeemer and our saviour Jesus Christ
With his divine permission we this mission shall fulfill
And together on unholy paths deliver us from evil..."

Force-fed on religion from the day I took my name
Branded as a player in their superstitious game
The preacher's words were frightful tools which I remember well
"Repent ye sinners now or you will surely burn in Hell"

The pleasures and sensations and temptations of the flesh
Damned my heart with guilt thus I was driven to confess
On bended knees I bowed and prayed to save my mortal soul
To rid me of corruption and depravity untold
Deliver us from evil

No angelic voice came singing
In my head was only ringing
The torment was no omen, either hell or heaven sent
The mocking peals of laughter were the sound of common sense

"Dearly beloved brethren, we are gathered here this night
In the sight of our redeemer and our saviour Jesus Christ
With his divine permission we this mission shall fulfill
And together on unholy paths deliver us from evil..."

Perhaps I'm being stubborn, perhaps it's only pride
Perhaps belief within myself forbids belief outside
Perhaps one day I'll see the light, disclaim this evil blight
Armed only with the gospel sword to fight the holy fight

Forgive my declination of your loathsome invitation
I shall seek not my salvation at the heart of your domain
I fear not intimidation of your threats of reprobation
Nor dread incineration should I worship not your name
