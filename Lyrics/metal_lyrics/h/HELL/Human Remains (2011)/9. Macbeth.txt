When shall we three meet again - in thunder, lightning, or rain?
When the hurly burly's done, when the battle's lost and won
That will be ere that set of sun
Where the place? - upon the heath
And there to meet with Macbeth

To Macbeth and Banquo came the three sisters weird
Macbeth they met with titles that were strange to his ears
"Thane of Cawdor, king to be" - so went their prophesy

That wretched name Cawdor seemed to breed treachery
The thane that came before, and Macbeth did agree
By Duncan;s death all of the land would fall to aching hands

Double, double, double, toil and trouble, fire burn and cauldron bubble
Be bloody bold and resolute and never fear death
For no man of woman born shall ever harm Macbeth

A guilty and tormented soul, so deeply steeped in sin
The gory glory's bloody story mauls Macbeth within
Dreadful frights - grisly sights - sleepless and tormented nights
Macbeth's ill-gotten gains are plagued by nightmare's savage bite

Witches' words recalled - soothed his pain, brought him calm
Macbeth believed himself to be free from all harm
He was yet to meet the man who would make him despair his charm

Dunsinane's battle was over and won
Almost before bold Macbeth was undone
Macduff tolled the knell of Macbeth's coming doom
When he was untimely ripped from the womb
Charged with a task long before he was born
Macduff was the one not of woman born
