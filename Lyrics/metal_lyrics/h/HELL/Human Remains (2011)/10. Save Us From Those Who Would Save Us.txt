I find it hard to see that in this modern age
So many people are easily outraged
They shouldn't be such narrow minded fools

I think the puritans have more than had their say
And I for one am bored with all their rules

I'm sick and tired of people telling me what to do
Self-appointed guardians - no better then me or you

Save us from those who would save us

They make the barriers and we must break them down
We must ensure they're stopped before
They got a proper foothold in your mind
Narrow minded fools

They'll conscript your conscience, they'll make you bow and cower
So watch your step, they're never far behind.
