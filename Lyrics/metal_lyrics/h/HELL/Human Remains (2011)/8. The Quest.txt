Searching for something - I look to the open door
I feel a raw anticipation I have never known before
Strange sensations shake my senses to the core
My head is reeling, but my body craves for more

If you truly believe in what you do
Your dreams one day will come true
If you truly believe in what you do
One day your dreams will come true

Braving the unknown I walk through the open door
Could this be my reincarnation? I have felt this thrill before
The revelations of rebirth fill me with the greatest awe
My addiction to adrenaline screams for ever more
