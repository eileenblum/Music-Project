[VERSE 1:]
HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT THUNDER, THE TIME HAS COME AGAIN
THE PAGAN GODS WITH THEIR WHIPS ALL LASHING, ROAR THE SOUND OF SATANÐ¢S NAME
BURSTING UP THROUGH SODDEN WASTELANDS, A DIRE AND FEARSOME SIGHT
THE HIDEOUS BLACKENED LORDS OF HELL ARE COME TO TRY YOUR MIGHT
SOUL DESTROYING O MIND CORRUPTING O EYES OF FIRE O RANCID BREATH
LEAVING ROOTS OF MANHOOD BLEEDING, BLAZING TRAILS OF DEATH

[CHORUS:]
HELL SPAWNS FIRE - THE DEVIL IS WITHIN US - A FUNERAL PYRE FOR ALL
OUT OF THE BRIMSTONE MIRE - SATAN IS WITHIN US
SCREAMING WITH RAGE - AND BENT ON DESTROYING

[VERSE 2:]
WHAT WORTHLESS CREATURES FLOCK BEHIND HIM O SINNERS SEEKING GRACE
WILDLY WIELDING WICKED WEAPONS, WRESTING SOULS TO WASTE
PAINTED LAKES ARE STAINED WITH CRIMSON O RIVERS BURST THEIR BLOODIED BANKS
SHREDDED SINEWS, BURNING BODIES, PANIC REIGNS AMONGST THE RANKS

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE]

[VERSE 3:]
SOLDIERS FROM THEIR GRAVES RISING, LIFT UP OUR HOPES OF SALVATION
SAINTLY SWORDS FROM SCABBARDS LEAPING, SCATTER THE DEVILÐ¢S CREATIONS
HORSES EYES IN SOCKETS BULGING, CHARGING AGAIN AND AGAIN
SNORTING NOSTRILS FLARED WITH ANGER, FROM OUR BREASTS LEAP FLAME
THE DEVIL TURNS HIS POINTED TAIL AND FIRES A VILE RETORT
AS WE VOMIT AND PHLEGM, HE REKINDLES HIS MEN, AND COMMENCES THE SECOND ONSLAUGHT

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[BRIDGE 2:]
BUTCHERED O SLAUGHTERED O HUNG, DRAWN AND QUARTERED
MASSACRED O MURDERED, AND MAIMED
FLAYED ALIVE O CRUCIFIED O BELLIES RIPPED OPEN WIDE
DISFIGURED O DISMEMBERED, AND SLAIN
OUR GALLANT DEFENDERS ARE RENDERED SENSELESS, HELPLESS WE WATCH THEM DIE
WITH THE STENCH OF DEFEAT GROWING STRONGER AND STRONGER
WE SCATTER AND FLEE FOR OUR LIVES

[OUTRO:]
THE EARTH, THE MIGHTY GATES OF HADES, SHUDDERING, SLOWLY LURCH
IN STORMS THE NOXIOUS AND VICTORIOUS HORDES OF SATANÐ¢S CHURCH

THE DEVIL IS WITHIN US ALLÐÐ
