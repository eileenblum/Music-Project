[Verse 1:]
Hello! Good Evening! Welcome To The Show!
Here's Some Information That We Think You Should Know
We Are Intent On Inciting You - Bent On Exciting You
Let The Battle Commence
It's A Full-Scale Attack, There Is No Holding Back
Over The Top We Go - Charge!

[Chorus:]
Fire Rages In This Domain, Still We Stand Our Ground, Defiant We Remain
Using Every Single Trick To Hold You In Our Spell
I Bid You Welcome To Hell

[Verse 2:]
We Are The Hunters - Our Task Is To Hunt You
But We Shall Taunt You Before We Confront You
We Tantalise And Tease, But Our Aim Is To Please
This Quest We Must Achieve
By Hook Or By Crook We Shall Force You To Pay
Then The Prey Will Pray

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Primaeval Masochists Gathered In Hordes
Pleading For Mercy - Then Begging For More
Like A Primitive Rite - In The Black Of The Night
Pagans, One And All
Your Heart Starts To Pound As Your Feet Stamp The Ground
Literally Shaking The Floor

[Verse 4:]
I Defy The Very Devil To Dare To Cross My Path
If He Did, Iswear To You - He Would Suffer From My Wrath
The Sharp End Of My Tongue Is More Lethal Than The Sword
My Magic Incantions Would Crash Him To The Floor
We Give You Our All - It's A Question Of Pride
We Bare Our Emotions, We Have Nothing To Hide

[Repeat Chorus]

I Bid You Welcome
I Bid You Welcome
I Bid You Welcome To Hell
