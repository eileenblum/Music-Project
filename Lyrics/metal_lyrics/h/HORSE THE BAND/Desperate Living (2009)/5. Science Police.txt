I pulled you over for your dangerous curves coming up ahead
Now there's squawkin' on my mother box
It's tellin' me to bring you in

I use...
Science and technology to formulate my theory
that your D.N.A. is the D.N.A. of something strange and amazing

We are The Science Police
Lay face down on the ground
We are The Science Police
We monitor and apprehend

You are
You are
You are
You are under arrest

I use...
Science and technology to formulate my theory
that your D.N.A. is the D.N.A. of something strange and amazing

We are The Science Police
Lay face down on the ground
We are The Science Police
we monitor and apprehend

You've got me searchin'
These city streets
These filthy alleys
These quantum leaps
You've got me callin' in emergency!

You are
You are
You are
You are under arrest

You can't get away
You will serve your time
You violated statue 15-G

Citizen!
