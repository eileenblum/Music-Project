[Featuring Ed Edge]

Big business

He's an enigma wrapped up in a conundrum
He's a mystery tragic like an ailing paramedic

My heart booms to see you're still standing
I know that your faiths can be demanding
With those cables all plugged in your head
In Poughkeepsie I thought you were dead

Ed Edge
He's Ed Edge
Ed.

He's an enigma wrapped up in a conundrum
He's a mystery tragic like an ailing paramedic

Like me tell you about Ed Edge...
Mexico City

He's a Buddhist, Christian, paramedic, vegan, straight edge pimp but most of all..
Big
He's big

Under an attack of the heart
He knows the sign
holds it close to his heart all the time

He's a believer, a healer, a sexuality stealer

Where have you been Ed?
Where are you going to?

He drifts on soul tides from island birth
...he arrives
golden heart and black hands
A human male. He's just a man.

Where have you been Ed?
where are you going to?
Where have you been Ed?
Where are you going??
