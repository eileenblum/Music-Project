[Featuring Jamie Stewart]

Pushing thrusting bulbs into the light
A peasant thought starts its flight
From reason and from fact
A peasant thought

Grows two legs
Opens up its heart
An absurd courtship

Oh dear
Oh dear
What has become of hesitation?
Oh dear
Oh dear
Did the mosquito's bite bring me down?

She said, "Let's sing the crippling song"
Her lips always ate moments like days
...and I was not prepared

I was gone

...and I was not prepared
To let my guard down
So I fed her the end

The end of my spear

We would throw rocks n' things into our well ourselves as well
we would ride to a
...clack and kabik

Like dinosaurs

Dropping into the darkness we sink

You should have seen her...
at one with the gods
she said, "Let's sing the cripple song"
Then I was gone

Oh dear, oh dear!
Then I was gone
Oh dear, oh dear!
Then I was gone
She said, "Let's sing the cripple song together"

Then I was gone.
