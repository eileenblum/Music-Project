I think I seem to be a mystery
Sven spied by the given eye
I'm telling tales of memories
Songs of birds softly outlined

I feel strange
Do you know me?
I recognize those eyes

There's something of me out there in between the trees but I don't believe
I can give the thought the time
I don't believe
I can give the thought the time

Puzzled with no peace

I feel strange
Do you know me?
I recognize those eyes

Something's coming over me like I've lost my mind but the world is open wide

Doctor, doctor
What's my status?
Will I stand or will I fall?

I can stand here blankly,
I can hold my breath,
I can even not exist at all

Doctor, doctor
Can you read me?
You've said the signs and I've got them all

Radio, radio
Can you hear my swan song?
Radio, radio
Can you hear my swan song?

I'm at it again
I'm at it again

I took my feet off
I took my legs off

I ripped my guts out
I peeled my skin off

I ripped my throat out
I pulled my eyes out

I ripped my heart out
I took my face off
