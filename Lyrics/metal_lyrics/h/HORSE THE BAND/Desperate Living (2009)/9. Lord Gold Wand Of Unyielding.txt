[Featuring Lord Gold and His Purple Majesty]

She was looking for more than just a good time
She needed a ramblin' man
To make her feel alive
In the streets of her heart
Someone had arrived
The Golden God of her dreams with blank porcelain eyes

Sunken in the master's chair
Lord Gold's face - a blank survey

The fullest flush
The sweetest surrender,
Pay attention as he pours...
You can't ignore blood, stars and wine

Expose your heart
Show me where you're weak
Kneel and beg for my healing
Obsession sinks in
You want more and more
Of my wand of unyielding

Open your heart to the world
Bare your soul to your lord.

Expose your heart
Show me where you're weak
Kneel and beg for my healing
Obsession sinks in
You want more and more
Of my wand of unyielding

Lord Gold feeds from your orifices
And he wants to see you sweat
Lord Gold probes you publicly
And makes your pussy wet

Now say his name...
LORD GOLD
