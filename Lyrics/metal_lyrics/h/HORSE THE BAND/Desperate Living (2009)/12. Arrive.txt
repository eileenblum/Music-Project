Pseudo - Squander
Plummet
Crunch
On the feet of the gods do the endless munch
Hunger
Open - Whoosh... Wind

BOOM
The Ash Grey Door of Doom
The moon is still
The stars are... still
The wind is still still
But not completely gone

The moon is still
The stars are... still
The wind is still still
But not completely gone

BOOM
Black circles in the dust spinning on a wind deprived of its lust

The sky above is bent and swings to the sound of silent things

BOOM
I can't have it all
Flee the moment and the moment will find you
I can't take this call but I can hear it
I CAN HEAR IT
I can't find the words
Speak of the devil and the devil will find you
I'm here but not at all
BUT NOT AT ALL

BOOM
...and we know that within our model of a human heart is doomed

BOOM
And still there is that gleaming silence underneath a gaping sky and an empty moon

BOOM
No need to operate to save my life
The time is coming
Quickly sliding soon
So soon
All the breaths in all the world
Stop breathing
And so consumed

ARRIVE
