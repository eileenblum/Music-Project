Wake up from etherian dreams - your song and your light return me to life.
I rise my rotting form - enthralled by your light.
Your golden, magnetic light!
Your golden voice soured eternity - held in the grip of your gravity
Why won't you let me sleep?
What art thou who summons me?
What art thou who summons me?

I crawl - I creep
I crumble back to sleep
If I could die I would sleep.
Just let me sleep
