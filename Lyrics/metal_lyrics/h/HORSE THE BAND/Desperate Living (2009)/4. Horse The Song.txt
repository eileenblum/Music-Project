[Featuring K-SLAX]

Look into the light
What do you see?
Yellow burns orange -- now blue and green
Phantoms in your vision over all that you see

The damage is done to your desperate life
But you love the feeling and won't be denied

Once is enough
The moment passes
Echoes and rings
You see the color
You hear the song sing

1 - 2 - 3
H THE B
HORSE THE BAND!

Like a meteor strike! Atomizing everything in a sphere of light
Like a lion attack! Teeth and claws covered with the meat of your back

It cuts you up just to try
How do you sleep at night?

It cuts me up every time and I don't know why.

Come on! Come on! Come on!
This is like an earthquake!
Find you balance and start to shake

Come on! Come on! Come on!
Like an exploding sun... everything is done...

It cuts you up just to try
How do you sleep at night?

It cuts me up every time and i don't know why.

Living at the top [x3]
When you're at the fucking bottom
