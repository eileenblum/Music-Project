A play folds out on the forest floor
I bought a one way ticket back to July

Quantum
Theory
Breathless
Yet...
Discorporate.

We are alive
We are hostages
Held for ransom
by a gentleman ghost
We are alive living day to day
Building bridges and statues

If I read the whole book
What would I say?
Now there's no mystery

Just a bunch of pages
Crumpled yesterdays

...and I'm not so sure we are together on this anymore

It's like...
Like nothing Matters
Oh, but it does

Woefully
At peace
We start to eat the seeds
Hungry enough to eat tomorrow
TOMORROW
TOMORROW
TOMORROW

Listen breakers
And listen bucks
These are the one-rail hooks

You're looking through garbage
The wealth and filth of our dreams.
