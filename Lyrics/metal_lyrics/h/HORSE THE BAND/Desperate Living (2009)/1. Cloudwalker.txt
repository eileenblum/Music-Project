We want to turn everything around

She's a real writer and say goodnighter
She's a sadist of a believer

I'm not a bridge, I'm not the bay
I'm not a car, taxi or train
I'm not a power tool or a construction crew
I'm not the weapon simple or mass device
Just a man with two hands

What should I do when you walk out?

I dress in white
Become cloudwalker
I want to scan the crowd
And point to where the rain flows

I'm a white cloud
I'm a white cloud

We've got clouds in our heads
Dreams in our skies
We never say goodbye

What should I do when you walk out?
We have soft clouds in our heads
We have dreams in our skies
We never say goodbye

I AM THE SKY
DON'T ASK WHY
I FEEL IT AS I FEEL MY BREATH DEEP INSIDE

I'M A RIDE HIGHER
A TRIED TRIER
A NEVER GIVE UP VICTORY FIGHT IGNITER

Row after row after row
Row after row after row
Sentinel trees go

SHE'S A DREAM BOOMER
A NEVER TOO SOONER
A 3D TREE RIGHT BEFORE ME FALLING IN THE SEWER

SHE'S A ROCKSLIDE
A ROCKET IN THE SKY
A PLANE CRASHING TO THE EARTH AND EVERYONE WHO DIED

I'M A COUNTDOWN TICK
MOVING QUITE QUICK
TWO LOVERS CONFESSING A TRYST

SHE'S A THUNDERSTORM
SINCE THE DAY SHE WAS BORN
AND SHE BEAT-BEAT-BEATS LIKE THE HEART OF A WAR

Row after row after row
Row after row after row
Sentinel trees go

I'm looking down on trees
Let's not let this moment... be the same.
