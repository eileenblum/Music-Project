I'm mesmerized. A servant to the light.
Preacher to the red and blue, the green, yellow and white.
They linger in so lovingly to songs so gay I scream!!
Brighter than the stars themselves and sweeter than ice cream.

The masses meld, the titans come, this crowd torn asunder to a quivering mass,
They smile down to me, devour my face and head!!
And everything was washed away,
I was damned to the light, I won't break!

White!! This perfect light!! Clean again but limited.
Aaaaaarrrrrggghhhhhh!!
Illu-min-ated hungry smiles,
Caterpillars and crocodiles.

Light bulb - flash pulse
Bright light - bright night
Everyone's fucked!

Light bulb - flash pulse
Bright light - bright night
Everyone's fucked!

They never change,
Only re-arrange.
Like a suicide,
It's do or die.
Coming down again
Like a grain of sand,
Caught in your eye,
Now you're blind.
