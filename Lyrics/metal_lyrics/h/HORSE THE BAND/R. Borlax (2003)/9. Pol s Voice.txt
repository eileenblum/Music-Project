Its name mocks the silence, a worthless beast born to violence,
Has its ears and whiskers flapping as its yellow flesh comes slapping
Across the rank filth of this ancient subterranean floor.
Its hate knows no bounds, as its home knows no sounds but the
Slapping! Crashing! Splatting! Of its yellow flesh.

I am the herald of light.

I withdraw a shining glory, a single loving - end of story.
Its only weakness is a grace on wings, my bow sings!

I withdraw a shining glory, a single loving - end of story.
Only weakness is a grace on wings, my bow sings!

Unleashed!
And in the silver light, my arrows take flight!
Unleashed!
Splits Pols Voices head and spills its thoughts and dreams!
Unleashed!
A host of sloppy bodies comes crashing to my feet!
Neat!

A host of slapping yellow bodies comes crashing in crimson piles!
A host of slapping yellow bodies comes crashing in crimson piles!
A host of slapping yellow bodies comes crashing in crimson piles!
A host of slapping yellow bodies comes crashing in!

Running away! Running away! Running away!
From your own voice!
Running away! Running away! Running away!
From Pols voice!
Running away! Running away! Running away!
From your own voice!
Running away! Running away! Running away!
From Pols voice!

Silence! Silence! Silence! Silence!
