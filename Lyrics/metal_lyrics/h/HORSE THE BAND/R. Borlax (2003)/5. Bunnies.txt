And a beef will rise again, broken machine in his hand.
Ten words: Snapping! Bunnies twitching, gurgling. Forget the bombs in your eyes.
Roaring with whispers to the tiny bunnies, Smash! Those fucking bunnies.
Roaring with whispers to the tiny bunnies, Splat! Those fucking bunnies.
Stand them in formation, in a sensationalist manner. Theyâre Corrupt.
Heads snapping and misspelling, eyes twitching in response to the sound of the words.

Red world like words, zooming, boiling.
Moons in the shallow sky.
Roaring with whispers to the tiny bunnies, Splat! Those fucking bunnies.
Roaring with whispers to the tiny bunnies, Squish! Those fucking bunnies.

Bloody! Bunnies! Screaming! Bring the hammer down.
Screaming! Bunnies! Twitching! Bloody bunnies smeared across the ground.
Drool spilling down my chin onto my beard screams red words at
A blank and boring sky above us.
Red words popping and crackling black.
Ten words: Snapping! Bunnies twitching, gurgling. Forget the bombs in your eyes.
Forget the bombs in your eyes. Speak the words to crack open the sky.
Forget the bombs in your eyes. Speak the words to crack open the sky.
