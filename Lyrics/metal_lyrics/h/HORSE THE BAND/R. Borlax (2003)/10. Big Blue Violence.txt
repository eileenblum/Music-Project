And on came the dawn.
Thought I'd see dying black, but I saw burning red!
Thought I'd see dying black, but I saw burning red!
Thought I'd see dying black, but I saw burning red!

It was all pedal down, full speed anticipation.
Burning my belly: The scent and the hunger.
Waves crashing through amber coasts!
Twilight drives pacify! And then ignite!

All the stars gave way to a big blue violence,
Everything like a gem.
All the stars gave way to a big blue violence,
Everything like a gem.
All the stars gave way to a big blue violence,
Everything like a gem.

In the crack of dawn, the ocean air told me things.
This was what I had been waiting for.
Her do or die appealed to my sensibilities, appealed to me like a smack,
That's right - Do or die, I came back different.
