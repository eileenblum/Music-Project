[Re-released Version Bonus Track]This I know, there is one who captures me.
For an age I stared at the heart of the moon,
Rise and fall!
Rise and fall!

I close my eyes and wish for freedom.
When I open my eyes, I find myself asleep.

The emptiness of my eyes, the memories of
Moonlight whisper seductively.

Worlds away! Worlds away! Worlds away!

Trying to forget, I looked in the heart of each perfect
Star each so full of myriad wonders of their own.
But in the night one cannot deny her, there can
Be no shadows without her defining light.

My life became a dream as I sank into the void of the fantasy I constructed
From her intangible attributes from which I awoke I had to again learn to see.

She is cold, she does not have the power to sustain my life, upon her I would die.

Love non absolute love. Love imperfect love.
Love non absolute love. Love imperfect love.

That inner closeness, the mutual respect, the power of trust,
The thunder of laughter shared words,
We are the same, we are so different.

I dared not look at her, speak to her, but I did.
I dared not look at her, speak to her, but I did.

Fact's a fact! Man was not meant for the moon.
This one fear, is bleeding like an open wound.

We are so close, the distance between us is a kiss.
A kiss that does not exist, a soft gentle petal flying on the wild wings of the wind.
A single petal from the gentle grace of the flower of woe.
May we all vomit from the stench of its perfume.
