debris, dirt disease, we've been brought to our knees,
anything and everything is torn away. our world turned
upside down and torn to the ground.
Shaking, thanking god for surviving this day.

In the wake of the Bunt!

tattered masses digging through the remains of the
lives come and gone. that elusive light broken and
reborn, a brotherhood combines, fury in your eyes.

Giant, looming, all consuming. The Bunt strikes like lightning,
Citizens feel fear! Our world turned upside and torn to the ground.
Shaking, thanking god for surviving this day.

In the wake of the Bunt!

Hearts aflame, we call the name of justice, and nothing
more. Strike up the song and scream along, vengeance
will be ours. This time itâs war!

We set upon a quivering mass and at last the moment had come, Shaking
voices cry as innocents die. Avenging their poor broken
homes. With fury and violence, we strike down she who
defies us. Bodies reach a horrible sum. Then its
horrible eyes lock on our thighs like they were
appetizers in a feast to come.

Then opens the maw of that wretched beast!!

Dear god, help us!
It wants to consume us, eating the flesh of those on the hunt.
Peeling skin from our bones, I want to go home.....

In the wake of the Bunt! [2x]
