Warm flesh and oh so smooth skin.
Twins, a sun and moon, that could have been anything.
Leading the armies of the free or building the great elaborate ID.

But one of them I dared to love so long.
Without defense, my eyes went white and blind.
Now I know only two, two wretched sisters,
Fucking lying sisters, Woe and Hate.

The ghost of a carcass, chipped away.
Its morsels, red and wet.
Losing warmth, I saw red and wet.
Hacked and cleaved from my back, I saw red and wet.
This mess is made for me by stabbers of the knife.

Thrusting, Holding, Touching, Hugging, Caressing, Loving,
Cut, Bragging, Stabbing, Comes at me, Come stabs the knife.
Cold inside, fucking me, fucking my blood. Stabbing me.
Thrusting, Swelling, Crushing, Falling, Killing me, Burning bright.
Bright! Bright! Bright! Tonight!

But one of them I dared to love so long.
Without defense, my eyes went white and blind.
Blind!

To all this I spit and leer!
Cheering vague obscenities in an empty room, on a dirty floor.
Writing Pagan poetry. Birthday card, another damn birthday card.
Splinters! Writing holiday commentary.
