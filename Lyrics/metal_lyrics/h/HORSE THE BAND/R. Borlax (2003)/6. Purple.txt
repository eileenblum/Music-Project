Sweet, sweet pain!
Like a thundercloud but tears are rain, full fists slapping, thudding, banging.
Wanting not to be weak with woe.
Empty hands! Sheâs on the floor!
On the floor she slams her hands!

Like thunder it rings in her ears, slapping and splashing in the puddles of her tears.
Lungs heaving from the crashing dying dreaming that was ripped from
Her heart while still beating.
Now there is a hole inside, where the ghosts and demons hide,
Whispering white wilting words of woe.

Hungry ugly crunchy things, horrible nasty perverted things.
In her head her mother whispers "spreading like a whore".

Weeping! Wilted! Pile! Heaving!
Weeping! Wilted! Pile! Heaving!
Weeping! Wilted! Pile! Heaving!
Weeping! Wilted! Pile!

Weak with tears and dead from dreaming.
She wanted to be wanted!
Wanting to be wanted and wanting nothing more!
She wanted to be dead!
Wanting to be wanted and wanting nothing more!
She wanted to be wanted!
Wanting to be wanted and wanting nothing more!
She wanted to be dead!
Wanting to be wanted and wanting nothing more!

Wanting to be wanted and wanting nothing more! [3x]
