[Intro:]
What is that? (Fire from the gods)
I don't know.
Power glove...

That little bastard
With his tricks and vile forms of play.
Hacking, shaving, slicing, mutilating
All that gets before him,
All that gets in his way.

Coming around down the stairs
Wood cracked beneath my feet
My hand slid across the rail
Collecting dust on my finger tips
I came into a dark room,
The smell of wet stone of many years
Then there was a bubonic retards blank empty stare

It was a little android man
HALF THE SIZE THAT I AM
SCISSORS ON HIS HEAD
SCISSSRS ON HIS FUCKING HEAD!

Little android man
Born without a soul
Without that force of reason
The scissors took control.

Little android man
Born without a heart
If he's in your vicinity he'll cut you apart!

Here he comes
Bring it down
It's just a game
Don't look back
He's right behind
Here comes peace of mind.

(cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut)

Little android man,
Born without a soul
Out of force  of reason
The scissors took control!

Little android man,
Born without a heart
If he's in your vicinity
He'll cut you apart.

Counting it down until your death counts on his fingers.
1 2 3 4

LITTLE ANDROID MAN
NEVER- NEVER - NEVER TRUST A LITTLE ANDROID MAN
HE'LL CUT CUT CUT CUT

[Outro:]
Jeez, I love the power glove. It's so bad...
