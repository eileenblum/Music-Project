Smoking birds dropping from the sky, plummeting!
Plummeting!

This circuitry works bestâ¦

And handsome shoved his gloves, with a fist he fed you reasons.
Brought you down from up above, made you strong and left you kneeling. [2x]

Brought you down from up above, made you strong and left you kneeling.
