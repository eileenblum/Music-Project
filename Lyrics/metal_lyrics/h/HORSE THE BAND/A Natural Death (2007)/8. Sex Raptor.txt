your legs are sweet and look like ivory
I can smell them and taste them at the same time
my mouth always waters with anticipation
we're together and I'm alive
feel my teethm they're lon and hard
the tips sharp enough to pierce your hide
now it's time to taste your flesh
you gasp and whimper a silent cry
good bye
I prowl the room
I prowl the room
for something sweeter to consume
I prowl the room
I prowl the room
for something sweeter to consume
"IT'S NOT ENOUGH"
"IT'S NOT ENOUGH"
"IT'S NOT ENOUGH"
"NO IT'S NOT ENOUGH"
my sweat starts to cover you
and your body starts to shake
no matter how much that you give
I just want more to take
"It's natural"
"it's natural"
I prowl the room
I prowl the room
for something fresh to consume
I prowl the room
I prowl the room
for something sweeter something sweeter something sweeter
"IT'S NOT ENOUGH"
"IT'S NOT ENOUGH"
"IT'S NOT ENOUGH"
"NO IT'S NOT ENOUGH"
my mouth has had it's fill of you
I can taste you on my breath
I give you one last kiss
and it's the kiss of death
"IT'S NOT ENOUGH"
"IT'S NOT ENOUGH"
"IT'S NOT ENOUGH"
"NO IT'S NOT ENOUGH"
