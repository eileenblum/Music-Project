...then came winter's bitterness
numbness swept down from the east
the lost, cold and hungry gently collapse
into the endless fields of soft luminous white
she sulks from the silver towers, she could save a life
he says he hates us and he's afraid to try
..and I know why
Trapped under winter's paw
I'm the animal
frost invades and steals my breathing
Distant dimples glut with glitter
and comfortable
outside the wolves are waiting
DON'T TRUST MAN
DON'T TRUST GIRL
DON'T TRUST ANIMAL
TRUST IN STEEL
Don't stop moving
Don't stop breathing
she sulks from the silver towers, she could save a life
he says he hates us and he's afraid to try
and I know why
and I know why
AND I KNOW WHY
when nature calls
TRUST IN STEEL
don't stop moving
don't stop breathing
