Winter's coming
days die short
at the end of autumn's reign
hunger becomes ravenous
hibernation never waits
soon the silent slumber
for now October's feast
fearless and graceful
crashing through dead leaves
DON'T FEED THE BEARS
OR THE BEARS WILL FEED ON YOU
all the forest fauna
frozen feeling fear
flinching at the moment
face to face with face of bear
all the forest creatures
vanish from sight
their betters come wither hungers
that cannot be denied
soon the silent
dreamings coming
hungers drumming
nights grow long
neither plant or beast have walls or doors
defenceless from the greatest of the omnivores
towering
over my head
terrible beauty
fuck I'm dead
THE HUNGER!!!!
THE HUNGER!!!!
THE HUNGER!!!!
THE HUNGER!!!!
Fall is falling
stars are conquering
dead branches soaked with rain
Bear gut glut on critters
heavy eyes feeling weight
twilight sighs
in animal eyes
a new cycle will begin
this winter when trees are white
the fauna is free from him
DON'T FEED THE BEARS
OR THE BEARS WILL FEED ON YOU
I'll die with the honor I choose
I will fight face of bear and lose
FACE TO FACE
WITH FACE OF BEAR
FACE TO FACE
WITH FACE OF BEAR
FACE TO FACE
WITH FACE OF BEAR
FACE TO FACE
WITH FACE OF BEAR
FACE TO FACE
WITH FACE OF BEAR
FACE TO FACE
WITH FACE OF BEAR
