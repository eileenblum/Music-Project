In down between the unseen
secret room of wonder and despair
rusting and in disrepair
un-here and un-there
SUPER SAPPHIRE is smiling
He's trapped in a room with three dying moons
Pulsing bicep boom cracks wheels of worlds
his not-skin cold black
a deep blue space like waiting
Violet Lights Collide then shimmer in his hair and eyes
not wounds never bleed
the lights of whispered stars
HE'S A SHATTERING PERFECTION
COMPLETELY PAST DETECTION
his head is a comet's tail
and his face is made of hearts
SUPER SAPPHIRE IS SMILING
SUPER SAPPHIRE IS SMILING
...STILL SUPER SAPPHIRE IS SMILING
I am locked in his black hole gaze...
I eat moons
YET HE EATS DAYS!!!!
I am locked in his black hole gaze...
I eat moons
YET HE EATS DAYS!!!!
CRASHING SLAMMING BOOMING DOOMING
EATING WORLDS AND CONSUMING ME
QUONOM EYES NOW BLACK ALIVE
TEASING LEARNING BLIND
DE CAMP ING HIS SEC RET PRI SON ROOM
HE-- IS-- LOOSE-
I --WAS --A -FOOL
OH NO OH NO!
