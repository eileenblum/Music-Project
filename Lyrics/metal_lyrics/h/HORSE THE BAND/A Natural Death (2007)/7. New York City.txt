Waking up in New York City
Dreaming about how it all began
Bright lights, big city
New Amsterdam and the Indians
You called me in tears
And it looks like rain

I walk south
Through our playground
Civilization's
Honeycomb

Taxi, taxi, taxi
Warm and pungent seats
Take me across the bridge
I can't be late

I'm heavy with you
Through cold morning avenues
Rushing with the rabble
Under gluttonous swollen skies

I'll come to you
Over clandestine sidewalks
I'll come to you
Crashing through dead leaves
Crashing!

I'll come to you
And cracks in the sidewalks
I'll come to you
Crashing

And the crosswalk says stop
But there you are
Just a flicker of a picture between
The static of cars.
And it's a relief
That these walls are so high
Like arms that hold us together
Waiting for a green light.

Go, go, go,
Stop!

Go, go, go,
Stop!

We embrace
In the heart of our city.
On wet, broken sidewalks
We're free
