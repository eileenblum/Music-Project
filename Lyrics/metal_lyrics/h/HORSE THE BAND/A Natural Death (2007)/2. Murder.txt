The blood of this family mingles
With the clay in this stinking riverbed
I tie the boy down and tear his mother's gown
It's OK, she's already dead

I'll sell the boy and the horses
To the snake you cannot see
I cut open the white man
And take from his woman too
If it were up to me
All the white faces would bleed
And bleed, and bleed, and bleed
It's truth

Murder
It's murder
Murder
It's murder

Empty plains echo with empty screams
There's a wagon on the highland
A father and his girl- both are heading south
I tie the boy and the horses

Then use the skills of the wolf
I don't use a bullet
I get close enough I can use my knife
My knife

I cut open the white man
And take from his woman too
If it were up to me
All the white faces would bleed
Red's a better color
It's truth

Let the blood out
Let it flow
Cut the blood out
Let it flow
Kill the blood out
Let if flow
Like a river

Let it flow
Like a river
Let it flow
Like a river
Let if flow
Like a river
Into the sea
