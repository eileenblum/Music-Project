--all aboard--
hang on, hang on,hang on
hang on, hang on,hang on
hang on, hang on,hang on
hang on, hang on
I took steps
in this mission
to take this tumultuous ride
It's all right
I'm the physician
this medicine will keep me alive
I wouldn't feel, I wouldn't look
and i would rarely care
but there's a small window at the end of this train
i hear something out there
I didn't know and I wouldn't try
I didn't have the need
the sound from the windows is becoming much clearer
that wind's a mirror
I see myself
I'm not alone
On this train of jewels and gold
passengers passer-by
strange sparkles in their eyes
then black stars start boiling from my mouth
I WANT TO DIE
on my knees i clutch my face
then glow and come alive
There's...
Lightning: in my hair
Thunder: in my ears
I go so far my head explodes
I'm only half way there
Lightning in the sky
the thunder of the train
diving into a bottomless rift
falling like rain
Lightning in the Sky
thunder in my room
there's no flavor to memories
and memories are moment's doom
hang on, hang on,hang on
hang on, hang on,hang on
hang on, hang on,hang on
hang on, hang on
onto the treasure train
valleys of sorrow and peaks of joy
across an empty plain
the treasure
of the treasure train
ON THE TREASURE TRAIN
ON THE TREASURE TRAIN
WE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME
ON THE TREASURE TRAIN
ON THE TREASURE TRAIN
ON THE TREASURE TRAIN
I GO SO FAR MY HEAD EXPLODES
ON THE TREASURE TRAIN
