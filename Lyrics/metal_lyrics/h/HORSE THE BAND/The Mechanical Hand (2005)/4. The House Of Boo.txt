Lights out -- shadows bloom
Crawling hands slide to me -- across a midnight room
I fear my blankets may not be the best
Defenses that I could muster
Still the cold beyond is like lizard claws
Crawling from the hereafter
Silent things scream and silent things BANG
Still the room is still but I'm filled with a cold
I'M TERRIFIED!!!
I'M TERRIFIED!!!
I'M TERRIFIED!!!
I'M TERRIFIED!!!
Pause cold I'm alone
I pick up the phone
But I fear
That it's been disconnected
I don't even check
Because I hear a breath
....and I know
This is the end of me.
...........I'm going to hell.
A silent scream it whispers free from me
My mouth is dry my eyes are wide
I'm statuesque - I'm petrified
The room is BLACK !!!
My mind is RED!
I'm alone in my room
.....but there's someone in my head!
HUNGRY HANDS HAUNT ME IN THE NARROW OF THE NIGHT
AND I'M SHAKING, BEGGING, for a precious night - light because..
I'M TERRIFIED
I'M TERRIFIED
I'M TERRIFIED
I'M TERRIFIED!!!!!!!!!
What should I do when the nightmares come true?
The lampshades have faces and the closets are cruel
Gasp and TREMBLE ---- weep and DROOL
Dawns glorious light-- a stale recourse
I'm the empty cup --- I'm still seeing stars
Well that's all right-
It's like I'm already there
Seven dawns UP seven moons DOWN
I'll get to sleep some night soon
That's all right -
It's like I'm already there
