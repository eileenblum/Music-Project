I feel like I'm becoming
A butterfly
Or a golden bee
My smiles like razor blades
When I smile it cuts bloody deep
My body is in the magazines
My face on the TV
My voice on the radio
That's me in my dreams
But when I open my eyes
I see I'm a piece of SHIT!
A WORTHLESS COWARD
A VAPID WHORE
A MORAL-LESS REFUGEE
COVERED IN SORES
A BLITHERING SEA COW
LOST IN ITS DREAMS
NOBODY LIKES ME, YEAH
NOBODY WANTS ME AT ALL
NOBODY LIKES ME, YEAH
Wet blue world-- it fills me up
I find I'm deep inside
Waves crash and I breathe water
But I haven't died
I won't come up
I won't come up for air
I won't come up
I won't come up for air
.....and beneath the waves
I hide my head in darker waters
And nobody sees
.....I cut myself
And hope to draw you in
But even sharks pass by
Someone please explain
All alone I'm growing colder
Laughter like cancer over my shoulder
Mirrors like hatchets to the wound of my face
You know I'm a complete.....
I'M A COMPLETE DISGRACE
I'M NOT A MANATEEN
I'M NOT A MANATEEN
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE
.....and beneath the sea
I give up and I descend
And I'm finally free
...and in the end
Wet blue world-- fills me up
Fills me deep inside
Waves crash and I breathe water
But I haven't died
NEVER
WITH FURIOUS POISON IN MY HEART
WILL I RETURN FROM THE DARKER WATERS
I LET THE TIDE TEAR ME APART
NEVER
WITH FURIOUS POISON IN MY VEINS
WILL I RETURN FROM THE DARKER WATERS
I WONT HOLD MY BREATH AND WAIT FOR CHANGE
I DIE
IT'S A SUICIDE
MY BODY SWALLOWED BY THE DEEP BLUE ABYSS
AND INTO THE ENDLESS TIDE
I won't come up
I won't come up
I won't come up for air tonight
I won't come up
I won't come up
I won't come up for air tonight
Cold
And all alone
I held my own
But now I give up
