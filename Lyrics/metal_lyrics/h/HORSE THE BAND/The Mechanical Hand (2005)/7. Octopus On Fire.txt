Right now, in the heat of my head
A flower blooms that was already dead
Decembers long gone
But these fields are forever frozen
......and everything she said
Burns in the back of my head
Quick-sands of silver
Under dreams still glittering golden
All along I sing this song
It runs wild like a river inside
A voice cries out sharp words of doubt
If I take them to heart they make me bleed
Everyday my attention strays
Light like life it fades away
The clock it ticks
I turn my back
I feel the surface bulge and crack....
Tick tick tock tick tock tick tick tick tock tick tock tick
SLAM!
I WANT THE CHANNNNGGGEE
I FEEL THE CHANNNNNNGGGEE
Then post-metamorphosis where do the answers lie
One above and one below with lions locked inside
Then in silence they turn the key
Setting all those lions free
Then I hold my head up higher and higher
Reach out tentacles to every desire
I faced the sea and its time for a change
I am an octopus in flames
Sinking underwater
Sweating boiling getting hotter
Bubbles burst between my fingers
My breath is cracked and drawn
Sinking like an anvil
And facing several tentacles
My eyes go black and pop red cherries
The surface me is gone
GONE
I'M GONE
GONE
I'M GONE
GONE
I'M GONE
GONE
I'M GONE
I'm mesmerized -- a servant to the light u cant deny it
With everyone standing here
I'm a million miles away
A change
