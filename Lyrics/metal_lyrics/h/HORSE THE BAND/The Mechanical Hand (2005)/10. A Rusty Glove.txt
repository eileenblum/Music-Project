TINKER tinker PLING - DING, DING - DING
My body breaks - the void screams
Weary of hollow metals
That ring of hollow life
By hand and by hammer
I give birth tonight
Metal bend and metal scream
Welding bright the circuit seam
Weary of the hollow spaces
Between the twinkling lights
I lost something along the way
And it doesn't feel right
MAY-BE I'M-NOT
Falling apart but falling a lot
MAY-BE I'M-NOT
Completely circuitry but I can't stop
I'M GONNA FALL APART!!!
I'M GONNA FALL APART!!!
Coming close I'm coming closer
Yet maybe I'm not
I can make you a sex machine
That would be hot
Break my nails and pull my hair
There's circuit boards everywhere
How long have I been in here
This is not my house
MAY-BE I'M-NOT
Falling apart but falling a lot
MAY-BE I'M-NOT
Completely circuitry but I can't stop
I'M NOT A ROBOT BUT I'VE GOT A MECHANICAL HAND
I CAN STEAL THE STARS AND PUT THEM BACK AGAIN
Once upon a time - I had a broken heart
Once upon a time - I just had a heart
I limped when I was wounded - so I replaced my parts
Once upon a time I had a heart but
I'M NOT A ROBOT BUT I'VE GOT A MECHANICAL HAND
I CAN STEAL THE STARS AND PUT THEM BACK AGAIN
If I am a machine because my hand made heart
Then why do I dream I'm a dinosaur tearing sheep apart
Lightning
Fill me up - it tells me where to go
Colors me and changes me
It withers me to coal
Lightning
Tears me up - leaves me smoldering
I close my eyes and hear her voice
Framed by vulture wings
In the wires of my hand - I see my fate
Cold and mechanical - squeaky with hate
It clicks + whirs and I'm satisfied
It's designed to fill that black hole deep inside
I'm turning away from the path of soft skin
To a path of mechanical sin
Turning away from the warmth of gold
To an empty machine thats broken and cold
Click, click, click hollow rooms always consume
Click, click, click dark and empty like most of the moon
Click, click, click the things we do in the name of love
Click, click, click secret machines and a rusty glove
SLEEP WELL MECHANICAL THING
YOU WERE FUN FOR AWHILE
BUT NOW I'M GOING GOING GOING
TO GO
GET
GET A BURRITO
Go get a burrito
Go get a burrito.... etc
