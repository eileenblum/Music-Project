I will not fade!
I will not fade!
I might be a baby caught in the snow,
But you know...
I will not fade!
I will not fade!
I ripped off my arms
So long ago.
All these wheels:
They seem amazing!
All these bombs
Must be ready to blow.
All this time
I could have tried.
All this time
I did not know.
The letters grow long and weary
And build into a maze.
The dialects laid beneath
Drip from hands yellow-stained.
Inside the envelope a heart of golden sand
Wrapped in snakes, clenched in a fist
Of a mechanical hand.
Give up and go away!!
Into the void.
Be silent and do not speak!!
Into the void.
Be blind and do not gaze!!
Into the void.
Be numb and do not reach!!
Into the void.
And if they want!
And if they want!
And if they want!
...I'll come undone.
I might be amazed like a baby but
I don't have those eyes.
Soaring quails sing of their glories;
Vultures always lie.
In the deep, the creatures weep,
Begging to be fried.
Any change can be magnificent
If you only try.
Face the stars or thee abyss!
Face the stars or thee abyss!
Face the stars or thee abyss!
Face the stars or thee abyss!
I'll face the stars or thee abyss,
But not nothing at all.
I'll face the stars or thee abyss
From nothing I can't fall.
All these wheels:
They seem amazing!
All these bombs
Must be ready to blow!
All this time
I could have tried!
All this time
I did not know!
It's so amazing!
It's so
It's so...
It's so amazing!
It's so amazing!
It's so
It's so...
It's so amazing!
