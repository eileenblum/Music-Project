Walk with me my monster - but close those crusty eyes
The sounds I make may be abrasive - but you'll be all right
Turn off all your senses and pretend you're home
Walk with me and you walk alone
YEAH!!!
AT THE SIGHT OF HIS SCALES
YOU START TO SHAKE
YOU CAN NEVER TRUST A SNAKE
AT THE SIGHT OF HIS SCALES
YOU START TO SCREAM
YOU CANT TRUST A FANGED THING
Grain by grain - so hot I've lost it
Echoes peck and gnaw at me
Creep, I crawl - shake I'm breaking
Creep and crawl -- they're chasing me
SERPENTS!!!!!
And I feel, so cold
Like the world just might explode
And if I open my mouth it will fill full of SAND
And I feel, so cold
Like the world just might explode
And if I open my mouth it will fill full of SAND
AT THE SIGHT OF HIS SCALES
YOU START TO SHAKE
YOU CAN NEVER TRUST A SNAKE
AT THE SIGHT OF HIS SCALES
YOU START TO SCREAM
YOU CAN'T TRUST A FANGED THING
It's safe to say I've finally lost it
The wells gone dry and abandoned me
Creep, I crawl, begging droplets
Of anything to comfort me
Thirsty
Laying in a hot desert
Bitten by a poisonous snake
Soft venom floods my veins
I have lost my heartbeat
My poor pulse is quivering
And I've lost control
Descending to my ending
A perilous black hole
The rivers run dry and so has my veins
I'm a filthy animal begging for change
Nothing I do is going as planned
NOTHINGS LEFT OF ME BUT FUCKING SAND
NOTHINGS LEFT OF ME BUT FUCKING SAND
The sun explodes, so slow
I feel the flames and I see the snow
All that's left of my mind is sea of sand
The sun explodes, so slow
I feel the flames and I see the snow
All that's left of my mind is sea of sand
And everybody's celebrating!
I've lost my way
Desperate for change
Pursued by snakes
Bearing my name
I've lost my way
My skins dry and baked
Fearing ill fade
I'm the snake
I walk with my monster - he beats me down
Bestial and savage thoughts - his arms are long
Cant get up, can't get up- nothings as planned
Nothings left of me but FUCKING SAND!
