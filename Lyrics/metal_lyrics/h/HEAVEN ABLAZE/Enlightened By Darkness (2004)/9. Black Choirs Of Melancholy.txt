Endless choirs from the fog
Take thy soul far beyond
Lead me to my shallow grave
And forever shall I remain

While the creatures of the night
Roam beneath the moonlight
Infinite flames torch the horizon
Disguised within enticing fashion

Black choirs of melancholy
Praise the unholy night
Black choirs of melancholy
Give me the gift of sight

Onward towards another dimension
Beyond your wildest dreams
Entranced within raging seas
I drift eternally

Give me the gift of sight
Lead me to the darkest of nights
Entranced within raging seas
I drift eternally
