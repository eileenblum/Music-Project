Daylight has abandoned all
And so we seek forbidden calls
The gloom of unholy spirit
Is the doom of haunting cries
A voyage for the soulless
A departure from our lives
The need to rise above and beyond
A removal from the week

Enlightened by darkness
Subconscious transcendence
Through gardens of fate
All darkness awaits

In search for the dominions
Of twisted utilitarian fate
Enshrouded within endless night
A communion for the depraved
Unorthodox scriptures of time
Heaving earth will be mine
A premonition for all to see
Is the end of all that will be
