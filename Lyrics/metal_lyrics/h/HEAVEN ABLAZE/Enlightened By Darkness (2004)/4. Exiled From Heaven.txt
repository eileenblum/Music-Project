His personal quest
Is to condemn the life you feel
But not knowing, he is inside
God cannot save you
You are damned within his presence
But still not knowing, he dwells within

Feel his essence
Burning inside
The unholy angel
Exiled from heaven

Broken dreams lead to
A shattered trail for your life
And still not knowing, he is inside
Psychopathic illusions
His vengeance you shall endure
And still not knowing, he dwells within

An angel of darkness
Expelled from the light
No good will or greatness
He felt nothing but fright
