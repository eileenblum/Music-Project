Amidst the eternal quest for divine reason
An arcane life force amongst all who will betray

Spheres of decadence... corruption within grace
Lead me beyond the threshold that awaits
Spheres of decadence... corruption within grace
Lead me beyond the pleasures that await

A birth above and beyond the tragedies of man
Breeding commotion in perverse annihilating one's faith

Trapped within spheres of decadence
A life of sin will surely begin
Breeding the tragedies of mankind
Spheres of decadence procreating strife

A slave to submission reduced to hypocrisy
The curse of reverence defiled the loss of divinity
