Sheltered by the absence of light
Hidden beneath this cloak of death
I am the entity beyond the grace of God
For I am the fall from redemption

Devoured within your own deceit
You are the plague for another noble feast
Lies, you have filled their souls
With the glories of your falsity
The supremacy of your flesh
Was in fact the curse to be

Pestilence shall purge through the holiest of nights
A plague of allegiance shall cleanse through your sights
Rivalled in damnation distorted by the light
Cursed upon thy throne you cannot fight

And so this plague called God
Shall be eradicated by the beast
