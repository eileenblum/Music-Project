As human beings becoming we can be so vulnerable
Oh to see so clearly would be a sinful vision indeed

Oh to feel the pain
Of centuries
Sin after sin
An ageless prodigy

The eyes of the beholder shall forever succeed
While the tears of the wicked shall forever bleed

Yesterdays are now gone forever
No fate but what we may make of it
Timelessness is lost within bereavement

Only to live for the life beyond
In our beings we are what we create
We all have the power to bring the end
It's up to us to amend the fortune ahead
