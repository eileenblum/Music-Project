Norse mythology was brought to the new world
In a time when Vikings roamed our land
Epic stories in verse have drifted through the ages
And the relics of time lay forevermore

In 1867 a colony had been launched
By the deed of surrender the great white north was ours
A dominion soon spread from sea to shining sea
A land of such majestic beauty shall lay peacefully forevermore

This land with mountains so soaring
A land with Great Lakes so broad
This land with the cruellest of all winters
A land I shall call my own
I am a patriarch
