A battle for the ages their empire will surely fall
A death in pure vengeance listen now and heed the call
Flowing with crimson streams this is the warriors last stand
Torn by such anger listen all and take command

Triumphant and victories we all stand tall
No battle will be lost and so we heed the call
March onward and press on for our beliefs
No country shall falter for peace shall bring relief

Arrogance in silence your decisions will pay the cost
Such fundamentalist movements your contentment will be lost
The quest for liberty will be conquered by successful dreams
And in the end your God will fail despite your fallen regime
