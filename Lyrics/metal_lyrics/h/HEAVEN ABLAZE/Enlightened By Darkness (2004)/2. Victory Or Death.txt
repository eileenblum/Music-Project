Unbending for the next battle
Bravery provided with implements
Emerging beyond the landscape
Enemies await in feeble presence
Shades of shining glory
Collide with crimson death
And all shall be conquered
By the tools of our trade

Totalitarians
Merciless beyond our grace
Devouring their unholy essence
With the sway of a razors edge
Spilling their blood like wine
Scarlet stains upon their flesh
For I shall defend thy soil
Elimination of all impure

Cast thy righteous blade
Bring victory or death
Cast thy sinful blade
Bring victory or death
