The end predicted from the past times elapsed
Erode milkened mouths reveal worlds controlled
Signs religions in their minds think are right
To tell that the apocalypse bring horror

Now punctured palms stigmata victim
Rise atomic tide world crumbles

Worship on your hands and knees begging please
Divine, sacrifice designed to take its course
Blind need the healing hand to free the pain
Why the visions seen for years are coming

Bow in search for life
So fake inside
Clay figurines
Visions through bleeding eyes

You live for pain

Become slaves
You pray for death
It never comes
