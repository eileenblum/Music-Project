You pinched your pennies, you sold your soul
You found no reasons which bored a hole
Led into trickery this all still ends
Bright, flash of lightning meets your amends

You thought you had it all when the world did fall
And all the things you have they are now all dead
With all the things you dreamed

Beg for release praying for your mercy
Is this the end ball of flame the sky opens
Trenches being dug the mortal will be corralled
Slow marching death redemption comes calling

You look at the sky a simple red
You'll hide your eyes ungrateful dread
Your pupils dilate your fear it grows
Your skin is scorched peeled from its bones

We're bleeding from our eyes suffocation
This strangle hold on life emaciation
We are set on fire immolation
From graves it steals our power
