Up on their thrones ones made from skin and bones
They twist the words that they say
From deep inside their walls corrupt beasts make calls
Breaking backs for "honest" pay
Cruel luck is set on high unmanned and running wild
Stealing from helpless pools

Parts made from simple blood wicked ways and we're the mules
This time the will to live and survive weighs down the very meaning
Of life, forced to be the ones to give up this time without

Lawless men make the rules the "golden" one's don't steal
What they lose won't make them rich
Their filthy hands are lined with what is yours and mine
Doesn't cost them a stick

This man made suffering snakes us a dying breed
Crucified for the machine
I he end of life begins cannot repent their sins
So they steal from our need

High up in liars chairs on weakened souls they feed
Breaking silence is' rubbed the wrong way now doomed
Enthroned in chaos

Retrieve what they stole from us
Deceive the maker of distrust
Repent for the souls of the dead
Relieve the world from this
Raped from the innocent stole from the weak
Brainwashed there is no relief
We live in chaos,
