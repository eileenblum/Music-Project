Now truths wearing thin
Hooks in the skin kept there to hold
Lies were told for years
Wasted their prayers on something dead

Broke and suffering
Receive the pain all pleas sustained
Control eliviate
Their victims slain judgment is due

Boiled over
There's nothing left to plead
Dig them under
There's no one left to scream
Bleed the guilty
And set the wicked free
Casting judgment
Eternal life received

Broke and suffering
Receive the pain all pleas contained
Failed sentence begins
Tried for their sins judgment is through

Boiled over
There's nothing left to plead-
Dig them under
There's no one left to scream
Bleed the guilty and set the wicked free
Casting judgment on those who don't believe

Served, signed and sealed
Delays chances of end
In our pain nothings resolved
Life's made slaves of us all
