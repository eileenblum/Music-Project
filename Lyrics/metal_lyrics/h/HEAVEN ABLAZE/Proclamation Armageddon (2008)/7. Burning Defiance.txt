Procure immortality time to choose a side
This war to rule eternity revealed and all its signs
Beast friend or foe has this god dethroned
Destroyed the temples burn* darkness unfolds into the light
Brimstone and babylon

Dread immobilized plight all falls collapsing skies

Belial trapped inside the earth breaks out to find his turn
Forced will and belligerence digs in and makes its mark
Besiege and bewilderment tears scars in gods own eyes
This trail of the destiny begins with angels cries

War above below
Burning defiance
