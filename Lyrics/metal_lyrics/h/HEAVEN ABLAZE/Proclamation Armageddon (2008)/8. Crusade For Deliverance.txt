Unchained wretched beasts
Form lines in search of flesh

Spread wings and tangled meat
From down below pukes evils seed

Process elimination this is the battle of sins
Proceed extradition is trained on who will lose

All will fall none are spared
Crushing blows that kill the air
Silent shadows the darkness casts
On trampled bodies of the past

Crusade for deliverance
