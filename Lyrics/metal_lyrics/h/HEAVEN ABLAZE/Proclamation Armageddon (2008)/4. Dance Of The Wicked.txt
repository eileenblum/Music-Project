Since the time began war machines churn up the dead
Bleeding minds and souls wretched horror in their eyes it grows
On hollow torture its fed wastelands are drained and bled
Brick by brick it's built shifting power the doom it kills

On pale horses the riders bring the death
Blackened and imprisoned the bloody end comes to view

It starts to deprecate feel the cracks beneath our feet
Droves of demons that roll destroying life where ever they go
A raging genocide a cancer that rots in time
It digs a shallow grave self strangulation you re made a slave

Dance of the wicked drowned in sorrow
Dance of the wicked rising death toll
