[Music: Peter Lyse Hansen / HateSphere, Lyrics: Jacob Bredahl]

So many times Iâve heard you call my name
The whisper from Angel City
White City come to me â You know what I want, and you know what I crave
Now itâs time
The Lady has landed

Lead by the Devil
Inferno come to me

Black sun rising â Blood is boiling
Adventures thrilled
All my hopes fulfilled

Destroy
Abuse
Iâm in for the blow

Like a zombie â Flying mountain high
This dose â oh so good â oh so bad, I speak in tongues
My insides are shaking
Still on top of the world of all worlds
With ego and sin as my keywords

Lead by the Devil
Inferno come to me

Destroy
Abuse
Iâm in for the blow

Crack of dawn
The end of the line
This is my last goodbye

[Solo â Heinz]
