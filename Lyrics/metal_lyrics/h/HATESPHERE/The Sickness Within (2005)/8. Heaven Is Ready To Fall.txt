[Music: Peter Lyse Hansen, Henrik Bastrup Jacobsen / HateSphere, Lyrics: Mikael Ehlert]

Human features are at hand
Flesh, blood skin and bones
But no exposed emotions
Except for greed and disgust

Raising the fires of hell

Something horrible possesses me
Clarification without reason
My bloodlust has overtaken my days
I feel lethal on the verge on frenzy

Raising the fires of hell
No one escapes my flaming fury
My pain is constant and sharp
Itâs time to settle the score

I think my mask is about to slip
There are no more barriers to cross
All I have in common with the uncontrollable
The vicious, the evil and the insane

Raising the fires of hell
No one escapes my flaming fury
My pain is constant and sharp
Itâs time to settle the score

All the mayhem I have caused
The uttering indifference towards it I have now surpassed
I do not hope for a better world for anyone
I want my pain inflicted in others
Colder than the devils heart

Heaven is ready to fall

Raising the fires of hell
No one escapes my flaming fury
My pain is constant and sharp
Itâs time to settle the score

Heaven is ready to fall
