[Music: Peter Lyse Hansen / HateSphere, Lyrics: Mikael Ehlert]

The lords of darkness have their decree
The end of all life, no one will go free

The fall shall rise in a river of blood
Follow me lead âcase I am their god

The stench of untamed sloth
Makes me hang everyone in the burning cross
Burn in the high flames of hell you will
Swirling black hate Iâm strapped for the kill

Slay one and all to make me whole
Sucking the puny spirits from their soul

The fall shall rise in a river of blood
Follow me lead âcase I am their god

[Solo â Heinz]

Filled with grounds for assault they arise
Craving for life and your worlds demise

Fuelled by my hatred fulfilling my needs
Walking the earth spreading endless disease

The fall shall rise in a river of blood
Follow me lead âcase I am their god

The fall shall rise in a river of blood
