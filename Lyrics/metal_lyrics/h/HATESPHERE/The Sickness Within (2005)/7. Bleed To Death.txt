[Music: Peter Lyse Hansen / HateSphere, Lyrics: Jacob Bredahl]

Name the time, name the place
And I will show you what Iâve got
Show you my fucking ace
Throughthe years Iâve trained my skills
Violent rapture is my codex

Now I start up my hate injected engine
Light up my rodeo of burning pits
Ainât life a bitch

Kneel down
Taste my switchblade knife
Oh so sharp, sharp as a razor
Iâll stab your head and punch you in your mouth
You bleed to death before me
Bleed to death â bleed

Iâll stab your head and punch you in your mouth
You bleed to death before me
Bleed to death â bleed

Name the time, name the place
And I will show you what Iâve got
Show you my fucking ace

Now I start up my hate injected engine
Light up my rodeo of burning pits
Ainât life a bitch
