[Music: Peter Lyse Hansen, Henrik Bastruk Jensen / HateSphere, Lyrics: Peter Lyse Hansen]

You speak the words
I donât want to hear
Rip up the wound
You start to tear and tear
Go turn back on me
Blunded violence sets me free

You only got yourself to blame
I mark my target as you make away

Still here, keep going on
Impervious to reason
Makes my hatred grow strong
Welcome to my paradise of pain
Where ill blood flows
And no one hear your screams

You only got yourself to blame
I mark my target as you make away

[Solo â Peter]
[Solo â Heinz]

The pool of blood spreads out
A head split in two
My hunch is finally gone
The world has seen the last of you
I need a scapegoat, a new one to blame
Same procedure, more violence I canât tame

The coming of chaos
