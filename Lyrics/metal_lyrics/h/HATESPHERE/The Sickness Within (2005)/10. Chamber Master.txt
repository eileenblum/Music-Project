[Music: Peter Lyse Hansen / HateSphere, Lyrics: Mikael Ehlert]

Your entire body racked with pain
Blinding
Searing at the depths of your soul
Surrounded by darkness in the pitch black of the hole

Youâre not alone
You see the others chained to the walls

Some strapped to the rack in the center of the floor
You hear their cries which bellowes from their code
Reverberating through the stone room never fading

Iâm the chambermaster, Iâm here for you
Iâll crush you âtill you do whatever I want you to
Iâll cut you free of your serpent skin
And let the devil take you in

I can smell your rotten soul
Smell its putrid corruption

[Solo â Heinz]

I am not here to save you
Iâll show you the truth and you will fold

Sweet smell of burning flesh fills your throat
Your ankles wrapped in leatherstraps
Donât be afraid, Iâll be right there
Before you can scream out and plea for death

Iâm the chambermaster, Iâm here for you
Iâll crush you âtill you do whatever I want you to
Iâll cut you free of your serpent skin
And let the devil take you in
