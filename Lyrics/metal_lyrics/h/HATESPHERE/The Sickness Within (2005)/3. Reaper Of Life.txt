[Music: Peter Lyse Hansen, Henrik Bastrup Jensen / HateSphere, Lyrics: Mikael Ehlert]

A destined unseen brutal force
Around us every day
Determining when itâs time
For us to live or die

Heâs all around us now
Awaiting his chance to strike

Understand his grand design
Into which we all fit
Understand that if youâre fortunate
Heâll visit all over again

There is no escape
He will claim his right

Heâs all around us now
Awaiting his chance to strike
There is no escape
He will claim his right

In the end
No one escapes his plan
Today may very well be
Your time to shake his hand

Your life is at its end
He will put you in your grave

He is coming to take away your life
For eternity you shall pay

A destined unseen brutal force
Around us every day
Determining when itâs time
For us to live or die

There is no escape
He will claim his right

Heâs all around us now
Awaiting his chance to strike
There is no escape
He will claim his right
