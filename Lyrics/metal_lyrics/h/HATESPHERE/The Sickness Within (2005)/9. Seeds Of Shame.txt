[Music: Jacob Bredahl, Peter Lyse Hansen / HateSphere, Lyrics: Jacob Bredahl]

Head down the dust
I seek what hurts
Iâm only satisfied with a broken lip
You know I need the whip

From a world of pain I scream her name
My mouth is bleeding from sucking the seeds of shame

Unholy dreams
The secret name
Ride like the devil
Down his black highway

From a world of pain I scream her name
My mouth is bleeding from sucking the seeds of shame

Peel my skin
Twist the pain
Feed the flame
Will I burn in hell?

Peel my skin
Twist the pain
Feed the flame
Will I burn in hell?

Face down in the dirt
I love all that hurts
Iâm only happy with a broken lip
You know I want the whip

Peel my skin
Twist the pain
Feed the flame
Will I burn in hell?

From a world of pain I scream her name
My mouth is bleeding from sucking the seeds of shame
