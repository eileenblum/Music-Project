[Music: Peter Lyse Hansen / Hatesphere, Lyrics: Jacob Bredahl]

I feel a sickness within
My body is on fire
Worms crawling underneath my skin
My life is wrapped in sin

I thin my blood
With bloodshed eyes and shaking hands I fill my cup
This will bring me back on top

I feel it flowing through my veins
I feel it clouding my brain
And the world grows distant
This is my moment of clarity

I thin my blood
With bloodshed eyes and shaking hands I fill my cup
This will bring me back on top

Paranoia
World of fire
This war within
The sickness within

When the demons scream for more
I crack bottles âtill I hit the floor
And Iâm never going black
I sink my brain into a world in black

I thin my blood
With bloodshed eyes and shaking hands I fill my cup
This will bring me back on top
