[Music: Henrik Bastrup Jacobsen, Peter Lyse Hansen / HateSphere, Lyrics: Jacob Bredahl]

Hear the screams from the underworld
And feel the evil come creeping on you
All these lovely creatures gathered here tonight

Legions of death lead by me
I, the master in command

The sign of destruction
Into battle with a force so strong
I, am marked by darkness
I have no mercy

Oh yes, blood and guts will be spilled
This method of destruction â crushing you and your world

Legions of death lead by me
I, the master in command

Let in rain with blood
Let it rain in blood upon my name

[Solo â Steve Smyth]
[Solo â Heinz]
[Solo â Steve Smyth]

Blood and guts spilled now
More blood soaks the ground
See the sky turn black
As the stench of corpses fills the air

Let it rain with blood upon my name
My wrath will take you, I have no regrets
My blackened heart will see you all dead

Legions of death lead by me
I, the master in command

Let in rain with blood
Let it rain in blood upon my name

[Solo â Peter]
