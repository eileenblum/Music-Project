[Music: Peter Lyse Hansen / Hatesphere, Lyrics: Mikael Ehlert]

It will set me free, my time has come
My thoughts, my acts wonât be undone
The rage in me will finally blow
No escape from your demise

Iâve tasted my inner demons blood
It rushes through my veins
Iâve never seen beyond the world of sin
The architecture of blood and bone

Death is coming
I am coming and hell follows with me
Dread the day
Vengeance is flowing and you cease to exist

I am ready to be unleashed
My time is now, my stage is set
All who stand in my way must die
You play, you pay, you bastard

Death is coming
I am coming and hell follows with me
Dread the day
Vengeance is flowing and you cease to exist

Canât take your nauseating reek of fear
My feelings have to be unchained
Put out my flames with gasoline

Death is coming
I am coming and hell follows with me
Dread the day
Vengeance is flowing and you cease to exist

Tonight my first purifying act will be done
All shall pay, all shall burn
