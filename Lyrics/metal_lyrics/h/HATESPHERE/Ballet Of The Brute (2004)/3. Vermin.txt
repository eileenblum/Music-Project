[Music: P. Lyse Hansen / J. Bredahl / Hatesphere, Lyrics: J. Bredahl / A. GyldenÃ¸hr]

Itâs me crawling outside your window
Itâs me creeping you out tonight

Hallucinating
Images from hell within

You thought you got off
But I came to fight another day
I drag it out, I drag you down
Always like that when Iâm around

Suffocating
Blinding fear is closing in

Iâm the nightmares inside your head
The monster underneath your bed

Beware of the beast in black
Your time has come, thereâs no turning back
Acid in your open wound
My hell is your tomb

[Lead: P. Lyse Hansen]

Try to dig your way out
Thereâs no escape for you to find
Shovelling through the lost souls
That I have left behind

I bring out the worst in you
You are a victim of my split personality

Hallucinating
Images from hell within

Your fear is my life force
I feed on you, going insane

Suffocating
Blinding fear is closing in

Iâm the nightmares inside your head
The monster underneath your bed

Dead
Youâre dead
