[Music: J. Bredahl / P. Lyse Hansen / Hatesphere, Lyrics: J. Bredahl / A. GyldenÃ¸hr]

Fear is my tool
To keep you down
Hate is the way
To hold my crown

Reign of horror
I am on the top of the world

Trust me on this one
It all will die

Death is my business
Death make me what I am
I am locked and loaded
And I am ready to kill

[Lead: P. Lyse Hansen]

Reign of horror
I am on the top of the world

From my domain
I watch it all go by
Across the blood red sky
