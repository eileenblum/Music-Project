[Lead: P. Lyse Hansen]

Give me back my anger
Cause Iâve been trying to live without
Failing miserably very step on the way
Itâs my crutch and itâs my sword
That makes me hard â so hard!

I need this mask to wear
I need this blankeyed stare
I need this thorn in my side
I need someone to hate, to make it all right

And I find that Iâm alive
Everything in this world must die!
This rage boils inside of me
I know Iâm in control

Iâm no longer feeling lost
I can make my own truth
No longer scared of the thing I canât comprehend
I crush it all under one foot

And I find that Iâm alive
Everything in this world must die!
This rage boils inside of me
I know Iâm in control

Nothing can stand against me
No room in my world for opposition
And I turn my gaze on you
This blankeyed stare
