[Music: P. Lyse Hansen / Hatesphere, Lyrics: P. Lyse Hansen / M. Ehlert / J. Bredahl]

Fighting to be released
From the strings attached to me
Intriguing voice invades my head
The dark side speaks to me

Deathtrip
For death I am yearning
Deathtrip
My whole world is burning

I enter the gates to his mind
Let the sickness inside
The rush of power turns me on
Raise the hatchet for the below

Deathtrip
For death I am yearning
Deathtrip
My whole world is burning

This rush of blood
Has turned against me
Pleasure and pain goes hand in hand
The hatchetâs pointing my way
Deathtrip
