[Music: H. Bastrup Jacobsen / P. Lyse Hansen / Hatesphere, Lyrics: A. GyldenÃ¸hr]

Taking aim as I approach
The scenario is set for our world to explode
Weâve been waiting for this moment for a long time
Thereâll be no salvation for us
I bet this night will be sublime

My tube of death
Is pointing your way
My warhead is armed
Better beg for mercy today
Beg for mercy!

Fire in the hole!
You scream in despair
Releasing my cluster bombs
From high in the air

Penetrating your defence
Iâm spreading my disease
Onto you
The pain I release

My tube of death
Is pointing your way
My warhead is armed
Better beg for mercy today
Beg for mercy!

The wardrums are played
With my stick on your skin
Iâm the black hole tailgunner
Coming straight out of hell

Your body is trembling
Going into aftershock
Of all the bitches in the world
You were my best fuck

My tube of death
Is pointing your way
My warhead is armed
Better beg for mercy today
Beg for mercy!
