[Music: P. Lyse Hansen / Hatesphere, Lyrics: P. Lyse Hansen / J. Bredahl]

Night time has come
Another hunt has begun
Balls out, Iâm like a loaded gun
You think you are a friend of mine
Canât be with that lack of spine
My gun works fine

When I look at you I see
A dead man looking back at me

Youâve crossed the line one too many times

You smile at me
Not able to see
Easy to hide my twisted personality
I put you to sleep
And take a ride with the devil
My enemies will bleed

When I look at them I see
500 dead people looking back at me

Theyâve crossed the line one too many times

Their pages are written
Their die is cast
Their books are closed
More heads for my collection

When I look at them I see
500 dead people looking back at me

They keep coming to me
I keep tracking them down
