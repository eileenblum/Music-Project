[Music: P. Lyse Hansen / Hatesphere, Lyrics: A. GyldenÃ¸hr]

Finding the best spot of the curb
The main ambition in life
Cardboard bed bagged and packed
Waiting for better thing to come

No hope canât cope
The lowest step of the ladder
Downward spiral to nothing
The smallest rat in the pack

Loneliness and isolation
Every man for himself...

Destiny is the rulemaker
The friend is a jawbreaker
Being king of the curb
What a rush to inhale

Loneliness and isolation
Every man for himself...

Escaping reality
By swimming noselanes
In the snowy seas of sorrow
Being the centre of the world
Being centre of nothing

No hope canât cope
The lowest step of the ladder
Downward spiral to nothing
The smallest rat in the pack

Becoming the king of the hill
Caused by a twisted mind
No chance of recovery
No future to find

Loneliness and isolation
Every man for himself...

Tomorrow, a new day will come...
