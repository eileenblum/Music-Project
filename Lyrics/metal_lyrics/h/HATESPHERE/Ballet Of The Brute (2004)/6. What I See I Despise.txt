[Music: P. Lyse Hansen / Hatesphere, Lyrics: J. Bonehead Nielsen / J. Bredahl]

Itâs been feeding on dark thought in me
Spreading rumours in my mind
Building anger in my heart
Burning hatred in my eyes
Now I see through all the lies

What I see I despise
What I see I recognize

I twist their every world
To find a crack
To see the truth
To find the place Iâve been used
To find a piece of me in you
To find something I can abuse

Now I see
You need me to put your weakness on
I spit on the hand you offer
Spit on the words you speak
You will never find me trusting
You will never find me weak

What I see I despise
What I see I recognize
Itâs all sickening to me
All these good intentions

[Lead: H. Bastrup Jacobsen]

[Lead: P. Lyse Hansen]

I Remember all the times you let me down
When I found myself alone
All the times you werenât around
Left me time to think
Who you are
What you give
What I need
What I see I despise
What I see I recognize

I donât need no one but me!
