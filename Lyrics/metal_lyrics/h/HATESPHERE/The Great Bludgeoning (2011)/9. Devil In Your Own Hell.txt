In self-hatred
Youâll find the comfort you seek
To free yourself of the brutal truth that haunts you
Demons catch up with you
To drag you back into misery

Feel disgusted
When you stand face to face with what you've become
With what you've made of yourself
Cut to get underneath
The crawling weak skin

Just how much pain can you endure?
How far will you go?
How much will it take?
Before you become the devil
in your own hell

Your greatest fear
The ugliness you possess
The hell created around you
You will never be content
Never end this pain

Just how much pain can you endure?
How far will you go?
How much will it take?
Before you become the devil
in your own hell

Your self-loathing
Is the excuse you need
To free yourself of reality

Cheers
