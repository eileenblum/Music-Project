In the blood of every lost soul
Runs the venom that turned eternal bliss into a living hell
Itâs spreading like a virus
One you cannot kill

This venomous game is my creation
I made you who you are
There is no cure for this evil
Causing the panic to spread

Yeah
Let there be chaos and let it reign
It will make the brave new world
Bite until it bleeds
Malice is the new disease

The flesh Iâve tasted, the seed Iâve sown
The venom eats you from the inside
Youâre on your knees begging to be saved
Begging me to put an end to the agony

Yeah
Let there be chaos and let it reign
It will make the brave new world
Bite until it bleeds

Malice
The venomous kill
Venom
The malevolence of this world
YEAH!
