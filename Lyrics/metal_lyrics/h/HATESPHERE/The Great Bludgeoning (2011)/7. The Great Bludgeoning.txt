To kill or to be killed is the question
There is nothing in between
It is a war of all against all
I made your death my final cause

Feel the rage
And the madness force the way
Into the reckoning of your death
In the great bludgeoning

I choose my weapon, I choose it wisely
Set free your inner raging fiend
I spare no one. They will be back to kill me
It is either me or them

Feel the rage
And the madness force the way
Into the reckoning of your death
In the great bludgeoning

I've shed the blood of many
Just to get to you
And they will not have died in vain
This is the hour of judgement

Bludgeoned as a memory
Of your demise, powerless and weak
You will die
Bludgeoned to death
You will die powerless and weak
So why make this a fair fight

Feel the rage
And the madness force the way
Into the reckoning of your death
In the great bludgeoning
