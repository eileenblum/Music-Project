Pain is my religion,
I know of nothing else

Pushed to the ground, barely up, down again
Redemptionâs not an option
Revenge will see the light as I resurrect

Sorrow wrecked my beliefs
I turn the other cheek
Now the scene is set for misery

Pushed to the ground, barely up, down again
Redemptionâs not an option
Revenge will see the light

Learning from all my failures
The beatdowns, the humiliation
Too much to overcome but giving
Not for nothing, for the sake of all manâs ruin
Gives me tools to prepare my next coming
To prepare my next coming

Pain is my religion,
I know of nothing else
The next life will pay the price
Pay the fucking price
