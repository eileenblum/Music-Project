As a bridge and not an end
Across an endless abyss
Man is tied
By the beast and the overhuman

All beings have created
Beyond themselves
Made your way from beast to man
But still a monster

Donât go back to being the beast
What have you done?
Need to kill your inner creature
To defeat the man in you
Need to kill your inner monster
To become the over(hu)man

Man is urgh laughing stock
a painful embarrassment
To the overhuman
The meaning of the earth

Donât go back to being the beast
What have you done?
Need to kill your inner creature
To defeat the man in you
Need to kill your inner monster
To become the overhuman

Thus spake the overhuman

Man shall be overcome
Heâs the ebb of the great flood
Don't go back to being the beast

Need to kill your inner creature
To defeat the man in you
Need to kill your inner monster
To become the overman
