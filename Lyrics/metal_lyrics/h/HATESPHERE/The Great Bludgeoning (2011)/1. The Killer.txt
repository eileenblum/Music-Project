My world is crashing down 'fore my eyes
Trapped in a sick game of pain, deceit and lies
She took her last breath
And then she bled to death

I found her blood soaked on the floor
Life as I knew it was gone for evermore
They came, they saw, without a fight
They picked me up and read me my rights

Life passes me by
Like time is no healer
Hate builds up inside
The depth of my anger knows no bounds
I see you on my way down

Year by year they take my life away
Day by day I want to make them pay for their mistake
A killer's on the loose
I'm broken and I'm wrongfully accused

FUCK!

The depth of my anger knows no bounds
I have no will to stand my ground
The cause was lost before it began
I am a broken man

A broken man

Anger keeps me sharp
Keeps me hating with all my heart

Life passes me by
Time is no healer
Hate builds up inside
The depth of my anger knows no bounds
I see you on my way down

Anger keeps me sharp
Keeps me hating with all my heart
