Caught in the maze of my empty promises
Spun around excessive desires
My legacy was my only intent
In a way I repay and leave it all to waste

I set the state on fire and let it all burn
Your decay is not my concern

Under the spell of my reasoning
The poor stayed poor and âfreeâ was yet another word for ârichâ
Nothing more to take from the weak
Whatâs yours is mine, whatâs mine will stay mine

You gave me power to rule
To decide over right and wrong
My intensions were cruel
All the promises dead and gone

Sacrificed for a much greater purpose
Lives spent in the name of my personal gain
The last crown wasted
Wasted on war

I set the state on fire and let it all burn
The flames got higher and higher âcause you wouldnât learn
All the things Iâve ever done, I did just to say:Â 
Your decay was never my concern

People die
From my neglect
You can never blame me
People die
When they put their trust in me
