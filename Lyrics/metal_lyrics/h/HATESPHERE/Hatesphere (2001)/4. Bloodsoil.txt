let me question your faith, mind, and what you believe
why did we leave our gods for one we can't even see?
do you wanna tell me why or my story to hear
ancient stones were found
scriptures from all around
tales from a thousand memories
dated to different centuries

a holy spirit set free
released from mind, you and me
he's one of true belief
a shadow in which you can't breathe
his laugh is lightning, thunder
his soul the gloomy forest
he walks with fire and wind
he's the Bloodgod

once there were respect for greater power
now we are left with one god
we're all gone
try listen feel the movements around you
what makes it happen
it's the Bloodgod

his laugh is lightning, thunder
his soul the gloomy forest
he walks with fire and wind

he's only one of many tales from ancient times
but ask yourself the question
is he the Bloodgod?
