now listen
crawl over here
down on your knees
the paralyzing hate struck from behind
your violent throne withered away
remember me?
PAY!

die when I tell you to die
dead

the parts switched over now
suddenly you're lowest of all mankind
the one I'll plague and rip apart
your private nightmares
pain is brought to life
(bloodcolored eyes don't realize)

my sight turns red
the burning hate
is warming my body
brutally beats you
feeling alive
but my soul is dead

cant stop myself,
I like it
your screams,
they stimulate my body
now pray
false hope is your last chance
now pray

pray for your life
no god won't help you out
bloodcolored eyes
now realize
soon dead
but I live again
soon gone
forever dead

die when I tell you to die
dead
