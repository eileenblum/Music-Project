proclaiming eternal truths
and solemnly pointing at dim lit sky
preacher standing tall promising salvation
for those who wait

rectify the innate mind subdue the body
submit to a sense of guilt
suffer and be redeemed

his congregation hurting
from acting contrary to nature

freedom
close your eyes
fight delusions divine
preacher
we smell the lie on your breath
ability to sense the icons of stupidity
but in reality the heatless light can't be felt
(truth faded into the mist destroying the will to truly exist)

[lyrics missing from book]

now is the time for conflict
let mother nature strike back
revitalize the inherent life by carnal dogma

oh sapient one, this is not why I am
the truth is that no truth exist
stray from the penitential path of the sable figurehead
all living damn the preacher to see
(his horizon circled by mockingbirds forevermore)

proclaiming eternal truths
and solemnly pointing at dim lit sky
preacher will you tell us
how it feels not being alive?
