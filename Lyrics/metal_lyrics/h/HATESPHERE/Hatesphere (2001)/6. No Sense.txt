I want to hear deafness
I want to see blindness
I want to feel alive

yesterday I ran like the wind
and seemed to be ahead of everything
today I stopped for a while
in the midst of my own eternity
I need a question
to find the answer

I've always walked with you
for a second, walk with me
don't seek eternity

why am I damned to freedom,
when I'm better off enslaved?
I would laugh and I would smile
come on and chain me for a while

you should tear off my ears
you should stab out my eyes
you should lock me in a chamber
so I could feel alive

I've been swimming in this lake
now I am drowning
today the water froze to ice
although the sun was shining

now I can hear nothing
now I can see nothing
now I can feel everything
