why do I have to look at you
every time I'm around?
I can't stand the sight of you
you make me sick

don't come near me
don't you temptate me

my blood is pumping harder
and my hate is growing stronger
soon you'll lie bleeding on the floor
hate forevermore

don't come near me
don't you fucking temptate me...

you better start digging
you better start dying

no warning got to your head
now the price has been paid
just now you realize
my hate to you will rise
die or be my slave, you fuck!

can't you see the scriptures on your grave?

Hate!
