What we need isn't systems
Or some regulating plans
But bigger guns to shoot with
And a bigger type of man
Ill Will
For good or ill my iron will
Is unrivalled still Evil ill thrill
This is the curse to me &amp; my friends
Ill will No patterns No sense

I hate mental exercise
Thinking gives me pain
I know people don't turn out
That way today
But here we go again:
Ill Will Hatesphere!
For good or ill my iron will
Is unrivalled still Evil ill thrill
This is the curse to me &amp; my friends
Ill will No patterns No sense

Rock'n'Roll!
Yeah! Ill will!!!


Thanks to m.s.n for sending track #9 lyrics.
