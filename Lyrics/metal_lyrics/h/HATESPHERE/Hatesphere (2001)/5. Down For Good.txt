beware for lust
can't you see it brings misery?
start chasing your dreams
get a life
ain't that what you want?
you better believe it

you thought about quitting all
just waiting to take the fall

who would you blame for leaving this earth?
when you've felt like this since your birth
losing your self-esteem
waiting for life just to end
your living is too extreme

you thought about quitting all
just waiting to take the fall

somebody told you you were useless
that's where your own world drown
no one knows who you are
now just stay down for good

you've tried to hide your best
it sucked, so fuck the rest
it made no sense to me
why is it that you can't see
you wanted to be alone
you wanted to be left alone

take your life
there's no point in waiting
take your life
just get the job done

you're so low
