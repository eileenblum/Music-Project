cheat and lie your way to the top
guess it's cold when your act has dropped
feast alone on your new found glory
the scars on your soul tell a different story
in complete denial of the violent act
forced upon defenseless people
you had sworn to protect

you feel you don't have to give anything back
so out of touch, spoiled and relentless
you let us all believe your devious lies
let us down cold and senseless

as the caring mother
you were supposed to be
it's evident, you failed miserably
dirt on your hands
mud on your back
you better come clean
and drop the violent act

communication is the key to all succes
that might explain your failed progress
