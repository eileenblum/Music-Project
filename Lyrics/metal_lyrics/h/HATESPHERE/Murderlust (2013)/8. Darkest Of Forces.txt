didn't find what I was looking for
in pursuit of closure
threw myself in the arms of a strange force
now gaining strenght from darkness

in the shadow of things I look for answers
praying for lost hope
every breath sinks deeper into darkness
into deep submission

trapped in dark thoughts
the sense of control slowly slips away
my power of will has succumb itself
once again nothing

I stand powerless
drawn to my final resting place
dark forces give me strenght
making life worth living again

found just what I was looking for
my search is over
embracing the darkest
of forces filled my life
