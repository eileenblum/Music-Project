bury yourself six feet deep
become a rotten dead seed
drag trail of blood red waste
to the altar
do the sacrifice or you will fear me

obsessive thoughts 
of violence within
a savage mind
fear is your existence
among the killing kind

pray you will never be my victim of choice
I will bring silence to your screaming voices
drag a trail of blood red wast to the altar
do the sacrifice or you will fear me

I will take your life
I will free your soul
let the means of violence
be justified by your downfall

fear me
I'm coming for you
the end is near
there is nothing left for you
