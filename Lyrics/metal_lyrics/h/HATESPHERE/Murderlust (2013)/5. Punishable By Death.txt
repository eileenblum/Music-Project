no matter how severe the punishment
it won't be albe to restrain
the crimes of those who have no 
other way of livelihood

the ill master is more inclined
to chastise than teach

blood for blood, no empathy
what I've done to you
without a doubt
you'll do the same to me
retaliate, defy
your common sense
to avenge my crime
with punishment

this system of retribution
which leads to harmony
is merely an illusion
you strike down hard
you strike with ease
upon the neverending
fatal necessities

the good master teaches the way
for every man to pe preserved
from the fatal necessity
of crime 
punishable by death

blood for blood, no empathy
what I've done to you
without a doubt
you'll do the same to me
retaliate, defy
your common sense
to avenge the fata necessities

crime and punishment

convinced that you need this
your motive for revenge will
lead to certain death
convinced that you need this
your lust for revenge is your
certain death
