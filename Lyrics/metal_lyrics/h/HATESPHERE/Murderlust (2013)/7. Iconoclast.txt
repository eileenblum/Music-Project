all you believers 
all you deceivers
witness a new force
spawned from hate
bloody inquisitions
murderous crusades
my name is all that's holy
slay all heresy

truth is that you are lost
like your savior on the cross
the first shall be the last
for I am the iconoclast

get back on your knees
pick up  your self-esteem
the time is right for your ritual
kill
bleed and bleed
until you're bled out
your sacrilege will be
settled here and now

my rage is fierce
my mind is steadfast
bow before me
for I am the iconoclast

torch your relics
torch your scriptures
light the hellish ames
to burn your pretty pictures

my rage is fierce
my mind is steadfast
bow before me
for I am the iconoclast
