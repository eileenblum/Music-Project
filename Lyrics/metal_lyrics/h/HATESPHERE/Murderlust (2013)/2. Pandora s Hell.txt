she was a gift to punish man
oblivious to pain, grief and suffering

she sent us straight to hell
her curiosity stole away our innoncence
she sent us straight to hell
with all the evils of the world into darkness
she had a look inside the box and unleashed misery

hope is all we have left
but all hope is lost
we will take it back

she gave us evil
a world in distress
left us in the gloom
of sorrow and torment

she sent us back to hell
her atrocities defiled the world of man
she sent us back to hell
back to the shadows
back to insanity
back to the evil we've become
behold, pandora's hell is done

she was a gift to punish man
she unleashed all the evils of the world
hope is everything in p andora's hell
