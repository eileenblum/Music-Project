You're hiding in you echo chamber
Where rambling noise is perverted truth
Blurting out obscenities
In safe distance from threats like me

Come out wherever you are
You cannot hide
I will seek and before long I will find
Beg my mercy
Beg for your life

Step outside and say it to my face
Here the echo's silent
Your opinion's not an argument
You'll feel change is violent

Come out wherever you are
You cannot hide
Your mouth can run
But your words will die
Beg my mercy
Beg for your life

You never thought you would fail
This is your new hell
Lift the talebearing veil
This is your new hell

This is your new hell

Scorn and humiliation
Walls come crumbling down
You're exposed
An easy target
I welcome you to your new hell

You never thought you would fail
This is your new hell
Lift the talebearing veil
This is your new hell
