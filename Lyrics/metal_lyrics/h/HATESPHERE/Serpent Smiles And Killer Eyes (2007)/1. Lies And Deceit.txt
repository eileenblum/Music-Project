If you donât bring nothing to the table
Donât expect to eat
Donât expect no one to grovel at your feet
Donât expect me to forgive any lie or deceit
Donât expect me to help you when you bleed

Youâve never done shit for nobody else
You never cared about no one but yourself

And all these sit takers you call your friends
I know youâll turn on each other in the very end
Your eyes will turn from red to black
When you feel all the daggers in your back

Iâm fed up with your bullshit
Iâm fed up with your lies
Fed up with your ways
Now look straight into my eyes

No more Mr. Nice guy
Itâs time to be blunt
Youâre nothing but a worthless cunt

I got a fist for your face
A blade for your soul
Iâm gonna nail your fucking head on pole

Youâre watching your world falling apart
No more lies to tell â
No more playing fuckinâ smart

Your eyes will open wide
Right before you only see black
I will strike you down
