Demands from the devil written in blood
Damned below Judas, more abhorred that he was
Release me demon from this prison Iâm in

A new terror is conceived and made
With boiling rage and repulsion prevailed
Hunting season is on the verge to begin
Fear the onset of a murderers reign

Mortality rate is on a rise
Look at me Iâll finish this fight

Iâll rip your heart out, squeeze it dry
Watch as life slowly parts from your eyes

I hate you truly, Truly I do
Everything about me hates all of you
I spit your poison back in your face
I want it to burn the eyes from your head

Death and vengeance has found  a new toy
Fierce and fatal with murderous joy
Burning with flames of resentful wrath
Iâll scorch the earth to light my path

I am a loathsome and evil man
I am the knife in the robberâs hand
I am depraved and I am vile
I am the devil that dwells inside

Demands from the devil written in blood
Damned below Judas, more abhorred that he was
Release me demon from this prison Iâm in
