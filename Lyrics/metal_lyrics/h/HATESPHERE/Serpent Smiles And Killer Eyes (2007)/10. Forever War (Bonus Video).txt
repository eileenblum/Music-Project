Trapped in this cell, rejected and confused
Why am I here, I do not recall
Waiting as time passes by
I wonder, am I going to die?
Forced into this Hellhole, Black as only black can be
Canât get a hold of my fears

FOREVER WAR! WAR!

This war, this life
My night, Your night?
Our nightmare!
Nightmare
Dragged out of this hellhole, Into a bright white light
Canât get a hold of my fears

FOREVER WAR

Revenge is the game, taken out on me
All dressed up, for the world to see
Blood will be shed
The screams will be heard
The pain donât ever stop
Itâs time to lose my head
So cold
Iâm on my knees
My eyes are closing
The end complete

Dragged out of this hellhole, Into a bright white light
Canât get a hold of my fears

FOREVER WAR

Revenge is the game, taken out on me
All dressed up, for the world to see
Blood will be shed
The screams will be heard
The pain donât ever stop
Itâs time to lose my head
Revenge is the game, taken out on me
All dressed up, for the world to see
Blood will be shed
The screams will be heard
The pain donât ever stop
Itâs time to lose my head
