The Dead care little if they seep or rise again
Whoâs gonna raise these chins now
Whoâs gonna look out through these eyes
Whoâs gonna wear this skin now
Whoâs gonna mourn us if we die again

Whoâs gonna break these bones now
Whoâs gonna grasp and swing these swords
Whoâs gonna throw these stones
Fight for eternity for our lord

The slain care little if they sleep or rise again
The slain care little if they sleep or rise again

[Solo: Heinz]

Whoâs gonna clench these hands now
Whoâs gonna set the world ablaze
Whoâs gonna rule these lands now
Whoâs gonna tear away your face

The slain care little if they sleep or rise again
The slain care little if they sleep or rise again

The dead care little if they sleep or rise again

The slain care little if they sleep or rise again
-Cause weâve been to hell and back
We have nothing left to fear in this world or the next

Doom!

Whoâs gonna break these bones now
Whoâs gonna grasp and swing these swords
Whoâs gonna throw these stones now
Fight for eternity for our lord
