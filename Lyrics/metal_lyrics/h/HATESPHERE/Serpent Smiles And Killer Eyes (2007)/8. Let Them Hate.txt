[Solo: Heinz]

I will kill everything you love
I will rule you with my iron fist
Come and march here among my troops
Pray to god and scream out my name

Let them hate as long as they fear
Let them hate as long as they fear
Iâm the core of the Hatesphere

I have sown the seeds, itâs time to reap
Choke you tight and put you to sleep
Now itâs time for a change of reign
Now itâs time to bring the fuckinâ pain

Let them hate as long as they fear
Let them hate as long as they fear
Iâm the core of the Hatesphere

Iâm the god of your reality

In misery you will dwell...
Iâm the embodiment of hell

Iâll turn this world into a whore
And I will let slip the dogs of war
Everyone wants to see me fall
Iâve come to punish you all

[Solo: Heinz]

Let them hate as long as they fear
Let them hate as long as they fear
Iâm the core of the Hatesphere

Iâm the god of your reality
