Too drunk to know my left from right
I put on my shades to dim the lights
Puke my dinner back into the night
Stumble forward while graping every bottle in sight
Spitting Glass!
I stump through the bars while flashing my backstage pass
No way back â no return

All the faces are blurred
Just faded flesh with eyes like liquid mirrors
Drinking with the King of the Dead

Never met a bottle that I didnât like
Every time you pop a corn I flip my tongue like a dike
Iâm a whore for alcohol
And I drink till I fall
I believe every promise in every bottle
Itâs all religious to me
Hey, look at me
Iâm going to the promised land

Here I stand in a pool of shit
Wondering when I went on this blackout trip

I get sicker
For every glass of liquor
I get the fever
Spanking that fuckinâ liquor

[Solo: Heinz]

All the faces are blurred
Just faded flesh with eyes like liquid mirrors
Drinking with the King of the Dead
