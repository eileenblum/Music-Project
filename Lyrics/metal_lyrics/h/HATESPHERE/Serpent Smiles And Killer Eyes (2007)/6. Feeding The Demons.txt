Keep raging till I can see
The shores of this ocean
let the pain rain down on me
It only helps to numb my emotions

Tear down every wall inside me
Wash away all memory
Smash through every chain that binds me
Smash through it all

I whip my liver all night
Itâs just my demons feeding
I squeeze my bottle tight
Until my hands are bleeding
I beat my senses to a bloody pulp
I leave my body trembling

Tear down every wall inside me
Wash away all memory
Smash through every chain that binds me
Smash through it all

[Solo: Heinz]
[Solo: Pepe]

Tear down every wall inside me
Wash away all memory
Smash through every chain that binds me
Smash through it all
