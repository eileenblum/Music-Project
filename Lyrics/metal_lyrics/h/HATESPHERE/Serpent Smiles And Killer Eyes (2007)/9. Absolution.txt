Absolution!

Tumour growing, filling life with deceit
Poisoned blood, your mothers worthless breed
Your vicious infestation of the weaker mind
The belief of higher purpose is yours not mine

Words of wisdom nowhere to be found
I spit on your thoughts of hallowed ground
Spreading your venom polluting the will
Brings out in me the scent for the kill

Damned be those stepping out of line
The toxins you spill are forced to decline
The lust of men is bound to win
Evil are those who call it sin

Venom

No absolution for those who think for themselves
Put in boxes, placed on the wicked shelf
Converting the world claiming your word is law
In the name of god you fight the unholy war

Words of wisdom nowhere to be found
I spit on your thoughts of hallowed ground
Spreading your venom polluting the will
Brings out in me the scent for the kill

Damned be those stepping out of line
The toxins you spill are forced to decline
The lust of men is bound to win
(Evil is not the lust of men)
Evil are those who call it sin

Youâre all liars, inside you are dead
To kill the snake you cut off the head
Living existences with no chance of scar
Iâll take the Morningstar
