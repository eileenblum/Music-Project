[Composed by Jakob Nyholm, Words by Mixen Lindberg]

I have a book collection that sits and screams.
It's chock-full of memoirs based on the thousands of notes, I wrote about you and me.

Some say it's a long shot, I say not even centuries of sleep could prepare me, for what you had in store for us.

And when the mechanics bend and the clock ticks we can say: "If it kills you, it kills you".
