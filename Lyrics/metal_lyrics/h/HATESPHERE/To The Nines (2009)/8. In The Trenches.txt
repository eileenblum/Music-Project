[Composed by Peter Lyse Hansen, Words by Jonathan Albrechtsen - Mixen Lindberg]

Feel free to try just know, that I will kill you.
Your mouth untrue, unravelling with rancid filth.
As charming as a snake you'll be put to sleep, with a blast from here and to oblivion.

No more self proclaimed and sacred shit, I will tear these lies apart.
And in blasphemous disgust, I will mark the start of the killing.

For I am a devil, here to do the devils work.
The utmost unholy, the baddest motherfucker in hell.

No more self proclaimed and sacred shit, I will tear these lies apart.
Anguish and turmoil will rot you inside out.

I am a devil, here to do the devils work.
The utmost unholy, the baddest motherfucker in hell.

Fake and worthless, you have spread your illness wide.
But today, I will deprive you of life.
Take your fucking life.
Take your life.
