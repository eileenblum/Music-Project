[Composed by Peter Lyse Hansen, Words by Jonathan Albrechtsen - Mixen Lindberg]

Let's go

I am the nemesis of sense and moderation.
I will annihilate, twist and break and devastate.
Show me your enemy and I will bring him to his knees.
Footprints of death I will leave in wake.

I am pain, I am darkness, I am strife, I am the constant evil dwelling in this life.
I am darkened skies and I am war, I am the bastard son of an angel whore.

In these heydays of slaughter there's a storm blowing your way.
A swaying ocean of blood and knocked out teeth.
Sitting on pedestals, I'm pulling strings with a deviant smile on my face.

With a burning passion for detest, I'll feed inside you.
I'm rising again inside you.
Inside your chest I'm rising.
Hate is my domain.
Hate is my domain.

I am war...

I am pain, I am darkness, I am strife, I am the constant evil dwelling in this life.
I am darkened skies and I am war, I am the bastard son of an angel whore.
