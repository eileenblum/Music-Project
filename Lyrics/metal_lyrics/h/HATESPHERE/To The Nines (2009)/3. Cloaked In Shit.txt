[Composed by Peter Lyse Hansen, Words by Jonathan Albrechtsen]

The tides will rise and swallow the earth and then, evaporate in hellish flames.
Leaving this world cold and cloaked in shit, for the father of lies has seen his prey and now he claims.

Apocalypse here today, an army of flies will feast on our decay.
No mercy, no shelter.
Doom and terror shall pour throughout eternity.

The inhabitants of hell shall walk the streets to wallow in our disease infected flesh.
We are heading for ruin and demise, suffer under the lord of the flies.

Apocalypse here today, the preacher of doom cries an omen of decay.
No mercy, no shelter.
Doom and terror will reign throughout eternity.
No mercy, no shelter in these deserted days.

Swallow the earth and leave this world cold and cloaked in shit.
There is no shelter in these deserted days because we have brought this disease upon ourselves, and so, these black wings will carry us away.
