Pull the curtain on me
With your moral-infected mind
You always end up wrong
No promises but empty words

Cross around your neck
But you're lead by the devil
Mingle the world as you want it
As you fucking want it, SVIN

You turn the blind eye
They turn the other cheek
The will of God you say
They submit to you

Cross around your neck
But you're lead by the devil
Mingle the world as you want it

All bow down for you

Receive this punishment
The will of God you say

Bludgeoned to the ground you lie
They refuse to turn the other cheek
Receive your punishment
It's all the will of their God

Cross around your neck
But you're lead by the devil
Mingle the world as you want it
As you fucking want it

All bow down for you

Receive this punishment
The will of God you say

Their God is dead
