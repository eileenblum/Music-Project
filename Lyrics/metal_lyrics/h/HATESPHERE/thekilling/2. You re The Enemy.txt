Instinct takes control of me
My psychosis arise in me
I detest you till the day you're dead
I'll curse your life to hell

I'll stalk you like the predator its prey
Strike you down in untamed disgust

MY RETRIBUTION WILL RISE

I'll dedicate my existence
To tear your petty soul apart
There's no doubt, that's what I'll do
Eradicate your life. Fuck you to!

I'll stalk you like the predator its prey
Strike you down in untamed disgust

Blood on my hands I'm in for the kill
Nothing's better than the real deal

MY RETRIBUTION WILL RISE
EMERGE FROM THE PITS
THE RAGE OF THE RIGHTEOUS
SHALL HANG THEM ALL

You're the enemy Face your demise
Succumbed by my hatred
All foes must DIE!!!!!

Loathing, hating, repulsed by your lies
Your every breath makes me fell half alive
Your eyes will never see anything again
Your soul is heading south.

I'll stalk you like the predator its prey
Strike you down in untamed disgust
It's a turning point I'm longing for more
Never felt free like this before.

PART FROM THIS LIFE AND MEET YOUR MAKER.
