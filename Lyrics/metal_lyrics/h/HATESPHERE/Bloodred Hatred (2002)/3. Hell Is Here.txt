Come on stranger play with me
Now we're in the dark you see
Nervously you ask from me
If this is how it's gonna be
You damn your eyes, they see too much
And pray your lord for deafness

The mind revolts
The body shakes
You sure would like to turn around
But something draws you near...
It's the Hatesphere

You told yourself to stay at home
The feet denied and now you moan
Blackened sky above, below a burning pit
You feel like shit
Entangled by a mastermind
You know this game is not your kind

This can only be a cruel mistake
Beg someone you're not awake
You can't believe you ended up here
Too late...
This is the Hatesphere

Panic's like a worm inside
You scream and run, but you cannot hide
You rip your skin to reach beast
Discarnate man to say the least

[Solo: Z]

The pain inside your head will grow
There's no turning back you know
You grab a pen to write a note
Then a gun...your head explodes
The paper says you've realized a fact you cannot bear:

Hell is here
HateSphere
