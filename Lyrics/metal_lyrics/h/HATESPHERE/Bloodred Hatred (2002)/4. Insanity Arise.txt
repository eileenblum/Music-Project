Feel the gain in your vein
Break loose and go insane
Don't mingle with the mute, but stand to my demand
Let us be creative, like the native
People who hunt and pray to seek the day
It's not in pre-historic chains, but in our veins
To change

Look around
Look inside
Scream, don't hide
It makes me sick to see your body
Like a brick in a pile of shit
You think I'm ill, but I have the will
To toss the stones and break my bones
Yes, I admit, I give in to sin

I spin
I scream
And laugh
I am insane...
Insane

Feel the gain in your vein
Break loose and go insane
Insanity arise
Arise!!!
