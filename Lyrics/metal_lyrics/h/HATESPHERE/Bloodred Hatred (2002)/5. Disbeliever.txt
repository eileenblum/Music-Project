[Solo: PLH]

[Solo: Z]

Covered in skin
Covered in sin
It's all about reaching out
And then begin, then begin
To feel the shadows coming in

It knows how to feed me
And beat me
It knows how, how to treat me
And beat me

Kept in a cage
Enrage
Looking through the bars
The stars glitter in the night
Glitters so bright

It knows how to feed me
And beat me
It knows how, how to treat me
And beat me

I broke the bars but saw no stars
I peeled my skin but felt no sin
I'm reaching in, but can't come out
Only doubt...
I wonder where
I wonder why
I wonder how to reach the sky
It's just a lie
