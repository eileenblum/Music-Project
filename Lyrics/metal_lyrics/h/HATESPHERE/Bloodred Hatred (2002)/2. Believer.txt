I give you the teddy to put you in bed
And here's an axe to chop off your head
I give you a pill to cure your disease
And here's a gun to put you to peace - put you to peace

[Solo: Z]

We chop each other half and half
And all the others start to laugh
But once in a while they seem to know
That this could be their final blow - their final blow

I am the one you love and crave
I am the one to open your grave

My love, your grave is all but one
Believe in me, or I'll be done

How can you walk without my feet
When I'm the one you know you need - the one you know you need

[Solo: Z]
[Solo: PLH]

I am the one you love and crave
I am the one to open your grave
Right here, right now!
I am the one you love and crave
I am the one to open your grave

Half a laugh is better than none
They will be believe, or they'll be done

They will be done
