My mind is closed for repairs
So don't get in my way
I am kicking ahead
And I don't care what you say

I can hardly resist
To be cruel like it is, like it is
I am kicking ahead
And I don't take any piss

Down on your knees, down'n'out
Big mistake, getting ready to fight

I'm making a wreck of myself
Just can't beat the choices that I make
I am kicking ahead
On this cursed planet it's all fake

Down on your knees, down'n'out
Big mistake, getting ready to fight
I am kicking ahead
And I am kicking your head in tonight
