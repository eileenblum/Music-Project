The road was paved long ago
While your progress still goes slow
Although you felt a freeze
You kept on walking on
Now you're begging please

Why do you rip off
When you should fuck off

Strumming, humming around
Like an insect and the dirt
You're the shit
And you're the fly
Go kiss your ass goodbye

Just another fish in the sea
But not swimming free
Entangled in a web
Of miserable shit
You can't escape you cannot swim
Your pitiful career will dim
Run away
No one remembers you were here
Find another place to bore
Or settle down as a whore

Here I come

Your mouth and ass were made to screw
Worry not, I'll visit you
Fuck you!!!
