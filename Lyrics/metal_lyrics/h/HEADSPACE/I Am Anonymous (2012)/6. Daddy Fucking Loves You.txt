All those stars and all their meaning
All the times we lost our way
Will you lie in my arms
'till the world forgets where we are?
Then we'll rise to start a newer day
All that trial and all those answers
All our lives and all that rain
Will you lie in my arms
'till the world forgets who we are?
Then we'll rise to start a newer day
With the warmth of your side
lets me know the reason why
We will rise to start a newer day

I was taken out of the sane
to a place that led me to war
Never thought to stop and complain
or to question what it was for

Time is a measure and it simply divides
Facing the moment,
though I don't know how, don't know why
Kind's not of manners, but in thoughts that decide,
and I don't know how, don't know why
All the same
It's a fine leather cover and an ocean of blame
Oh, how can we explain?
Balance of life [x4]

Want to head to mountains to be safe
Cross the borders to bring me back life
From now on, I can't take all the blame
Given out enough of my own time
From the safety of my known hometown, I was taken
They shredded my mind
From now on, I will bear them no grudge
From now on, I am telling no one

If you choose then to go mess with life, she'll mess with you
I need now to determine who can carry through
We look to people who can supply
the things that lead us to a solemn life, the fallen line
I wanted something that we'd choose to become of you
I didn't know I wanted to,
but its strength and power has integrated through

Change sides more than you give
Change sides, everybody seems to want to blame
Grind - how much more can you give them?
Change sides, nothing's too important not to
Change sides more than you give to
Change sides, everybody seems to want the same
Blame, it's more than you fear to
Change sides no one really ever wanted

Here now, we're running our lives
Riding the storm, but staying alive
Split us in two, we have our sight
Holding the dream to be with you
Here now, we're running our lives
Riding the storm, but staying alive
Split us in two, we have our sight
Holding the dream to be with you here now
To be with you here now

"Hush, little baby, don't say a word
We're buying you a mockingbird,
and if that mockingbird don't sing,
Papa gonna buy you a diamond ring"

Hush now and keep growing
The world has no way knowing
All that's in you is honest and true
Tomorrow you'll wake, and I'll be with you
So hush, hush now and keep smiling
The world is always finding laughter for you
to carry you to the morning
You'll wake and I will...I'll be with you
I will...I'll be with you
I'll be there with you
