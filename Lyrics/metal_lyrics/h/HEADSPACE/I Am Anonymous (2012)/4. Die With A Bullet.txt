Endless lessons
Every day's the same, in life as another,
and it seems sometimes
it's everything that I love to hate
Garrison home now, peace at our place
Killing's the natural phase
Garrison home now, peace at our place
Genocide is in play

Going down now, peace and rest you'll know
Going down now, better prepare the soul
Going down now, peace and rest you'll know
Going down now, evil to face the cull
Going down now, peace and rest you'll know
Going down now, eager to end you all
Going down

Endless lessons
Everyone's gone insane, in life as another,
and it seems sometimes
it's everything that I love to hate
Garrison home now, peace at our place
Killing's the natural phase
Garrison home now, peace at our place
Genocide is in play

Kids don't like me 'cause I'll beat them
Men despise me, I defeat
Kids don't like me 'cause I'll beat them
Dream of murder - murder - murder

Going down now, peace and rest you'll know
Going down now, better prepare the soul
Going down now, peace and rest you'll know
Going down now, evil to face the cull
Going down now, peace and rest you'll know
Going down now, eager to end it all
Going down

Going to die with a bullet in me,
'cause I believe there's something to see in a world
No, when the light's out, let me go - go - go
Going to honor this man that's me,
but I believe there's nothing to see, though I don't know
When the light's out, let me go - go - go
[x2]
From make believe to heresy
Why can't they all let it be?

Going to die with a bullet in me,
'cause I believe there's something to see in a world
No, when the light's out, let me go - go - go
Going to honor this man that's me,
but I believe there's nothing to see, though I don't know
When the light's out, let me go - go - go
[x2]
Reality to victory
Why won't they just let it be?

A cause and a foe
aborted their transmission with intention to violate
Defeat together
Release another round until you can find no trace
We're hearing bullet after bullet
My mind is going blank as the enemy moves to face
Teach a lesson
Call it intervention tearing apart this place
Armageddon
Turned it into Armageddon, was that your intention?
Keep together, release another round
The mission is now in place
Bleed together, raise them to the ground
Destroying the human race
Alive with intention, fueled by our aggression
In the end, we annihilate
