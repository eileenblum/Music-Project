Visualizing the mind of the tyrant
Close my eyes, I see everyone
You don't need to partake to believe it
As I listen to the final announcement
Seems you don't understand what they have done
Are you really controlling the action?
If only people understood what they were reading,
Though I can see it's making them strong
But all power comes from shifts of allegiance

I tell you the reason: fruit will naturally fall
I tell you the reason: growth still follows law
Given that reason, we're falling
Whatever you believe in, you can't change at all,
but changes come around, around, around

I will rest here in your arms for a lesser evil
Whilst we're nestling in the calm, they will not commit you
Just barely holding on

All that's been, we have never managed to make out
through the records that were written at the time of
Like, give another taste, control, camera in the phone booth
Day or night, we're forever open
Live in a manor, and I've taken note for
Fine Caucasian holds minimal life and love, and leave me
Don't lie
Everybody's got their own opinion of you
People never repeat: they won't tell you
All they're feeling is the God emotion

The great people fly high
Greatness also flies by

This is the call of a nation
This is a war that we're heading for
This is the call of a nation
This is the fall of America

You don't even know
You finally let them tempt you
Only let it show as they're leading you away,
and no one has to know
Fear of innocents
While they're playing our games,
you're heading out with:
Leader - federation
Bullshit - vindication
Blinded - all I'm saying
Everything we stood for still wasn't better
Bleeder - deviation
Faker - blind omission
Movements undertaken
All I've ever known, we are no better

This was a call
This was a call you could not ignore
This was a call
This was a call to unite us all
This was a call
This was a call we were waiting for
This was a call
This was a call for America

All time heals now
Oh, let us have peace
Here I'll lie chained overnight
How can we hide?
Here I'm...I'm a traitor
I am a king of another world

This was the fall of America
This was her fall
