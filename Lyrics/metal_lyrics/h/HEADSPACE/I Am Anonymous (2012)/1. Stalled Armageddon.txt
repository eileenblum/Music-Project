They stayed sometime, thought they'd never go
Bound us to the land and bled us 'till we're bone-dry
The undertaker never stalled at all
They know now - they know now
A change in their final idyllic show
People we had loved beginning to be soulless
The undertaker wouldn't halt at all
They know now - they know now

Chains on gates into Babylon
Fear salvation leads to hell
People that stand in different corners
They know now - they know now
Heightened stations that our chieftains never saw
Based emotions added
They know now - they know now
Chains on gates into Babylon
Take your vengeance out on hell
People that stand in different corners
They know now - they know now

All the time whilst it was safe to measure
Clearly wasn't our choice then to stay
If I'd known better, I'd have stopped to get away

Storm clouds
The unstable skies of winter
from the scorching haze in August
to the blazing silent splinter of a moment's madness

From the borders of town, meadows enclosed,
and the second it started, I lost hope
in emotion aroused from the mother of faith
But I'd rather be something that's real
Covered leather 'n bound, and the children were saved
That's how it started, all the blame:
with the lessons and time that were taken each day
But I don't understand it, even now

Keep us for the moment, out of sight
Keep us from the moment
Keep us in the moment
Light of day leading us
Nothing we have broken dies away

Cheated, stalled Armageddon
Evasive - evasive
Beaten, fallen down
Get them down beneath us - beneath us
Open gates into Babylon
Elated - elated
Order might be before too long
Embracing - embracing
