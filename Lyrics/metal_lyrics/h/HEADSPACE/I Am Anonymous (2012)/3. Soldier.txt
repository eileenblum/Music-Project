When I return, I'll be a soldier
I'm simply living in this army holding
There's nothing to fear, except the war I hear
and civilians in their combat clothing
But there is no answer when you ask where it's all leading
There must be something we can say or do
Who can belong inside an army town
when we're all fighting to get out of here?

When I return and I'm much older,
I...I often wonder, will the...the war be over?
And how will I feel that I was sent to kill
with decisions I have no control of?
There is no answer when you ask where it's all leading
There must be something we can say or do
Who can belong inside an army town
when we're all fighting to get out of here?
Out of here

When I return and it's all over,
I...I hope you'll carry me upon your shoulder
and walk up the hill beneath the cannon,
and lay my body down with...with my companions
There is no answer when you ask where it's all leading
There must be something we can say or do
Who can belong inside an army town
when we're all fighting to get out of here?
Out of here
