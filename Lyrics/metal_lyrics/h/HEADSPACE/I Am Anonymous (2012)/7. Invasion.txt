Naively, I had been attracted to the city as a child
It was the heart of community
Unified, healthy, sharp, abbreviated
Opportunities in the city
Greater for the choices of success
and happiness - acceptable - completeness
I moved there as a teenager
and was exposed to subliminal images and emotions
that relied due to accumulation of the rational defined
Expectations everywhere would lead us to the dream
Was this where we were first exposed?

Invaded our faith
Invaded our skin
Invaded from within
Don't you see they're taking us?
The Criminal Nation has led this invasion

Now we're protected
No one except "type A intellectual
unaffected numerically connected" can enter the city
On arrival, shocked by extent, exposure infestation
Denied the truth - shelter - propaganda
And at the gates, the word had changed
So recognize the invasion

Invaded our blood
Invaded with sin
Invaded from within
Don't you see they're taking us?
The Criminal Nation has led this invasion

Taken its hold, ah, yeah
It's taken control, ah, yeah
It's taken its hold, ah, yeah
It's taken control

I saw the sign on the city wall predicting the final day
Then concluding that it had come
to the point I should leave this place
As I left through the gates, I was joined
by a crowd all sensing the same

Now I've led you to this place,
seen your point of view,
dreamt up other faiths we could be too

It's taken control, ah, yeah
It's taken its hold, ah, yeah
It's taken control

All we've seen, we can't change now
Although you feel there were many things unanswered by,
all I see, all I see's invasion

If only I'd tried in life just to let it all lie
No one man decides the fate of the world
If people don't try, then we'll break all together,
and I'd never decide on that course for mankind
And I won't deny all the lies that we're given,
but I'm watching our minds forsaking our souls
And I, and I, only stand for the given
However, nothing survives when the sun finally fades

Nothing can change the fate that we're heading to
(Nothing can change)
No one can take it away
(Nothing can change)
Nothing can change the life that we're going through
(Nothing can change)
No one can take it away
(No one can take that away)
Nothing can change the fate that we're heading to
(Nothing will change)
No one can fade it away
(No one can, no one can, no one can change)
Nothing can change the life that we're going through
(Nothing can change)
No one will take that away
