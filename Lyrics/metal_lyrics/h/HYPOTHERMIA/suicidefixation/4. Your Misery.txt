Torned, bleeding, mourning that you have to face facts
Trapped inside surrounding shadows
You cry out my name without any answer
Words from your lips are nothing
Nothing more than ashes in the filthy air that you breathe
I feel no compassion in your spoken hollow words
Without a purpose you strive
Tords endless solitude
The only salvation is brought by self-destruction
Misery has a face
It's yours
