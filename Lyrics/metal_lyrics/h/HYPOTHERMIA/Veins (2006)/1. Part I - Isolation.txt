Everything that I see
Are reflections of what has come to be
Reflections of me...

Desolate darkness isolates me
As a burning cold leaves one in its never ending caress

Sadness becomes my only happiness
Isolation is my inspiration

Beyond life lurks the greatness of divine
Evolution has taken its turn
Planet earth shall forever burn
