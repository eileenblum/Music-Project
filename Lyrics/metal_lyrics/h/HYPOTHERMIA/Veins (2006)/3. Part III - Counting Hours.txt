Never felt such emptiness
Never been so alone
Always been by myself in this world
Down deep down at the bottom
At this endlessly dark pit
Shaped with my bleeding fingers
Torn apart, die trying getting out of this
All the tears and blood was shed in vain
Now crawling even deeper down
Deeper down than I ever thought possible
Left sleepless where days do not exist
Only weeks and months of everlasting night

Counting the hours...
...for an end to come
