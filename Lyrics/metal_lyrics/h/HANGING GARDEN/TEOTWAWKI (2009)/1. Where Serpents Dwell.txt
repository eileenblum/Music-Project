Through the the ruins of caved in homes
Purified with a curse, the flare withdraws.
Flees a welkin obscured.
Cross the black fields where serpents dwell.
Dim figures, a dark parade.
This is the closure, forced march into unknown.
Our sun is dying.
Stars hide within stars.
Hazy mist steals all the shine.
As the earth moves on, we are left behind.
Banned in hades, caged and blind.
