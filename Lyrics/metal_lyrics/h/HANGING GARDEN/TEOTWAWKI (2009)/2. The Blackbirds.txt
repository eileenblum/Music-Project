Like shadows have we become.
Repressed.
Unable to withstand the wrath we have befallen, on these days of fierce anger.
As black birds of grief leave us withering without respite, it gets hard to breathe.
Soon our pulse wanes.
Sole creatures lost and undone.
Incused, unable to escape the havoc we have arisen.
On these ruins we will succumb.
As black birds of grief leave us withering without respite, it gets hard to breathe and our pulse wanes.
The noise shatters.
Today holds no forgiveness.
No more time.
All belief has vanished these lands, as we let ourselves grow cold.
Inert as ghosts.
We abandoned all the faith.
We abandoned all the hope.
We abandoned all the blaze.
We abandoned all the hope.
Windup is at the hand.
Today all life pines away, it's our twilight.
All the beauty has vanished these lands, as we let ourselves cave in, lifeless within.
