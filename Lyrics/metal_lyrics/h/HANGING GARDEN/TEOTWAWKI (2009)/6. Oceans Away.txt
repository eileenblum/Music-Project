Paralyzed
Breeding disease in this dark grown place
A scarred soul
You went away alone
Undying sickness
Disarray
When the world wakes lifeless and always desert, where can I go?
Breathing with ever slowing pace.
Longing for release as shadows pass across my face.
Alone between the heaves of storm.
Drifting oceans away.
For how much longer will I have m wait?
For these cold waves to wash us all away?
To bring you back home?
