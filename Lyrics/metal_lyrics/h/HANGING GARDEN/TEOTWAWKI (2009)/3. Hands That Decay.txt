Is this finally the winter when solar wind breaks our fate?
I've been waiting for the last spell so long, I've lost the gasp of everything.
Visions from my eyes.
Run away from this dead end point.
Is there a place to go, where hope still grows untouched by the hands that decay?
Where tomorrow holds a brighter dawn, release from all this filth?
Run away from this soil ground.
Harmony we broke.
The dying glow.
Dark shades of the failed cycle.
Finish this shame.
Heal me and walk away.
No more staring walls.
People full of holes.
Blank eyes, hollow speech, the echoes.
Breaking like zero degrees in my heart.
Dead reality, veiling with frost us all.
Breaking like zero degrees in my heart.
Dead reality, all delight frozen and scarred.
Waiting hands stained in blood.
Waiting with ice cold heart.
