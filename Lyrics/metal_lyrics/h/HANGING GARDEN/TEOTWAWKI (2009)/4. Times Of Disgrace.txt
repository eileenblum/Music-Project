Grow old in this place?
To see you age in disharmony?
This shelter the only home for you.
The line is crossed for evermore.
In this room with the unmoved faces staring mute.
Times of disgrace.
With misery we are engaged.
Times of disgrace.
We lost our humanity.
As divided fall upon us the closing times.
The heavens open crashing down the claws of light.
All our sins in the end victimized.
Will we find relief on demise?
Times o? disgrace fall upon us.
Close your eyes let the darkness fall.
Close your eyes.
We'll meet again beyond this all.
Close your eyes let the night time fall.
Close your eyes and all the woe will be gone.
And now we fall in the perish of it all.
