Ravaged with hate into bleeding ground that suffocates.
Once haunting desires fade away with anguished cries.
Nature bent on revenge.
Voice of perdition screaming.
Outburst is close.
Howls catching our cores, one last overthrow.
There is no escape.
This time the wolves cry out for blood abhorrent of our kind.
This time our hearts will be ripped apart.
They will spare no life.
Outlived is our time.
Scenes of the future in the red pouring rain.
Witness our false beliefs drown.
We are not the chosen ones.
This time the wolves cry out for blood abhorrent of our kind.
This time our hearts will be ripped apart.
Outlived is our time.
Unforgiven, our crimes.
No one can spare our lives.
Came the day of deceiving lies.
The moment of going away.
No strength left to arise.
Innosence profaned by unwell mind.
