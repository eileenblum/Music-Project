We roam towards the downfall in fear.
Enchained in punishment.
Crying for deliverance.
We who are the ones to blame.
Unsound minds raising Cains
Evoking,the mans ruin
We gave birth for the plague
Futile souls born in vain
Fever's rising under the blaze
Desecration turns a new page
In pyres we'll evanish as the passage terminates in Eden, turned into a grave
Decline will be cleansed tonight
Burn with me above this tomb
Let the tire erase all the gloom
This paradise will never rise or thrive
Black glints horizon, dark falls the sky
The gates of light forever barred
All life crushed and discarded
Thousand years of decline will be cleansed tonight
Burn with me above this tomb
Let the fire erase all the gloom
Thousand years of decline fades out in flames tonight we all burn in the fires of Sheol.
