We wake up
And watch the world fall apart
And we wake up
Why does this feel so right?

We wake up
And watch the world fall apart

We wake up
We must wake up
We wake up
We must wake up

We must wake up
Our world, it needs to break apart
We see the pieces adjusting to a pattern
They were meant to be

[2x]
Will you stand beside me?
Will you share this ending with me?

[2x]
Will you stand beside me?
And witness our world crumble
And begin anew
