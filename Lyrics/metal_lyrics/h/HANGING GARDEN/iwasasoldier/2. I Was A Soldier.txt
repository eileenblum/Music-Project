Watch closely, loving mother
The world as we know it will fall
Listen closely, mother
While their voices still call

Hear the laments
Faltering little by little
Hear the voices still linger
Waiting for deliverance

Waiting to no avail
We pass the time
Slowly running out
Waiting until stagnation
Will be the worm
To conquer us all
Waiting

See the remnants
Crumbling little by little
Hear the voices still linger
Waiting for deliverance

Waiting to no avail
We pass the time
Slowly running out
Waiting until stagnation
Will be the worm
To conquer us all
Waiting

Waiting
Waiting to no avail

See your children, dying mother
They are bleeding out
In a trembling letter they carve
Their epitaph upon your breast

In silence the children stand
With no air to breathe
They suckle upon your flaccid chest
That seeps but poison
Their fetal frames
Writhing in death
