Carry me
Oh noble wind, my ally
My ashes, a squall of memory
Through these barren meadows of death

Monochrome scenery
It basks in man's passing
Our desolate wake

A deserted abode
A deformed burial mound
No monuments of this victory
A lamentation out of bounds

Oh storm, arise and wake me
For here remains but ash and dust
You wail as if in agony
Let us flee this shore, reach the primal sea

A deserted abode
A deformed burial mound
Abandoned and devoid
Here raging storms prevail
Dissonant and proud
