I remember
The dawn of the final event
And the countless morrows that came and went before it
Uncalled yet precious in every passing
Yet we played along
The mummers farce
With every twist of plot
From the start, plain for all to see

You led, I followed
A pair of weary footprints
Along this path 
Across the abyss
Of fallen thrones

See - the sun bore a son
Luminous and warm
To destroy us all

Yet the strength would fail
Unto sickness succumb
The strongest of brows
The brightest of souls
Went out

I will find
A place for us to hide
To rest and reside
To linger until at last
Death please us claim
But not now
Please not now

A radiant halo of flies
A silent breath of putrid lullabies
For a short while our path was light
Where two once strode thereâs no longer more than one

Of man, a remnant we were
The last pair, these deadly airs we shared
Stalking the dead horizon, on we strode
The soil, the seas, this barren earth
Was ours
