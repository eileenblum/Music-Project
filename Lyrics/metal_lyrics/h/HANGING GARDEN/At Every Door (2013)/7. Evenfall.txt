They fearâ¦
The wolves gather to run
To hunt the herds now lost
Against the horizon
By the setting sun
Carrion birds flock

And they fearâ¦
The shadows growing long
The dusk is at the door
The evenfall upon
So seek shelter now

Soon the darkness beckons
When the shadows fall
Go! Run!
To where the fires still burn
Few and far are the havens

This time we went wrong
Too deep, too far - gone
The remaining are few
Yet ever fewer will become

Rain falls - unpoisoned
Roots strangle the abodes
Of man - forever fallen
Great trunks tower where once buildings of glass
And once more man fears the dark
