Some proclaimed it was the seventh gate
Some forebode it was the heaven's wake
Yet in the end it was us
All along

In the nest of ten thousand cranes
At long last we smothered the flame
Though not in the advent of the long aspired calm

Some proclaimed it was the seventh gate
Some forebode it was the heaven's wake
Yet in the end it was us
All along

The trees still stand so tall
Reddened corpses that breathe no more
A songless headstone for the fallen
For the proud

Burn!
I command you, burn!
And bring back what was taken
What was taken once
Burn!
I command you, burn!
And bring back what was taken
It was taken twice

Burn! Burn!

Behold the brand
The mark of plague
Our savior of molten flesh
Paint the clouds with the darkness [2x]

My song it echoes
A wordless plea of pain
After a moment of eternity
It slowly falters and fades away

Burn!
I command you, burn!
And bring back what was taken
What was taken once
Burn!
I command you, burn!
And bring back what was taken
It was taken twice
