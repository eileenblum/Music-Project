Late in to the twilight
We ride the silvery steed
A moment cradled in dark
A myriad burningâpointsâabove

Will there be
Anâimpenetrable silence
A blanket to smother allâlingering life

Three moons left behind
And with them the remnants of time
One moon above to light my way
Beneath a broken sky

Late in to the twilight
We ride the silvery steed
And through the dark, a distant radiant star
And in the mist, the lucid dancing of flame

Three souls to carry the flame
Three minds with burning memories
Together we bear the weight of untold time
Fear, longing, hope and the night

Will there be
An impenetrable silence?
