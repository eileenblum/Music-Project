I feel the earth beneath my feet
And the sweet air in my lungs
The water fallingâsilentâfrom the sky
Andâthe fire about to die

Will myâfeet still carry me
Under the silent trees
Will my feet still carry me
Through this overwhelming night
Over the frozen earth
Until I die

Will my feet still carry me
Under the silent trees
Through this overwhelming night
Over this earth
Until I die

The silent sentinels
Oaks and pines in the dusk
They watch over the path of a fallen son
Towards a glimpse of a final morning sun
