Remains of winter's snow
A million trickles towards the shore
As fluid as eternal time
Deeds good andâevilâlost within

Yet fromâa chance encounter
A meaning could beâfound
A handprint etched into a soul
A keepsake to guide us forth
Towards eternity

How do we reign over our fate?
The paths of those passing by
Entwining with a burning resolution
Life, relentless, unending
Until it ceases
