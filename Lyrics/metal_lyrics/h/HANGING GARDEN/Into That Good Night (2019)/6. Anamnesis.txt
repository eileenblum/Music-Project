A memory
Is woven from the shadows
Distilled from dying embers

A memory
Drawn thin between the moments
Expelled beyondâourâgrasp

Remembrance
Is a thresholdâto the night
A journey without ending

Remembrance
Isâa chalice for the damned
Lost forevermore
And we tread that trail
Unwilling and yet eager
If not awake then deep in slumber
Restless in our sleep

We loved the flame
The fire stolen from the gods
We gathered around the dancing embers

We loved the flame
The fire stolen from the gods
Warding us against the dark
