In these times
When sickness holds
A solemn pact with death
One did fall
Unto sickness
And shivering slumber

Oh heavenâabove,âwhy
Is woe onâmisery piled
Under these skies
Should one moreâof us die?

From darkest skies
This night unfolds
With the most gentle breath
Still does one fall
Unto that good night
From pain ever yonder

On the concrete shade-tendrils
Slowly creep and crawl
By evenfall the shadow-fingers
Point towards the dawn
I watch the insects
Scurrying along the waning light
For them the dark means death
Whereas we hold dear this cover of the night
