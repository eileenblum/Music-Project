A song from bygone days
A haunting tune in the back of the mind
Sing with theâdamned,âoh rising tide
Forâthe stars are aligned on theâclearest sky

A song from belated morns
Daunting moons, forever behind

This night the sky became the sea
Beating soil and the soul torn asunder
Who should dare to tread under darkest clouds
Slick and tarnished with the taste of demise

Tainted water pours from the ages past
Running through these fingers battered and worn to the bone
Diluted with the shadows of wasted days
Frozen it hovers to the broken ground
