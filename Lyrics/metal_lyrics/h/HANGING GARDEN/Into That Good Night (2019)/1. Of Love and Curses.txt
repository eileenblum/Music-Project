This time
The tide wouldn't turn
Towards a brighter dawn
The shadows long grew longer still
Cold creeping upâtoâthe bone

This timeâthe morning sun
Caught up on thoseâon the run
The cruel bright pledge of demise
Sealed with ice and signed in blood

From blood a fire is broken
Heavy breath through the dawn
The world is wet with emptiness
Embers aglow in the dark

From blood a fire is broken
Hold on through the dawn

And I can see it now
Clear as the brightest dawn
This curse we cast upon ourselves
The love we chose not to bear
