Let your voice out
We've been silent too long
An ode of one forsaken
For another one to hear

We tread with graceful grace
All paths shrouded in haze
Lead by promise of unknown
Did we lose our way
Oh did we

Come and break the silence
Hear an echo resound aloud
Reach out your voice for a melody
Hear it beckoning, reaching out for you

We have lost our silence now
Have we lost our way as well


There are truths one can find
Confined beyond senses
Truths eyes cannot perceive
Truths for ears unheard of

Are we too far gone
Too strayed from the path
Guided away by promises
Lost and astray
Gone to nothingness
We are too far gone
Too strayed from the path
Guided away by promises
Lost and astray
Gone to nothingness
