Here I stand alone
Firm I face the dark
Moon's gaze upon my shoulders
The breath of winter on my skin

Your warmth still carries on
A candle against the cold
And time, place and distance
Have lost their hold

What if we could share the stars
The earth that bears our weight
What if we could share the sun
The sky, the wind and the sea
