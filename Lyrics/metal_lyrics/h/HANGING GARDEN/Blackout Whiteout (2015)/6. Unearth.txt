I lose myself here
And become one
With all that I am
About to be

The words will not come
They are buried under the mountains
Lost deep in the ocean
Scattered in the wind

I lose myself here
And become none
Leave behind the one
I used to be

Lose yourself here now
And the words will be found
Washed to the shore by the storms
Brought down by torrents cold

We stole the fire
To keep away the cold
Our hands got burned
Yet we kept our hold
