The end of this eclipse
The dusk of the last day
Is not one of closure
No solace can be found here

No answers are laid bare
No truths are spoken

The start of this eclipse
The dawn of the first day
Is not one of closure
No solace can be found here

Here night prevails
And the day holds no stead
No answers are laid bare
No truths are spoken

So kill the lights
Draw down all curtains
Smother the dying fire
And maybe you will see
