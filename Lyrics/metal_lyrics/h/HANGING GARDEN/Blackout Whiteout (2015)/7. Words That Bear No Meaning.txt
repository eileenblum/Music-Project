I am weary of this
Weary of every little thing
Keepsakes held dear
Havens that burned

So I tear loose this skin
Tainted with affection
Plagued with compassion
Scarred by hope

And I shall become your eyes
Your ears, your skin and mouth
And it's through me that you'll speak
Words that bear no meaning

Beneath our feet
The ice keeps melting
The waters run black
The earth, a corpse's putrid skin

Lesions carved deep
Ground down to roots now
So lay down all that remains
To where sensation goes to die
