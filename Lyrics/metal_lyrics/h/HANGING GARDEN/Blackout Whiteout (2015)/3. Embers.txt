From summer's end
We walk towards winter
Shadows entwined
Fleeting moments passing by

By dawn we were ended
Yet there was beauty to be found
The warmth still lingered
And the gentle snow that made no sound

Do not grieve, my friend
For each beginning there must be an end

Do not grieve, my friend
And while there are things to be buried deep
For each beginning there must be an end
We'll meet again beyond the realms of sleep

Thrice the moon's full bloom
Yet only twice the eventide
One night to set alight
Another to let the fire die

Yet the embers remain
