With every breaking dawn
We scar the earth
In a blind mindless way
We feed our growing pain

Disinclined to see
In our cores diseased
We carry the plague

With every passing day
More beauty we erase
The groves, the glades
Our world we devastate

Disinclined to see
That springs will fail
That colours will fade

And the shadows shout
A nightmare scream
In the black desert
In every restless dream

In the clouding distance
The paper doves fly
Someone declares
The end of time
In the clouding distance
Black fumes arise
In fear decayed souls collide

And the shadows shout
A nightmare scream
In every wasteland
Within you, within me
