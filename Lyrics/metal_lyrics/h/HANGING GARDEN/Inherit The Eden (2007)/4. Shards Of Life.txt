Among this dying scene
I try to pull together
Scattered beauty, Shards of life
The waning ruins of mankind

For you to see
My unborn child

Like statues in the rain
We watch tomorrow fade away
Hang our heads in pain
We disregard our fate

Clam â is the dawn without a sounds
Cold â is the day without the light
Silent death attends every death we take
Dead â is the world in my eyes

Bounds up in memories
I treasure images
Of our abode left to die
Of what we have forfeit

I feel ashamed
For what leave behind

Like statues in the rain
We watch tomorrow fade away
Hang our heads in pain
We disregard our fate

Clam â is the dawn without a sounds
Cold â is the day without the light
Silent death attends every death we take
Dead â is the world in my eyes

We live among the dead scene
