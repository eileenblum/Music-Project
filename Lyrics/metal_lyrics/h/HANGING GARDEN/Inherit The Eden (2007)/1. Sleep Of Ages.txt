Through aeons in sleep
We close our eyes to get away
Through ages astray
We close our minds to negate

In the end we all fall
In the end we all fall
Every soul, all alone
Every heart, turned to stone
we fall, down below
In damnation, in a dark glow

Lost inside a hopeless gloom
We are alive, yet dead inside
Deep In slumber, in the endless doom
Our cores decay and slowly die

In the end we all fall
In the end we all fall
Every soul, all alone
Every heart, turned to stone
we fall, down below
In damnation, in a dark glow

Guide us back into the light
Show us the gate within
Proffer us a release
In the emptiness we will suffocate
