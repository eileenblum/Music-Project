Oh murderous blade of dawn
Tear open this cavernous lesion
Beneath the shedding skin
Rancid pools of sickness

A morning painted black
Mute and devoid
Frozen stillness
No beacon for this frigid path of mine

Inhale a warm false solace
An ember between my fingers
Smoke sings a silent melody
A quiet pledge of death

I am a blight unto myself
Heavy with this burden
Such sonorous malady
An accomplice in my demise
