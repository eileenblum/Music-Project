This burden of ours
Shared by blood
Carried with sadness
Released with an ease

This is where
All journeys are brought to an end
Where the tides collide
Shallow waters left behind

The isle stands guard
Names etched to stone
As they are to our bones
The sea is silent

We share its quiet sigh
And we let it go
We let it go
Over silent waters

Ashes scattered in the wind
This is where
All journeys are brought to an end
Where the tides collide
Shallow waters left behind
