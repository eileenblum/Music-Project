All colour is gone
Cast time speaks a silent tongue
A diluted sun
Looks down on all the shadows cast wrong
All of the shadows cast wrong

All purpose bled out
Miscarried intentions run amok
Pinholes of light blotted shut
Painted black

What is the purpose behind this
Life lived, loved, eventually lost
What is this vague emptiness
This vacant throne of dust

Still the colours are gone
Lost time and its silent tongue
The diluted sun gone out
No shadows cast any more
No shadows cast any more

Through the years
A beacon of memory shines forgotten and weak
Scattered debris of recollection
Twisted by time's deceit

What is the purpose behind this
Life lived, loved, eventually lost
What is this vague emptiness
This vacant throne of dust
