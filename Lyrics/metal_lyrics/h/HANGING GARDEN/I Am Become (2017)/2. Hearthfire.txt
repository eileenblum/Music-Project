Here
A stead of strong hands
A home of sound heart
Abode of warm hearth's fire

There
A place among friends
Memories of a man
Gone but not lost

Now
We carry your weight
Of iron and stone
With the strength that you gave

Then
A bearing intense
Within and without
A sound mind in our midst
Now and forever

To live without fear
With a heart content
Stay not your hand
Held out in pure intent

Here
The anvil grown cold
The bellows silent
Yet these walls still remember

There
An oak still stands firm
In memories and tales
The words are still heard

Now
We carry your torch
Of resin and wood
Yo ulP light become ours

Then
A companion in life
Still loyal in death
She followed your path
When no-one else could

JÃ¤Ã¤ hetkeksi matkamies
KÃ¤y varjoon
ÃÃ¤relle hÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤n
Hengi tulestasi hiljainen kytÃ¶
JÃ¤tÃ¤ surusi
KÃ¤y kanssani pimeÃ¤Ã¤n
