Come
Lie down here
Where the earth brings sleep
Where the fires burn
With a radiant glow
And hear the songs sung by soil
By the wind and rain
They call you now

Then we reach the sea beyond
And greet the sunless glowing dawn
Lay all fears to rest
Here the night tide brings us close
To the timeless stream of souls
Lay all fears to rest

Come and let go
Let the earth bring dreams
Amidst the fires' warmth
A distant hum
That turns to a song sung by soil
By the wind and rain
They call you now

Then we reach the sea beyond
And greet the sunless glowing dawn
Lay all fears to rest
Here the night tide brings us close
To the timeless stream of souls
Lay all fears to rest

We will know you
A spire strong
A spire strong
And tall in our hearts
Spirits and souls

We will know you
A spire strong
A spire strong
And tall in our hearts
Spirits and souls

We will know you
In our hearts
Spirits and souls
