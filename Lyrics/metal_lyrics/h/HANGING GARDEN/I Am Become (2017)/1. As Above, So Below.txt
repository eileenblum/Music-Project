"Se kuollut ei oo mi voi iÃ¤ti maata
Aikojen myÃ¶tÃ¤ voi kuolokin laata"
[quote from "The Nameless City" by H. P Lovecaft 1921.
Translation by S.A. Kivinen 1987]

Tread lightly, hear the calling night
Thin sheets of ice give in beneath the white

Silent and tender, winter's cloak divine
Breathe in the dusk's hushed air sublime

Be still in this moment of dark
Linger quietly under these stars
Call out beyond the reaches of memory
And hold my heart captive

I inhale the dusk, the crystalline air
The frozen dew vaporized, star-silver-lined
The world is a playground of ethereal shadowlings
An endless merry-go-around, sprung from the eye of the moon
