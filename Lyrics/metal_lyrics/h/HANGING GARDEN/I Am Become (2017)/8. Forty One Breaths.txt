When the rain fell
And the breath of sickness
Would seep within
Every crack and crevice
Disease was born inside

A silent sigh of demise
Breathe it in, my darling ones
Oh gently inhale my love
And let sickness be born within

These walls breathe death
The weeping sores gape wide open
We draw deep this dying breath
And greet the silence left behind

Oh gently inhale my love
And feel the sickness within

Kuule sanam, ystÃ¤vÃ¤
NÃ¤mÃ¤ seinÃ¤t henkivÃ¤t kuolemaa
Kulje kanssani - me jÃ¤tÃ¤mme tÃ¤mÃ¤n maan
