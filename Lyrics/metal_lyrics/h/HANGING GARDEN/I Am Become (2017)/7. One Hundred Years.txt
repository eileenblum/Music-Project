Rise
I call unto you
Lest what we were be forgotten

She
Bore us, gave us nourishment
She is what eventually made us strong

Lay waste unto this darkness
Carry a torch to light the night
Blood is not what unites us
Words should not tear us apart

Now
Let the fetters fall
And break the silence
We can be as one

This is what we built
This is what we stood for
Here is where we'll make our final stand
