Bastard cries, feed the fire. The burning desire to rob human life. In this
world full of fear of the unknown. Twisting the perception of the weak.
Lying to progress. Only achieving greed. Seated behind the sun. Myths bleed
into one. Searching for a saviour to lead us through this life. Where our
sanity is undone. Killing against our will. Killing for the bastard maker.
The fairy tale. The non existent. Salvation so bittersweet the taste brought
fear to our tongues. Preying on the weak. Fatherless creation encased in the
depths of humanity. They continue to rape and call it purity. I will not bow
down because of out past. I see now mankind was not meant to last.
