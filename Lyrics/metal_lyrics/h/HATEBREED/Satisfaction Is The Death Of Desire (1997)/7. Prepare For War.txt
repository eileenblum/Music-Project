Drifting by the heavens unscarred. Yet unhealed before a bleeding cross.
Thrown into the ash. Crumbling.
[chorus]
I've been crossed. Like the lies on
a clocks face. I've been fed lies I can't comprehend. I've become but a mere
seed again. And I'll prophesize the end. Now. I have yet begun to fight.
There is no fear in my heart. No cause worthy of my respect. In the End I'll
rot. I won't fall prey to deception. Deception is the means by which they
profit. Deceit if their hearts. Evil within their souls. The cruelty by
which they exploit will not be part of my life.
[repeat chorus]
