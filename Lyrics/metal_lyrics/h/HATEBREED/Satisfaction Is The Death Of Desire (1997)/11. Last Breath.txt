All the prayers in the world can't bring you back. It's your last breath,
this is our last breath. Taken from this earth without warning. Victim of
the ultimate injustice. Nothing will ever make sense of this. Nothing could
have prepared me. All that is left are memories, and the pieces of a
shattered existence. I wish I could bring back. Right through your last breath.
I felt you last breath. All the prayers in the world can't bring you back.
