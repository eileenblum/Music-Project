Conditioned to feel nothing.
We turn our backs on all these crimes.
Cries fall on deaf ears, and the killing continues.
They say what we don't know will never hurt us, but nothing could be further from the truth.

[chorus]
In your uncaring life - we are worlds apart.
In this race doomed to fail - we are worlds apart.
In this system you support - we are worlds apart.
In my soul - we are worlds apart.

Worlds apart
