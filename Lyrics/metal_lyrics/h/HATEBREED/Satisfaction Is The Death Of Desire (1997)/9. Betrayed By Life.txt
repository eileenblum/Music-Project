In a cold unforgiving world--alone with fear and weakness, oppressed and dying slowly--countless people have been betrayed by life. No one is exempt. No one is safe. So many lives will be taken. So many lives have been ruined. So many lives hang in the balance. So many lives have been lost. Betrayed by life. As survivors we are left to mend their wounds, we are left to dry there tears. We are left to pick up the pieces of those who have been betrayed by life.
