Every seconds breath life into a reason for dying. Our ignorance will only
stunt our final will to live.  Bound and Gagged. I feel forced back in a
losing race. I've been stepped on and passed by but I have enough hope to
keep fighting. All of my pain. Driven by suffering [x2]
Every single choice I must make. Driven by suffering. [x2]
