You came to me with salvation, saying I must repent. You offer up your
redemption, a guarantee for a better life in your safe world. Your illusions
are comfort for your conscience. My sacrifices will be made in honor of what
is truly sacred. How can you save me, when you can't save yourself? You
can't save yourself.
