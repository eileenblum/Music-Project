[Back ups by Watt Macintosh]

What make you think everything is this world that you have can be taken away?
In a world this day, it's kill or be killed. I live each day like it might be my last.
In this lifetime few things are worth fighting for. My Blood, Your Honor. Everyone has a destiny.
I'll choose my own! I will not be a victim.
I'll choose my own! My cries won't go unheard
I'll choose my own! I've got to fight for myself
I'll choose my own! And what I hold so true. Destiny!
I'll choose my own destiny and I'll never let anyone take away what I hold so true.
I won't live in denial. And I won't turn the other cheek.
I must remain convicted and never accept this suffering.
I've learned from my mistakes and I've made a promise to myself.
I won't live in the past... I won't live in the past!
I've been affected by your lies and I've let that hold me back.
I wasn't thinking for myself. I wasn't living for myself.
I will not be a victim.
I'll choose my own! My cries won't go unheard
I'll choose my own! I've got to fight for myself
I'll choose my own! And what I hold so true.
What I have in my heart...
What I have in my heart, I'll take to my grave... I'll take to my grave
