Thrown into this living hell. I was thrown into this living hell. I am the
hatred taken from another's life. Born unwanted, extracted of all that is
humane. No one can relate to my abandonment. I walk this earth alone in
search of salvation. Forever, Forever. Forever. Alone. A tormented seed
given a chance to grow. The end result of moral choice. Only to live a
tortured life as the product of rape. Under a mother's face of innocence,
And a father with eyes of a demon. Conceived through an act of violence.
[x4] I was thrown into this living hell. I didn't ask to be this way. I was
thrown into this living hell.
