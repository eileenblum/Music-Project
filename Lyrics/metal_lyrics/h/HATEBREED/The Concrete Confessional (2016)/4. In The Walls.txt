Leave no eye open
To weep for the fallen
A strange stillness
Has started to sink in

Inside the wall is scum and trash
Blind from birth, only see what they lack
Outside these walls, filth and shame
Standing on unmarked asylum graves

Something in the walls
I hear them scratch, I hear them crawl
Something in the walls
The lurking fear has trapped them all

When you're in league with vermin and bums
It's no surprise all you get is crumbs
When you're the worst, the worst of all kinds
No one's shocked you're trapped inside


Something in the walls
I hear them scratch, I hear them crawl
Something in the walls
The lurking dread has trapped them all
Something in the walls
Blessed are the blind that feed them well

Rats, rats
