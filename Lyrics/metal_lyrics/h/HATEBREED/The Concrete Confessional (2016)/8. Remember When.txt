Remember when is a phrase for fools
The here and now is what I choose
It was better then is a saying I dread
Will they ever under-fucking-stand

I don't regret
Not one single shred
I let the weak lament
Now I'm eager to forget

The past is like a virus to some it infects
A vestige of thoughts that I once had
Now they want to tell me that it's not the same
Some of us follow a path they can't see

Remember when is a saying I reject
What if today is all that we get
It was better then well than I don't recall
Will they ever stand or just crawl

I don't regret
Not one single shred
I let the weak lament
Now I'm eager to forget

Will they ever
Will they ever
Will they ever
Under-fucking-stand
