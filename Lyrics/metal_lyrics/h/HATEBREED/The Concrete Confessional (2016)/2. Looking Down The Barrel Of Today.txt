Once hat a shotgun to my head
They said I wasn't worth the bullets
Now the world is my trigger and I'm here to fucking pull it

Once hat a shotgun to my head
They said I wasn't worth the bullets
Now the world is my trigger and I'm here to fucking pull it

Still here, still here, I can't hesitate
Eyes wide open, pupils dilate
Still here, right here, set to detonate
I see the swarm, the scavengers await

No sleep, no rest
If that's what it takes to be the best
No sleep, no rest
Must say driven, I can't relent

Once had a knife to my throat
They said I'd wind up in the dirt
I know the ones who doubt me are the ones that really hurt

Still here, still here, I can't hesitate
Eyes wide open, pupils dilate
Still here, right here, set to detonate
I see the swarm, the scavengers await

No sleep, no rest
If that's what it takes to be the best
No sleep, no rest
Must say driven, I can't relent

Came from the gutter
Just missed the grave
Now I'm looking down the barrel of today
Start from nothing
Stop at nothing, hellbent
Never put myself in that position again

Now I'm looking down the barrel of today

Once hat a shotgun to my head
They said I wasn't worth the bullets
Now the world is my trigger
I'll fucking pull it

Once hat a shotgun to my head
They said I wasn't worth the bullets
Now the world is my trigger and I'm here to fucking pull it

No sleep, no rest
Must do what it takes to be the best
No sleep, no rest
Do anything that it takes to be the best
