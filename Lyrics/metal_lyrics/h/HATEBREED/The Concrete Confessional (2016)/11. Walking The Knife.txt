You only know life's worth
When you're taken to a place
Where life means nothing
You only know what hurts
When you dig to a place
Where the pain stops coming

Some days will give you the ground
Some days will give you the rope
Someone will hand you the poison
Who is it that pours it down your throat

Follow follow
What your gut is telling you or
Swallow swallow
Swallow what they're feeding you
Death is on one side, the other is life
Neither seems bright
When you're walking the knife
Follow follow
What your gut is telling you or
Swallow swallow
Swallow what they're feeding you
Looking at both sides, foes or friends
Lighting the candle that burns both ends

You only know love's weight
When you're carried to a place
Where acceptance is real
You only put your faith
In the places you know it's truly sincere
Failure's on one side, the other is growth
Neither is a choice
When you're beneath the earth

Follow follow
What your gut is telling you or
Swallow swallow
Swallow what they're feeding you
Death is on one side, the other is life
Neither seems bright
When you're walking the knife
Follow follow
What your gut is telling you or
Swallow swallow
Swallow what they're feeding you
Looking at both sides, foes or friends
Lighting the candle that burns both ends

Follow follow

Follow follow
What your gut is telling you or

Swallow what they're feeding you
Death is on one side, the other is life
Neither seems bright
When you're walking the knife
