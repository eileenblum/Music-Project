Sickness has come

Disorder comes in many forms
See the faces of angels deformed
Moral decay, icons razed
Witness another glimpse into the darkest age

Welcome to chaos
This is the fall of those who betrayed us
Come one, die all
Bodies put to flame as the heavens fall
No shelter from the downpour
Halos replaced by crimson thorns
Weakness breaks all solemn vows
Will all be deserted forever now

From grace we've fallen
In deceit we trust
Delusions reign
All that's iron, turns to rust

From grace we've fallen
In deceit we trust
Delusions reign
What once was brilliant, now hast turned to rust

Sickness has come
This has all become too much

Atrocities like never seen before
Innocence burns, children ripped from parent's arms
Separation from this world
Mankind reduced to feed the worms
No one to shield us from this storm
Saints now wear their bloodied crowns
Weakness breaks all solemn vows
Will all be forsaken forever now

From grace we've fallen
In deceit we trust
Delusions reign
All that's iron, turns to rust

From grace we've fallen
In deceit we trust
Delusions reign
What once was brilliant, now hast turned to rust

Sickness has come
This has left us in disgust
The sickness has come
