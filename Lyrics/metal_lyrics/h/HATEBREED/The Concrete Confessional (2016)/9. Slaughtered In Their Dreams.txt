Evil infects this place
All innocence
Nailed to a stake
I see murder, I see rape
I see children slaughtered in their dreams

Shedding blood, in its wake
There's no end to the hate
So we're headed into the flames
As we're paralyzed in this state

Aggression is their messiah
Resentment filled with twisted desire
Tempers reveal true repulsion
Unending blind devotion

Live, how can they live
Breathe, how can the breathe
Sleep, how do they sleep
When there are children slaughtered in their dreams

Taking solace, giving pause
Now the effect becomes the cause
So destructive, so numb
Sacrifice will not be enough

Progression can never be achieved
Soulless in the fiber of their being
Deliverance attained by none
Expression suppressed once again

Live, how can they live
Breathe, how can the breathe
Sleep, how do they sleep
When there are children slaughtered in their dreams

Butchered, maimed
Mangled as they slept
Slaughtered, tortured
The part we've forgotten
Was never to forget

Slaughtered, tortured, murdered in their sleep
The story we are told is a horror to believe
How do we exist, rest and breathe
Go about our lives with children dying as they dream
