When the end of sanity comes to you
What will the silence say
Will you express any remorse or throw decency away
Clear conscience is forfeit when a heart's plays false by praise
Harmony ends swiftly, withers, dies and dissipates

Always unwilling to give, so self-obsessed without respect
Always unwilling to give but they take take take
So many unfazed by greed, just arrogant so ignorant
So many in dire need but they wait wait wait

Then comes forth a message
A lesson you'll surely learn
Confidence is fragile so we see the damage earned
A propped up false identity, bearing a faceless mark
Dignity was not preserved, now we're at a loss

Always unwilling to give, so self-obsessed without respect
Always unwilling to give but they take take take
So many unfazed by greed, just arrogant so ignorant
So many in dire need but they wait wait wait

All I hear is dissonance
