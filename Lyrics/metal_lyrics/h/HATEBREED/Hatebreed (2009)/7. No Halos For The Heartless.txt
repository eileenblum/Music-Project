I see a world that's out of focus
Lost and dying as we witness virtue
Thrown aside

Now degenerates and leeches thrive
While the working mans condemned
And the junkies, risen up onto a throne of lies
A wretched pedestal
But only fools will watch it all

I have no halos for the heartless
No pity for the insincere
No honour for the worthless
Who've done nothing in life to be revered

When addicts die
Their abuse fades
If heroes live
They face the hardest days

They'll stigmatize the soldier
And question motives to try
And cheapen all their sacrifice
They pay homage to those who don't deserve
Praising thieves and liars
The corrupt and the pariahs
Decency is left to die

It's completely despicable
Only weak minds will deem them worthy

I have no halos for the heartless
No pity for the insincere
No honour for the worthless
Who've done nothing in life to be revered

I have no halos for the heartless
No pity for the insincere
No honour for the worthless
You never did a fucking thing in your life to be revered
