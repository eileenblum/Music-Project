Father of all that is merciless
Creates what cannot be more vile
Servants beg their twisted master
To victimize defile

The merciless tide
Consumes and purifies
All those who've done wrong
And believe it's right

Your on the wrong side of a merciless tide
And it's crashing down upon you
On the wrong side of a merciless tide
Up to your throat as it haunts and surrounds you

The merciless tide
Has come to paralyze
All those who've done wrong
And believe it's right

Sink!

You're on the wrong side of a merciless tide
Now it's crashing down upon you
On the wrong side of a merciless tide
Up to your throat as it haunts and surrounds you
On the wrong side of a merciless tide
When your punishment is everlasting
On the wrong side of a merciless tide
Where will you hide, when your fate comes crashing?

The tide has turned on you!

Sink!
