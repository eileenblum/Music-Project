I won't celebrate your
Genocide and I won't consume
Your lies, and you cannot
Deny how your selfish ways
Kill and ruin innocent
Lives, people have been
Exploited, people have been
Killed, humanity has been raped
And still I see no cure. I won't
Consume your filth. Filth is what
You know, filth is what you
Consume, filth is all you know,
I'm gonna take you out.
I can justify your suffering,
Can you justify theirs?
You degrade and destroy
Life as we know it to profit
At any cost. I won't consume!
I won't take part! I cannot and
I won't, I won't consume your filth!
