You fucking bleed now

Underneath the veil was a
Killing power
Only a cursed love could retain
I lent it a vision and a voice
And pleaded in the greatest moment of need

Carved into time
Every reflection dies
This will be the bleeding of your life

Carved into time
Every reflection dies
Every reflection dies
Until you see it clearer
Every reflection dies
Inside the broken mirror

Every reflection dies

And now I'm forced to see...

You fucking bleed now
Everyone fucking bleeds now

Crowned in pure disdain
Barely able to contain
Now this will all end in blood
Cleansing, lasting, murderous

Carved into time
Every reflection dies
This will be the bleeding of your life

Carved into time
Every reflection dies

Nothing was enough
And once was to fucking much
Nothing was enough
This will end in blood

Get bled

Everyone fucking bleeds now
