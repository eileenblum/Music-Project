Defy it!

It's forced into our minds
It's pollution of the soul
So invasive and poisonous
To resist is to gain control

Leeching the life
Sucking the faith
Polluting the blood
It's everything this world throws at us
Pure distortion of the truth

It's forced into our minds
It's pollution of the soul
So invasive and poisonous
To resist is to gain control

Don't let it burn you alive
Don't let it scar you
Defy it!

Don't let it burn you alive!
Don't let it scar you
Defy it all!

They forced it into our minds
It's pollution of the soul
So invasive and poisonous
To resist is to gain control
