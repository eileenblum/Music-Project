Hard rain pours down on the concrete
Seeps in deep below
Cold screams of the city are
Heard through the walls of every home

Most seek for a deeper meaning
Beyond their daily woes
Most see nothing more than black clouds
It's all that they know

We Become
Our scars, if we let them
But all that we truly need
Is out there for the taking

We scream every word
It's brought us together
Every lasting scar
Reminds us how we got here

We scream every word
It's brought us together
Every lasting scar
Shows what it's taken to be
Who we are

Some dwell into emptiness
The hurt they claim is real
Been let down now it's meaningless
They find ways to conceal

Never to be seen again
Until it's all too late
And if we don't learn from it all
Well repeat the same mistakes

We Become
Our scars, if we let them
But all that we truly need
Is out there for the taking

Every lasting scar
Shows us what it's taken to be
Who we are!

We scream every word
It's brought us together
Every lasting scar
Reminds us how we got here

We scream every word
It's brought us together
Every lasting scar
Shows what it's taken to be
Who we are

We scream every word
It's brought us together
Every lasting scar
Shows what it's taken to be
Who we are!
