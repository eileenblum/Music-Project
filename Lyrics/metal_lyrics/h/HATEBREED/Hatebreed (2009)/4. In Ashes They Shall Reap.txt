Born to bleed fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me [x4]

Let me tell you of a force crashing through my veins again
Like a page torn from a chapter of a book of better days
In the moments that we see together some will never know
It's these words that never give to justice screaming all alone

I was born to bleed fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me
Born to bleed fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me

You may trusted me an answer and put hope in
Me a seed
All these memories come haunt us if we still feel to believe
Now the fear we all once held is a breath we must attain
Because those who sow in flames in ashes they shall reap
Ashes are all that you're left with what you sow in flames [x4]
Our life sorrows of my own creation saving sand for a love [x3]
Those who sow in flames, in ashes they shall reap

I was born to bleed, fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me

Born to bleed, fighting to succeed
Built to endure what this world throws at me [x5]

But those who sow in flames in ashes they shall reap [x2]
Those who sow in flames in ashes they shall reap
