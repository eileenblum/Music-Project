The man drifting seeks poison and promise
A threat to all, mostly to himself
Hearing voices from the great beyond
Now only he can dig himself out

Eyes red, wrists cut
Reaching out but not from heaven
Soul black, head fucked
Hell's existence isn't numb

You can't keep him from the bottom
Where the dwelling begins
Once capable and caring
Now in perils seductive grip
His mournful cries are pitiful
Sung to dying skies with no stars
Now his letter's kept inside a flame
Those who read only know the burning

Eyes red, wrists cut
Reaching out but not from heaven
Soul black, heart fucked
Hells existence isn't numb
Mouth sewn, hands bound
But do you cease the torment
Skin cold, failed unknown
Scream until the blood fill your lung

Yeah, now you're a threat
But only to yourself
Yeah, now you're a threat
To your own tomorrow

All your words became...
All your words became...
All your words became...
Untruth!
