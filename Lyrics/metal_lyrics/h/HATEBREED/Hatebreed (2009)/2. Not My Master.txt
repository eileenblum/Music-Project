This day is worth living
This fight is worth fighting
This hope is worth hoping
What I walk away from is not my master

This day is worth living
This fight is worth fighting
This hope is worth hoping
What I walk away from is not my master

If it came down to life or death would you even make a choice
If it was tomorrow would you see the today you've destroyed
I feel like I've been here before so many painful times
But I know your crying for my help not of your own device

Denounce, denounce. Denounce their cure
It's worse than the disease
Denounce, Denounce. Denounce their cure
Deny their disbelief

Just keep telling yourself
This day is worth living
This fight is worth fighting
This hope is worth hoping
What I walk away from is not my master

Just keep telling yourself
This day is worth living
This fight is worth fighting
This hope is worth hoping
What I walk away from is not my master

You've left and claimed one more lie to live
With so many more fears to cower in
And ill spill your blood in the abyss of tears
Then spread my remains on the battlefield

Denounce, denounce. Denounce their cure
It's worse than the disease
Denounce, Denounce. Denounce their cure
Deny their disbelief

And I keep telling myself
I just keep telling myself
I just keep telling myself
What I walk away from is not my master

It's so true when they say
Sometimes you just gotta walk away
And never look back!

It's so true when they say
Sometimes you just gotta walk away
And never look back!
