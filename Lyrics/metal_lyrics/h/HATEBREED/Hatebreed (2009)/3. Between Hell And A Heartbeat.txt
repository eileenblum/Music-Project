Deformed living hemorrhage knotted into flesh
Betrayal lives within hosts
Anchored in bones
Surviving on secrets told

All screams are but whispers
In the realm of the barely living
Unraveled, in the arms that carried
If it's still worth loving it's still worth letting go

One last nail
In the coffin of all your trust
Where there once was love now lives total disgust

Somewhere between hell and a heartbeat [x2]

Sometimes the unforeseeable
Is what our lives become
And now matter how strong and spirited we are
Some hold the weight of the harm done

One last nail
In the coffin of all your trust
Where there once was love now lives total disgust

Deprived
Undreamed of
Somewhere between hell and a heartbeat

Grey skies rain down a hail of black
Put your ear to my chest and hear nothing
This is oblivion
Absence heard with clarity
Just hope it's all a dream
Stagnation of the all being
We cease to be
Somewhere between hell and a heartbeat
