Soldier on

Now it's all irrelevant
The journey here and what it meant
The time and distance
Others hate for my persistence
Every stride enlightens
It's all begins emerging
I've been here before
But veered from my path
I will get

Through, the trials
Through, the trenches
Through, the demons
The voice inside pushes me
Through, the trails
Through, the trenches
Through, The demons
The truth will soldier on
And it will surface
Something inside gets me
Through the thorns

Through, thoughts that kill me slowly
Time, times that test us all
Thorns, that pierce and cut us deeply
I soldier on and I get through
Through, thoughts that kill me slowly
Time, times that test us all
Thorns, that pierce and cut us deeply
The voices inside pushes me through

Only the true soldier on

Into oceans of hurt
Over mountains of grief
When it manifests
I got enough enough fight inside to get

Through, the trails
Through, the trenches
Through, the demons
The voice inside pushes me
Through, the trails
Through, the trenches
Through, the demons
The truth will soldier on and it will surface
And when it matters most
This will always get me...
Through the thorns!

Only the true
Only the true
Only the true
Only the true, will see this truth

Through! The! Thorns!
I soldier on and I get
Through! The! Thorns!
The voices inside pushes me through!
