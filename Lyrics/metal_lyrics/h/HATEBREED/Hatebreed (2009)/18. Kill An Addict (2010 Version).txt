You've made excuses
For the fucked up things
You've done but everyone's
Heard them before, your
Lying and stealing to feed
Your addictions won't be
Tolerated anymore. I tried
To help you but you spit in
My face, so now you're on
Your own I see your life
Slipping away, you brought
It on yourself... GO! Those
I've hated are the ones I've
Held so close, and those who
Use betrayal will be the
Ones to suffer, the ones to suffer the most
