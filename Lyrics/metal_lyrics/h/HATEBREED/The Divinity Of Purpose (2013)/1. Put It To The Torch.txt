Am I supposed to be sorry, my words struck a nerve
Am I supposed to be sorry that I lift dust where my footsteps once were
Maybe Iâm supposed to care for grand ideas never expressed
It took no heart, pierced through so clear
More verbal piss in the well of your fear
Hereâs your apology, hereâs to burning out
And hereâs to fading away
Fuck you both, I just put it to the torch

So with those new found ideals
Youâll be well on your way
And changing agendas is part of your game
Your sense of entitlement strengthens your pain
It shows on your twisted face
Wearing a drawn out shade
I take it all and I put it to the torch
I torch it all without a shred of remorse
Hereâs your apology, hereâs to burning out
And hereâs to fading away
Fuck you both, I just put it to the torch
Put it to the torch
And let it burn!
Oh torch it!
