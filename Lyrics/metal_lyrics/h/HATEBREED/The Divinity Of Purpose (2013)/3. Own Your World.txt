Who's got more heart than you?
No one [x4]

Of all the questions I've asked myself
This answer I must prove

You're just sliding painfully back
If you're not striving forward
Some think they know where your devotion ends
Let them swallow their words
Make your stand
Burn the bridge
Burn the bridge to the place where your fear lives
Make your stand
Burn the bridge
Burn every bridge to the places fear live

Fists up, head high!
We own the fucking world tonight
Fists up, head high!
One flame can light a million

Own your world
It's in your hands
Own your world
Strive to find the heart

They think the promises broken lift the blade to flesh
Light to hold back words that tear through they're all just
Spiritless
Make your stand
Burn the bridge
Burn the bridge to the place where your fear lives
Make your stand
Burn the bridge
Burn every bridge to the places fear live

Fists up, head high!
We own the fucking world tonight
Fists up, head high!
We own the fucking world tonight
Fists up, head high!
One flame can light a million

Some live by the limits set upon them
Others will commit
To the task of destroying them
Some will be defined by the past that haunts them
Other will commit to their will undaunted

Own your world
It's in your hands
Own your world
Strive to find the heart

Who's got more heart than you?
No one [x4]
Of all the questions I've asked myself
