I've grown colder
Than any other stone turned
Than any road crossed
On my way
I've grown colder
Than earth under foot
Than wind at my back
Now scabbed &amp; cracked
I've grown colder
Just like your father
And his father before
Through the endless storm
I've grown colder
Than I ever was, beyond my beliefs
Will this ever cease?

It's begun
Choose your hell
You are no exception
I don't want to be another dead man breathing

Cold, I've grown colder than I ever was before
Cold, now, all I see are dead men breathing

For those who once rejoiced
I've grown cold
for those who feared &amp; hated
I've grown cold
who can't escape their grief
I've grown cold
Don't want to be another dead man breathing

I've grown colder
Than the mercy of whose looking down
Upon the silent graves of all who once paid with sins
I've grown colder
Than all those who wasted trust
Opening the gates without acknowledging the cost

It's begun
Choose your hell
You are no exception
Hands cannot drown the sounds of better men screaming

It's begun
Live to tell
Don't deny the instinct
I don't want to be another dead man breathing

It's begun
Choose your hell
You are no exception
Hands cannot drown the sounds of better men screaming

Don't want to be another dead man breathing
I'll curse &amp; fight till my heart stops beating
Until my heart stops beating

It's begun
Choose your hell
You are no exception
Hands cannot drown the sounds of better men screaming

It's begun
Live to tell
Don't deny the instinct
I don't want to be another dead man breathing
