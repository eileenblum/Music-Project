Let's go

Standing here again as the words
Fail to hit the page
Towering in silence straining thoughs
To create
There's no safe words
There's no stasis
There's no fixing the broken places
I see just one more chance for redemption
A selfless child's dream of ascension

End the fight
Before the fight ends you
This could be the day
Things only fall in the hands we raise
End the fight
Before the fight ends you
Of all the lies I've told
This is the least untrue

All the pictures didn't change but the poeple in them did
Monuments don't always crumble
When the pillars have
Maybe the light is fading
As the tunnel closes in
But who are you to see this
As this journey just begins

Forgetting nothing
Forgiving so much less
The devil you thought you never knew
Is now the one that knows you the best
Now end the fight

End the fight
Before the fight ends you
This could be the day
Things only fall in the hands we raise
End the fight
Before the fight ends you
Of all the lies I've told
This is the least untrue

I try to forget yesterday
When I'm living through today
And I don't know what tomorrow brings
Or what it might take away

Forgetting nothing
Forgiving so much less
The devil you thought you never knew
Is now the one that you know the best
Now end the fight
