What becomes as red sight sees life
Lies and the mouths that birth them, sworn to abide
Cutting the lifeless pieces, rotted by time
Strangled by shadows in the coldest light

Nothing you say scares me anymore

Nothing,scars me
Nothing fucking scars me

Reminding acceptance
Of matters I'll never control
So save me your venom
Your time is served better
Saving what's left of your soul

You told me what was never said
You showed me who was hopellesly done wrong
Those visions came to pass
Those needles tears are gone

You'll never scar wha'ts inside
Now I'm the one who decides

Reminding acceptance
Of matters I'll never control
So save me your venom
Your time is served better
Saving what's left of your soul
Now revel in blindness
Digging &amp; digging yourself into another hole
Now heaven takes the pieces
You tried to hide them now this dies inside them

Nothing you say scars me anymore

Nothing, scars me
Nothing fucking scars me
Nothing you say scars me anymore
