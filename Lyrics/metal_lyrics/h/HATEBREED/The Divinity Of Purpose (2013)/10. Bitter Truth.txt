How many ways to languish
How many ways to fail
How many ways to die too soon
You can't choose one it chooses you

Some of the choices, we make
All along the way, can destroy us
The bitter truth cuts both ways

The stories written in our eyes
I'd rather suffer for the truth
Than prosper from a lie

How many ways to judge me
How many places to wash ashore
How many ways to feel nothing again
Another mistake i once thought was a friend

Some of the choices, we make
All along the way, can destroy us
The bitter truth cuts both ways

The stories written in our eyes
I'd rather suffer from the truth
Than prosper from a lie

Some of the choices, we make
All along the way, can destroy us

The bitter truth cuts both ways
