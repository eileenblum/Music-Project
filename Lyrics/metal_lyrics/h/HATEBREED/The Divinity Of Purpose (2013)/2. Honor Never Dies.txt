Sometimes standing for what you believe
Means standing alone
Sometimes standing for what you believe
Means standing alone

When the limelight grows dim
And our heroes fade away
Some men still fight silent battles until their final days
Some will be forgotten having no one know their names
But I stand here grateful for the courage that they gave

Chorus:
I am just a son
A brother, a father and a friend
No more, not any less
I am just another man still fighting
But I wouldnât be here if I wasnât taught that
Honor never dies

When your heart is questioned
There are hearts with hope still beating
Waiting for footsteps that might not come
Born with nothing just a weight to carry through life
And the journey they are on

Chorus:
I am just a son
A brother, a father and a friend
No more, not any less
I am just another man still fighting
But I wouldnât be here if I wasnât taught that
Honor never dies

When your heart is questioned
Honor never dies
When your beliefs are tested

Sometimes standing for what you believe
Means standing alone
Sometimes standing for what you believe
Means standing alone
Sometimes standing for what you believe
Means standing alone
Sometimes standing for what you believe
Means standing alone
Sometimes standing for what you believe
Means standing alone
Sometimes standing for what you believe
Means standing alone
