Unfinished,
Are the issues we wait until tomorrow to confront
Unpunished,
Are the deeds we do to gain us what we want
Intentions,
Have to be genuine so that it may be felt
Decisive,
We will be, once we clear the past from our present self

This bond
No force can sever
This time
Was never better
These words
Our generation
Let's scream the anthem for every nation

Let's scream, let's scream
Let's scream the anthem for every nation

Divided,
Is how they want us for their control
Becoming,
A threat to the freedoms that they stole

This bond
No force can sever
This time
Was never better
These words
Our generation
Let's scream the anthem for every nation
Indivisible

Profits over people
Propaganda over truth
Bias before balance
Our future will be the victim that they choose

Becoming
This bond, no force can sever
Decisive
This time, was never better
Determined
These words, our generation
Bruised &amp; Battered, let's scream, broke &amp; bleeding
Counted out but never beaten

Let's scream an anthem for every nation
Indivisible

Let's scream for every nation
Let's scream an anthem for every nation

Indivisible
