I've got a bullet for the shame
A toe tag for the spite
A body bag for the envy
A coffin for their guilt
Headstones in their place
A shovel tells the memories

So take this message how you want
Today it ends now I choose what you control

'Cause it's time, our time
Confront what you've always denied
And be boundless

It's time
Reach within and find
The nemesis inside
'Cause it's time to murder it

Oh le'ts go

I've got your epitaph written
Elegy to scream
A hole dug deep for the gluttony
Sever strings of doubt
No need for last rites
False prayers no one's hearing

So take this message how you want
Today it ends now i choose what you control
And I'm not sorry for your loss
As the coffin shuts on everything you know

'Cause it's time, our time
Confront what you deny 'cause it's time to be boundless

I want what it take to be boundless
I know what it is to be boundless
I can't let this nemesis survive
I must reach inside cause it's time

Time to fucking murder it

It's time [x3]
Confront what you always deny cause it's time to be boundless
