[bonus track]

Bound to violence
Gagged by pain
Drowned in self-regret
This grief is the sentence you face

Incomplete, you've lost your way
Struggling with rationale
In a world so cold and bleak
How could this be a place for you?

Bound to violence
Gagged by pain
Drowned in self-regret
This grief is the sentence you face

You're bound to violence
Bound, bound, bound to violence
Gagged, gagged, gagged by pain
Drowned, drowned in self-regret
And this grief
Bound to violence

Violence begets violence
Pain begets pain
Haunted by a dying hope
Subconsciously needing the agony

When will you face this?
Why do you run?
How will you ever heal
If you've lost the ability to feel?

Bound to violence
Gagged by pain
Drowned in self-regret
This grief is the sentence you face

You're bound to violence
Bound, bound, bound to violence
Gagged, gagged, gagged by pain
Drowned, drowned in self-regret
And this grief
