Give me something real
Give me back those years
Give me peace of mind
Give me something more
Strength, to deny you
Trust, in my instincts
Breathe, when I'm drowning
Life, when I'm lying dead
Hearts, mend with pieces
Dreams have been shattered
Love crucified, forgiveness denied
Strength, to deny you
Trust, in my instincts
Breathe, when I'm drowning
Life, when I'm lying dead
Hearts, mend with pieces
Dreams have been shattered
Love crucified, forgiveness denied
Give me something real
Give me back those years
Give me peace of mind
Give me something more
I confide in no one.
Strength, to deny you
Trust, in my instincts
Breathe, when I'm drowning
Life, when I'm lying dead
Hearts, mend with pieces
Dreams have been shattered
Love crucified, forgiveness denied
The betrayal, so hard for the victim to fathom.
Burn every word, every page, every letter.
Confide in no one
Confide in nothing.
No one, no one
Confide in no one.
No one.
Give me something real
Give me back those years
Give me peace of mind
Give me something more
