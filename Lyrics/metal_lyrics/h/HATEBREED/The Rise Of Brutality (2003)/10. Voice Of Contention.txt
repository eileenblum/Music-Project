If they said they knew the truth
They lied.
No one said my faith wouldn't be questioned.
Been driven to the brink.
Because the truth is too hard to accept
When you face your mortal enemy.
Who ever said, I needed you, lied
Who ever said, you knew the truth, lied.
Who ever thought they knew my faith, lied
And if they think they know now, they fucking lie.
They lie.
Where are all your answers now.
That you've been called out.
I kneel down and mourn for what we had.
I can't be there for you now.
Hear my voice of contention.
It's sad you made me this way.
Hear my voice of contention.
It's so hard to see this end.
Who ever said, I needed you, lied
Who ever said, you knew the truth, lied.
Who ever thought they knew my faith, lied
And if they think they know now, they fucking lie.
You think you know the truth
You lie.
Where are all your answers now.
That you've been called out.
I kneel down and mourn for what we had.
I can't be there for you now.
