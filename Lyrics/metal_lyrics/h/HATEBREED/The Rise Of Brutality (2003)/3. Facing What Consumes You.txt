Facing what consumes you is the only way to be free.
Released from those poisonous fears.
Resurrected once and for all.
You want me to hold my tongue
Then why the fuck am I here?
You want me to bottle my rage
Cause you never had the heart to say what I say.
My life, my body, my pride.
You have no opinion, no right.
I've built myself nothing like you.
My refusal is my way of life.
Doubt me, Hate me
You're the inspiration I need
My life, my body, my pride
You have no say
My life, my body, my pride
You don't have say
Facing what consumes you is the only way to be free.
Though I'm still far from perfection.
I stay relevant, I'm still vigilante.
I have so much more to say.
I have so much more to fight for.
I've used your lack of inspiration.
As my awakening, its my ability to live forever
By my own command.
To be vehement, remain confident.
Doubt me, Hate me
You're the inspiration I need
You're all the inspiration I need.
Your doubt, it fuels me.
Your hate, it drives me.
The challenge ignites me.
You make me fight harder.
