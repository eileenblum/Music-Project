In this very moment, agony exists
Unbeknownst to an unforgiving force.
Some pray, some beg, without consolation.
The pure lie beneath us while the scum walk the earth
Why can't we heal them
Why can't we see them
Can we keep hoping, no one knows for sure
Blamelessly renouncing, guilt has no bearing
I must believe that there is a better way.
Beholder of justice
Who have you abandoned
Beholder of justice
Why have you forgotten us
Why, why have you forgotten us
Why, why must the innocent die
If I could reverse this I swear I would
I would take the pain away, I swear to you.
Broken souls and misery it seems we're too far gone
Now we can only ask and wish for our complete redemption
Beholder of justice
Who have you abandoned
Beholder of justice
Why have you forgotten us
Why, does such innocence suffer
While the evil prospers
Why, beholder of justice
Why, have you forgotten us
How can I stand by your judgment
