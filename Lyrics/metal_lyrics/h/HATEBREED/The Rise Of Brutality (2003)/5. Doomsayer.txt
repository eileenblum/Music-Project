Your doom awaits you!!
Selfish ones who think this world revolves for them
Around their games and illusions.
They give nothing but their hands are always out to take.
I wish you misery now, desolation.
Cast down, defeated, never to rise.
Cast down, defeated, never to rise again
Wallow in your hypocrisy.
You want respect but you'll never earn it.
Condemned to your heresy.
You want respect but you'll never earn it.
Your life is a fantasy.
You want respect but you'll never earn it.
Now you live out your blasphemy
You want respect but you haven't done a thing to earn it.
I'll be your DOOMSAYER, motherfucker.
Your doom awaits you
Cast down, defeated, never to rise.
Cast down, defeated, never to rise again
Wallow in your hypocrisy.
You want respect but you'll never earn it.
Condemned to your heresy.
You want respect but you'll never earn it.
Your life is a fantasy.
You want respect but you'll never earn it.
Now you live out your blasphemy
You want respect but you haven't done shit to earn it.
Your doom awaits you.
