Let's go!
Live for this, Live, Live
Live for this
Live for this, Live, Live
If you don't live for something, You'll die for nothing.
Through the best and the worst
The struggle and sacrifice.
For the true who've remained and the new blood.
Motivation, undying allegiance
Striving through the hardships and affliction.
Every drop of blood
Every bitter tear
Every bead of sweat
I live for this
Live for this, Live, Live
Live for this
Live for this, Live, Live
If you don't live for something you'll die for nothing.
What we have are not possessions we own
It's not weighed by greed or personal gain
This is real a desire for freedom.
A place apart from a world in abandon.
Every drop of blood
Every bitter tear
Every bead of sweat
I live for this
Live for this, Live, Live
If you don't live for something you'll die for nothing.
I live for this.
Every drop of blood
Every bitter tear
Every bead of sweat
I live for this
