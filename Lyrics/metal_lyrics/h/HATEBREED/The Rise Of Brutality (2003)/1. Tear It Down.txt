How much more can you possibly take?
How many battles can you lose in one day?
Who is the source of all your pain
And how do you ever plan to be unrestrained?
How much longer? How much more?
Until you gain some self respect.
For once, just stand the fuck up and fight!
Confront and shatter everything that stands in your way.
Every burden every source of strife.
TEAR IT DOWN
Every cage every fucking vice.
TEAR IT DOWN
Distorted notions of who you are.
TEAR IT DOWN
Imposed values and beliefs.
TEAR IT DOWN
TEAR IT DOWN NOW
