The time has come to deny your ways.
To rid ourselves of the parasites.
Shedding dead weight, reclaiming what's ours.
Taking each moment with force again.
No crosses to bear, no time to be wasted.
A fearless approach to oppression.
A constant attack to never retreat from.
With no other choice but resistance,
What will it take
You must choose or be chosen for.
What will it take
Choose or chosen
Its all that we ask, for what we demand.
The decisions we make we will live by.
Proving your weakness.
Denouncing your claims
Your feeble attempts to demean us.
What more can you do, you're against the wall.
Your lies will be heard for the last time.
Say what you will it's only in vein.
This is the justice I fought to attain.
What will it take
You must choose or be chosen for.
What will it take
Choose or chosen
What will it take
You must choose or be chosen for.
What will it take
Choose or chosen
What will it take
Choose, choose
What will it take
Choose, choose
Choose or be chosen
