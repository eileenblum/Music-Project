I can't seem to fathom
how we live in this world 
of pain, under the knife see
our bodies grow frail, ravaged
by disease my heart grows weak,
and there's nothing to cure 
the pain or to heal my scars now.
I won't live my life under the
knife. If my fate's been chosen 
then I will exist, or should I put
the razor to my wrist, 
I'm alone is this fight, how will
I prove I'm right? I won't live 
my life under the knife.
