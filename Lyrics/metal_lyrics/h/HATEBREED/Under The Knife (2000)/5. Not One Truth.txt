Living as we rot, Showered with shadows of dreams devoured. Our souls
descend into endless seas of sin. There's no turning back. No repenting, no
remorse. Hate stricken creation. I realize in this world.
[chorus x2]
There is not one truth cast into stone.
Only lies cast into flames. It's time to
burn. Burn alive. Burn at the stake. Our eyes crystal clear, our bodies
frozen with fear, and there's nothing to save us now from endless suffering
and solitude. We've lost the chance to save this dying world. So we pay the
price, of which no one can afford. This is our last breath. The first in a
world of misery. There is nothing left. Only the lies in this world.
