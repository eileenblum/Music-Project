I won't celebrate your 
genocide and I won't consume
your lies, and you cannot 
deny how your selfish ways
kill and ruin innocent 
lives, people have been 
exploited, people have been 
killed, humanity has been raped 
and still I see no cure. I won't
consume your filth. Filth is what 
you know, filth is what you 
consume, filth is all you know,
I'm gonna take you out.
I can justify your suffering,
can you justify theirs?
You degrade and destroy 
life as we know it to profit 
at any cost. I won't consume! 
I won't take part! I cannot and 
I won't, I won't consume your filth!
