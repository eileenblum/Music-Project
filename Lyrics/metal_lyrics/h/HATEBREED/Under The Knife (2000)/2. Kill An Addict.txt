You've made excuses 
for the fucked up things 
you've done but everyone's
heard them before, your 
lying and stealing to feed
your addictions won't be
tolerated anymore. I tried 
to help you but you spit in 
my face, so now you're on
your own I see your life
slipping away, you brought 
it on yourself . . . GO! Those 
I've hated are the ones I've 
held so close, and those who 
use betrayal will be the 
ones to suffer, the ones to suffer
the most
