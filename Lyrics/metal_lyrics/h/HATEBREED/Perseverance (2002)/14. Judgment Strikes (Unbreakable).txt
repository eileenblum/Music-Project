Worthless, is what you made your life
Failure, is what you set yourself up for
You don't have the power
To realise your dreams
Now you want to take from me
Jealousy seethes through your callous words
So content you're visionless
Void of emotion
I pray for someone to release me from your grasp

It's evident, your guilt
It's evident, that this judgement strikes down on you

Unbreakable - and you're guilty
Unbreakable - I'm not going down without a fight

You try to break my world
You breached our trust to destroy me with lies
Now you've fallen you're nothing again
Live my hatred, its you I despise
Live my hate
