Those wounds have been revealed
Clawing through this wasteland
No emotion lives, suffocate on hope
Swallow your last rational thought
It tastes of every heart you've devoured
Your veins constrict, they are choking you
Wrapped in vanity, you're dying.
Unveiled by searing hatred
You gasp for life, you can't hold me now
I've let you go, bleed into obscurity
Clawing through this wasteland
No emotion lives, suffocate on hope
Swallow your last rational thought.
It tastes of every heart you've devoured
Your veins constrict
They are choking you
Wrapped in vanity, you're dying
