Your reign of terror is coming to an end
And all your victims' pain will be avenged
Taker of innocence, I want your demise
Tear you apart for the unspeakable things you tried to hide

I fucking hate you
Every bone in my body will ache
`Till I destroy everything you love
And fill your life with their pain

Ten long fucking years
I waited to erase all the memories
And you can't fucking stop me
My vengeance is finally born
Ten long fucking years
Your reign of terror is coming to an end
And I have no mercy for your soul
Your blood is on my hands

A call for blood
For what you've done
No tolerance (for what you've done)
A call for blood
For what you've done
No tolerance (for what you've done)

All their anguish, all their pain
All their nightmare, all their misery
It's all coming back to haunt you
Your time is up and you've no where to hide

(I fucking hate you...)

(Ten long fucking years...)

(A call for blood...)
No fucking tolerance.

Let the blood spill
Vengeance is born [x2]

A call for blood.
