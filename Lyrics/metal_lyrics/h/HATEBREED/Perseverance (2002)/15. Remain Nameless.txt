If there's one thing in this world that I must do
It will be, to prove you wrong

Make you take back the lies
And bring the truth to the surface
Clean my slate and erase
All the black you've
Tarnished my name with
This is conviction
Of what I have inside you will never possess
And because you never understood how I lived
You try to disrespect
Well I've paid my fucking dues
And everything I have
I've made from nothing
I've done this all on my own
That's more than you can say for yourself

You disrespect the way I live
You take apart what I say
You try to judge me
Now I'm judging you
You disrespect the way I live
You take apart what I say
You try to judge me
Now I'm judging you
This time I'm judging you

The harder you try and break me
The harder I push on

If there's one thing in this world that I must do
It will be, prove you wrong

You never believed in this
And you never would admit your fault
You've always had everything handed to you
But the wealth has finally run out
I knew from the beginning
You had no heart or soul
I've always seen through your lies
And I'll always hate you for what you are

You disrespect the way I live
You take apart what I say
You try to judge me
Now I'm judging you

You disrespect the way I live
You take apart what I say
You try to judge me
Now I'm judging you. [x2]
This time I'm Judging you.

The harder, you try to break me
The harder, I push on
