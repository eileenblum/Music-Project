You want to see me fail
You won't get your chance
You want to see me fail
You won't get your chance
You'll never get your chance

This is our lives
This is who we are
You can't put a price on it
It's strength within our hearts

From within our souls
Stood strong throughout the years
This runs through our veins
We stay true to ourselves

(You want to see me fail...)

Who are you to judge us
Who are you to condemn us
I have respect, honour and dedication
For my family and friends

From within our souls
Stood strong throughout the years
This runs through our veins
We stay true to ourselves

(You want to see me fail...)
This is thicker than blood
Its all we have

PROVEN
