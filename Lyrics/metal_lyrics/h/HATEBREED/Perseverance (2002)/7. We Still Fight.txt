Talk of the causes you support
Voice your misdirected views
You only comment on the things you don't have the power to change
Do you even think before you speak
Do you know what it is you condone?
Take a look at the world today
You've taken your freedom and safety for granted

How do you justify (you have no right)
The way you disgrace those who gave their lives
And how do you justify (you have no right)
The way you disrespect those whose loved ones died.

Everyday is a different crusade
You revolt from the safety of your fantasies
Privileged, you've never fought for a thing
You'd be the first to go if there was real anarchy
All your jargon makes me sick
You're the farthest thing from an activist
You've lost sight of what's important and real
You've taken your freedom and safety for granted

(How do you justify...)

Kill!

This is dedicated to all those who gave their lives to uphold their beliefs
Not to those who try to demean their sacrifices
You have no right.

For those who fought our rights and for those who gave their lives.
And for the families whose love ones died.
It's their honor for which we still fight.
