This is for the kids who have no where to turn
Who have nothing to live for
You think you haven't the will to persist
You have to search within yourself

All the work that you've done in vain
Been overlooked and taken for granted
Only you can end your suffering
You must be honest with yourself
You have nothing left to lose
You feel that everyone's out to get you
Been beaten down but the hate still breathes
Confined by consequences, it's your soul you must release

It's our struggles that define us
And the hardships we endure
Your spirit can't be broken now
You've come too far

All your life
You told yourself you were never alone
All your time
Spent on the problems that have no solution
In your mind
Giving up was never an option
Out of spite
Hold onto the hate that has helped you stay focused

You are one but you're never alone
You can't atone for every promise you've broken
In this moment there's no way you will fail
You must be honest with yourself
Use your pain to achieve your goals
Make amends while you can and stay focused
You can't be burdened by your lack of control
Never stray from the path you have chosen

(It's our struggles...)

(All your life...)

(This is for the kids...)

This spirit can't be broken [x3]
It's who you are

(It's our struggles...)

Forever
Forever
Forever convicted [x2]
