I hope I'm alive
To witness your demise
Make you feel my sorrow
Encompass all my pain
That I've felt for years
Dreading each dying day
Hanging by a thread
On the edge of my sanity

When I wake up the real nightmare begins

Will I make through my time in living hell?
Do I possess the strength to smash my fears into the ground?
I've tried to be strong
I've tried to overcome but I don't think I possess the strength to carry on
I'm torn between, and there's no right choice
I've gotta fight back
I won't be scarred for life.

Bring it up!
