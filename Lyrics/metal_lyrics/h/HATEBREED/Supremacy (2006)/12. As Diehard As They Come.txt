Some of us have had that fateful day
When harmony fades and life stands still
Those who were willing to sacrifice
Were blessed with the instinct to survive

This is for those who've escaped the torment
You know real courage

You are as diehard as they come

This is for those who never wavered
You are fearless

You are as diehard as they come
You are as diehard as they come
You are as diehard as they come
You are as diehard as they come
Never waiver, never falter- REMAIN DIEHARD

You are as diehard as they come
You are as diehard as they come
