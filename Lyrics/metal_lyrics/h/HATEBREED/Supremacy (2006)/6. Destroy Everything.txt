A new life begins
Destroy everything
Obliterate what makes us weak
Destroy everything
Decimate what threatens me

Cleanse this world with flame
End this, cleanse this
Rebuild and start again
Obliterate what makes us weak

End this and embrace the destruction
And this and embrace new life
NEW LIFE

Even an empty threat deserves a response you won't soon forget
I must destroy everything that tries to infect
Even an empty threat deserves a response you won't soon forget
I must destroy everything that tries to infect

Destroy everything
Obliterate what makes us weak
Destroy everything
Decimate what threatens me

Cleanse this world with flame
End this, cleanse this
Rebuild and start again
Obliterate what makes us weak

End this and embrace the destruction
And this and embrace new life
NEW LIFE

Even an empty threat deserves a response you won't soon forget
I must destroy everything that tries to infect
Even an empty threat deserves a response you won't soon forget
I must destroy everything that tries to infect

A new life begins
Destroy everything
Obliterate what makes us weak
Destroy everything
Decimate what threatens me
Destroy everything
So a new life can begin

Destroy everything
Rebuild and start again....again
