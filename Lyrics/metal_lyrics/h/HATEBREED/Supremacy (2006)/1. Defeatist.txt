Trapped within your own apathy
Spiraling into a cycle of loss
Beaten mind with a bruised reflection
It's addiction to failure of substances
That ties you to your selfish punishment
In you eyes it's cursed
No fix, no cure, tortured with imperfection
Your hatred is aimless
This is my hatred, this is my vow
Never to be broken
Erogenous
Cause you HATE yourself
And you HATE this world
And you HATE the fact
That you HATE every moment

Defeatist, you and I will never be the same!
I've taken this vow of hatred, TAKE THE VOW
A promise to myself to never be my own defeatist
This is my hatred, this is my vow
Never to be broken

Cause you HATE yourself
And you HATE this world
And you HATE the fact
That you HATE every moment

Defeatist, you and I will never be the same!

I take this vow
I take this vow of hatred
I take this vow, never to be broken
