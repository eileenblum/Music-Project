It's a wish for reprisal
The vengeance the divine has chosen
In the reflection of this anger
In this embodiment of all that is despised
They'll claim it's justified
They'll say it's divine judgment
With prayers and wishes to be granted
With destruction and murder behind their eyes
Pray tonight, pray
Beg the sky, beg
The angles they claim
May be sent to take our life
A wish for something more than death
A wish for paradise to open
Born now are new saviors
Sent to steal our breath

Pray tonight, pray
Beg the sky, beg
The angels they claim
May be sent to take your life.

Some claim its justified
Some say it's the judgment of the divine
How could it be the work the work of the divinity?
It's divine retribution
