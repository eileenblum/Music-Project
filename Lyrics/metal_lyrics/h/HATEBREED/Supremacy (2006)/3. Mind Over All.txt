When I was at my weakest
And I had given in
Some had counted me out
Some rejoiced in my failures
The few that believed
Gave me power and life
Gave me strength with their trust
Surrounding me with light

No limit to what can be achieved
MIND OVER ALL
Power that has yet to be seen
MIND OVER ALL
End the instability
Stare now into glory

It's within and it's growing
Their mark is not worn
It's purest devotion
It's the war of knowing
They are there for me
They are part of who I am
It's within me in spirit
And beside me in battle
No limit to what can be achieved
MIND OVER ALL
Power that has yet to be seen
MIND OVER ALL
End the instability
MIND OVER ALL
Stare now into glory
MIND OVER ALL
BECOME ENPOWERED
