Here lies another grudge another score never settled
For many who lead a life of resentment
Filled with foolish pride, that blinds them
Fighting the world but their own progress gets fought
Feeble minds, spit their venom at me
Reliving their grievances day in, day out
Living with all the same that their life has spit out

Alone and provoked
Your anger is deep and lasting
Shamed and enraged
Filled with righteous indignation

So believe what you may
Say what you will
I'll spit my venom in the eyes or your world

I'll spit my venom in the eyes of your world

Anonymity will not last
So mock and slander
With your empty threats
Identity unknown
Spineless coward, soon to be revealed,
Choose your conflicts
Try again and fail, expression of feat
From the lies you live
You stand to lose now, you always will
I am undeterred

Spit

Spitting Venom
