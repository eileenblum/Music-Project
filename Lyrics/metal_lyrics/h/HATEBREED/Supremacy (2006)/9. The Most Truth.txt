The pain is here to tell me that I'm still alive
The pain is here to tell me that I'm still alive
Alive to fight another day
Alive to reveal and turn the page

The pain is here to tell me that I'm still alive
The pain is here to tell me that I'm still alive

Alive to fight another day
Alive to reveal and turn the page
Alive, alive to reveal itself
Alive because the pain reveals the most truth

See the scars behind these eyes
The sting of daylight, the changing tide
Horizon haunt me no longer, the truth is born again into me

My pain as revealed the most truth
The pain tells me I'm still alive
To fight another day
The pain tells me I'm still alive
Reveal and turn the page
