SOME WARS MUST BE FOUGHT ALONE
Am I the only one standing in my way?
Am I my own merciless enemy?
Can I stare back looking deep into death's gaze
Can I turn and face myself and the knowledge of would shouldn't be?

To look into my heart was to look into hell
Controlled by the voice of fear I was completely overwhelmed
So concerned with the things I could never change
Now I must assure to never fulfill that prophecy

I must attain
Supremacy, of mind
Supremacy, of body
Supremacy, of spirit
Supremacy, of self

The war you want is the war I'm willing to give
Farewell to all the disbelief suspend in the depths

To look into my heart was to look into hell
Controlled by the voice of fear I was completely overwhelmed
So concerned with the things I could never change
Now I must assure to never fulfill that prophecy

I must attain
Supremacy, of mind
Supremacy, of body
Supremacy, of spirit
Supremacy, of self
