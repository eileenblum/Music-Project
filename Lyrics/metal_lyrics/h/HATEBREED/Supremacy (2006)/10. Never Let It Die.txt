The flame was almost extinguished
There's a will that had faded and escaped from me
Two years have passed and they wilted away
All that was left were memories of days I never lived

Now the fight is on, until there's nothing left
I'll fight like never before
The fight is on, until my final breath
I've never wanted anything more

I must never let it die

Bonds are strengthened when they've been tested
And mended when they've been torn
So give all of yourself that there is to give
Cause in life to have never risked is to have never lived
Now the fight is on, until there's nothing left
I'll fight like never before
The fight is on, until my final breath
I've never wanted anything more

I must never let it die

So resolve, reassure and push on without fear
Ignite the flame, because only you govern what tomorrow holds
It's inside us all waiting to be awoken
It's more than words describe
This is the spark, let it burn, make it build
It will never be denied

Because the fight is on, until there's nothing left
I'll fight like never before
The fight is on, until my final breath
I've never wanted anything more

I must never let it die
Will we let it die? NEVER
