When the conflict never ceases
And the enemies are immortal
Only their names and faces change
So a stance must always be held

Claw at my pride you facade tears away
Another day dies, I'm looking, I'm tasting
Attempt to break my stride, fall deeper, tread faster
Another cry ignored, the most desolation

If the conflict must last forever
So much our struggle for justice
In a state of faith denied
Is it any wonders where the answers lie?

Enemies never die
Conflict is unending
Chaos never ceases
Where does the solution lie?
