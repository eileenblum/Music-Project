Fire from within
Fire from below
Fire deep in me
Fire from the sky!

The Embers never died out
Subconscious slumber
Smoke from the deepest chasms
Now obscures the Light

From Longforgotten Realms
I now come forth-
Wielding my branding Iron
Behold my Wrath upon thee!

I put a mark upon your soul
The smell of burning emotions-
Never was so sweet before
Hatred is renewed!
