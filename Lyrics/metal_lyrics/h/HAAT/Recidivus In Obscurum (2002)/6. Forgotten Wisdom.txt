[originally by Burzum]

Out of the cracks
Comes forth a mist
Consuming human life at will
A malign intelligence
Seems to control it
With a Hunger to kill

Funeral Mist and Deathwish Spells
Are spreading 'cross the lands of man
No escape for their pitiful lives!
The warning signs neglected back then...

Forgotten Wisdom
Has created this Fog
A mist of Death and Destruction
Wisdom so ancient and arcane!
