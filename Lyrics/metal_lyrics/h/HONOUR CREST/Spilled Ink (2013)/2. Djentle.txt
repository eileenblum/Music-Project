I've been here for quite some time
It's so repetitive
I need something different
A change for good
Who needs rationality?
I need these dreams to turn to reality

There must be a way to escape from this place (to escape from this place)
Most of the time everything feels so fake to me

You wouldn't even notice if I walked away
When you can't even give me a reason to stay

I think it's time to escape
I think it's time to escape

And when you take control
No matter what, rely on yourself
I'd give anything to feel that way
To free myself, their hands are around my neck
Their hands are around my neck

Cut loose of their grip
Take in a deep breath
If anything it will get easier
Make a decision
Before this life feels like a prison

Did you ever have to make up your own mind?
For a sense of security
Carve out your own way
So you can leave that reckless life far behind
(Paving your own path)
Stay away, you will never get me (stay away)
Suddenly everything I do feels right
I'll take care of myself

I've wanted this for far to long
I never said that this would be easy
There is a process of moving forward
Don't waste this life and its meaning

I spend too much time with these thoughts in my head
(You're not alone) We're not alone
It's time to hide, somewhere you can't find me
These are my struggles, my pride, what defines me

Now I know this is my choice (my choice)
I have reasons of my own
To move on and make you proud
It's a shame because now I'm gone
Nothing you say will bring me back
I'm far gone (far gone)
With no light to guide my way

Did you ever have to make up your own mind?
For a sense of security
Carve out your own way so you can leave that reckless life far behind
(Paving your own path)
Stay away, you will never get me (stay away)
Suddenly everything I do feels right
I'll take care of myself

I'll take care of myself
I'll take care of myself (I'll take care of myself)
I'll take care of myself (I'll take care of myself)
You made me who I am
