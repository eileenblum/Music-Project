Where the future pours into the past by the pinch of now
There is a ticking, where the seconds fade away (fade away)

The sand in the hourglass will one day pour out
As if looking into a story
That was never mine to begin with

Will I ever be able to understand the weight on my shoulders?
A deathly silence from the other room
Amplified by the stillness
Where ghosts whose seconds tick away (tick away)
They tend to never leave

I was scared to see what I would be
If I looked in the mirror
But if the grip of time would just let me go
I will remember the person that I was meant to be

I watched the walls collapse
And let out all of their secrets
I never wanted to let you down
But I felt my morals slipping

As I left myself at the door, I never wanted to let you down
Disappointed (disappointed) at my hopes and expectations
Somehow I wanted more and now I stand (and now I stand)
Waving back at defeat as I stare in the face of victory
I know who I was meant to be

I was scared to see what I would be
If I looked in the mirror
But if the grip of time would just let me go
I will remember the person that I was meant to be

Now that I can see it's a whole new world (a whole new world)
It's hard to believe that it's been here before

There is a ticking where the seconds fade away
Regret nothing because those broken walls only make you who you are
You can always rebuild, rebuild, rebuild
You can always rebuild, rebuild, rebuild
You can always rebuild, rebuild, rebuild
Rebuild those broken walls
