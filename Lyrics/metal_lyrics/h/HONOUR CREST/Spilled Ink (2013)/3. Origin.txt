All that I did caused and set in motion
(Do I have time) Do I have time to make a difference?
Or are my choices set in stone
Awaiting the clockwork of seasons to take their place
And at the end of all stories, we will say...

I remember when all of this began so long ago
Your memory will live forever (with me) with me
No one is ever truly dead

Until the ripple they caused fades away
Until the clock they've wound winds down (winds down)
No one is ever truly dead
No one is ever truly dead

This was all just a story
A long tale overdue
This was all just a moment
Seize the day and make it yours
Before you're gone (before you're gone)
Before you're gone (before you're gone)

How I wish that I could say these words
But the answers are very clear
That in this amount of time on earth
All I can be
Is what I'm supposed to become
Who am I supposed to be?
You must find a way to prove you were here
You must prove you were even here

Take me back to that room, where nothing moved
That place I called a home (that place I called a home)
So long ago
I miss the sights
The sounds
The moments
God, I hope that place still exists
But I can't go back now

How I wish that I could say these words
But the answers are very clear
That in this amount of time on earth
All I can be
Is what I'm supposed to become
Who am I supposed to be?
You must find a way to prove you were here
You must prove you were even here

How I wish I could say these words
As I wake up
All I see is darkness
You can't escape this

With a life time that comes and goes (comes and goes)
This is the only life you'll ever know
This is the only life you'll ever know
So learn to live today before you're gone
So learn to live today before you're gone
