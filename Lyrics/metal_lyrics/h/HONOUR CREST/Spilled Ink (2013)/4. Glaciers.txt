I've lost the point of no return
And the gravity is going to hold us down

Fate has left us here
The journey we must take on our own
Where we go they cannot follow
And this guiding light will never go out
A faint melody is all I hear
This pathway should finally be clear

You're never far behind
But I push on
Falling victim to my own fears, my own hopes
You're never far behind
But I push on
Falling victim to my own fears, my own hopes

Let go
Let go of reality and become
Become the world that surrounds me
I am never awake, never awake
Merely alive in a collision of ideas
Let go
Let go of reality
I fear that no one sees the world like me
But that idea only brings me comfort
It feels better when I stand alone

In my sight is another world
Where the lives shared are barely visible
The facades of houses
Hold memories
I can't even fathom
The life I sacrificed

Let go
Let go of reality and become
Become the world that surrounds me
I am never awake, never awake
Merely alive in a collision of ideas
Let go
Let go of reality
I fear that no one sees the world like me
But that idea only brings me comfort
It feels better when I stand alone

And when the dust settles
Where will you stand?

I've lost the point of no return
I can't look back
I should be fine
I've had more chances than I deserved
Once in a lifetime has happened more than once

Distance shared between us
Has been extended over time and space
Stretching out beyond our grasp of who we are (who we are)
And what we have become
Letting go of reality
Letting go of reality
