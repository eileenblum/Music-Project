I can finally admit
That I want to leave it all behind
Caught up in all of these lines
I'll do what's best for me

I'm disappointed in the way that it ends
I want this story to restart
We need a new course
We need the winds to change (we need the winds to change)
To reach what we think we truly deserve
Our compass leads us to our new world

I can't take these waves on my own
I can't take this on my own
I will never let this go
What have I done that's made it hard for you to see what I have become?
These questions seem to have no answers
I can't take these waves on my own
I can't take this on my own
I will never let this go
What have I done that's made it hard for you to see what I have become?
These questions seem to have no answers

These questions remain the same
Guiding me to sleepless strain
Tell me what I cannot see
Whatcha say that you see in me
(You took) You took (the very) the very best of me (best of me)
These questions remain the same
Guiding me to sleepless strain
Tell me what you cannot see
What it is you see in me

I can't take these waves on my own
I can't take this on my own
I will never let this go
What have I done that's made it hard for you to see what I have become?
These questions seem to have no answers

I can't take these waves on my own
I can't take this on my own
I will never let this go
I can't take these waves on my own
I can't take this on my own
