You put your hands on me, through empty bottles you speak
I won't forgive you
Time after time you let me down
Just a child with high expectations

You won't break me
No matter the circumstance I will rise
You mistake me
For all the pain you bear alone

Why are you so afraid to finally let me in?
Try to find emotion for me
You're always there but it's never enough
I'll never be the same again
I'm a victim of ignorance
You preyed on me when I was sick
And now the time has come to play my part
The way it's supposed to be

I won't be like you
Never could I turn my back on you
I'll take my pride, of course what's left
And break free while I can escape

Another day goes by
I'm going insane
In time I'll find a way for things to change
I find it tiring to hold it inside (inside)
I will survive

Why are you so afraid to finally let me in?
Try to find emotion for me
You're always there but it's never enough
I'll never be the same again
I'm a victim of ignorance
You preyed on me when I was sick
And now the time has come to play my part
The way it's supposed to be

You look at me through your eyes
And see a child with high expectations
But all I really want is for you to love me true

Turn the pages, still things are the same
I take your place in this never-ending cycle
I want to show you the light
I wish you never had this life
As blood runs through each others' skin
I'm always there but somehow I'm never seen
How about I take the lead
And we can finally have some peace

I want to see, to hear, to feel
What's on your mind
Every day and every night
I will learn from the cracks in your branches
So I can mend mine, so I can mend mine
