Go!

In a world where no one knows your name
Waiting for times to change
Knowing that you're not alone
You fight to find

We all start out as strangers
We are all connected
We try to reach out, but there's no one ever there
You try to find the meaning
Screaming out
But no one ever hears

We all start out as strangers
We are all connected
Searching deep within ourselves
You try to find the meaning
Of being connected
To someone else

It's hard to realize
That you are never alone
You must be blind if you cannot see
We are all connected

I can't seem to find a way
With time against me in every single day
I can't escape
I can't seem to find a way (a way)
With time against me in every single day
I can't escape

I like to think
That you can never hide
But always run from me
I'm a strong believer
In making change
But I pray that I'll stay the same
I like to think
That you can never hide
Because I will find you
I'm a strong believer (I'm a strong believer)
In making change (making change)
But I pray that I will
Stay the same

One thing I've learned
You're never too far away
&gt;From which brings me closer to you
To the rest of the world
We're all connected
We're all connected
We're all connected
To the rest of the world (to the rest of the world)
