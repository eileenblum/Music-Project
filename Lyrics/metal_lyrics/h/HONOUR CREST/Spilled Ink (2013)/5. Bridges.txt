I had mastered fate or so I believed
Fate smiled and declared, "No one masters me"
There's no way to tell which direction I'm going (which direction I'm going)
Sand has a way of leaving footprints engraved
When they wash away
I'll leave a trail behind and I'll find my way

And I know,
And I know that you are scared
More so than I wish it was easier for you
You didn't plan on this
It's not like we could have seen this coming
But I promise one day that it will all be OK (seen this coming)
I won't give up on you if it's the last thing I do

Find meaning behind this life
All this talk of incomplete bridges
Don't be scared of the future
Because your past will catch up
And break apart the foundations you laid (foundations you laid)
Don't regret your goals (don't regret your goals)
Don't let these feelings subside

And I know,
And I know that you are scared
More so than I wish it was easier, easier for you
You didn't plan on this
(Easier for you)
It's not like we could have seen this coming
But I promise one day that it will all be okay (seen this coming)
I won't give up on you if it's the last thing I do (last thing I do)
I won't give up on you (I won't give up on you)

Heart and pride
I won't fall if you stand by my side (stand by my side)
I heard this all before
But no words have ever been so true
Our lives collapse into chaos (chaos, chaos)
But it keeps us feeling alive
Finding new meaning behind this life
