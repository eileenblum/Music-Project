You're just a part of my society
Ignorance is always swift to speak
(And while) And while you're watching from a distance
You're losing grip of reality

Too many voices
Trying to find a way to clear your mind
Until I break away
Are you the only one
Who sits and stares until things go your way
When everything falls apart?

I can't keep doing this
Everything you say
Bringing down my good name
It's time for you go
Now sit back and enjoy the ride
There's not much you can say to change my mind

You ought to know
You ought to know that you've gone to far
There's no way for you to take this back, it's time
To make things right (to make things right)

You're like the rest of them
Never satisfied
Pushing and pulling till you get what you want from me

Tell me, why you deserve a second chance?
Too many voices
Trying to find a way to clear your mind (until I break away)
Are you the only one

When everything falls apart?

You ought to know
You ought to know that you've gone to far
There's no way for you to take this back, it's time
To make things right (to make things right)

Look what you've done (look what you've done)
You've had such little faith in me
What have you done? (What have you done?)
I know what you are looking for

Was it everything that you thought that it would be?
Are those the words that you wanted to hear from me?
I can't remember the last time you were content with yourself
And honestly, I know what you're looking for
I have it all
You want it all
You can't keep expecting so much from me
This is what I've been trying to tell you
All right from the start

You ought to know
You ought to know that you've gone to far
There's no way for you to take this back, it's time
To make things right (to make things right)

You ought to know
That you have gone too far
You ought to know
It's time to make things right
