It's time for you to learn
What is right and wrong
It's getting harder to fall asleep
I'm in trouble
I'm in this way too deep

I used to think I was the one with problems
But in reality I'm the one with knowledge

No excuses, I did this by choice
I never thought I'd see the day (I'd see the day)
I'm at a breaking point
What has become of me?

Now looking back you'll see nothing's changed (nothing has changed)
While gone I stayed the same
Far away they tried to pretend
That they could make me their own

Once I'm back you'll see that nothing's changed (nothing's changed)
And while I'm gone I'll be the same

You can't see it but I'm the victim
You wouldn't even notice if I was there
I've been set up, destined for defeat
There's something missing that makes me feel complete

I hear a voice inside my head
It won't stop calling out my name
I'm the voice of your existence (existence)
Don't be afraid
I'll guide your way

Now looking back you'll see nothing's changed (nothing has changed)
While gone I stayed the same
Far away they tried to pretend
That they could make me their own

Once I'm back you'll see that I'm the same
And while I'm gone (I'm gone)
I'm never far away
I know the end of my vision (I'm never far away)
Meets your horizon
I'm never far away
