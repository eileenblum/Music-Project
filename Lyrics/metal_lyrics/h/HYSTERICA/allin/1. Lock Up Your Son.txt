I seek your eyes through the darkness
In the night when shall be conscious
I smell the tension of your presence
If you dare, please come a little closer
I teach you everything were knowing
I smile when your fear is showing
The time has come to take you over
I'm bring your soul forever and ever

Stop! Watch me now!
I will crack your world
Be true and stop pretending
Show me what you learn
Lock up your son
Lock up your son

Lose control, erase your limits
Release your mind and all your power
Attached to all my expectations
You find your image on the fury

Stop! Watch me now!
I will crack your world
Be true and stop pretending
Show me what you learn
Lock up your son
Lock up your son
