A tie and shoes, black leather dress
All you need to make a perfect mess
Saturday, the heat is on
Couple of drinks and we are gone

Then suddenly he changes mind
He's not my kind
Always the same, dead promises
No more of this!

My heart beats faster
And my sight turns red
All I wanna do is scream
I can't resist
Watch and see, he breaks out the devil in me

It's a devil in me
Full of sin
It's a devil in me
Look what my love can bring
It's a devil in me
Full of sin
Look what my love can bring

He thinks he's cool
Standing all alone
Stupid smile shaking out the room
Every girl nearby with a pretty face
Get a gleam of his charming eyes

Then suddenly he changes mind
He's not my kind
Always the same, dead promises
No more of this!

My heart beats faster
And my sight turns red
All I wanna do is scream
I can't resist
Watch and see, he breaks out devil in me

It's a devil in me
Full of sin
It's a devil in me
Look what my love can bring
It's a devil in me
Full of sin
Look what my love can bring
