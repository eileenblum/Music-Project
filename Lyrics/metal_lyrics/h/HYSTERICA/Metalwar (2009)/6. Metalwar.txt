The time has come
We gather here
To show them all that we are strong and refuse to fall
And on the battlefield
We're here to fight
Fight for the truth that we believe in our heart is right

Girls on toward
Here to break the law
Bring your sword
To the metalwar
Make some noise
You have no other choice
Raise your voice
For the metalwar

Now listen up
Obey my words
Tonight we gotta raise the force to break the spell
Fire's out
The wind and earth
Will help us get the victory that we deserve
