She took the train from utopia
Promising curves of euphoria
It seem the way she wants,
It seem the way she talks

Heart's beating faster every time
She puts you at the end of the line
There's no use to retire
You know she's a destroyer

She teases you and bleeds your heart
Just to rip it out again

The bitch is back, she's back
The bitch is back

The earth is crushed by her feet
The wind decreased by her heat
Don't let her play with your soul
You'll end up known like a fool

Seek and destroy are her calls
A plea to heaven she falls
A penus digging your grave
You'll be forever her slave

She teases you and bleeds your heart
Just to rip it out again

The bitch is back, she's back
The bitch is back
She's back to rule the world

One look at her is all you need
Now get down on your knees and bleed
One look at her is all you need
You'll get down on your knees and bleed

The bitch is back, she's back
The bitch is back
She's back to rule the world
She's back
The bitch is here to rule all of you
Watch out, the bitch is back
