Hey you, the heat is getting on
Sunrise above this broken shades
Tell me why you wash your dirty hands
Enemies on promised land has gone from fame

Soon you'll discover
The earth will never recover
It's swallowing the future,
The darkness for the generation to come

I know you'll see
It's the death of humanity
I know you'll see
It's a wreck of society

The blame, the sky is crying dust
We prepare to rust, where's the sense of shame
We will need ro regain the land
But you will soon be damned by your fanatic creed

Soon you'll discover
The earth will never recover
It's swallowing the future,
The darkness for the generation to come

I know you'll see
It's the death of humanity
I know you'll see
It's a wreck of society
