The lights around turn the rain that stopped
There is an echo in my crypt
You are so welcome even though you look strange
Just be quiet listen to my breath

You are so cold
You are so still
I love you
I promise I will

(Who) Digs you up when you're down
(Who) Makes your head spin around
(Who) Even loves you when you're dead and cold
(Who) It's your part in the place
(Who) Heavy smile on your face
(Who) Cares about you when you feeling down
We Are The Undertakers

What we have it's a love affair
You can give me any more than a week
I'll be with you every minute of love
I gotta have you one more time

You are so cold
You are so still
I love you
I promise I will

(Who) Digs you up when you're down
(Who) Makes your head spin around
(Who) Even loves you when you're dead and cold
(Who) It's your part in the place
(Who) Heavy smile on your face
(Who) Cares about you when you feeling down
We Are The Undertakers

Who? I said who?
Who? Will always love you?
