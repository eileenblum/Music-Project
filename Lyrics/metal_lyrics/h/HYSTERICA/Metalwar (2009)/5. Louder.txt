If you're seeking after gold
Take your guitar and play it loud
If you wanna be a rocking star
You need to show us who you are

Make your amplifier gleam
Hit the stage and start to scream

Stab and shout louder
Stab and shout louder
Stab and shout louder
Stab and shout louder

If you're losing all your faith
We will show ya a higher state
We're approaching the final goal
Are you ready to lose control

Bang your head, stand with the band
Join the heavy metal land

Stab and shout louder
Stab and shout louder
Stab and shout louder
Stab and shout louder
