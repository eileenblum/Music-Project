Hey look to us all
You come to see the show
Raise your hands in the air
Fire in the hole
The amp start to roar
For men enjoy this god forsaken bar

We are the girls made of heavy metal
We gotta pursuit to rock
We are the girls made of heavy metal
We gotta rock you to the top

Don't try to pull us down
We here to raise some hell
What happens next
The story doesn't tell
Everyone I ask
Will make a scream
We play so fucking loud
Your ears start to bleed
