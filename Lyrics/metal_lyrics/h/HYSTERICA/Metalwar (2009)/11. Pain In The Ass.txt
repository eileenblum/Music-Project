In my dreams I see your face
It's just a messed up picture and letter in lace
You have your lights of fame
Disaster
You only have yourself to blame

Take a hike with mister rabbit
Take it fake it

You're a pain in the ass
Get out of my way
A pain in the ass
Surrender and go pain
Just get the hell out of here

Just a loser, not too worth my time
Even your existence is a crime
Around the highway to hell
Faster
Now and forever you're under my spell

Take a hike with mister rabbit
Take it fake it

You're a pain in the ass
Get out of my way
A pain in the ass
Surrender and go pain
Just get the hell out of here

In my dreams I still see your face
It's just a messed up picture and letter in lace
You have your lights of fame
Disaster
You only have yourself to blame
