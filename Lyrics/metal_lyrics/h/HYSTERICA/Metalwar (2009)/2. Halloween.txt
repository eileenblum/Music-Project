She wakes up in the graveyard
Wipe the dirt of a face
This is the time for her to wake

Her body is in agony
Her soul is in pain
She looks for her beauty
Lost in vain

Halloween
Midnight queen
Searching for love where it's never have been
Halloween
Killing me
For man that hold me and love 'till we die

She's not into witchcraft
It's not making sense
Why must she live her life again
She rise herself from the earth
And fall back again
In her chest where her heart is dressed up in pain
