You're fighting
With the demons in your head
The lightning
A candle next to your bed
You're screaming
In your nightmare that feels so true
Begging
Who can tell you what to do

Hey hey listen to me
It's in your system, it's time to be free
Hey hey it's time to obey
You're losing control
It's time to pay
Where is the priest?
Bless the beast

Searching
For a lead that conform your soul
Crawling
And hoping reach your goal
You're burning
You're burning up in flames
You're bleeding
And your conscious sister blame
