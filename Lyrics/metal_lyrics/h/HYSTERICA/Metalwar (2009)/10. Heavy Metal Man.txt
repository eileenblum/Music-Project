He pays his bills at the right time
And he never cross the line
And he wonder why the hell
He's such a bore

He thinks you're stupid and you're fat
He's a pain little prat
He says you dress too much like a whore

You say damn
I wanna heavy metal man
You say damn
I wanna heavy metal man

A man who rocks your world
When you're all alone
Like the perfect taste
Come heaven and hell
If he's got long long hair
And tattooes everywhere
You can be sure
He's a heavy metal man
Metal man, metal man

He pimps his ride like it's LA
And you wonder if he's gay
'Cause he's got problems with this macho attitude

You are a sweet little doll
And if you talk
He lose control
You should be quiet
And please his every move

You say damn
I wanna heavy metal man
You say damn
I wanna heavy metal man

A man who rocks your world
When you're all alone
Like the perfect taste
Come heaven and hell
If he's got long long hair
And tattoes everywhere
You can be sure
He's a heavy metal man
Metal man, metal man

Damn
I want a heavy metal man
All the girls say damn
We want a heavy metal man
Everybody damn
We want a heavy metal man
All the boys say damn
I am your heavy metal man
