Ten years of pain 
And anguish in vain 
Came to an end 
A cold winter night 
One blow to his head 
An act of despair 
I feel no remorse 
I did what was right 

Locked in this cell 
My own personal version of hell 
One day I'll break free 
Don't know how 
Don't know where 
Don't know when 
I'm writing my tale 
At a point where I just cannot fail 
This is my fate 
I will fight 
'Til my very 
Last breath 

Through echoing halls 
Destiny calls 
I'm breaking the walls 

Within these walls 
Memories haunt me 
The sound of his voice 
Still lingers here 
Going back to move forward 
The only way out 
I look in the mirror 
There's wounds that won't heal 

[Chorus]
