We stand united on a mission here tonight 
It's all about you, All about 
A world of hope 
Immortal, unbreakable 
Together we're strong 

Feel the beating of your heart 
You were born to be state of the art 
Sky is the limit if you choose to believe it 
Take a chance 
You are 

Fighters of the century 
Open your hearts 
Scream for me 
Fighters of the century 
Open your hearts scream for me 
A sign of hope 
One last show 
Everybody's living the dream 

The greatest thing you'll ever learn 
Is just to love and be loved in return 
So live it up all you warriors of rock 
Keep the faith 
You are 

[Chorus]
