I see a bright eye in front of me
The world is burning around me
A path of sins, a lonely cell
I'm on my way to the gates of hell
God's warning me; back away!
But I know now this is where I belong
I close my eyes and see the end
I raise my hand

With the force of metal
And the power of steel
With the force of metal
All the strength that I need

There is no giving up in life
You wanna beat me throw the dice
I see the sadness in your eyes
Did you find love in paradise?
Fame beauty and therapy
You grew fat on fantasies
Admit your crime, take a stand!
And raise your hand

With the force of metal
And the power of steel
With the force of metal
All the strength that I need

Perfect stanger
Time is everything but I'm still waiting
Pay the price
Miss perfectionist
A crash course in love
A leap of faith
Leave the past behind
Make up your mind
Follow me
Reclaim your life
Take control

With the force of metal
And the power of steel
With the force of metal
All the strength that I need
