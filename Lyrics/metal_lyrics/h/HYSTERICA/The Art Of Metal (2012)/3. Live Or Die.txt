Alone
So far away from home
No turning back
I've lost the track

I fear the screams
These endless dreams
Won't close my eyes
I look to the skies

Where will I be tomorrow

Live or die
Live or die
Live or die
Live or die
Nobody's gonna win this war

The countless tears
The wasted years
Been hurt before
Down to my core

My soul is drained
I hide the pain
But the scars
And the memories remain
