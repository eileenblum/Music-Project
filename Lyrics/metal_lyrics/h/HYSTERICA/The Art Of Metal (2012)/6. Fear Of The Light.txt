Crash! Another burn
Fuck! I never learn
Need instant attraction
Crave satisfaction
Grow my ego
Feed my libido

Fear of the light
Sheltered by night
All the rules are overthrown
Fear of the light
At the break of dawn I stand alone
Unmasked and exposed
For all the world to see
Fear of the light

Raw I want it all
Strong I rose and fall
Take for my own delight
Stay all through the night
Lost nowhere to turn
Why crash and burn?

Fear of the light
Sheltered by night
All the rules are overthrown
Fear of the light
At the break of dawn I stand alone
Unmasked and exposed
For all the world to see
Fear of the light

A hideaway, a haven
I'm safe
Say you'll stay
Hold me close

Fear of the light
Sheltered by night
All the rules are overthrown
Fear of the light
At the break of dawn I stand alone
Unmasked and exposed
For all the world to see
Fear of the light
