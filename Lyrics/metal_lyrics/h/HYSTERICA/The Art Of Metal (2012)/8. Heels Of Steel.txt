Tonight is the night
I've had it I'm out
Tonight
Your lies and deceit
Won't hurt me no more
Tonight I will stand up and fight

I'll crush you like a peanut
I'll crush you between my thighs of doom

I'm gonna make you feel
My heels of steel
Get down on the ground and kneel
Kiss my heels of steel

No pleading for mercy
Will help you this time
Beware
There is no relief
In your charm or your eyes
Beware it's time to say your prayers

I'll crush you like a peanut
I'll crush you between my thighs of doom

I'm gonna make you feel
My heels of steel
Get down on the ground and kneel
Kiss my heels of steel
