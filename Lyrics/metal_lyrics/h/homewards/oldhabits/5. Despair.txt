Every breath could be the last
Leaning back against the wall
He could need another jacket the breeze is piercing through
Blowing in his hands is not gonna stop the chill
With holes in his shoes and holes in his jeans
All he wants is to last another night
Every breath takes you closer to death
When you're all alone in the streets of loneliness
Constantly falling to the bottom of your despair
With no one there to care
One step closer to death
Every breath takes you closer to death
When you're all alone in the streets of loneliness
Laying your head down the freezing ground
Empty stomach left, sinister sideway
No turning back
Constantly falling to the bottom of your despair
Constantly
Will this ever take a turn or will we be standing and watch all burn
