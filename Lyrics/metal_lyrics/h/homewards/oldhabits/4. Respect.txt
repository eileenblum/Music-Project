I have enough of all that bullshit, these people telling me shit
Day after day won't stop making promises they cannot keep
You're not a man try ask me why, telling me lies and wasting my time
You're a disgrace without any pride
Fake fucks like you we hang in our town
This is my brotherhood we're never going down
Say what you say no one gives a fuck
Can't hit us with this shit you got so give it up
Give it up give it up give it up
This is my brotherhood we're never going down
We dive into the fog all colours fading out
Keep going on with broken dreams bound to our back
We carrion
You speak this words with no meaning trying to shut us down
But what is the meaning of breathing if you are not truly alive
You'll get no honour, you'll get no respect
Only hate is what you get
No matter how tough our path may seem we won't go astray
Still going on with broken dreams bound to our back
This is my brotherhood we're never going down
Say what you say no one gives a fuck
Can't hit us with this shit you got so give it up
Give it up give it up give it up
This is my brotherhood we're never going down
We dive into the fog all colours fading out
Keep going on with broken dreams bound to our back
We carrion
No honour, no respect
Only hate is what you get
We'll carrion
No honour, no respect
Only hate is what you get
No honour, no respect
Only hate is what you get
