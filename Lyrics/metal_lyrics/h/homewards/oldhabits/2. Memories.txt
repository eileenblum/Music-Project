I can't shake off this feeling there's so much more to say
I lost a part of me
Closed doors inside my head
Locked up key thrown away
Hidden paths behind stone walls
End of road, no sign ahead
Every wrong move could be my last
Weight tied around my neck, it's tearing down my head
I keep searching for my memories
I'm running blind
I hear this voice inside my head
There seems no end in sight
My legs are tired,
I won't give in
I got nothing to lose
I won't crawl back
Life on a short fuse
Dragged in an endless abyss we got lost in the dark
Searching for those memories that left us torn apart
Running blind
I'm running blind
I keep searching for my memories
I'm running blind
I hear this voice inside my head
There seems no end in sight
My legs are tired,
I won't give in
I got nothing to lose
I won't crawl back
Life on a short fuse
Empty glass, clouded mind
No sense of direction
Broken bridge,
I lost my track
Hell can
I make it back
