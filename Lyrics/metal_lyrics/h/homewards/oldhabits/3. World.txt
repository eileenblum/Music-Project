We are the youth that's been cursed born into a rotten world
Standing on the edge of nothing
Left with a broken compass
We were raised to believe the end is near
That all is lost, we can't escape
We have no chance to choose our future
We are the youth that's been cursed born into a rotten world
Standing on the edge of nothing
Left with a broken compass
There is not much left to choose
I start to ask myself, what will we leave behind
For generations to come, what's left of all our pride
We are the youth that's been cursed born into a rotten world
Standing on the edge of nothing
Left with a broken compass
There is not much left to choose
Burnt down
Intoxicated
Contaminated
Planet earth
Extinct races
Trapped in cages
Wiped out tribes
Greed homicide
I start to ask myself, what will we leave behind
For generations to come, what's left of all our pride
'Cause we are the youth that's been cursed born into a rotten world
Standing on the edge of nothing
Left with a broken compass
There is not much left to choose
Is there anymore we have to sacrifice,
Just to realize there's almost nothing left
