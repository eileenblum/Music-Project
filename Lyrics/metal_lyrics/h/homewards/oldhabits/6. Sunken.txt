Left without any decency you misled friends and foes
Sympathy as an excuse
Pretended grief, expiring fraud
Your broken morals and wasted virtues
What's left to flaunt yourself
You have to remember your roots
This place in your heart you've long departed
Remember your home
Remember where you anchored your heart
Bad blood spread through your veins
But
I won't neither forgive nor forget your face
Your rancour hidden by a mask despair consumes your soul
Corruption is your only friend and greed will kill you in the end
We're all born into this world, like a seed sown in a gardens bed
Taking root and growing fast, sometimes we spread far away
Every plant knows its beginning where it anchored itself down
But if you uproot this anchor the plant will eventually die out
You have to remember your roots
This place in your heart you've long departed
Remember your home
Remember where you anchored your heart
Left without any decency you misled friends and foes
Sympathy as an excuse
Pretended grief, expiring fraud
Your broken morals and wasted virtues
What's left to flaunt yourself
You've wasted your whole life
Nothing can cover up this lies
Nothing can cover up this lies
You have to remember your roots
This place in your heart you've long departed
Remember your home
Remember where you anchored your heart
