Capitalism pigs deprive us of our freedom
Trapped in a cage, we lost ourselves
Still as we fight to preserve what we hold dear
We know no fear
Limitless imagination yet we don't know
How to set ourselves free
We struggle to escape our own prison
And finish what we've started
Remember your roots where we all started
This place in our heart we've once departed
Remember your roots with home in our heart
Life won't be hopeless
Wrapped up in insecurities, torn from our past
We forgot our priorities, we lost our trail
Forgot our priorities
Remember your roots where we all started
This place in our heart we've once departed
Remember your roots with home in our heart
Life won't be hopeless
Recall your home, you know what this stands for
Recall your home, you know what this stands for
Remember your home where your story began
Remember your home where you anchored your heart
