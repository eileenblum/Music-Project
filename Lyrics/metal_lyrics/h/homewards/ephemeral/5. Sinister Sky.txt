I'm not in control
This life is passing me by
I'm not in control
I closed one door and
I lost sight
I'm not in control
This life is passing me by
I'm not in control
My world is crumbling from the inside
We all know the first step you ever take
Slowly starts your journey into the unknown
Every day changing, in constant motion
Makes it hard to find shelter.
Yet after a while insecurity begins to darken the sky
I always believed to be so flawless
So much that
I lost sight
Alas, making my actions feel so uncontrolled
I'm not in control
This life is passing me by
I'm not in control
I closed one door and
I lost sight
I'm not in control
This life is passing me by
I'm not in control
My world is crumbling from the inside
After all this time, the only thing
I know for sure
Is that no matter what choice
I make
There's still one promise that
I can't break
I can see the light shining from the top of the mountain down on me
Down on me
Down on me
