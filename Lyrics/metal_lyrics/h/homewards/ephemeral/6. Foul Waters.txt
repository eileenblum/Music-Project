I remember the days when we grew up in our hometown
I was always there to help you up when you fell down
We would laugh and drink into the night
And meet disaster the next day
Now that
I need you the most
You're gone up in smoke, nowhere to be found
I've put my trust in you and you've let me down
You've let me drown
We used to say we'll go down swinging
I got your back brother
Fighting side by side
'Til the end of days
With a smile on our face
We used to say we'll go down swinging
I got your back brother
Fighting side by side
'Til the end of days
But your face has changed
You're gone astray
I can still see your face
I can still hear you say
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
You're gone astray
I've put my trust in you and you've let me down
You've let me drown
