A cloud of darkness moving in
Shadows all, remove my skin
Drain my corpse, cut away the flesh
I'm a mere hollow shell burnt down to ash
I always wanted to move mountains
Instead I closed the curtains
I guess it must've been the burden
That kept me down under
All life in a slumber
It makes me wonder
Am I the hunter
Or am I being hunted
Is this the last
I will see from hell
Farewell they've rang my bell
It's time to leave this rotten world
Nothing left to feel the hurt
Forever is a lie
We live alone and that's how we die
No second chance, there's no blue pill
There ain't anymore blood to spill
Dead end,
I'm going nowhere
I'm stuck in my own despair
The hole I dug myself in
Good or bad, the line is thin
Will I find my true self or just give in
Is this the last
I will see from hell
Farewell they've rang my bell
It's time to leave this rotten world
Nothing left to feel the hurt
Stranded deep,
I've sunk my ship
A last minute one way trip
I was right, life is infernal
Only death is eternal
