Your time is now
I wake up every day with regret in my heart
All these times that
I chose wrong
I don't know where
I belong
I barely got some free space
To keep my mind in place
Fear whispers me there's no way to win this race
Life shines every day but you're living in constant darkness
You keep running around but you fail to cherish the moment
Desperate, fearful, insecure, your social angst keeps you on edge
If you can't stop this fight, you'll slowly perish inside
Your time is fading out
You perish inside
You perish inside
You won't win this fight
Breathe life, let shine
Breathe life, let shine
Your time is now
