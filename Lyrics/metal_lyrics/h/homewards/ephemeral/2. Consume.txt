Hell is home
And home is hell
But we're still doing well
Hiding in our empty shell
Underneath of what our eyes can perceive
Lies nothing more than what we already see
A world in flames, glowing ever so brightly
Can you feel it burn to cinder
I've stumbled upon scorched earth
My demons may have found me
Resurrect the earth
Let it rise from the ashes
Resurrect
Hell is home
And home is hell
But we're still doing well
Hiding in our empty shell
We are the scavengers of earth
Relentless we take everything
Nothing is safe from our evil hands
Reckless we take everything
We disroot all of nature's treasures
From the garden we once thrived up from
To the grave in which we'll find our end
Your blatant lies won't stand
When all hell comes crashing down again
Hell is home
Home is hell
Resurrect
Let it rise
