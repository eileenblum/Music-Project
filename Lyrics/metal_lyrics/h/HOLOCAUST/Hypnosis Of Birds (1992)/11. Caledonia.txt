Wake up to a brilliant dawn
Cold air in my mouth
And the day reveals to me once more
Earthly paradise

And the spirits fly
In the morning sun
High above the fields of Caledonia

And the river sings to me
Timeless mountain songs
Of a race who held the energy of Earth
In their silent minds

And my spirit glides
By the ancient cairns
I would commune with Caledonia

So let the standing stones
Circle me once more

I will dream of Alba's ghost
In her womb I am
And bleeding from the source, the sound of souls
Lingers ever on

Jewel of Albion
You will ever be
I belong to you, my Caledonia


Thanks to n-k-v-d for sending track #1 lyrics.
