We cross the Rubicon at birth
The point of no return no return - has come and gone
(Goodbye)
Remote and so alone so alone
The fear of evermore of mortal immortality
No degree of trance will regain the liberty of the void
I heard you in my deep sleep
There is no sleep so deep I would not hear you there
And now hear the fool...
She is a curious light on the horizon a focus for future dreams
She will meet all of my failure with a soothing kiss... 
Too much, too much space for folly, for nonsense,
This gigantic naivety ruled me.
Chorus at dawn
Find it all gone
In spite of all that s said and done, the complications run
It all makes simple sense in the end,
We all need to hold and need to be held.
