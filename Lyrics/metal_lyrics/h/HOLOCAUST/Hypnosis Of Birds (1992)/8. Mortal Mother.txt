We are so small here on our planet home
A planet which in the fullness of time will be a solar vapor

Not ours to see
Millions of years
A hidden time
The sun was red
The earth engulfed
In our mortal mother

The solar furnace will burn on
When hydrogen is gone until a final moment

Then somewhere new
In space and time
A star is born
Will there be eyes
Will there be minds
There to receive it
