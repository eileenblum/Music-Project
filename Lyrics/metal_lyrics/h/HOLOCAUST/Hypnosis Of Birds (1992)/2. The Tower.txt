Volcano under me and moonlight's on my hands
Great wheel within my heart is grinding
Insidious, the yeast of bitterness
The dust of eons on the floors of empty halls
The sense of ashes under Earth
A life in conflagration old beneath the sun
The resurrection of the only son of God
Undone, the centuries of crime
The sure foundation and the mockery of time

Grand Lucifer, the deceiver of souls
Shining star
How great the fall taster of all mankind
Accuser Satan
Torn is the veil and the prince of this world
Defeated

The king of swords, the queen of pentacles
The queen of wands, the page of cups
The knight of cups, the king of wands
Two lost
One required
One desired
The knight of wands, the king of cups
The queen of swords, the knight of pentacles
The page of wands, the page of swords

(Rejection, rejection)
Crave the lovers
Crave the chariot
Crave the queen of cups
Crave the knight of swords
Chance the devil
Crave the judgement
Crave the tower
