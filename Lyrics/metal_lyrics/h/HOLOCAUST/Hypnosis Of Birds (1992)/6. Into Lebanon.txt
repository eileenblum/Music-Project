devil come under summer skies
holding bible holding koran

Iran Israel Jordan Syria surround her become her
Iran Israel Jordan Syria I hold you all before god
devil come under summer skies
holding bible holding koran
these are the days of turning tides
these are the days that bring the evil
and the dark affairs of men
Into Lebanon

crisis come hostages await
unknown terrors in the shadows
these are the days of turning tides
these are the days that bring the evil
and the dark affairs of men
Into Lebanon

kiss the sun hold it to your heart
taste the blood that will drown you
these are the days of turning tides
these are the days that bring the evil
and the dark affairs of men
Into Lebanon

see how the mighty are broken
see how they fall
