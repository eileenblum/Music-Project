Out across the quiet earth
Run the corridors of power
Ancient spirits
Left a legacy here
Vast vibrations rise
From God's land and water

Psychic heroes of a long forgotten age
Reach back from the haunted places
Touch me â touch me
With the sound of hail on stone

And the daughters of the deep will call again
To the never failing rains
And they will bring new life
And the children of the rain will bless the sun
As he climbs up in the sky
Higher every day

As the centuries roll by
Will we lose the gift forever?
Blessed are they
Who commune with days gone by

And the dreams of many searching hearts
Will be crystallized in sleep
Never to come true
But the children of the night will bless the moon
As she waves at wanes and is reborn
Empress of the void

She was then as now
