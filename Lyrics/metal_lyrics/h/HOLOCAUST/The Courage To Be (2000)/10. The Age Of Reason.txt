Autonomy 

Break free from Theonomy,
The old Heteronomy,
Embrace the paradigm shift. 

Welcome to the age of reason,
Welcome to the new high treason,
The Age of reason.

Into the labyrinth...

'There is never anyone but me,
but I seem to hear a voice asking about 
the foundations here'.

Here is a man who knows his way around
The labyrinth of reason,
Beyond the walls he's on the road,
A very lonely road of freedom
Leading to another labyrinth. 

The more unique you make yourself
The colder grows the universe.

For that and that,
A centered self is a miracle.
