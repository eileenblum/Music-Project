I will never live again in the waking world, 
I pacify the mind of the Broken One,
You all got me wrong...
You don't understand,
He would never call me by that name.

Neurosis.

D'you know,
There is a man he thinks he is...
'Lover of the real',
Never satisfied with what I say,
I wish he would die,
If I had a head I'd shake it in disgust.

Neurosis.

Unclean spirit...
There was a time
The called me a minion of Beelzebub, 
So what ya gonna do?

I seem to spend most of my time
Behind your enemy lines,
Well that's fine...'cause I'm here to fight.
Who is the enemy within?

Neurosis.

I will never be who I want to be,
But that's OK.
I've never never known him anyhow.

You don't know one hell of a lot, son,
Do ya?
