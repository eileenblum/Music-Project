Supreme authority, but me no buts.
Clear and deliberate, banish all doubt.

The courage to be, for you, for me.

No more uncertainty, we have begun, 
Freedom and destiny...
For us they are one.

The courage to be, for you, for me,
The courage to be.

We hold in trust the liberty and the fire,
It's clear to all who see...
There's only one thing to be, baby,
In this world...

Fundamentalist

No more conformity to Vanity Fair,
No time for trivia masking despair.

The courage to be, for you, for me,
The courage to be.

Restored, revived,
Our brother's in love again.

There's no anxiety
In the apocalyptic visions
When you are 

Fundamentalist

The race is not to the swift,
But the weak, the despised,
The disenfranchised,
Are the people...God's people...
The kingdom comes...

The battle is not to the strong.
