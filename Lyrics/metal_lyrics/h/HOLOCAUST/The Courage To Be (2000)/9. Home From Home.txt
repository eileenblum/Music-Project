You can call Him the Ground of Being,
You can call Him the Word, the meaning,
You can call Him Redeemer,
The courage to be is here,
And through all my hypocrisy I still see
The nail prints in his Hands...
The everlasting arms...
And even now
The thought of embrace in those arms
Is a home from home
There is peace in the depth of reason,
A strong undefined cohesion,
To the day-spring eternal, 
The courage to be is here,
And through all my hypocrisy I still see
The nail prints in His hands...
The everlasting arms...
And even now
The thought of embrace in those arms
Is a home away from home.
Glory to the Father and to the Son
And to the Holy Ghost,
As it was in the beginning, is now,
And ever shall be.
