Yes, the day has arrived,
And the sun is up like a soldier,
Watch the old shadows fly.
From this day we are the Collective

Feel the foundations firm and strong,
All hail the banners raised on high.

Strong now in our community,
As we march and work together,
Sovereign our ideology,
Which cannot be overthrown now...

World without end.

Happy to be children of the state,
Ready to think 'We', not 'Me' anymore

We belong to ourselves,
Every one of us belongs to each other.

One...I'm always dreaming
About the beautiful number one.
Unity...dynamic unity with a will
That cannot be broken.

World without end.

The sunlight on the fields
Brings us to remembrance...
God bless this land,
Our God bless us all here.

We are the boundless ocean,
We are eternal Spring.

What is it gonna be then?

Endless revolution to evolution,
Or New Earth?
