[Part Two (Night Train)]

When Penelope dreams, 
She's on a train
On the West Highland line,
She's a beautiful girl,
And it's a beautiful day...it's OK,
She knows how to behave,
She's on a train...night train now,
She's on a train on the line to nowhere.

She looks out at the stars
And thinks to herself, 
There's a tendency to be born...
I know I was."
She's on a train
On the line to somewhere...
Sunday girl...we send our love.
