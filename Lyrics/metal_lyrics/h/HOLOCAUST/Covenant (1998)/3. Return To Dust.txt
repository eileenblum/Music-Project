Tell me, do you ever get out breath when you go chasing the wind?
Never just let a moment go by because your time is money?
Me, I like my "pie in the sky"...
Do you see how the days fly under the sun?

Does it ever take a hold of your heart, that Eternal God,
Looking down on rebellious man,
Should make a covenant?
An everlasting covenant...
Do you see how the days fly under the sun?

And all our days are vain,
In Self we do trust.
But our bodies and our brains
Shall each return to dust.

The resurrection day of the Eternal Lamb
Has taken death away from those who died with Him.

I'm not afraid to return to dust.
Return to dust, I'm not afraid, no, no...
I'm not afraid.
