Omens, days of blood and toil
Seeds grow in a barren soil
Nothing shall be deemed impossible, 
Bring Olympus down
Witness all ye gods,
This is the dawn of the mighty.

Kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall
But there has to be an end to it all.

Ah, mirror of the sky,
Odysseus knew thee not as I.
How the seas have changed!
Holy reason comes to the sanctified,
Then everything succumbs!
This is the dawn of the mighty,

Kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall
But there has to be a reason.

Never underestimate the Leopard,
Quick, sudden, ruthless.

Is it really so far to the end of the earth?
Is it really so far to the end of the earth?
Daniel, Daniel
Daniel, what did you see concerning me?
Daniel,
Daniel, what did you see concerning me?

Is it really so far to the apotheosis?
Is it really so far, 
Is it really so far to the Infinite?

So far, so deluded,
What is Man?
Ashes and dust.
Ashes, embers.
