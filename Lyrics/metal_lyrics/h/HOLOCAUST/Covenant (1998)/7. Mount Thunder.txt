The sheer face of the Landsdrop
Rends the earth in twain
For evil banes 
Buried deep in Mount Thunder

The domicile of the Despiser
Looks down
On Andelain.

Treacher's Gorge leads us on to the edge of the Abyss.
Goodbye Andelain
Sweet Andelain
Power comes from the glory of the one you serve,
All else is impotence.
