The mercy of the Living God renew your mind,
Unclean! Unclean! I am a survival machine,
Present your body as a living sacrifice,
Don't touch me, don't touch me, I am defiled.

We gotta change inside
We gotta change inside
We gotta change inside

The good I would do - this is what I do not do,
To live by what I hate is my unbroken rule,

Oh my soul!

Leper! Outcast! Unclean...
Misfit! Weirdo! Unseen...
Leper! Outcast! Unclean...
Misfit! Weirdo! Unseen...

I was alive I had my leprosy and pain,
I took a vow to save my life go down the drain,
Above the world, beyond the grave, behind the snow
The work is done, and you are whiter than show.

Oh my soul!

We gotta change inside
We gotta change inside
We gotta change inside
We gotta change it, change it, rearrange it, change it, change inside...
