Stone and sea participating in what remains,
The power that's remaining...
Even though I see despite in me, I wonder...
I wonder if at home beyond the Sunbirth sea, do they keep a flame? 
A fire to burn away the darkness in my soul?

I am Salt Heart... Stone and sea!

Stay by me, beloved Unbeliever,
I shall weep for all the tales you could not tell.
I remain when even sanity is hell
I retain, the vision of the innocent,
Even though I see despite in me, I wonder...
I wonder if at home beyond the blue horizon, do they keep a flame?
A fire to burn away the darkness in your soul?
