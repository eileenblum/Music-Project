Talkin', I'm talkin'...I never seem to stop talkin'
Trouble is, I'm talkin' to myself!
Tomorrow, tomorrow, I get my shit together,
You know what I'm sayin'?
Tomorrow never comes.
I'm drinkin', stinkin', lyin' in my bed,
Someone oughta come around and shoot me in the head!

Bring on the light to guide these fools,
These fools that I have been.

Attention! Attention! I'm beggin' for attention,
Can ya hear me looking at you?!
It's just I can't get through my sorry life
Until I get the vibe I've got to get from you...
No malice, I'm Alice falling down the rabbit hole,
Tweedledee Tweedledum totally confused!

Bring on the light to guide these fools,
These fools that I have been.

I am serious, this will never change if it's left up to me...
God of love, help me now!
There is hope in this life even for a fool like me,
By the grace of God.

Bring on the light to guide these fools,
These fools that I have been.
