Nothing in this world will ever bring me down again,
No-one is gonna rob me of my self-respect, no way.
Tomorrow is another day...my day.

I regain my iron will
forged in the primal fire

No institution can hold me,
No government can own me,
No superstar of politics is gonna vandalize my mind.
Look down on me from a great height if you must...

I regain my iron will
Forged in the primal fire
Now hear this, ye gods of this world
Your system had me in chains
Now hear this, ye gods of this world...
Count the cost or pay the price.
I am holding on to what I love and I will never ever quit

I regain my iron will
Forged in the primal fire
