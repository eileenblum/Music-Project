This is the place where you will find the free
This is the place where you will find the brave
From poetry to engineering,
We keep on pioneering,
We become the light of the world
Through the things we achieve...

Made Righteous

This is the place where you will find the best
This is the place where you will find the worst
On the world stage we write the story
Covered in our Hollywood glory,
Our influence...a deal you can't refuse,
Everyone knows who we are!

Made Righteous

Where do we go now?
