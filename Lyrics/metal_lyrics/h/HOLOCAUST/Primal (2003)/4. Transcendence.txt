We don't need more aggravation,
Don't want to kill for a nation,
All the peoples of the world...
Let's get it on together, let's get it on.

We don't see the will to power,
We don't need all the pain and anger,
You know we flourish in love...
Let's get it on together, let's get it on.

Freedom inside...transcendence is ours!

Everyone on this earth is here for a reason,
Torn apart, maybe...
But in the image of God.
It's time to embrace pure ecstatic bliss.
