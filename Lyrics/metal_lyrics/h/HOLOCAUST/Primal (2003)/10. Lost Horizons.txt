Now the sunshine of youth is gone
Possibilities become so few...
What do you see in the eyes of a child?
Uncorrupted wonder.

Sad surrender to mature consensus,
Determined to forget past inspirations,
Find a photograph from days gone by,
A smiling child...it's you...
Uncorrupted Joy.

Will you ever see beyond the shadows again?
