The room is dark and still
I am no longer alone
Something out there now within...

Sullen silence of the damned
Agents of their own despair
Vicious, hostile and insane

Evil, there is evil in my head,
Grant me asylum from the empire of Hell...they colonize.

Senses far beyond our own
Devious, intent on harm
Am I in their grip again?

Evil, there is evil in my head,
Grant me asylum from the empire of Hell...they colonize.

(Until the day of the judgement of The Almighty...
but until that day they colonize)

The theories of this age cannot explain evil
There is evil in my head,
Grant me asylum from the empire of Hell...they colonize.
