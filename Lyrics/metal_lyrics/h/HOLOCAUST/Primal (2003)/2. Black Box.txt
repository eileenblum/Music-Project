I reach out and touch the chill black face
I get the thrill inside
Curious desire; need to know

What lies behind your walls
Real world deserts me now
Thoughts drift into emptiness

Black box calling me again
The time is now ... Decide within
The scream of fear.... An agonizing dread
Clings to me and shows me how the end will be

The weight of time pulls me down
Fear of pain beyond the walls

Someone pull me back, someone...give me the will to get out of this
Insane desire has me now

I know it's where i need to be
Alone again in dark despair
Memory leads me back to simple times
But where to go? -- but what to do?
My thoughts continually flash
Back to you
