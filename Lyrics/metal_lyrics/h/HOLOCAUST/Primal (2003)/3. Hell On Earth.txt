Riding on a tide of ill will,
Poison propaganda greedily devoured,
Powers up the war machine.

Contrived genocide,
Taken from the mind of hell.
Vicious rage, lethal incursions,
Venomous hate in action...

Nightmare campaigns
Hell on earth

Working from behind the veil,
Unseen and aggressive manipulators
Excite human evil,

Willful ignorance serves them well,
Gratify arrogant desire in orgies of destruction.

Nightmare campaigns
Hell on earth

Resistance imperative
Persistence imperative
But it will never happen upon the battlefields

Resistance imperative
Persistence imperative
But it will never happen out on the streets,

It's got to be in the heart of every man and woman,
It's got to be in the heart of every child...

No more hell on earth.
