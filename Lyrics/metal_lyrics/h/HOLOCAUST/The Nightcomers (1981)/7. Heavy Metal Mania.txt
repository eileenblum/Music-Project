Inside the power cage
I can feel the music of my age
It's paranoid...first degree
Tellin' me that I'm not free

I've got Heavy Metal music in my blood
And I'd like to give it to you if I could

As I lie in the shroud of darkness
The wings of light remove the veil
It's Heavy, Heavy, Heavy
Heavy Metal Mania all the way
Rock 'n roll...far too slow
So the adrenaline just doesn't flow
Where is the power, where is the glory?
Heavy Metal is my story
