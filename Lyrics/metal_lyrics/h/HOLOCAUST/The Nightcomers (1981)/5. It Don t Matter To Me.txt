It don't matter to me
It don't matter what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter if you stay

Come on and rock me
Come on and rock me
Come on and rock me
I'm gonna rock with you
I ain't telling you nothing
You don't know what's in my mind
I'm gonna give you a deadline
Better make a fast connection!

You better get on your way
'Cause I have nothin' left to say
It's been raining all day
The storm cloud has the right way
