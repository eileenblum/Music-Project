On the other side jesters keep their watch
Fifteen million lives ready to be lost
We come from the Northern Headlands
The warriors of ice
Come to cleanse the world
Destroy the human sacrifice

And the living dead will swarm upon this earth
The multitude will gather to punish every breath
And in the devil's gallery
A feast will be prepared
For those of us who dared...

"We will forever haunt you"
The torrid masses scream
Damnation, hate and torture...
The order of the dream
As angels flee in terror
The sun begins to freeze
And every soul on earth
Is broken by the breeze
