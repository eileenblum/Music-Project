I have seen him die
Death I crucify
Revenge is fast - I know...
Pain is always slow
Flying high above
God I shall not love
We look, we see way down
We fall to the devil shown
Falling...hold on...
Descending way down

Walking side by side
We know we cannot hide
Lies of long ago...
My power is no more
I had prince's fire
Believe me, I tell no lie
I sense my death has come
Like a witch I will burn
Falling...hold on...
Descending way down
