Sitting alone is so bad
(The times we had!...)
Feeling you close to my heart
Even though we're worlds apart

Come on back to me
My heart's crying out loud
'Cause in losing you I lost the love that I found

Dreaming of suicide
It's the easiest way to hide
Only one thing I got to do
Got to get close to you

Every day that passes
I try to hide my sorrow
My tears will come as surely as tomorrow
