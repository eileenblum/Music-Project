Stare
Like a china doll
Now the sky will fall down upon us all

Can you fill those wasted years?
Now it's time to shed those tears
Hard man

Death
Flying in the night
Generating light
On its fatal flight

Desperation looms above your head
Silent violence as the lights flash red

Die
For the powers that be
For men who couldn't see their own insanity

Now the night will follow day
Is it right to end our lives this way?
