A still, small voice stirs inside of me
A spark of joy ignites me

This is a movement of the soul
A paradise on earth

It is my joy to dance in trance
Dance into the vortex

Just like being pulled forever
Into a clear autumnal morning

I am not the only one
I see the multitudes

It is their joy to dance in trance
Dance into the vortex

Chill winds will blow the past away
The flags will fly

It is our joy to dance in trance
Dance into the vortex

Our future is a glorious fountain
Shimmering in the chaos
The hygiene of destruction

It is our joy to dance in trance
Dance into the vortex
