I am a violent answer
To this existing world
I am a truth enhancer
I lie about my cure
I am an empty mystery
One that controls the truth
Erasing all the history
Its reconstructed for you

I am a tragic story - I make most children cry
For what it's worth, I'm evil
Got worthlessness on my side
I am a starving vulture waiting for death to live
If you claim to tell the truth
Then make damn sure you know what it is

I Am
Bored
I am low
I am high
I am sick as fuck
And I am tired

We'll take the sun and make it cold
And just because its written doesn't make it so
Don't fight back you're too high
You won't try - Too fucked up

I am a hate enhancer for everyone in view
I'm digging out the answers from everyone of you
I am a hidden pathway, a trail you never took
The truth lies in here somewhere
Chances are, you'll never fucking look

I Am
Bored
I am low
I am high
I am sick as fuck
And I am tired

We'll take the sun and make it cold
And just because its written doesn't make it so
Don't fight back I'm too high
