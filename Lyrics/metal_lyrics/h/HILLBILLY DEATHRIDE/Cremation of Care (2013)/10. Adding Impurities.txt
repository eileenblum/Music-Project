I'll tell you what
I fill up on poison and all just for fun
Stray in the realms of the loneliest one
Detach from the wings, leave halos behind
Becoming immortal - the deadliest kind

Escaping the pain of the common mistake
Accepting the lie, embracing the fake
Ignoring the facts and sticking to faith
Consider the option of burning this place

No one is safe in a time such as this
There's nothing to prove with blood on my fist
We're saving your soul but just for the refund
While killing the earth for adoring the sun

This is the process of adding impurities
We're in the process of killing what you believe
This is the process of adding impurities
We're in the process

I'll tell you what
I get off on the ruin, the death of the week
The coke sniffing model - a hideous freak
If that's what you want, then that's what you'll get
Something to keep you from throwing a fit

Inciting a riot to watch from a view
Like making some friends and killing a few
Insisting on hatred but settling for fear
Indulging in havoc and making it clear

No one is safe in a time such as this
There's nothing to prove with blood on my fist
We're saving your soul but just for the refund
While killing the earth for adoring the sun

This is the process of adding impurities
We're in the process of killing what you believe
This is the process of adding impurities
We're in the process

I hate to say it but I'm broke
Boxed in
Wearing down
Wearing thin
I won't take it for granted
I won't sleep til I get done
I'll add to something or fucking die alone
