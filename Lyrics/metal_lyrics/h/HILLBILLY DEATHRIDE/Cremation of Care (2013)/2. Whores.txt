At first my attention is all but yours
I laugh it off 'cause I know they're metaphors
And I seem to know just what you mean
I'm sure that you will never know
What goes on just beneath your skull
Inside its all bare and hollow, no joke

Give up I ain't scared
Did you think I cared
Did you think you'd win
What's wrong, did I crush your ego again?

Don't try denial
Its happened to you
I see your motive
And I know you

My new solution's apathy
It works, you can take that straight from me
Someone who knows just how to bleed
What helps our ridiculous egos shine
A remedy for the pain like yours and mine
I've got much stronger things on my mind
Like what helps our ridiculous egos shine

Give up I ain't scared
Did you think I cared
Did you think you'd win
What's wrong, did I crush your ego again?

Don't try denial
Its happened to you
I see your motive
And I know you

No I won't help your ego shine
No I can't help your ego shine
