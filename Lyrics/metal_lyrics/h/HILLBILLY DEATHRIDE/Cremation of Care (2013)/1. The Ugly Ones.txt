Stand back the pretty ones go first
And that's right, the pretty ones got hired
I can't wait, the pretty ones get smart
Find out that the ugly ones can

Stand up - The pretty ones got loved
And that's right, the pretty ones will die
I can't wait - The pretty ones get smart
Find out we're the ugly ones inside

And I still feel the same
No matter who I blame
I still feel the same

We love to cry

Hold up, the pretty ones want peace
That's right, the pretty ones got scared
I can't wait - the pretty ones get smart
Find out that the ugly ones can...

Stand up - the pretty ones get loved
Well fuck that - the pretty ones should die
I can't wait - the pretty ones get loved
Find out we're the only ones inside

Watch it burn
We'll make love not war
Well this love is war
This love is war

This love takes the pressure we're under
Makes all of the pretty ones look sick
We're crawling for cover in this love-hate war
