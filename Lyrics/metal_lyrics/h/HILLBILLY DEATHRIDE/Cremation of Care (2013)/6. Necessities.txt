Cursed with the will of God, out in the land of Nod
I am a burden unto life its self
I'm spreading filth and dirt no matter who it hurts
I live to die one day and nothing else

And I feel fine
The world is mine

I drink some alcohol, I take some drugs
It always seems to help but not enough
I need some guidance, I need some advise
God, I hope the Devil helps this time

And I feel fine
The world is mine

Sex Drugs Pain Power

Oh, the world is mine
Doomed to die like me in time
Oh, but I feel fine
I've got all I need
All I need from life

I've got all I need
My necessities
All I need

I've got all I need
My necessities
Sex Drugs Pain Power
