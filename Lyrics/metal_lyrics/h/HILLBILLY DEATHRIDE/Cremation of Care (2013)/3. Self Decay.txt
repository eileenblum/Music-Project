So close, I can smell the destruction
Dear God, we're on our way
A body count by the thousand
In the name of self-decay

And when we take them on
We'll see the truth coming on
And when we take them on
We're using brute force alone
We'll kill them all

Who are we to smell the roses?
Who are they to cut them down?
What are we but newborn soldiers?
They'll cut us down

Who are we to smell the roses?
Who are they to cut them down?
What are we but newborn soldiers?
They'll cut us - They'll cut us down

Cut us down

Who are we to smell the roses?
Who are they to cut them down?
What are we but newborn soldiers?
They'll cut us down

We live in an age of preemption
Who wants to bet it's gonna take us down?
A body count by the million
When their one little threat gets found

And when we take them on
We'll see the truth coming on
And when we take them on
We're using brute force alone
They'll kill us all

Who are we to smell the roses?
Who are they to cut them down?
What are we but newborn soldiers?
They'll cut us down

We're fearless, not timeless, we're helpless
They'll cut us down
