There'll be no shelter
There'll be no freedom now
Enjoy the slaughter, or else we'll show you how

You'll feel much better on our medication

We're making progress
We're making millions here
Some day you'll thank us
To hold you off, here's fear

You'll feel much safer under surveillance now

We'll tear the skin off the sun and then we'll eat it hot
We'll kill the innocent one by one and
And then we'll watch them rot

They say there's no place like home
Well they ain't been where I'm from
I leave a trail of purified hell
And from those ashes you've grown
Worlds apart

We break your life down
We make it digital
Look at your life now
Its not your life at all

You'll feel much better on our medication

We're making progress
We're making trillions here
Some day you'll thank us
Once you get past the fear

You'll feel much safer under surveillance now

We'll tear the skin off the sun and then we'll eat it hot
We'll kill the innocent one by one and
And then we'll watch them rot

They say there's no place like home
Well they ain't been where I'm from
I leave a trail of purified hell
And from those ashes you've grown
Worlds apart
