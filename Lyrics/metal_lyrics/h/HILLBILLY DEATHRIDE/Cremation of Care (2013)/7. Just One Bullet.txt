No remorse for what's been done
Nothing left - Me and the gun
There's just one bullet
Know not where it sleeps
When it wakes up, I know its coming for me

So why make friends? They'll all die in the end
No one survives
So kill your friends Save them from the death
That no one wants

Shut the fuck up - No one's listening
You keep talking - and I'll keep venting
Instead of this one bullet, I'd rather have three
One for the king, one for you and one for me

So why make friends? They'll all die in the end
No one survives
So kill your friends Save them from the death
That no one wants

We've tried
And failed
Don't get disgusted
Its not fair

Live to lie another day
Learn to lie another way
Live to fight another day
Learn to fight another way

And die

So why make friends? They'll all die in the end
No one survives
So kill your friends Save them from the death
That no one wants
No one survives
No one survives
The End
