So here we are once again
Back to all of our pain
Has it been in vain'

What we can see straight ahead
Results of a misread
God knows it's sad

Still there's someone believing the light
Still someone wants to reach for a paradise

Don't leave me
Don't fear me now
All is lost but our will
Will live on forever more
And into time we'll fly so high
The world we'll start all over now it died

Walk with me and in a time we'll see
Another breed and a new world integrity
Strike your hands, it's wonderful to dance
Once more again and no more mistake and pride

Don't leave me
Don't fear me now
All is lost but our will
Will live on forever more
And into time we'll fly so high
The world we'll start all over now you...

Won't lie me
Won't swindle me
Nevermore as before
We'll be true forevermore
And our deeds will testify
The world we'll start all over now is right
