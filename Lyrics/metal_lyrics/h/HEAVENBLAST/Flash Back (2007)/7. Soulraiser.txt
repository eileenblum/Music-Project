A cold night was creeping and melting in our hearts
Until you all came bringing back the sunlight
Guide my life, once I have lost any will to try
So that you will be the soulraiser of mine

Fallen down like a comet from the sky
Angel from a paradise, I could see no sense at all
But I did not lost control, waiting for a chance
To see my spirit ever dance, an inner trance

Please
Somebody fought, somebody died
Somebody went up in the sky
Somebody tell me why I have survived
Into your blessing arms I want to lay much too long I've kneeled down to pray
Soulraiser tell me why I am here to stay

Dove from horizon, a sparkle in the darkness
Of our world of survival, the prize we had to pay
Has been painful enough now, I know your purity, worth waiting
It's up to you now, reach for our hearts and raise all our souls

In your mind you've got a key to unseal this all
And you will show me I was not meant to fall

Please
Somebody fought, somebody died
Somebody went up in the sky
Somebody tell me why I have survived
Into your blessing arms I want to lay
Much too long I've kneeled down to pray
Soulraiser tell me why I am here to stay

...Please...
Somebody sang, somebody played
In the meanwhile somebody died
Soulraiser show me what's the reason why
Why I have survived?
