This way has driven me to a door
My pain has drowned in a sea of pains
Maybe the only remained hope flows
In the veins of my enemy

Shake down, this is the final way
We are blind in front of all this hate

Tell me a word in this sort of silence
I don't want this once more again
While the earth keeps spinning around and 'round
And now we have lost this challenge
This last chance on this battlefield
To turn this world into a better place

No reason
To turn over
We are between the good and bad
And we cannot judge where is the truth

Opposite poles sparkle
Is everything wrong'
The demons assail us
And we can't avoid

The beast we've found inside ourselves
The devil laughs inside his hole
No hope for those who' re left alive
'Cos war's an instinct, not a crime

Give up, you're just an animal
Shut down moral and chemical

Not an use to check your thirst for
Blood, right to disagree:
Prevail your brother or kill him now

No reason
To turn over
We are between the good and bad
And we cannot judge where is the truth

Opposite poles sparkle
Is everything wrong'
The demons assail us
And we can't avoid
