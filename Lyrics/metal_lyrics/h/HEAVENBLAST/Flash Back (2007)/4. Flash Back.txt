"Come with me, now it's time for deliverance
Take my hand, there'll be a day when together
We will return back again from a distant place
Back and forever we'll remain
Believe in me tonight"

Through my eyes fast images are running away
Like a maze my confusion increasing and I feel
I'm not awake to understand the blames
How much I still wait to see the end
From here I want to escape

Leave this heaven from somewhere far beyond the sky
The ghosts of memory waste over your shoulders sometimes

Desire is stronger than all the hidden truth
Try to research deep in your love
The force for break your limits
The passion makes action and takes alive the game
I can't forget quickly the past
From this odyssey I must turn back

Desire is stronger than all the hidden truth
Try to research deep in your love
The force for break your limits
The passion makes action and takes alive the game
I can't forget quickly the past
From this odyssey I must turn back

Desire is stronger than all the hidden truth
I can't forget quickly the past
From this odyssey I must turn back
