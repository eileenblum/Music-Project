Out of the sky, there is the darkness' space
That you don't know, where man took refuge
Follow the stars in a perfect design outside the world
The right way to back home

Now I can see the earth and tears falling down from my eyes
We are the result of human's technology and science

Like a desire, like look into fire there's a mysterious place
Where my heart will find a shelter
Now in my mind memory is the only place where I can see the light

And when I fall in this light I feel a strange kind of sensation
I'm into the gravity
Show me the way in this time
'Cause my life has an unknown destination
Just into the gravity
Into the gravity

Go in front of the wind over the seas
Now it's impossible to kill
Our wish to live into a new life
Where freedom will rebirth in all our hearts and
Hope for the new future world
We still believe to find the doors
Forget the past, future's begun
Gravity is the witness of our new born sun

And when I fall in this light I feel a strange kind of sensation
I'm into the gravity
Show me the way in this time
'Cause my life has an unknown destination
Just into the gravity
And when I fall in this light I feel a strange kind of sensation
I'm into the gravity
