Now I want to seize the light
Weak like hope remained
I cannot believe this way
There's no reasons to defray it

And I want to take my soul in peace
While for the world we wait outcome
All this wasted time fighting
And all the hard work lost in the wind

Stand alone under this rain
Desperation through my veins
While the men have lost control
I've no power against this storm

Sometimes in my mind I still believe
That the stars are not so far
Nightmares of our lies are made of fear
And there's no way to win this fight
Living in this jail of glass
Doesn't protect us enough
From our madness we must run

Why? We are source of sorrow
Why? Humans do not understand
Why? The end is still the same
Why? Mistake infinite times
