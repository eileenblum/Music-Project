Dreams are all my sins under this sky
There's a bright light in your eyes
When I think on tomorrow, tell me why
Let the shivers go down my spine
It's so cold this wind
And also my tears and sorrow
Scream to this night
I want to come back to my past life

And I feel a throbbing
Reach between our life
You are very distant
From my thought
In this silent place
There's no exit way
From your mouth
A short breath

Winter falling into my heart
My control disappears, remain scars
And the earth under my feets
Is the final place that my trust will fit

You can hear the whisper
In this darkest night
Steps behind your back
Open the eyes

Winter falling into my heart
My control disappears, remain scars
And the earth under my feets
Is the final place that my trust will fit

Again the fear to lose another fight
And we want to fly away
Take the time
And give yourself a reason to survive
In this cold and winter night

[Solo: Alessandro, Donatello]

Feel again the fear to lose another fight
And we want to fly away
Take the time
And give yourself a reason to survive
In this cold and winter night

And I feel a throbbing
Reach between our life
Are you very distant
From my thought

Winter falling into my heart
My control disappears, remain scars
And the earth under my feets
Is the final place that my...

Winter falling, winter falling
Winter fall, winter fall,
Winter falling into my heart
