We live in the deep of the ground
Our scream in emptiness comes from desire of rise
To see the sunrise again
And for a human race we want a second chance

Here, yeah!!! Smell of wet land in the dark
Nobody can escape from this desolate place
All our trust for future days
Lives in our hearts and in all our prayers

When you've survived apocalypse
And time is stranger to you
Maybe it's the moment to became strong
And make your dreams come true

Here, yeah!!! This is all that remains
Into the abyss the life has found its own way

Look in the mirror, look in your eyes
We are the heroes
We are the few man that remained
We are the elect

There's a another star in the sky
For a brave new world we can fight
And the fate of destiny will change in a short time
Working all in peace men and machines
This is future world of my dreams
We wanna escape from this abyss infernal place
Towards freedom

Some under the sky
Try to research what the war has denied
Searching one reason, taking power
For future days

When you have survived apocalypse
And time is stranger to you
Maybe it's the moment to became strong
And make your dreams come true

There's a another star in the sky
For a brave new world we can fight
And the fate of destiny will change in a short time
Working all in peace men and machines
This is future world of my dreams
We want escape from this abyss infernal place
Towards freedom
