You run, must achive alone the freedom
Escape and jump, fly in the sky like an eagle
Hide, save now what you have, don't let it fall down
or your world will die and your dream will vanish

In the night the serpent will assay
the whole loot and your eyes will bring your destiny with you
Yes, you are the one bringing the peace
but your breath is wasted for who wants to play with the avarice

Look at our safety
This is the crown of the light
Breath of God in his diamond
Angels custodian

Shining the shade of the elect
Don't leave this war and your world will win
The time is going for the end
You reach out your hands
Riding upon a dream in white and black
Show us the way when the night has come
The time has come to save our land
Now just save our land

Shining the shade of the elect
Don't leave this war and your world will win
The time is going for the end
You reach out your hands
Riding upon a dream in white and black
Show us the way when the night has come
The time has come to save our land
Now just save our land
