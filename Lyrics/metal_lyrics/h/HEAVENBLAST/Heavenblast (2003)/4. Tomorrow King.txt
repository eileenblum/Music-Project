First star of the night,
the time is about to change my life
I never lived in your light,
I lost my control,
I am the only heir of my world
But I don't trust myself

I want to set my reality free,
can I express what I keep inside,
I look at my earth in bloom of freedom
To close the eyes and dream happily,
a perfect world made out of peace
And I can taste the dew in the fields in the morning

But it's the time for remember his eyes,
never go back, and now show me the light

This is my world, down of my trown,
and I have the soul of an animal, the time for a miracle
Tomorrow king, tomorrow king of my world,
come to my world, your dreams become one with reality,
and we are the sons of the light

I can see you dreams,
I can feel shivers down my spine,
and feel power in my hands
Take the right way,
have faith in response,
you will see that it will arrive

But it's the time to stand up and to go,
never go back and now show me the light

This is my world, down of my trown,
and I have the soul of an animal, the time for a miracle
Tomorrow king, tomorrow king of my world,
come to my world, your dreams become one with reality,
and we are the sons of the light

We are sons of the miracle

But it's the time for remember His eyes,
never go back, and now show me the light

[Chorus:]
This is my world, down of my trown,
and I have the soul of an animal, the time for a miracle
Tomorrow king, tomorrow king of my world,
come to my world, your dreams become one with reality,
and we are the sons of the light
This is my world, down of my trown,
and I have the soul of an animal, the time for a miracle
Tomorrow king, tomorrow king of my world
