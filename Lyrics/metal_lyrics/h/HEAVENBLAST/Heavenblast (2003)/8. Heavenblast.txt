Hey you, I've seen man's destiny
In a time of sorrow
And I describe my dream
When I fall into desire
To feel new emotions
The fog above my eyes
is dust of ignorance

Another season of my life
begins too late
When will man understand
his time?
The only profeth fo your life
is in your mind
but you don't want
to hear him right

Lead me inside of the
question for miracle
and it's not too late
to do it

Heavenblast
when you try to find
the real story full of power
blast of glory time,
for a reason tonight
must believe in your mind
spread your wings, spring again
now begin another game.

Hey you, I've seen man's destiny
In a time of sorrow
And I describe my dream
When I fall into desire
To feel new emotions
The fog above my eyes
is dust of ignorance

Heavenblast
when you try to find
the real story full of power
blast of glory time,
for a reason tonight
must believe in your mind
spread your wings, spring again
in the name of the Heavenblast
when you try to find
the real story full of power
blast of glory time
