My wings fly, with the silence, in the sky
My rebellious dreams, with the thunder, in the time

Look, this is the road that leads to the sunset
Flame that burns inside the memory
Take, this is my life, far away from the sorrow
What you need, what you wanna be

Moon, leave the night and look at me
I live under your starlight skies
Moon, take my dreams and cradle them
and bring me far from reality

Hero, hero, of the power and glory
Hero, hero, brave hearted king
Hero, hero, in the tale of Dreamland
Hero of the eternal flame

So beautiful, so strange
I'm living my tale in an ancient castle
Where I forge my dreams
playing with the shiver of the nightmare
Among the point
Beyond the point
the point of no-return

Moon, leave the night and look at me
I live under your starlight skies
Moon, take my dreams and cradle them
and bring me far from reality

Hero, hero, of the power and glory
Hero, hero, brave hearted king
Hero, hero, in the tale of Dreamland
Hero of the eternal flame
