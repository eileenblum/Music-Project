I am in the middle of the night and the father sky is upon me,
full of shining stars
When I'm far away, far from the time, like a miracle my loneliness
shows me the way tonight

And my heart is full of adrenaline tonight,
when I take my airplane shiver of my life
And I ride emoitions, ready for the game,
and I like to live in the blue sky

For another world I sell my self-control,
and now I am the light god of the sky
Freedom in the sky, reason of my life
and never take away the time when I am so high
I am ready to fly

I hear the call, I close my eyes, in the middle of an heart-beat
can you hear my soul that cries
And I feel confusion in my mind, praying so strong for my destiny
when I'll be there tonight

Calling you, searhing the heaven, loosing my reason tonight
Never stay into the limits, in my sky come on to fly

For another world I sell my self-control, and now I am the light god of the sky
Freedom in the sky, reason of my life and never take away the time when I am so high
I am ready to fly

And when the countdown is on the zero my game takes off and clouds welcome me
Now I am the king, now I feel the power and you cannot stop me because you cannot see me
You will always be behind me, everything was written...

Calling you, searhing the heaven, loosing my reason tonight
Never stay into the limits, in my sky come on to fly

For another world I sell my self-control, and now I am the light god of the sky
Freedom in the sky, reason of my life and never take away the time when I am so high
I am ready to fly
For another world I sell my self-control, and now I am the light god of the sky
