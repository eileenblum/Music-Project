Look into his eyes, the colossus of the life
Before another day, emperor of your time

When the time has come, revolution in my heart
Before another day, a life can't end this way
And when the sun has riser your last smile greets this world

Now take my tears, take my time, I can hear the whispers
Every second, every day and night I can feel the wind of destiny
Closing my eyes, taking my sleep, bringing me with it
Where you want, angel of the night, I can see the light from the sky

I can see my soul out from my body
I can fly much more distant that with the wings

And with the heart show me the way, you open the doors of heaven
Of the winter of the life take your last smile,
You streach the hands toward me bring me in heaven
Like a minor god I'll live inside your dreams

And with the heart show me the way, you open the doors of heaven
Of the winter of the life take your last smile,
You streach the hands toward me bring me in heaven
Like a minor god I'll live inside your dreams
