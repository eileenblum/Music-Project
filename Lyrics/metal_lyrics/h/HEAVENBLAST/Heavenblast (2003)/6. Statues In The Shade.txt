Sometimes I desire in a small piece of my heart
Happiness in time of war when each one feel hate and gradge
Look at people from the sep die and conteplate
Blinded by the anger and by the pain

Now I live on in fear, there's no time for tears
With the broken heart, I am running
And when the silence is the spy
That gives you company
with on shivers on my hands, I'm praying

When the time is God and decides for the end
Contemplating the present doesn't starts your end
If you keep alive or you even die your weight doesn't exist
Statues in shade for the people and marks for the death

When the time is God and decides for the end
Contemplating the present doesn't starts your end
If you keep alive or you even die your weight doesn't exist
Statues in shade for the people and marks for the death
