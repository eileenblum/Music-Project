Prime evil!
In human form will never die, yet was never born
Descending! On doom we ride
All fingers point towards genocide

Abominations in a world of sin
Evil spell is cast from the hell within
Domination of unholy ways
Those with the faith have now gone astray

Uttering words from a sacred book
Some feel these sins will be overlooked
Self-righteous fools wear the mask of god
Others too blind to see through their facade

False prophets speak in a twisted tongue
Obtained victims at an age so young
Brainwashing of the innocent ones
Realizing too late that the damage is done

Seasons of pain as we try and obtain world peace
Living in hell each day while murderers walk the streets
Our leaders to blind to see what's best for you and me
Hole in the sky causing death to our oceans and tress

Not much time left to repent our sins
Famine's rampant time and time again
Plague and disease are burning out of control
Millions are dropping, finally, death takes its toll...

All that is evil. Deep within the soul of man
All that is evil. Taking mankind by the hand
World full of hatred!
I think we've got to find a way to dispel the evil
If things don't change we'll never be the same...

Why does it have no end?
It seems to be starting once again
Spiralling to the point of no return
What once was good has done bad
Try to find the life I had
Before the vil came to take my soul...

Seasons of pain...

Your mind begins to work in sickened ways
Finally realize that you have been possessed by the evil!

All that is evil!...
All that is evil!...
