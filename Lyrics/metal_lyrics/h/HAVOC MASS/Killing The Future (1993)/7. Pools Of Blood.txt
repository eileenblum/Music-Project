See my victims - they like face down in pools of blood
It was so easy - they offered themselves unto me

Suffer! And pay the price
As you drown in pools of blood
In pools of...

Blood is flowing in rivers fed by scarlet rain
The storm unleashed - I lift my face to taste the pain

They led worthless lives. They died by my hands

Bear witness as the victim's family
Mourns the loss of their only born
Thirst for blood is growing stronger
As I watch them die, I feel no sympathy
I feel no sympathy...

I feel no sympathy. I want to hear your screams...
Hear you scream...
As you drown in pools of blood...
In pools of blood
