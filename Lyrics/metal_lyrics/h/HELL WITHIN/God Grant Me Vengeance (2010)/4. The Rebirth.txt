Dead eyes fixate upon our souls
Reaping the effortless
Conceiving our rebirth
Faithless (broken) rejected apathy
Pathetic virtue stains (blood soaked rain)
Our god forsaken world

Feeling merciless hands of a God that does not sympathize
Cutting human by human until every herd has been bled
Lives that wade in the filth like a plague that will not pacify
Prolonged torment that yields no relief at all...fuck

Mindless deaf herd repent all your scars
Retribution will surface again
I maim you

With wounded pride I fight
Deliverance is near
A fetal glimpse at life

Blackened darkness abating as I persevere through this shit
Starving mind fed delusions that rape me of all of my worth
Purgatory a haven that crushes the will of a man
Drink the chalice of your god and taste the horror...suck

Mindless deaf herd repent all your scars
Retribution will surface again
Fallen empire will rebuild at last
Glass womb bondage will not force us down

Against all odds that succumb I find the strength to kill
I find the strength to kill
Immunity at hand
This demon seed will bloom
Even Christ will bow at our fucking side
Bow at our fucking side

Take my hand to perish from this place
A bleak and restless life
Revulsion spreads its wings
Carry on as fragile life dies out
White ash and dust blow strong
Across the dim lit sky

Carry on, reaping the effortless
Conceiving our rebirth
Life dies out, pathetic virtue stains
Our god forsaken world
