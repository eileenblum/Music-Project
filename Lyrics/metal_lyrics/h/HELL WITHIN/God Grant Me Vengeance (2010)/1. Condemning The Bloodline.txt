Wither away
Human failure
Born to tragedy
The ashen womb she
Did not know the
Filth that she would bring breeding
Murder hands and
Itchy eyes to
Stab the lids out dry, fearing
Her own child
In denial
Bodies build up high, well...

Poor world we should suffer what you did bare
A callous beast that feeds on blood and tears

Condemn the blood that's in your line with all these
Deaths that fill the endless graves inside your

Basement walls bleed...bleed...
Mortar screams plead...plead...

Arsenal of
Butchery is
Locked inside his room while the
Smell of skin is
Burning black the
Killers new perfume, well...

Sorrow filled screams encompass all you know
Prodigal son contaminates the flow
Of blood...of blood...

Encased by the fear of your perishing spawn
You birthed a monster, are you ashamed?

What you came for
Lacerate the flesh
Suffocating
Mother's will to live...to live...

Suppress...the shame...
Embrace the violence
As he cuts a toxic mess
Hiding in the shroud of doubt
Is your sanctuary now
Suppress...

Lie...die...

Wither away
Human failure
Born to tragedy the
Ashen womb she
Did not know the
Filth that she would bring

A murderous heart
Condemning the blood
As pure as the sun
Now shining in hell...now shining in hell...now shining in hell...
