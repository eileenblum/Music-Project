I need more time
Unrest corrodes vitality
Buried alive without closure

Reject my eyes (reject my eyes)
Revolving door of pain
Deliverance (deliver me)
Before I go insane
I'm falling into this curse again
I'm chasing after my own redemption now

Bereft of air
I choke on countless failures
Swallow razors and lies that cut my inner lining
Corruption, enter the gallows of hatred
Hanging like blood rusted chimes
No wind to quell the stagnant fear
That binds us, we carry iniquitous black flames
Casting dark shadows of plague
Be rest assured I'll die, but not without a fight
Patiently I wait to overcome
I will not give in until my voice has been fucking heard
Surround my eyes with gloom always a constant veil
Detest my life, these prayers go unanswered

I dwell in horrid darkness
I loathe the failure I am

Bullet for all of my sins
I strive to be undivided
Miles of desolate pain
I wander earth as a crutch
Only to die

Bereft of air
I choke on countless failures
Swallow razors and lies that bleed me
Catastrophe draws near
I relapse into darkness

Surveyor of human flaw
Defiance will be our own
I face dishonor once again (with bitter arms)
Redeeming grace is never there
Patiently I wait to overcome
I will not give in until I've won

I need more time
Unrest corrodes
This is my only vitality
Buried alive (I suffocate)
Without closure (the silence kills)
I will arise and be heard
