Erode

Burned beyond recognition melting skin drips fast
A bloody trail of wreckage, slaughtering carcass
Annihilate the god-like, bury them with gospel pages drenched red

I am unaffected by your scorn
Defend (lament)
All the losses that you mourn

Drain the common man of solace, let him bleed out dry
A rancid sack of flesh, rotting servitude
Why am I the victim that you torture most?
Surrender all of my will to survive

Burned beyond recognition melting skin drips fast
A bloody trail of wreckage, slaughtering carcass

I am unaffected by your scorn
Defend (lament)
All the losses that you mourn
I am pushing further than before
Transcend from this memory once more

Broken child Infected by neglect
The nightmare turns to daylight
Ripe scars and piled skin
Unceasing execution
The mania kicks

Revere my life
Instead mutilation of the mind
Abuse, despise
Create subliminal suicide
Revere my life
Instead mutilation of the mind
Destroy, leave dead
Commit homicidal bloodshed

Now defiantly I stand, murder weapon drawn
Kill the competition with a fatal blow
Spit in the face of tyrants and of those that choose
To oppress in the wake of my reign

I'm dying
Piercing deep into your eyes
Sorrow felt for those who die
Lament for the fallen
