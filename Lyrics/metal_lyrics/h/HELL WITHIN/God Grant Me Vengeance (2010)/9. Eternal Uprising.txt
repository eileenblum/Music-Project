We torch our own
With fist and flame we tend to justify
Burn

Amidst the holy war machine
Embrace the earthen tomb we live
Rotting rich with body parts
From years of mortal doom

We curse ourselves for bleeding her
Chaos the blackest fuel alive
Attack the world with slaughtering
Creatures of endless hate

We torch our own
Driven to die
Craving the dark
Mushroom cloud sky

Forever burning the world with fist and flame
Eternal uprising

Born to terrorize all the hearts of men
Gears and knives that will crush and bleed all the skulls
Mines that shear a man in half at the seams
Shards that tear at the skin and fillet off the bone

For such a frail
Creature we are
Power we seek
Induced by death
Beliefs blur the righteousness
Lost souls cling to their kingdom
Afraid to negotiate
Instead bleed the soil

We torch our own
Driven to die
Craving the dark
Mushroom cloud sky

Forever burning the world with fist and flame
Eternal uprising

Kill...driven to die!

Protect all of your lands by abandoning reason
Deploy bombs in the air that break the foundation
Faceless bodies that stare from the heat covered wasteland
Bedlam covers the sky with sacred explosives
Burn...

Our enemies are mirrored by our minds
The enemy is that we're human kind
Our enemies are mirrored by our minds
The enemy is that we're human kind

Born to terrorize all the hearts of men
Gears and knives that will crush and bleed all the skulls
Mines that shear a man in half at the seams
Shards that tear at the skin and fillet off the bone

We torch our own...
Surrender none...with fist and flame we tend to justify...
With fist and flame, with fist and flame, we torch our own, we tend to justify
With fist and flame, with fist and flame, we torch our own, we justify
