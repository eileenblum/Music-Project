Suffer days you live, count the ways you'll die
I avail for you always
Never hearts to mend, only martyred life
Sever empty trust always

Pillaged youth, lustful stare
Prying wide, tainted flower
Tears run cold, deepest scar
Soiled seed, pray for the end that will never arrive

Cower in the dark, saviorless you are
Betray your kin through silence
Abandon purity, neglect what you see
Damage done will prove the test of time

Medicate, tortured mind
Numb to skin, rotten dosage
Deception, loveless void
Evade sin, her demise

Cower in the dark, saviorless you are
Betray your kin through silence
Abandon purity, neglect what you see
Damage done will prove the test of time
Offering remedy full of scorn and malice
Crucified casualty, severed heart lingers on this time

I reveal the bloodshed, damn the undeserving

Now I descend full force all of my hatred
Sift through wreckage as I search for composure
Absent as the heart beat and the torment of a murdered child
I tread in damnation through the bullshit and your minion waters
Fuck them all

Cower in the dark, saviorless you are
Betray your kin through silence
Crucified casualty, severed heart lingers on this time

You're betrayal ignited the terminal war
Your neglect will scar deeper than you'll ever know
Her sorrow's induced by your oblivion
Stale force fed life
