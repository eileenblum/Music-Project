Eighty percent of you will turn your back on your own god
Our prisons holy temples for the modern day criminal mind
He kills with sacred hands
Divinity has failed we cage the sanctified
With righteous plastic smiles you preach but you don't pray
A fucking hypocritical mess you have made
All bullshit

Raise your hands to the absolute power
The absent ghost divine
Embrace all sin
Your words a poison whisper
So sell your soul again

Salvation is all alone inside your head
You'll never see
It's in your head
All fucking bullshit

Lace the truth with empty promise
This is a product of man
Reach to the sky
Assembly of locusts
Fidelity is your weapon

Salvation is all alone inside your head, man made to believe
Collected and betrayed we murder ourselves
Thinking we'll be saved

Slaying with pride
A knife to the throat happens worldwide
But it's OK, because all of us who pray will be saved, fuck that
Cut out your eyes, blinded by truth and the light, fake light
Mass homicide descended by heavenly crimes this time

I mask my hate
With pious insanity
Anoint my wounds
I kill again

Stab your way into a cement refuge
A cage of steel ordained
You are the plague
Remiss of consequence
So burn the word to ash

Saved, you think you'll be saved (collapse the last time)
Saved, you think you'll be saved
Collapse the last time
Follow your own heart
