I rot alive

In the coma crimson sleep
The sound of iv drips
They water down my soul
Distilling hate and mold

When will I wake to kill your mind like mine?

I drown in sleep, cold eyes can't speak (what a waste)
These hours of decay, these hours of decay

Breed the cold dark murderer in a room locked inside
(A prison cell of cries), a prison cell of cries
Form the ways in which to rip all the flesh from your spine
(I'm gonna take your life), I'm gonna take your life

Open the gates of collagen
Flowing red from your heart
No solace in the air
You're life will disappear

When will I wake to kill your mind like mine?

I drown in sleep, cold eyes can't speak (what a waste)
These hours of decay, these hours of decay
The time has come for you to run
I'm gonna take your life, I'm gonna take your life away...away

I think of ways to end your days
Its manufactured death
Destroying all that's in my path

God save me nothing, the insanity I crave
When I awake from hell
Your life will end as well
Insanity I ask
The taste of blood at last

I drown in sleep, cold eyes can't speak (what a waste)
These hours of decay, these hours of decay
The time has come for you to run
I'm gonna take your life, I'm gonna take your life away

As I rot alive in the sleep
A prisoner of hate
Residing here awake

Awake...decay...awake
