Stain the planet red, dark knuckles will ignite
The ignorant will pay with their blood on my hands

It's bad enough the human condition is weak
Three pounds of flesh upstairs and you can't think for yourself
Merely defeated I carry this weight alone
Standing defiant I strike with reprisal now

Web of lies you weave
Like daggers piercing skin
I'll choke the breathe out of your sad existence
You become victim to my own hands

A bitter taste
Hostility (taker of life)
God grant me fucking vengeance
I grind my fists (a violent rage)
Across cement (reaper of death)
God grant me fucking vengeance

I sharpen this blade just for you
Merely defeated I carry this weight alone
Standing defiant I strike with reprisal now

Animosity, I bludgeon all the rest
With shards of wrath I stamp out pestilent wind
I rise against authority

I brake for no one other than me
I am the master of hate
I am the power

Grow this mutiny
Of blood and ash
Re-salt my wounds to remind me
You become victim to my own hands

Bleed reopened scars
Unanswered pain
Extreme distaste for the human condition

Drown in testament
Old industry
Profit off oceans of lies

Fuck
