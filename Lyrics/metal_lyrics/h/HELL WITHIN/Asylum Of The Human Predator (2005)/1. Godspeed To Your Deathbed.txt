A dead mother's eyes
Transfixed in endless sorrow.
Hard times to bury a son
Some say we will live on.
Hope fills the depths of their hearts
Of blind faith I surely am not.

[Pre]
These passing years have stolen my smile
My reflection a stranger

Behind the attic door
Between the silhouettes
The wet kiss of death in the night-time mist
Upon the autumn leaves
Your words are carried to me
I know it kills you that my own hands set me free

[Pre II]
These passing years have stolen my smile
(my time)
My reflection a stranger
(reflection seems stranger)
This young shell harbored an old man
(why try?)
Set me free from this nightmare

[Chorus]
It's over now
Rest your head a while
The fear
Is the illusion of darkness
Death is not the end

Inside decaying eyes
My murdered spirit lies
My body burns with the glow of a funeral pyre
Procession gathered 'round
I never heard a sound
Ash to the wind
Never underground

[Pre II]
[Chorus]

Death is not the end...

Burn my flesh off this rotting shell
Grind my bones into dust and ash
Send my soul to oblivion
Erase these hollow, fucking years
Cleanse yourself from my putrid life
Become my ghost, and kill yourself

[Chorus]

Death is not the end...

Do not falter
Pull the trigger
Absolve your wretched existence
