Soul revulsion

You can't stop and end this shit
Starts going
You can't fight against it
Poisoned thoughts led you astray
Nodding off into the grey
Fight your fears
A useless crutch
Relief a needle shot away

[Chorus]
You do it every day
(pent up shoot up)
Those games that you still play
(poison yourself)
You give your heart and soul away
(you'll kick again tomorrow)
It's just an empty promise

I can't wait to see you there
In a pool of yourself
You're too high to care
All I see of you
Glassy eyes
Begging for another chance
Sold your soul long ago
Rot your brain
Stab the vein
Kill the pain
Gave up on you a long time ago.

[Chorus]

Soul revulsion

When will you realize
How you look through other peoples' eyes
Slave to mind and body rot
In its clutches, you are caught
So you thought
All I see of you
Glassy eyes
Begging for another chance
Gave up on you a long time ago.

[Chorus]

Soul revulsion.
