I stood and watched the ocean breathe
For the millionth time it swallowed me
I care not to feel; I'm dying.

Flash back to what you did to me
Flash back to what you said to me
Did your work
I can't touch; I can't feel.

My sanity is breaking
Sweat dripping, mind racing
There's nothing left to lose
(I'm a dead shell)
Erase you
You gave me lies.

[Chorus]
It tears a hole inside you
(lies)
Where light will never find you
(lies)
Abuse yourself
(LIES)
Inject yourself
A broken, brittle body.

It won't leave me alone - alone.

Flash back to what you did to me
Flash back to what you said to me
Did your work
I can't touch; I can't feel.

Reject me
Why?

Caress my face
Only to crucify me
I am your slave fixation pulsing
Punish me.

Tie me up
Cut me up
Stitch me up
Reopen me
Come alone
Crawl inside
I only want to come in you.

Disgust to purify
Kill you a thousand times.

[Chorus]

It won't leave me alone

Disgust to purify
Kill you a thousand times.
