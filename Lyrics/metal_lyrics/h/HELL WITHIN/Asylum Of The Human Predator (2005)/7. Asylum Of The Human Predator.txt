[Chorus]
Save me one time won't you
Take this blackened heart and make it whole.
I don't fear for what I am
Is the fall of man.

Rape and worship

Life breeds death and disease
Empathy out of reach
We all wash with rain of blood skies
Pervert words that we read
Blind men die for beliefs
Fall back in the pit of tangled masses

[Chorus]

Sewn land of the free
Live in the shit you bathe yourself
God of your world
This piss stained mortuary hole
Just look around
We are the sheep left shepherd-less
True and perverse
We are the teeming maggots

[Spoken]
We are the collective scar across the face of existence itself.
We are the murderer, the rapist, the plague.
Consumed by hatred and loathing.

Life breeds death and disease
Empathy out of reach
We all wash with the rain of blood skies

Time soils our will
It breaks us down with every war
Child fucking priest
Religious zealots fuel the whore
The common man bleeds
Into the trough of those made rich
The pure and the sick
Kneel side by side as seconds tick.

Dear God
(can't you save us?)
Doesn't lift a finger for us now
(the blood is on our hands)

No more time
No more reason
No more lies
It's time we burn

[Chorus]

Rape and worship.
