Fill our minds with fear to blind us
The hoax is on
There were no weapons
It's a petty revenge
Vindication
Annihilate them
Ninety-one was nothing
This time we'll burn your cities down
We'll turn your blood to democracy
Just like Jesus would do.

[Chorus]
So let the children burn
They're only terrorist spawn
The blood crusade is on
A fool is at the helm
The idiot pilot of the killing machine
Make God and country proud.

Each step of treachery
(sell your)
A coalition... weak
(half truth's)
Pulpit of lies on holy ground
(with a smile)
Our young come home in bags
Sent to their death by our own
Who is the real murderer?

Light the match
Hit the gas
Send them all straight to Hell.

We watch it unfold
(an error of mass destruction)
Like we're living some twisted Tom Wait's song
(the blood is on our hands)

[Chorus]

Burn your nations down
So many died in a single breath
For blood and oil
So many died in a single breath
Ostracize us
So many died in a single breath
Sew our mouths shut
So many died in a single breath

[Chorus]
