Redemption... is a cold body.

Burned in the image of my everlasting torment
(scarred my flesh)
Murderer staked my heart
I'm better off dead than believing
That you could keep
Or want so blindly
A twisted mind
Trapped in a needled body

I keep these etchings on my wall
To remind me of what you've taken
Left me adrift for endless days
In a sea of my past addictions
Would you fix your image
In the reflection of my polished casket?
Or shed a single tear for a hopeless life ended abruptly?

I screamed to deaf ears
It didn't fucking matter
Drained white from empty words
Carved in the heart you shattered

You failed me...

[Chorus]
Killer
Murderer
Deny me of closure
These scars won't heal over
Rusted frames
All I had
Pictures of what was
I give to the flames
Watch you burn
Pick up your pieces and burn them all again
The smoldering ash
Embers of the past

Shadows unearthed your truest form
The heights of filth astound me
I cleansed myself of what's not real
I'd die just to pull you from me

Consumed inside
Corroded spirit
Words sear my flesh
Spit from the tongues of liars

Stretch the skin
Constricted breath
Face down in your world of mirrors

[Chorus]

The night wore on
In time I saw the sun
Familiar voice elusive

Everything you said rang hollow
We've read this story once
The end... a toppled kingdom
"I'll tell another lie and you'll believe me."

I'm not afraid to die
I'm just barely breathing
Crushed brittle bones to dust
When will we heed the lessons?

Hell is full
She walks the earth
Face down in your world of mirrors
