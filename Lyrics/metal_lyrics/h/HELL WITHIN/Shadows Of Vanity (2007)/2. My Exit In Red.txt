I've bled myself a river red
Well, I'll bleed for you no longer
Time will not be kept my master
My riddled body shakes
The fear inside me breaks
The arrowed tongue beckons me Crawl...
Enslaved my bitter soul
A hundred knives cutting, stabbing
My brittle bones
Ground in the grease of addiction
I've seen the end
Through many miles of long dead road
Leading nowhere
Have I stayed for too long?
Hold fast the moorings break
So frail the chains
You can't heal the wounds I've spent years on
So callous in our shame
Blind to what I hide
Grip the wheel, lead footed
Straight to my demise
No sympathy when the addict dies
I've seen the end
Through many miles of long dead roads
Leading nowhere
Beneath the river bed
A scarlet rive red
Flowing cold from the hole in my head
The lives that we make are only a prelude to our graves
A shell of a man takes his shot
Just one shot to the face
I'm blind to what I need
My resolve fast fading
Stomach knots
Evisceration
My god can't you set me free?
Lord, end this tragedy
I've seen the end
Through many mile of long dead roads Leading me nowhere
Beneath the river bed
A scarlet river red
Flowing cold from the hole in my head
My exit in red
Grant peace to me
