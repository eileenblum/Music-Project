You've got a heart like a loaded gun
Shed the skin and spare your eyes from what I've done
So You've got a game to play?
The deck is stacked so I'll walk away
I'm haunted by my lust for your taste
Cutting myself feels right
Sometimes I don't know if I'm alive
A siren haunting once silent shores
Weighted me down in the brine
I'd toss the key to my own shackles
To taste your lips just one last time
Blind men can't stare in wonder
Her snaking hips will pull you under
A burning kiss tastes of gasoline
Well on my way to the pyre
Just strike the match, my love
I'd die just to burn in your fire
In the absence of your fire...
The blackest waves to take my ship away
The spiraling decay of all we had
My angel, tie my noose of blackened halos
With every single breath
I die a little more
Cover my mouth
Sink your teeth in
I'll still love you blindly
Clawing at the walls that cage me
Why couldn't you just forgive me?
I know your hate
I've been there
It gets no better with every passing day
