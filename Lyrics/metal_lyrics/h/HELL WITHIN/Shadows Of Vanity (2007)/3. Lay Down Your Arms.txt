Constricting
Choked breathing
Serrated wounds left bleeding
(Why?)
The dead fall through empty eyes
(Scorch my black skies)
Escape with your life
I touch my hand to the fire
The numb seductress
Splintering decay
Burning numbered days
Feed on my blood until you get your fill
(Bear down and sink in)
Drain me until there empty eyes turn still
(Come take your Vengeance)
Such a vibrant heart
Blackened now, I left my mark
Give triumph to the poison
My lies were my own choices
Deaf ears can't kill these voices
Oceans burn
My time of losing
Cities fall
What am I chasing?
Tear down walls
Yet I don't see you on the other side
I still breathe your scent
A twisting knife
The fading light dies
Killers
Liars
Chase this shot of gasoline with fire
The fall and rebirth of the vile
One false step
One man down
Your words are daggers piercing through my soul
(I hear a calling)
Changing as your perfect skin turns cold
(Dead leaves are falling)
Our time was cut short by the ones you trusted
Bought their lies
I'm not a fallen man
Blood drawn from praying hands
Against me take you stand
On this night I fall
(I know you are listening)
Take me back to your prison
I got a taste for these four walls
Take me back to your prison
I got no taste for life
