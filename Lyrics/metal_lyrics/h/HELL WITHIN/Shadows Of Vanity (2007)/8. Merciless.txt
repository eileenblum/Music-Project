Yesterdays gone
Or so I was told
Tomorrow just another day old
I'm drowning hordes with pointing fingers
Stepping on the bones or another dead ringer
I know you all wish me hell behind your plastic smiles
A broken jaw will slow your tongue
You're too green to walk this mile
The pain instilled (my fist of retribution)
I take what I want, when I feel
From where I stand your nothing
Choose wise the ones who turn the screws
(I'll burn you down and smile)
For I've nothing to lose
A belly full
A silver spoon
A heretic inside your room
I've broken bigger men without much effort
Cut off the ties I've severed
So all at once or one at a time
A hollow point to ease your mind
No warning shot to quicken haste
Just fucking die
The pain instilled (my fist of retribution)
I take what I want, when I feel
From where I stand your nothing
Lsian by the hand that you left stained
Merciless in my hate
Don't appeal to me
For all I'll do is watch it bleed
Destroy another life for crimes so petty
Can't take back the life you buried
Open yourself to me and I'll recoil
The crippled lamb
The whoring daughter
The royal prince that's bred for slaughter
Cut from a cloth long since discarded
Expired to for which you bartered
You'll find no pity in my eyes
I'd just as soon watch you lie down
In this kingdom of shit
Built to reach the skies
