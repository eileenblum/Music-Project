Daylight
Four days you're gone
Still chasing sleep
Black spectres born from dark shadows in my mind
One step to the edge I'm taking
The last remnants of who I used to be
My still blackened skies
You've got to burn your eyes to see
Unguarded thoughts betray a frail mind
So what
If I lost all compassion?
(Just like you)
Would you make me a martyr?
I'm not afraid to die
Shut me up with some new damage
One step to the edge I'm taking
The last remnants of who I used to be
My still blackened skies
You've got to burn your eyes to see
Flowers for an empty grave
To your knees to brush away
An epitaph you just can't say
Between the leaves reads your name
The tide has washed you back to me
Into my arms lay you down to sleep
Call it love or just revenge
A fitting end for us, my friend
Time for mending came and went I tore you from my heart
So just walk away I tried to open your eyes
Your soul was shackled since the point of inception
There is no grace
So just fall away
The hourglass spans the length of a life time
