A writhing sleep
A waiting gun
A black premonition
A crow to follow home
So here we are again
The fork carved in the road
White knuckles grip the wheel
A full liquor tank set to blow
I'm not afraid
I don't give a fuck if I live or die
I just want to see twisted metal
The broken glass shards right through my eyes
For salvation a bullet ride
Not a stained glass prison of lies
Are you afraid?
You can't make it home
The crack faÃ§ade of love has left you stained black
Rotting and cold
So drink up
Let the acid burn
Deaf. Numb. Blind
Serenity in a gutter sleep
They'll make you feel at home in the absence of the truth
The only hole you'll get is in the comfort of the noose
She's soaking wet
This love's a crime
But goddamn it, it feels so good to watch the fear take over her eyes
So drink up
Let the acid burn
Deaf. Numb. Blind
Serenity in a gutter sleep
A velvet lining
Some words of prayer
Such a merciful god
(To the ship-like minions)
Thumbs his nose in the air 1234!
This ship of fools is going under
A broken mast impales the martyr
A blood red sky bled from our father
The spiral turns wine to water
Stained life from this debt
Take my last breath
