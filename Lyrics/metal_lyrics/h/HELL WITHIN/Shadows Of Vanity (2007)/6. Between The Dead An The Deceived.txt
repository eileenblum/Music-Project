I have opened my eyes to a world against me
A futile, weak offensive
Met head-on with crushing malice
I'd live on more days just to watch you die
For contempt, my savior I was not a cross that you'd bear
I am your bastard child
You see me in your eyes
Suffered your life I have
Drunk fucking liar
Into the arms of god
Willingly let you fall
For your place is hell
You left me there I know it well
Why have you forsaken me?
I was lost
Reared by a father's first
Lived the lie
Paid the cost
Crush all the ones who've wronged you
Rip out the tongue that scorned you
Therein redemption lies
Let them burn
Let them burn
Cut the marrow
Taste the barrel
End the sorrow
Let them burn
Light the fire
Stack the pyre
Hang the martyr
