I remain docile
panic panic
despite what you say i am still quite afraid
panic may arise
there will be no memorial to praise your name
panic may arise
shut your mouth as every last limb is amputated
who knew in ten years you'd just be gone?
and i think it's safe to say the days of wine and roses are over
in the event that someone passes away completely unaware that their life is about to pass before their eyes
panic may arise
