Your gift horse has brought flies
and the stench is unbareable
i'm left with no option,
but to embrace apathy and loneliness
hoping that i die

i took a train to new york city
met a guy who i THOUGHT was pretty

tiny strands of skin could never hold a whole
begging to nurse its mouth to health

strip the skin from the inside out
you didnt think they'd notice
(you looked them straight in the face)

i always said that we'd watch them die
(you looked them straight in the face)
