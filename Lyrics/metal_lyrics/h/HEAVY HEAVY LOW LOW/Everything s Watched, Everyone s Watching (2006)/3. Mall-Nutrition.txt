Throw me through this car window and land me outside
where i can breathe better and pass away alright
this is ill at ease and i worry, i worry
oh my god i felt my heart stop
i felt my fucking heart stop
but were going all the way
i only have myself to blame
oh they know, they know, they know
their eyes are tearing the skin from our bodies
and dressing us in guilt, filling our wounds with salt
my stomaches tying itself in knots and eating itself and everything else, there must be something in the water making this an awkward situation
