I am here, and you are here,
but we are not really here at all.

Chew them up,
build the fort,
they won't see where we're hiding.
I see the road slipping as our eyes glaze over.
Warnings, just keep those blanket and pillows coming, and turn those fucking lights off.
As long as we make it alive our ears will reject their babble, and we'll fall around like imbeciles.
