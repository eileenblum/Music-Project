It's the sun, it's the sun that's making me smile.
Fell asleep in that warm, warm sand.
I don't think I ever wanna wake up again.
Wake up, carried by ultraviolet waves and very ugly transparent dolphins to an island floating meters above the sea.
I am greeted by a lime green crab, he is bent on self destruction, on my destruction.
Uncomfortable with his statements, I inch my way
toward those fart soaked pillows that double as
floatation devices and paddle my way back out to the ultraviolet sea.
I sink down to my friends,
Mermaids with aids dressed like maids,
Got me laid, I raged
Stayed up all night at bars, had dinner with the sharks,
Woke up with whiskey farts,
I broke the mermaids hearts,
Didn't bounce a single narc,
and still I'd go again.
