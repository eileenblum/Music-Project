I chopped my head off,
we make love for hours and hours,
I sewed it back on at the neck, just to see what you would say.
And I sat there and I thought to myself,
I could watch this wall talk for hours,
while he talks to me he talks to me about life
and first round human beings like you and me,
like you and me.
