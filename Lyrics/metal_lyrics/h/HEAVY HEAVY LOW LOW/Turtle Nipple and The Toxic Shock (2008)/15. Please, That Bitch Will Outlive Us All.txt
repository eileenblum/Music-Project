Why are we still sneaking behind the backs of people we dont love anymore?
We dont love em anymore.
Because I am so sick of living in a bone dry marriage,
I dont even know what the fuck I'm even thing anymore,
my kids a fucking pervert he smears cum on the computer desk.
My husband, a money grubbing pill eating cheat,
but I cant say I dont pop em too though.
When I feel fuckin sick.
I feel fuckin sick.
Now that my gardens dried up,
what do I have to life for?
Where is the man of my dreams?
Wheres the cornucopia feast?
And cherry red convertible.
I wont ride the wings of my cockroach mother,
Im too young to die inside.
