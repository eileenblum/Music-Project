always always always always.
we breathe in sighs and breathes of desperation.

something (something) always seems to make its way in
and i end up looking paranoid.
i call em out, you can call em out,
see if they listen.
they never do.

something (something) always seems to make its way in.
bad case of day dreams, i dont mind, i do not mind.
i will pick from the tree of life ALL day EVERYday.

i just need to take a breath and realize that I have got a very big problem..
chapped lips unhinge, im losing my friends,
i need a break from living older.
