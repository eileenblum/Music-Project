My brain is thinking funny and I thought youâd relate,
Iâve got no money and I smell like shit.
Two cockroaches sit on a table
gather dust eaves dropping conversation.
Stone cold faces, hard hard times.
I love life but no pain is annoying,
fuck the skeletons in my closet,
Iâm so tired of their sad sad moans.

[Vincent Bennett:]
Iâm so tired of their sad sad moans
Iâm so tired of their sad sad moans
My brain is thinking funny and I thought youâd relate,
Iâve got no fucking money and I smell like shit...
