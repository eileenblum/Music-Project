Is this real is this even real
no one above me
i am below me gravel and bone am i smiling have i grasped the situation yet
I put my hand on my neck in a position where I can feel my pulse on my fingers
A strange sense of sadness passes over me
Starting at my eyes and ending in my toes
I start to grab at my chest and I feel everything burst my skin in hellfire
My body on earth choking on sorrys for the people who made me.
