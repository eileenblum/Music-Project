in your room
i'm in your head now
can you feel it?
can you feel this smelling your hair?
it's okay that you're the answer that i can't seem to formulate
are you claustrophobic?
blood is the new fashion
when your face shatters like porcelain bullets
wounds gape like open sewers
it's okay
this is what they're doing in europe
strangling flowers into ocean blue
you're the rock and i'm the roll
so tilt your gaping neck and let the good times flow
