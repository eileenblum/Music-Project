i've packaged my emotions
it's limited edition in the new clear vinyl
this one's guaranteed to make you weep with the pretty print
oh we'll sell it all with the words that kiss your skin
my heart is your collector's edition
you wanted pain and you're getting it
oh what a time you'll have with my misfortunes
