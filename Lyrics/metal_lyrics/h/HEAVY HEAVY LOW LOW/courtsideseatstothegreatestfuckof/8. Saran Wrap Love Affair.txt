you are a sunset
you paint a perfect portrait
and with just one touch i'll be fucking sold
i am a ghost
i am transparent
consider the consequence of a young boy's smile
chapped lips and intentions
consider the description of a young boy's smile whose every love is separated by his own fear
and whose song will soon be sung
this is a saran wrap love affair
