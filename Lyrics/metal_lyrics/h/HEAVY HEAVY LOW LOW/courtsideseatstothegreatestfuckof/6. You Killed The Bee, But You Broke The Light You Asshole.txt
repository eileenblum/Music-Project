how's the water
let's drown ourselves tonight in sappy goodbyes and witty remarks to keep our smiles from ear to ear
let's pretend this isn't killing us
i'm comatose
not asleep
all they are are paper cutouts of what we'll never be
and the sunset will not grace our faces the same
oh no
let's fucking slit our throats and save others the trouble of falling in love
