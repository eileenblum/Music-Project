blood's not enough to give to you
blood's not enough to change your mind
what's worse is when you're assured that this state could be deemed as something more than what we had to think
i'll never see you sleep without rope or tape
one is lost and one is gained
and when you're gone it's so easy to reclaim your heart from sorrow
revenge was on the tip of my tongue
and i will die before i let this go
take these words and bury them with me
and as for you
you were gone before they ever left my mouth
but can you get your fill?
i can't live with or without these memories
but i can live without you
