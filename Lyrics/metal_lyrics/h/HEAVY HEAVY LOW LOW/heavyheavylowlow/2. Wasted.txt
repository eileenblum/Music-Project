[Black Flag Cover]

I was so wasted
I was a hippie
I was a burnout
I was a dropout
I was out of my head
I was a surfer
I had skateboard
I was so heavy, man
I lived on the strand

I was so wasted

I was so fucked up
I was so macked up
I was so screwed up
I was out of my head
I was so jacked up
I was so drugged up
I was so nebbed out
I was out of my head

I was so wasted
I was wasted
