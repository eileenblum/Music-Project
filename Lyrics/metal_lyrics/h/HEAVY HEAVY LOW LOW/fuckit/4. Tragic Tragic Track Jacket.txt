It was the faulty foundation
said the weeping eyes
the architecture bends under pressure
the architecture broke over lies
they said "just a trend"
they said "just a phase"
they were right
now every person in this place will lose their fucking lives
i am a burning building bringing everyone inside to the ground
in the time it takes
to make things right
we'll make new memories
this feeling will have passed
i'll have said goodbye
you'll have gone and went
i'll turn my back on the only meaning in my past
what destroys me
will have saved my life
we are gone
i am a burning building bringing everyone inside to the ground
