Fight Fight Fight find them 
Fight Fight Fight hunt them 
Fight Fight Fight kill them 
Fight Fight Fight show no mercy! 

Kill Kill Kill the enemy 
Kill Kill Kill all of them 
Kill Kill Kill everyone 
Kill Kill Kill show no mercy! 

ThatÂ´s an command! 
You would do well to obey! 

I gathered you my soldiers 
Because I know you are elite 
Find for me the cowards who did this to us 
Let them pay for their deeds, bring me their skulls 

You donÂ´t have to question 
my orders. DonÂ´t even 
think about it. 
All you have to do is kill! 

My word is law! 
Bring me their skulls! 

If it would be the highest mountain 
Or deepest see 
Kill them for me 
Bring me their skulls 
Come over them like hungry wolfs 
And kill them for me 
Bring me their skulls 

Show no mercy 
Find for me the enemy 
Kill their whole family 
Show no mercy 

ThatÂ´s their very own guilt 
Like they craved for this pain 
I tell you just one thing 
They should have let me paint! 
Let them taste the smell of gas! 
Let them die like dirty rats! 
Let them taste the smell of gas! 
Let them die like dirty rats! 

He wanted to be 
Master of all puppets 
All he did was just 
Bringing shame on his love 

DonÂ´t dare to listen to lies of the weak! 

In the end there is nothing left 
Everything lies in ashes, in ruins 
Revenge is the only thing left 
Nothing more is there alive 
He destroyed the shining past 
Just to becalm his selfish thoughts
