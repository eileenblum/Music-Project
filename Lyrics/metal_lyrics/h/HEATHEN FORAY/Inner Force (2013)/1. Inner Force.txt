Another year, Another time of struggle 
 You went with us through all the highs and lows you can imagine 
 Another year, another time of real big fights 
 Standing on stages only for you my dearest friends 

 Sometimes it looked like we will loose the fight 
 We put in this hard work our sweat and tears and blood 
 Sometimes it looked like we wonÂ´t make it anymore 
 Every time we got smashed on the ground you straightend us up 

 You know this longing deep inside 
 You know this feelings you canÂ´t hide 
 This are the reasons for our fights 
 We will forever stand our ground 
 Through the music we are bound 
 Nothing will stop us we'll rather die 

 We hear this call out there 
 Noway to ignore this yearn 
 There is this inner force 
 Pushing us right to the top 
 Till the end we will stand up for sure 
 Chasing our dreams for you 
 Till the end we we will fight 
 No one can this deny! 

 This time weÂ´re going right to the edge 
 With full force and we wont need sleep or rest 
 This time weÂ´re going right to our limits 
 And again we need your help to give our best
