The winds are chasing me on and on 
But I am still alive 
It's burning me from the inside out 
I won't fall right now 
I thought that I could forget 
But that was just illusion 

I will never forget 
The time we shared 
I am carrying on 
From now on your image strengthens me 
The clouds are drifting away 

What are my options now 
to live despite this past with you 
Head up high 
looking back with pride 
I wonÂ´t regret anymore 

Asked myself about you 
Hundred times 
But what am I in your life? 
Am I present, do I atend 
In your dreams, in your world? 
Do I take part? 
I don't wan t to be illusion 

The sun is comming out again 
I won't sit in darkness nomore 
Removing all these chains 
I'm disengaded from this illusion 
from the past 
so I could be free again!
