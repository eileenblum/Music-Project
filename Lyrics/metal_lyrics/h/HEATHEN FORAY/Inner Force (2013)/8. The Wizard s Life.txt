Night, long ago 
When this faithful child was born 
Prophecy in his hands 
Blessed with power of the gods 

Fire burning in his mind 
Dusk of the light 
Evil creeping in his soul 
Blood will run on 
This lands barren earth 

Loosing all through battles pride 
He was hiding in the woods 
Lost his mother the day before 
Through the hands of weeping dawn 

Couldnât wait for revenge to come 
Studied spells of pagan birth 

He heard the voices in the trees 
Telling him secrets long untold 
He felt the power in his heart 
Unleashing fury in the winds 
Reaching out for revenge to be 
Time for him was now 

Anger was rising 
Mercy beyond him 
He burned the souls 
Of countless of men 

He vow vengeance 
Took lives among them 
He got revenge 
But he couldnât cease 

Far away in the realms of wrath 
Roamed a man on the darkest path 
Blinded eyes by his inner strife 
Hear the tale of the Wizardâs Life 

War felt on every man and woman 
Death crept this land of fear 
Spells casted in the ruins of daylight 
Skies red as dyed from blood 

Knights on the hunt for the head of the wizard 
Caught in the woods after days of journey 
Seduced by spells of pagan Magic 
Hit by a sword in the middle of his abstruse heart 

Now he lies down to the feet of 
The knights of weeping dawn 
Passing away with his last breath 
He lost his power
