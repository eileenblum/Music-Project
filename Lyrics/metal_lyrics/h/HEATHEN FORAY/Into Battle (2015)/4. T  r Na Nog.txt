Riding through stormwind and waves across the sea
We leave our home behind to be free
Night and day we are awake
Craving to fulfill our fate

For so long in the dessert of blue 
Accompanied by the bravest crew
TÃ­r na nÃg on our mind
With his greatest treasures to find

No fear of death or just jeopardy
Forever young that's what we want to be
Living in the land of eternal youth

Since a monk told us the story
Of this land where lives no worry
TÃ­r na nÃg on our mind
With his greatest treasures to find

We are sailing the seas and searching the realms
With the only ambition to redeem our mission

So we'll row, row our ship, till the end of our trip
Not fearing Ran or the snake, we will fulfill our fate
