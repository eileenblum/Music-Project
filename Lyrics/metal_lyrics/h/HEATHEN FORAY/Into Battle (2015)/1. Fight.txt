Metal is my heart, my soul, it is charging my inner self
It streams wild through the veins, releasing me from my chains

Giving me the power to be free

Let us hear your cry for battle, shouting out: Forever Metal!
Never calm! Come on, move on!
Stand your ground for this sound!

With the gods on our side we will fullfill our fate forever
Fullfill our fate forever and ever!

We will fight, fight with the pride we have inside
There is no reason for us to hide
Raise your flags, stand your ground and march forever to this sound
Our hearts are pounding as one, a revolution is going on
It will lead us the way as long we fight!

United we stand for Metal, it doesn't matter where you're from
It doesn't matter which group, which religion you belong

A force that connects us all!

We honour gods like Bathory, Venom the great and Manowar
We're burning for Finsterforst, Adorned Brood and Battlelore
