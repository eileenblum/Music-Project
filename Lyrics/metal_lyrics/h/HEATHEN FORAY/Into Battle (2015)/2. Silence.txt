Where I'll be there will be blood
Nowhere to hide
Raging through the legions of mud
Destroying their filthy pride

And the floods of blood are streaming 
The old mother she is grinning 
Fondling me with her cold hand
I deliver her call in every land

Goddess of the night
Goddess of death
Ruler of the realms in the north
Cover! Cover me with darkness
From now on I will be your well behaved child

Reaching out for everyone
I do not suspend
Breaking up your screaming masks
Till the cathartic end

Golden light of natureâs power shining on the lifeless cities
In the blooming fields of doom there is just one step to do
The last of you - it will be me, marching into the longest night
At last there is just silence...
