Since countless days he does ride
To distant lands of legends
His skin is frozen from snow
Only to serve his master

He has to run
Spread the word
Of his lord!
To save souls
From their sins!
They don't knew
That they have committed!

Over mountains he does strive
Right down to deepest valleys
Light dances on his pail face
Slave to faith and prophets

He has to run
Spread the word
Of his lord!
To save souls
From their sins!
They don't knew
That they have committed!

He is the messenger of God
He spreads the faith of lies and blood
Enemy of freedom of thought
He is the messenger of God
The real meaning he forgot
I will not stop until he rots

People unite against this oppression
Unite against centuries of false hope
You now have to join your forces
To destroy the chains of this false God

His aim is to convert us
Until we are all like him
No sense for freedom of thought
The end of all free spirits

He has to run
Spread the word
Of his lord!
To save souls
From their sins!
They don't knew
That they have committed

He is the messenger of God
He spreads the faith of lies and blood
Enemy of freedom of thought
He is the messenger of God
The real meaning he forgot
I will not stop until he rots

[Solo]

People unite against this oppression
Unite against centuries of false hope
You now have to join your forces
To destroy the chains of this false God!

He is the messenger of God
He spreads the faith of lies and blood
Enemy of freedom of thought
He is the messenger of God
The real meaning he forgot
I will not stop until he rots
