Enemies of the light envoys from the other side
Mounted might. We choose the night
Try to stand our pride
Enemies of the light checkless blight. Omnicide
We are born for the fight

We are wolfs. We are dragons. We are hate and
We are fear. Our home is the battlefield
That's where you will get immortal

We are wolfs. We are dragons. We are hate and
We are fear. Our home is the battlefield
That's where you will get immortal

My foul breath is your judgment
Close your eyes and let it be
My cold hands are your judgment
Close your eyes and let it be

Give away all your hopes
Surrender your souls to our cause
You don't even have a chance
Resistance is futile
Resistance is futile
Tonight you will see whats pain
More than one time
More than one time
We are the blight
Grab you tight
We will infest your mind

[Solo]

War is our life
Death stands beside
Darkness surrounds our grim way

We are wolfs. We are dragons. We are hate and
We are fear. Our home is the battlefield
That's where you will get immortal

We are wolfs. We are dragons. We are hate and
We are fear. Our home is the battlefield
That's where you will get immortal

Till Eternity we will fight
No one will be left alive
Till Eternity we will fight
No one will be left alive

Till Eternity we will fight!
