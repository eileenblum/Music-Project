It is a day like so many before
Only cold wind and rain behind the closed door
Only darkness fulfills the saturnine room
I am sitting lonely in perfect gloom

I haven't seen the sun
Since the day you left me
No easy smile on my face
It's not easy to be
Never again
I can feel your skin
Tender and soft
And pale like milk

Now I can hear the winds outside calling my name.
But they won't get me. Not yet. I will resist
Someday I will forget you and this whole time
I will forget you and I will surmount

In past times we fought against the Darkness of life
We stood forever together like one
I thought that no one could ever tear us apart
I never thought that it will be so fast

[Solo]

In past times we fought against the Darkness of life
We stood forever together like one
I thought that no one could ever tear us apart
But I have to accept that now you are gone

It is a day like so many before
I will forget you and I will surmount
