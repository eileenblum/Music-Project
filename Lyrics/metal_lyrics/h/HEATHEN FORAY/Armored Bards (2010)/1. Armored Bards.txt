We went through the darkest hours only to be here for you
We fought the hardest battles just for you
We left the highest mountains and the deepest seas behind
Only to play tonight our songs for you

We are the armored bards from behind the Alps
We are here â to hear you scream
Come with us on a journey to
Your destiny

Tonight we're not here to struggle
We're here to make party hard
With you together we are one power
One Power which never fails
No one will ever stop us because we are the mighty
Force of Foray
Join us if you dare and become immortal

We are armored bards
We believe in ancient Gods
We are warriors
We claim the top
We are armored bards
No one stops us
We are warriors
We know our roots
We are heathens proud and brave

We are the armored bards from behind the Alps
We are here â to hear you scream
Come with us on a journey to
Your destiny

We are armored bards!
We are armored bards!
We are armored bards!
We are armored bards!

[Solo]

Forget your troubles till this day
Because now you are with us
Stay strong and brave and don't regret
You are a part of us
We are heathens proud and brave

We are the armored bards from behind the Alps
We are here â to hear you scream
Come with us on a journey to
Your destiny
