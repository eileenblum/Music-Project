Let me tell you about Hannibal
The mighty Carthagian.
He is one of the greatest warriors of all time

At the age of nine he swore an oath
He will never tolerate Romes intrigue
He will fight forever against them
All for his beloved Carthage

For our homeland
I will fight forever!
Nothing will ever stop me
I will stand my ground!
For our homeland
I will fight forever!
I will raise my sword in my hand
Even if it will be my end!

Nunquam ingenium idem ad res diversissimas
Parendum atque imperandum. Habilius fuit
Vincere scis Hannibal Victoria
Uti nescis Hannibal ad portas

For our homeland
I will fight forever!
Nothing will ever stop me
I will stand my ground!
For our homeland
I will fight forever!
I will raise my sword in my hand
Even if it will be my end!

Hasdubal my brother,
Come to me with a new army
Hasdubal my brother,
Together we'll ride to meet our fate

Hannibal my brother
I tried so hard to arm you well
Hannibal my brother
The Romans ambushed me

Melqart let me kill
With mercy of Baal Hammon
I will win the fight
Reshepf guide me through this battle
I will assert our right

For our homeland
I will die forever!
Nothing will ever stop me
I will stand my ground!
For our homeland
I will die forever!
I raised my sword
It was Carthage's end!
