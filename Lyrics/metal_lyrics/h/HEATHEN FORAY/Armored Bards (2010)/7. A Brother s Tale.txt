In the land of ice, ice, ice and snow
A child was abandoned by his own
Destined to become a great, great warrior
Soon to discover his true ancestry

He is the twin brother of the despot king
Thrown away to clean the path for his younger sibling
His purpose is to reconquer his throne
He craves to bring freedom to this kingdom

Standing on the crossroad
He has to decide his path
Blinded eyes by his inner strive
One of the brothers can't survive

Will he spill his own blood
Will he leave the righteous path
Will he end his brother's deeds
Will he sow freedom's seeds

The twin opponents meet face, face, face to face
The whole kingdom holds his breath
Weapons meet and bodies crush, crush, crush in pain
He brought everlasting peace to his kith and kin

[Solo]

Standing on the crossroad
He has to decide his path
Blinded eyes by his inner strive
One of the brothers did not survive

He has spilled his own blood
Did he left the righteous path
He has ended his brother's deeds
He has sown freedom's seeds
