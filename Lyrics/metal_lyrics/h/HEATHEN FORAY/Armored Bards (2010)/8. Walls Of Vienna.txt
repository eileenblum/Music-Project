Oriental flags are blowing in the shimmering red
Wind praising an army on large scale
Behind the city walls warriors strengthen themselves
Do not give up until the last drop of blood

They marched cumbersome and far from Turkey
Against the land of the Alps to bring ruin
The rugged landscape has no pity
With the Ottomans

We keep these walls. Maybe it's the last we do
No mercy. No fear. We make a stand
For the city we so love we must hold at all costs
No mercy. No fear. We make a stand

Wave after wave they're coming
Our swords are just few
Defending Vienna's walls
Our blood is heated
Let us give them the rest
Do not give up until the last drop of blood

They marched cumbersome and far from Turkey
Against the land of the Alps to bring ruin
The rugged landscape has no pity
With the Ottomans

We keep these walls. Maybe it's the last we do
No mercy. No fear. We make a stand
For the city we so love we must hold at all costs
No mercy. No fear. We make a stand
