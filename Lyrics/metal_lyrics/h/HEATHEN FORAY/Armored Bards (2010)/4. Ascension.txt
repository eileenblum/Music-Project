Face to face we meet on the field
Two men sworn to kill for eternity
Only the strongest will survive
Draw your sword and let us fight

The first blow meets and rips my shield â
My shield broke apart
My defense destroyed
Try to defend my chest against the next attack
My weapons are useless

I give â I give my live into oblivion
But I rise again
To let my arch enemy pay!
Enemy pay!
You shall â You shall not forget my face
For I hunt you down
Until my revenge is here!
Revenge is here!

But your broad sword into my heart
Kill me. Do what must be done
Blackness opens up before my eyes
Freedom, the circle is complete

Soon â Soon I have my full revenge
I will rise again
And bring you down right to your knees!
To your knees!

The sun sets and so begins the new
The new circle â circle â forever trapped
Tomorrow we will meet once more
Once more!
We will never be free
