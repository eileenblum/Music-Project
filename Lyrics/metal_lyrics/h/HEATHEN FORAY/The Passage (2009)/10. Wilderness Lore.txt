Edging away in the morning sun
Out to the woods to escape from traitors
Fast as a the dashing wolf
Leaving my live behind

Can you hear the falcons call
Shouting out for you
Wolfs are chasing through the woods
Passed by just a few

Hear the call of wilderness
Pass the trees on horseback
Haunted down by betrayers
Wilderness lore

My new live under the midday sun
Far away from my past life
Sitting on the river side
Nature's call is mine

Hear the call of wilderness
Pass the trees on horseback
Haunted down by betrayers
Wilderness lore

They found me in the setting sun
Pursuing me for countless days now
Strong is my pounding heart
Never shall I obey
