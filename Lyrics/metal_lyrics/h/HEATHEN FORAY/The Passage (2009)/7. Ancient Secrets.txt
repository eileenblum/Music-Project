The journey begins my life has ended
Riding in winds the night awaits
My aim is near dark path before me
Crying no tear my spirit awakes

Time has come

I crossed the Bridge of twilight
Escaping from the curse on my side
Hiding from shadows of ancient secrets

The golden hall so majestic
Warriors of Odin horns full of wine
The one eyes told me answers of wisdom
I hear the hammer now I can see

Time has come
