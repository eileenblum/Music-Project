Hail -- Hail to the Gods
That our ancestors praised in the woods
Skald -- Narrate us the tale
Of the God with sorrow in his heart
Tell us his fears

Odin the great sits enthroned Hlidskialf
Looking down to Midgard in deep grief

Tears in the eye you wouldn't believe it
Tears in the eye of the great God
See the fall of Odin's warriors
Snow keeps falling in this frozen land

Hail -- Hail to the Gods
That our ancestors saw in the skies
Snow -- Coating the land
Endless darkness rises from now
No more light

Under the oak we used to meet
To praise the Gods of forgotten times
Now it stands alone in the forest glade
The Whipping winds tear if the leaves
No one sees the fading tree
It passes away from the light of day
