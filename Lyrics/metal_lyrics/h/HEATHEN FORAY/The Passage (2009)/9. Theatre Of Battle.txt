We are awaking from the night
Arming ourselves
For the theatre of battle
Long time eager for the fight
Arming ourselves
For the theatre of battle

Marching to the battle with no fear
In our hearts
Killing in the name of our clan

Voices calling in the dawn
Coming closer
Storming into the fog
Flags are waving
Silence dies by our horns
Souls are crying
Torches lighting in the dark
Swords are blazing

Ca you see the arrows fly
Slowly pouring down
The first men are dying
Let us hear the battlecry
The enemies are dying

Blood covered faces begging
For our mercy
Killing in the name our clan
