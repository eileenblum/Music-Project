Riders of honor
On the Quest for gold and glory
They make for the mountains
Dark Dungeons they will seek

Reign if the dragon
All will die in darkness
For the name of honor
Nobody will prevail

They ride into darkness
The eyes are full of fury
Seeking for sleeping one
Their swords hunger for blood

Lives seem so useless
All will die in fire
Fighters for glory
The end is coming soon

Those eyes so cold hearts of ice
I see my life through the dragon's eyes
I see right through darkest skies
I see the lies through the dragon's eyes

Blood on their weapons
Nobody will escape now
All of them are dying
With fire in their shields

Riders of honor
On the quest for gold and glory
Nobody will remember
The next will follow soon
