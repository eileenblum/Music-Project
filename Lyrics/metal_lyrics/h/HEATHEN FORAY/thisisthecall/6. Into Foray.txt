[Music : S. Lawler, lyrics G. Beasley]

Onward we march to war
Family and friends we are fighting for
To face indestructible foes
Give me the strength to wield my sword

We fight together side by side
Into the foray nowhere to hide
Over the enemy lines we ride
The air is filled with deathly cries

Weary we still advance
Behind cold armour, shield and lance
Amongst the dying and amongst the dead
The battlefield runs a bloody red

We broke their pride, showed them the way
Triumphant chants, this glorious day
Tomorrow the sun still shines
And claim this victory as mine!
