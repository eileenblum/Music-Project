Went for a walk on summers day
Never had a clue what would come my way
Into the forest I did stray
Only companion was a flag of ale

Wandering in to the forest deep
Weary that I was I collapsed in heap
Closing my eyes did I go to sleep
Suddenly I froze with a sense of disbelief

Who was that the standing there
Before me a lady with auburn hair
Blinded by the mid-sun glare
All I could do was gaze and stare

A SUMMER'S TALE?

Beckoning me with a twinkling eye
I rose to my feet I was hypnotized
To this very day I don't know why
Simply addicted by her enchanting smile

I was lead down a path to this magic place
Her beauty was divine but I canât recall her face
She flavoured well my primal tastes
All day long till the sunlight fades

Sapped my strength till I couldnât go on
Never believed I could last so long
A kiss, a goodbye and then she was gone
Bewildered, I reflected had I done wrong?

A SUMMER'S TALE!

I returned to the forest everyday
Never told a soul about what came my way
The strangest thing of this summers tale
Was it reality, or was it the ale?
