The gods of elements heed our call upon the very day
Northern winds caressed our sails and sent us on our way
Descending to your sacred shores beneath a crimson sky
Bearing gifts of conflict and war under banners flying high
Hail!
Hail!
Hail! Hail! Hail!

Under the stars and under the sun
Brothers and sisters unite as one
Till the battle is fought and won
This is the call to arms

This is the call â Heed the call!
This is the call â Heed the call!
This is the call â Heed the call!
This is the call to arms!

The pounding hooves of cavalry shake the very earth
Majestic knights with sword and shield sworn to break the curse
Breaking the curse of those tyrants, we shall hear their cries
Impaled upon our avenging spears we laugh as they die
Hail!
Hail!
Hail! Hail! Hail!

Under the stars and under the sun
Brothers and sisters unite as one
Till the battle is fought and won
This is the call to arms

This is the call â Heed the call!
This is the call â Heed the call!
This is the call â Heed the call!
This is the call to arms!
