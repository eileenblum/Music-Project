The warriorâs path, for you to decide
A warriorâs path, a sword by your side
A warriorâs path, your fate in your hands
A warriorâs path, to distant lands

The warriorâs path, a hunger for war
A warriorâs path, a tavern, a whore
A warriorâs path, life under the skies
A warriorâs path, who knows when youâll die

The warrior's path, a maiden to save
A warriorâs path, a one man crusade
A warriorâs path, no guilt and no shame
A warriorâs path, ignoring the pain

The Path of the warrior, nomadic the life
Path of the warrior, the law of the knife
Path of the warrior, and warriorâs deeds
Path of the warrior, to Valhalla it leads
