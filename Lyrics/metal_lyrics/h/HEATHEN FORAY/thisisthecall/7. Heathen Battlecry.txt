26th November 2006 you did heed the call to arms
And you formed a pagan army to change these tragic times
To battle drums we marched together destination unclear
But the fire raging within our hearts subsided all our fears

Off we go,
We donât know
Still we are sure
We ready our weapons for war ...

THE BATTLEFIELD - Beckons us all once again
THOSE INFIDELS - will die in bloody flames
OUR FORCE - will conquer all that stand before us
When we unleash our HEATHEN BATTLECRY!

Music to my ears the infidels scream like a banshees bloody wail
This does indeed inspire us all to ensure our cause wonât fail
Each and everyone one us here would rather fall then taste defeat
So together our circle won't break within the battle heat

On our way
To the fray
Weâll seize the day
And enter the Heathen Foray ...

THE BATTLEFIELD - Beckons us all once again
THOSE INFIDELS - will die in bloody flames
OUR FORCE - will conquer all that stand before us
When we unleash our HEATHEN BATTLECRY!

BATLECRIES - Echo in the mountainside
THOSE INFIDELS - now slaves in living hell
HEATHEN FORCE â as testament for those who fell beside us
Honour their deeds with a HEATHEN BATTLECRY!
