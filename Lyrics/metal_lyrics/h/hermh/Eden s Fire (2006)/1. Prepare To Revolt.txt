Incline your forehead to receive the sign
Incline yourself low to worship
Here's the reward
Habitation of eternity
Here's the reward
Sit close at my side

I am who million and one time hunted
Lose for me is to give away everything
Our kingdom - eternity of redness
Our kingdom - lair of desime

Time of assembly is close
Time of harvest comes
Follow the hand of power
Follow the sign of ancient eternities
Keys are within me
Code is my body
Time of assembly is close
Time of harvest comes

Consume for the last time the communion of power
Soak ritually the hands in my flesh
Touch the heart
Bring forth destruction
Touch the soul
Gaze into future

Prepare your body
For the baptism of the dead one
Mysteries of the universe threshold you cross today
And again - I am the master
You necromancer
Boundaries made from today are no more
Boundaries of the universe you now appoint
Revolt time is now
Time to start infecting
Let the virus of eternity achieve triumphs
Let the virus of eternity  rule over them

I put aside my hand from your temple
Blessed for ever
Blessed you are by THEM!
