Two millenia I adhere you
Millions of generations brought to naught
You infiltrate my body
With a treacherous hunger

In the temple of death, at the feet of devotion
Ages still with you
Sanctuary of venom still lasts within me
I give away my whole
To the virus of paleness
I give away my whole
To the virus of paleness

I am eternal
You're never-ending
Venom is within me
Intoxicating for ages

My body torn by tremors
Like in agony
I scorch my stigma
Marking the path

My pale green pupils
With madness they mist
My fangs and claws
Always ready
My throat prepared
To feel the taste of redness
My body awaits the communion of life

Whether wings I spread
Whether fangs I drive
Feeling meat
And the warmness of your existence

You deliver fury and wrath
Controlling my mind
Leading me
Making me invisible among the living
I am the undead fear

Whether wings I spread
Whether fangs I drive
Feeling meat
And the warmness of your existence
