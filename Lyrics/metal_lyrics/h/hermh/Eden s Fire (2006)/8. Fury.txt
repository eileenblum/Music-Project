"Sticking nails into your bare neck
I furrow with claws your innocence
Nectar of life flows straight to my throat
Slowly you withdraw
Pale-green body descends to the hard ground
I am the master and lord"

Kneeling at your body I am your keeper and servant
Nervously seeking your breath
Nervously lifting your eyelids
Grey pupils vocalize image of betrayer
Grey pupils reflect his face
Grey pupils vocalize image of betrayer
Grey pupils reflect his face

I am the servant of blood
Rage is my power
Rage is the redeemer of souls
I am the servant of blood
Rage is my power

Return thou can not
I shall wash your blood from his
Cleansing my face
With his soul's wax
I shall look right into your pupils
To strengthen the image
Cleansing my face with his blood
Shriveling arteries
Into the sun I shall expose in day

I am the servant of blood
Revenge is my power
Revenge is the redeemer of souls
I am the servant of blood
Revenge is my power

And I feel his breath and the taste of his blood
Sword is my arm, blade is my hand
I emerge from the earth
Kingdom mine where I am
His heart is my trophy

I am the servant of blood
