Hour is here by eternity measured
Eternity is from ages annealed
By hour, in which born will be pain
In endless depths of bloody plains

When seventh seal bursts - by dagger injured
You fall right into my arms
Today hell will be your paradise
When rapture in frenzy arrives

Sin you call me
Before daybreak will set in
Admitting that eternity will pass
When hunger of life shall arise

Call me death
Call me everlasting
Call me immortality
I will be sin

Death I dispense
Eternity I return
With deathlessness endow
In sin I dream on

Reminding gods their calling
When the era of nonexistence supervenes
Reproaching kingdoms
And their regency

Time of vengeance draws near the hour of uprising
I am appointed and from gods retaken
Arising from gods hatred
