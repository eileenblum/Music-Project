Endless depth of inexhaustible desires
Only the scent!
Only the taste!
Nothing else do I feel
Imperious albugo begs - more!!!
Savour of redness
Smell of power
I await the imperfect creatures in the cave of my rule
To take off the voke of degradation
To take back the cross of affront
Only fear is my ally
Only hunger is my inspiration
The taste of blood - eternal commitment

I want to enter into your pupils
Like the glitter of the sun dazzle your body
Take rapture from your struggle
I want to enter into your soul
Like acid dissolve your body
Take rapture from your impuissance
One bridge is not enough!!!!

Exonerate you I shall like the serpent's venom
Exonerate you I shall like I was told to

I arrive from the endless depth
I arrive from the opened limbos

I know the language of the dead
Spreading the virus of condemnation
Eternity rejection
Death itself nauseates at the site of me
Albugo battles for power
I am dead in eternity I last

Recognize your scent I shall
Recognize your taste I shall
Waiting for you
Among the eternity of stars
