Six days six nights given away
A pair of arms that desire
And crave bent in half

You're there I'm here
You know who I am?
I've craved and desired...

I raise my fist like in the beginning...
I raise it in the name of truth
In the name of truth I hit Christ's face
He condemns me, crushed with the wood of the cross
But he doesn't raise again!

It was me who in hatred spat in Christ's face!

And again I drive the thorn of truth in the Messiah's temple
He condemns me again!

It was him who left his imprint on me!
It was him who condemned me!
You'll understand this when the time comes!

The whirlwind of the night draws me into the infinity of my blasphemies
Payday has come!
For famine and for condemnation!

Then come kiss me
So that I can leave
With the feel of your lips
For the boundless depths of the night
Just as always!!!!
