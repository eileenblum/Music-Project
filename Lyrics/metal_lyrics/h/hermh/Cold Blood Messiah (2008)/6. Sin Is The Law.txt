Aware of my own body
Aware of it s being
Within me lies verify
Cognition of truth is the sin
My body serves the truth
My body serves the Law the law of sin

Sin is the Law!
I drink to the bottom of pride!
Sin is the Law!
I move from Sodom to Gomorrah!

O death, where is thy harvest?
O grave, where is thy cold?
You, who absolve sins with phrases
You, who demand payment for salvation
You, who speak of corruption!
Gorging your stomach with envy!
Rotting in your golden palaces and rumbling with fear!
You, who absolve sins with phrases
You, who demand payment for salvation

Messengers of distinctive goodness
Trading with conscience
Ignoring the truth
Suggesting lies
Pain is not suffering
Salvation for aims

Sin is the Law!
SALIGIA!
Sin is the Law!
ZU-EN!
Sin is the Law!
NANNAR!

What more can I say?
Sin is the Law!
Sin is the path to cognition
Sin is freedom

I drink from the chalice of pride!
I move from Sodom to Gomorrah!
