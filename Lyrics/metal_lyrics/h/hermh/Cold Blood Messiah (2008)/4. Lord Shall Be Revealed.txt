Even until now lives a settled conviction, that salvation can be bought here, on the Earth, by praying the so called offering to the priest of grace.
For centuries the human naivety has been used by the Catholic Church to debauch its stomach and magnify its fortune.
Bargaining the salvation is just another hypocrisy of the Catholic Church, and since money is the instrumentum daiboli, where really hides the Beast?

And that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the Beast, or the number of his name.
[Revelation 13:17]

I cleanse my body in the blood-red crystal sea
Bestial amok lasts
Pure soul, pale flesh, ice-cold breath

Altar prepared, whiteness clean, golden candlesticks
Chalices in diamonds, the smell of incense
Innocent souls, naive children
Vulgar herd awaits salvation

I've sold my soul to the truth
Life path winding, but free
I let it flow in harmony
With nature, my animal humanity.

Another bell tolls for the hour of coming
Another chime of lies
Odour of hypocrisy and false saints

The Lord is coming
Lord of Hosts
Black not heavenly
Open thee soul

Figures dissolved by my eyesight
Wax nobility
Flour and water raised above
Grape drink tastes like blood
Shawls of mendacity
White bread and flesh
Hands folded in triangle
Sign of the cross
Sacrifice fulfilled.
