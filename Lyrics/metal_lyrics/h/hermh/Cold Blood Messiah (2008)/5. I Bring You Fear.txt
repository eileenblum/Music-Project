Imposition, understood as fulfilling and
Applying to commandments or truths by preaching, is apart from intimidation the
Essence of religion.
Fear itself dominates, as a part of the leash on the way to salvation.
fear mainly paralyses the common-sense and rational thinking, and therefore it s a perfect tool of authority.

if anyone worships the beast and his image,
and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand,
he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of god,
which is poured out full strength into the cup of his indignation.
he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels
And in the presence of the Lamb
[Revelation, 14:9-10]

I ll bring you fear
But fear not
You ll get wisdom
You ll get freedom
I bring you fear
I take away life
I bring you fear
Another existence
You ll get wisdom
You ll get freedom
I bring you fear
You ll get freedom

Spit out the pain of existence
Reveal thy name
Repeat the truth
Not lies
Repeat the truth
Bite your tongue
I come out of the sea
Bringing next truth
Another horn rambles
Yet another cock in the morning
And freedom by my side
I bring you fear
And rapture within
I bring you fear

Allow me to speak thy name
It will be a seal of salvation

I ll bring you fear
But fear not
I bring you fear
I take away life
I bring you fear
Another existence

Dawn is close
The sun approaches
Heat of sand on my face
Freedom won
