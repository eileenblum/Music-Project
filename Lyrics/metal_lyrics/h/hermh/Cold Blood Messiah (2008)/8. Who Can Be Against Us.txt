Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process
He does not become a monster. And when you look long into
An abyss, the abyss also looks into you.
[Nietzsche]

Men-cheper-Re
It was I who received the weapon of Mitum
Men-cheper-Re
It is I who rule the heavenly power
Men-cheper-Re
Iszkur I summon you
Men-cheper-Re
Unleash the endless element with your might

I shall destroy lands,
And turn them to dust,
I shall destroy cities
And turn them to waste

Inspire the land with blazing fervour
Sulphuric dust shall be thy breath
With divine weapon I destroy lands
I see transient fear
I see the moment of terror
Swallowing souls
The flesh evaporates
Black stain
Venom spread from ulcers

I shall flatten mountains,
Make all beasts die
I shall dry the seas
Decimate what in there lies

Lord of the Flies is coming
Gathering vermin at his side

I shall annihilate mankind
Their souls will turn to dust
None shall be spared

Men-cheper-Re

Body of the enemy, watery lake
Souls like smoke over the ruins
Lack of suffering
Hollow sound of absorption

The locust erodes their eyes
Rain of fire, pillar of ardour
