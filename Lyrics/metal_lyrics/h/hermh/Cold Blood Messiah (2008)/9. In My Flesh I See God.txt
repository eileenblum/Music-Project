My thoughts years away from my body
My mind shivering from cold
Leucoma, nobody s sight
I touch the smoke of burning carcass
I hear the smell of burning
Naked limbs plaited with hurricane of fire
Skin, a desert shell

Ashes

My thoughts bring and luminous
My mind in the state of ecstasy
Cupreous sight, the heaviness of eyelids
I touch the story body
Smell of fresh fir
Naked limbs congealed in stillness
Skin pale-green
Rottenness
Thoughts tangled by tress of existence
The third eye is watching
Embryo of corporeity fights
Smell of mud
Naked limbs separately folded

Hollow sound of the earth

You sprinkle the skin
Wax glitter
I see God in it
You celebrate rituals
You light up incense
I see God in it

In my flesh I see God
Of all moments
In my flesh I see God
The Master of death
In my flesh I see God
Donor of life
In my flesh I see God
My God!
