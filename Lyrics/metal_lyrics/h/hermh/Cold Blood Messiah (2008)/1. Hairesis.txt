Caedite eos! Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius

Per signum crucis
Millions of annihilated begins
Millions of death sentences
Laus tibi!
Per signum crucis
Greatest crimes of this world
Greatest bloody battles
Laus tibi!
Per signum crucis!
Flowing river of blood
Desecrated bodies in thy name!
Laus tibi!

You they call the redeemer
Agnus Dei
You they call the salvator
Agnus Dei
You they call the son of the highest
Agnus Dei
You they call the infinitive love
Agnus Dei

Thine is the holy heart which knows no mercy

Tu Rex Gloriae!

Blodless sacrifices
In your honor flesh and blood consumed
Myths from generations passed
All this because;
Tu Rex Gloriae!
Children of killers breed
Crowds for ages fed with lies

Arise beyond ye supreme being
Arise above ye supreme being
And confess the truth once again
And say no once again!

Every truth is a torn for my temple
Every word flows with bloody sweat
Thy believers fanatic killers
Thy believers burning on stakes
Thy believers decapitating in thy name
Thy believers raping and drinking blood in the name of cross
Thy believers mass murderers
Thy believers greatest masters
For thy name they sacrifice nations
For thy name they sacrifice their families
Bloody lord
Thou is the betrothed of Satan!

It is I the heretic who chooses truth and wants:
Ne perenni cremer igne.
