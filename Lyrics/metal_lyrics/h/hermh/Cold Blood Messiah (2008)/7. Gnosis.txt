That Light, He said, am I, thy God, Mind, prior to Moist Nature which appeared from Darkness; the Light-Word (Logos) [that appeared] from Mind is Son of God.
Know that what sees in thee and hears is the Lord s Word (Logos); but Mind is Father-God.
Not separate are they the one from other; just in their union [rather] is it Life consist.
So, understand the Light [He answered], and make friends with it.
[The Corpus Hermeticum/Poemandres, the Shepherd of Men]
