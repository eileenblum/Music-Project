Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
To receive power and riches and wisdom
And strength and honor and glory and blessing!
[Revelation 5:12]

Whiplash, laughter of guards
Another drop of bloody sweet falls upon the slippery pavement
Thorns driven into temple
Shivering body desiring rest
Last glance at the sky
Here is your prize!

Years of lies harvest the crop
Here s the chosen lamb
Resurrection of mortals
March of the lepers
Dance of the possessed

What once seemed to be a deed
Becomes malefaction for itself
Divine wonders bear the heaviest arms
Yet the hatchet is not yours
At first the night of torment
And then the salutary day

You have chosen nothing
But wise men alone have you convinced
So carry your torment
So carry their rapture

Eyes clouded with blood
Canvas sticked to the corpse
Another downfall
Another splinters in the shoulders

Believe, they gave the verdict on you
Saviour with eyes of lamb and lion
Blind faith passed on in scriptures
As was foretold
You have been chosen

Arise!
Arise and walk!
Go on meet your destiny!
Arise!
Arise and walk!
Go on bring them salvation!
