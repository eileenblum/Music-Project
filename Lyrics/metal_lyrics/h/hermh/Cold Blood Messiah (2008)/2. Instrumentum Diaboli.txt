Whosoever will be saved, before all things
Is it necessary that he hold the Catholic Faith
Which Faith except everyone do keep whole and undefiled
Without doubt he shall perish everlasting
[Credo]

better for a hundred innocent people to die than for one heretic to go free

El veritas liberait vos
Scream no one will hear!
El veritas liberait vos
Scream hear the whisper of death!
El veritas liberait vos
Scream liberation is at hand!
El veritas liberait vos
Scream no one will hear!

Another stake on fire!
Another life taken away!
Another verdict given!
Another heresy slain!

Scoffing image in your eyes
You long for departure
You long for death?
Say the words
And your body shall expire
Say the words
And your soul shall be redeemed

This night is marked with torment
This night is dripped with bloody sweat
This night is winning on the firmament of being
This night is illuminated with blazing bodies

El veritas liberait vos
Scream you burning saints!
El veritas liberait vos
Scream you desecrated corpses

Another trial of truth
Another lake of slander
