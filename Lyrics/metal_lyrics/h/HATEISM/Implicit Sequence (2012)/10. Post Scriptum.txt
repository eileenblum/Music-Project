Now fear is gone
But you are alone
Let is go as it goes
At last you've got no foes
Everything you've become
Is less than a crum
No chance in this hell
The abyss the world once fell
The big entities
No diversities
The horrible signs
The prime evil aligns
It all was a joke
You felt when you woke
Knock back silly rhymes
When dead lie in lines

Roar of insanity
No hesitations
As this just ought to be
I wonder how did you last so long
It's not a test but a genocide
You're the last of your kind

In the end
You understand
What to defend
What to defend

Now fear is gone
But you are alone
Let is go as it goes
At last you've got no foes
Everything you've become
Is less than a scum
No chance in this hell
The abyss the world once fell
The big entities
No diversities
The horrible signs
The prime evil aligns
It all was a joke
You felt when you woke
Knock back silly rhymes
When dead lie in lines
