Descendants!
What did you leave here after all
Some code of morality much like the ancestors' one
Not so confused by the face of death that befalls
Just hearts and spades, despite the memories could not set a dot

The destiny's buried down
A place to heal
Lies beneath
Tried to reach
Oh fall
It fascinates
And that's the call

Descendants!
What did you leave here after all (so cold)
Some code of morality much like the ancestors' one
Not so confused by the face of death that befalls (just told)
Just hearts and spades, despite the memories could not set a dot

Prepare your arms and be ready for
What lacks any confusion
It's in our souls but we can not guess the distribution
Why don't you fear
The future depends on us
And certainly we can't just pass
Through
Any time for hesitating but now
The fathers would approve

Now
