Clarify the mess of this daring not to be called atrocity
Coming with pain and flames not being afraid of even itself
Neither any salvation
The devil's creation is starving to death
But its mission is done well
When all humans flee even fearing to be not much since they are told one two three

What will they do now
For the earth
There is no way left

Implicity
Necessity
Complexity

Nowhere is the only rally point
The only chance not to be late
Prepare and try not to be stricken by the hand of fate
What do you want so far?
And i'm not sure it's a thing to dream about
The world will become unscarred
And i can do without
I can do without
What do you want
