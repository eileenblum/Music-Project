Prepare for anything
Concerning desecration
A brand new way of suffering
Was innovated just for you
The foul parasite
That needs an isolation
Come on and see the light
It is time to show you something new
New

Prolonged insomnia
Progressive paranoia
Huge brain injury
Successful therapy

Long range frequencies
Voices from above
(it's taking the staff; sector five; need major assistance)
Time to take your fees
Tasting this blood bath
(just hear this laugh, it's more than alive; keep distance)

Just as they fall overall
Remember this day as the best day
The end is here, but they still fear
Remember this day as best day
