One last game to everydays, oh
It's just a word now; we are
Changing times, apparel and face, so low

(low)
It's the way of the world we should believe in
From now on but never again
Shall we ask ourselves of relieving
Feelings that do bring so much pain

Things we can do
To feel stronger
Find a way through
For today

Spirit is dead, what is instead, no
Who knows
Does it all matter what we stand for

What we stand for

Things we can do
To feel stronger
Find a way through
For today

Close your mind
Close your mind
