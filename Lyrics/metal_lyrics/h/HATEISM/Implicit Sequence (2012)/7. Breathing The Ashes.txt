Tell me more of this unstoppable chaos
Tell me why do we deserve that
The walls are singins the story i don't believe
I want to see everything with my own eyes

Look
At this maroon horizon
The burning skies above
Like devil's minions rising
Looking for a pure love

Anything you'd like to pray
Make whatever rituals necessary
Hide in sanctuaries
Try to save yourself with faith
Will you answer for the call?
Flaming clouds miss you all

[Arabic style vocals]

Fire
Horrific force of nature
There's nothing you can do

Time to crush these four walls
Meet reality fearsome and dire
There is no chance; unstoppable calls
Breathing the ashes
Touching the fire
