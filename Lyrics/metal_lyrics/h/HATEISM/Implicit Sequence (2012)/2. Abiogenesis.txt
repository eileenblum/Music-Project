The end is here
The gates are opened
It's knocking our doors
When the omen appears you hear
Voices of nature that could not be worse

What could you expect in the end
Being reckless and relentless
But now it's too late to understand

All (all) just left it all behind
A mindless step and fall
What do you tend to find
When all is broken

That's all you can do

Slaves of technology working so good
World is a no reason to worry about
Proceed an then finish to end the etude
The message will surely be heard out loud

What could you expect in the end
Being reckless and relentless
But now it's too late to understand

All's left at all
Mindless faint
All falls down
Starts again
