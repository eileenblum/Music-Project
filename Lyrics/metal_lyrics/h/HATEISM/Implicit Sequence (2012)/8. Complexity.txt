Now hear my voice and look at me!
I'm what you have become
It's really not what you might ask to be
But it gets going, certainly

By the last time
Advanced life
Is struck by a dissonance
You have turned to a scum
Useless thoughts, empty words, other stuff of no sense
And whatever, the whole world falls down

Demon's seed, filth and greed, common needs are so
(low)
What do you really expect of this hollow life
Love's become apparently something you can't ever stand
(everything) tells there is nothing to defend

Just realize!
You're stuck
Eternally you're paralyzed
And can't be free

All comes
From inside
No expectations
Right, again, you lie, to self,
Now, don't stop, or you, just die
You are
What you fear
Dead inspirations
Take, my hand, and walk, with me,
Find, a place, to hear, and talk

With me
Don't leave me
Come down

What do you feel
It's in your head
No one to blame
You're just mad
Listen to demons
Whom you resist
And i'll show you the reason
And see you just coming down

Demon's seed, filth and greed, common needs are so
(low)
What do you really expect of this hollow life
Love's become apparently something you can't ever stand
(everything) tells there is nothing to defend

You're paralyzed
And can't be free
You're criticized
And can't be free

All comes
From inside
No expectations
You are
What you fear
Dead inspirations
Take
Walk

With me
Don't leave me
Come down
