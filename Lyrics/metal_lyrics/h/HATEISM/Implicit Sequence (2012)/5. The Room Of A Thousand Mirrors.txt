Why don't you stop that fuckin' starin' at me
(what is wrong?)
I'm talking to the mirror
Reflections moving
Inspection's approving that
Over there is something wrong
All time long

I look at myself to see the difference
Oh my eyes don't believe me
There is no way to cast the interference
All those mirrors changing me
No!

I can't remember what i should've done here
And what's happening
Misunderstanding is the most fear
The silence is completely deafening

Oh i know
I know the best way out
From this maze once and forever
How did i get here?
(shake)
How did i get here?
(shake)

Why should i cry now?
And how will i die, say?
What do i look straight for?
And what did before?

Another stand-up, another ready-to
Blood has no worth for me anymore
(anymore)
And one more thing i'd like to tell you all on the other side
See you in hell

I can't remember what i should've done here
And what's happening
My mind is empty but my eyes clear
