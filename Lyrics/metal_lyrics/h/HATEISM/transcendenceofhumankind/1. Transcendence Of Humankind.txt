That was a long journey
Through the time of wars,
Demons inside me, telling
their frightful know-how
Maybe it's the time for a free ride

In that case I agree
To give myself a chance
Dealing with this 
Personality is a piece of cake
All I want is just a cave to hide

Who knows the way to reach
The height attracting so much
It could be better just without a perception
Just an exception to be dreamt of such 
Results in global delight
There is a feeling denied

Get me!
Listen to those dirty words
Until you meet the another force

In vain we strive to play)
If only we could throw the aggression away

I suppose
There is an end to be delayed
However I can't promise 
I'll be ready to another
Variations of future get worse and worse
We're up for something new
A new paradigm
Which is supposed to fully dominate

What can we bring
To our land of confusion
Suffering 
Is just a mortal's delusion

Now you fail
It prevails
Become the first to be assimilated
Join our ranks
Consider this as something highly rated

Do we deserve
Such blessings
Against the nature
The wonders
Of creation
The wonders
Of Self
