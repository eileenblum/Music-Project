The healer

There are men who speak to the gods
They are the ones to council the leaders
And help them devise their strategies

There are men who thrive in combat
They are the ones who spill all of the blood
As result they're loved and glorified

Just because I'm not vital in the battle
That doesn't mean I'm not a crucial key
I revive and give care to the future
I'm a part of the victory  

The healer
I'll make you well
The healer

I'm vandal, I have the knowledge
To mend your wounds and to quell your sickness
I'm the best when you are at your worst

I'm a man with gifted purpose
I'm the one possessing the talent
And the heart to make sure you don't die

Just because I'm not vital in the battle
That doesn't mean I'm not a crucial key
I revive and give care to the future
I'm a part of the victory  

I deserve a higher credit
Not disregard when everyone's healthy
I'm honored only when you need me

Just because I'm not vital in the battle
That doesn't mean I'm not a crucial key
I revive and give care to the future
I'm a part of the victory  

Using my herbs I manage pain
Sustaining life
I am the healer
I handle birth, death and sickness
Mend battle wounds
I am the healer
