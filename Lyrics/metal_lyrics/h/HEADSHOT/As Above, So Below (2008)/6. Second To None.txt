Limb from limb I hunt you down with victory and might
Bring you eternal sorrow, shooting out your light
Kneel down or be erased, step back in line
I am the new commander taking what is mine

For pride and glory
I am the one
I won't step back
I'm second to none

Another day, another war, another land to conquer
The biggest nation of all, the one that'll never fall
A new crusade to bring the truth, heaven's on our side
We live in god's own country, a legacy of light

For pride and steel
I am the one
Still act so selfish
Second to none

So proud and primitive
I am the one
Lack of intelligence
Second to none
