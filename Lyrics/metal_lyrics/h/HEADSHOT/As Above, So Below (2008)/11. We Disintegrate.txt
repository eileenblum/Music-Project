Icons, ideals
Falling from grace
With no sign of descending
Another strange idol taking their place
Another fake healer arising

Losing my faith
Losing my hope
Disciple of insanity
Losing my love
Drowning in pain
Man of distrust - misanthropy

Don't care for you
Don't care for me
Failure in humanity
Chances are gone
Servants to chaos and hate
We disintegrate

Demons, serpents
Rising from hell
With no sign of ascending
Another double-dealer playing its game
Another false prophet appearing
