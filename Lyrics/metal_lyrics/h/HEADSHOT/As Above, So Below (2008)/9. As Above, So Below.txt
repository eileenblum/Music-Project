The one, you can call it god
Creates - opposites are formed
Falling - in polarity
Born from entity

The two - mirror to the one
And three - creation is done
Rising - to infinity
Holy trinity

A microcosmic disharmony implies
A macrocosmic analogy

Darkness - now defined by light
Colours - versus blackest night
Father - son and holy ghost
Nothing's ever lost

Warfare - eternal peace denied
Evil - keeps the good alive
Mankind - profane and divine
666 is nine

A macrocosmic disharmony implies
A microcosmic analogy

As above
So below
The patterns of creation
Contain a revelation
As above
So below
Eternal wisdom's fading
Our world is rearranging
