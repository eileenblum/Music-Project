I am the everlasting ever watching hell for you
Telling you 'bout morality and things you shouldn't do
My sense of tolerance is widely recognized
Any anomalies are sure to be despised

And if you don't respect that I know what is good for you
You'll take the painful way to be a loyal member too

My word is the law
And if you choose the wrong way
My rage will unfold
Which means war

I bring democracy, I praise the lord
I bring a true belief, don't fuck with god you whore
I root out all the sinners, burn them on nuclear pyre
I bring the new world order, illuminating, shining fire

My word is the law
And if you choose the wrong way
My rage will unfold
Which means war
Which means war
Which means total war
One more eternal war
