An act of selfishness and the twist begins
An act of arrogance, confess no sins
There is no sympathy, suspended love
Neglected harmony, opposition grows

Interplay of disagreement escalating higher
Depraved in agony, fuel for the fire
Apparent indifference, two worlds divide
Manifest hostility, two worlds collide

Without respect
Without a cause
Without regrets
And no remorse

In your face

Insidious act
Is now designed
The will to kill
Is on my mind

In your face
In your face - hit
In your face - punch
In your face - kick
In your face - kill
Gone insane
