Like demon possessed, taking no rest
Building the tower ahead
Founded on science, unholy alliance
The mental life suffers instead

Pushing on faster, head into disaster
The tower sways up to the spire
Eternal erection with no satisfaction
Symbol of misled desire

Aiming heaven, approaching hell
Blinded by greed and deceit
Inflicted by karma, extending the drama
The harvest of yesterday's seed

Life's meaning descending with no comprehension
Mysterious enigma unsolved
In one-way direction, just forcing the action
Mankind is one-sided evolved

A morbid monument arising
A monolith that shall prevail
No synchronicity with nature's law
Unstable, bound to fail
