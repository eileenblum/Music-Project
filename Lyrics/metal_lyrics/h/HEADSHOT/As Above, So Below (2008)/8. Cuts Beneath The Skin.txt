Born into a world of sin and hate
And greed implanted in our
Brains fed up with lies, true life denied
State of degenerated mind

Numb we watch and see our destiny
Inflicted with a world that's
Drowned in apathy, with shattered souls
Caught in a slave machinery

Hypnotized
Synchronized
Paralyzed by fear

Victimized
Sacrificed
No way out of here

Scars deep within
Cuts beneath the skin
