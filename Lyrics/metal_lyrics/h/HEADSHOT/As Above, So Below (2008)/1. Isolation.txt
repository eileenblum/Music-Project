Pressed into lifeless shapes
Suffer from vertigo
Confronted with a brutal world we grow

Dispersal - disorder
Just chopped in bits
Dissection - into pieces
That will never fit - again

Betrayed and agonized
Until the day you die
But your self-made prison is a lie

Dispersal - disorder
Just chopped in bits
Dissection - into pieces
That will never fit - again

We are the travellers of eternity
We lost our way, we walk alone
We are creators of our destiny
In isolation we shall drown

There is no common ground
No union, no alliance
Too many try to be the first in line

Dispersal
Disorder
Dissection
Isolation

We are all witness to insanity
The plague is spread across the land
We are observers of catastrophes
Things just getting out of hand
