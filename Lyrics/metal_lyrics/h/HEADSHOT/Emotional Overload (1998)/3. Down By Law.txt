Why donât you see?
Why donât you face?
Why donât you understand
What we are trying to say?

Innocence in this society a sin
Unjustified jailed for the colour of your skin
Terrified of what they thought you to respect
Corruption and injustice as a matter of fact

Weâre on a mission to madness
No one can be saved
This is a vision of darkness
For us itâs too late

Realize when you see blood on the floor
Victimized you are down by the law
Highest price turns right into guilt
Start to rise against the system theyâve built

You brought us
Down by law
