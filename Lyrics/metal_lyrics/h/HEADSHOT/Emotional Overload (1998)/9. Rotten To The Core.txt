Under blackened skies of poison
Societies will burn
We destroyed our mother nature
There ainât no more return

We buried all our wisdom
No learning from the past
This earth is like a time bomb
How long will it last?

Rotten to the core
Rising nevermore

2000 years behind us
Of slaughter, death and pain
No good came down to save us
Through hell we walk again
