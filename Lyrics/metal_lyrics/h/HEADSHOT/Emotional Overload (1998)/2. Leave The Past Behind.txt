Four walls are closing in
Thereâs no way out
This time I cannot win
There ainât no doubt

We should improve our minds
And leave the past behind

Domination of the past
Just set me free
How long will it last?
Renewal in me

This is the price we pay
If we donât change our way
And face another day

Frustration once again
Iâm feeling low
Another day, another sin
Where do we go?

We should improve our minds
And leave the past behind
To start a better life
One more time
