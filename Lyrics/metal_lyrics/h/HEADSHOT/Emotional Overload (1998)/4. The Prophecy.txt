[Hesekiel 25/17]

I had a vision in a dream
The prophecy
The past becomes our destiny

The dark side is our guiding light beyond belief
Godâs armyâs near
They come to strike

Look back in time and history of war and pain
The same mistakes are all I see

Mankind will pay for all its sins on judgement day
Here at the point of no return

A dark age
A black fate
Damned for all time
Down we go
Sure to stay
At the end of the line
