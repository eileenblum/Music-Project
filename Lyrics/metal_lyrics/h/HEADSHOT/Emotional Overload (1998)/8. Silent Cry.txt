Dark shadows in your mind
Suffering every night
Awake, you cannot sleep
Will it ever end?

Trapped in a world of fear
No nightmare, this is real
The pain will drive you mad
But there is no escape

Your soul is screaming loud
You voice donât make a sound
You fall down to the ground
Silent cry

Do you know who is to blame?
No one cares, play the game
But you know time wonât heal
Suicidal thoughts

You feel disrooted and alone
So disrupted to the bone
Lifeâs a pleasure, you feel pain
Lost your mind, you are insane
