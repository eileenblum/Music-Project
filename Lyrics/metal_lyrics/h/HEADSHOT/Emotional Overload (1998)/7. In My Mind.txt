Tried to face the fear
Deep inside of me
Itâs been here for son long
Tried to face the fact
Iâm a livinâ wreck
Maybe tomorrow Iâm gone

Take a look in my mind
Tell me what you see
Is it something unreal?
Take a look through my eyes
Itâs too much for me
Pain is rising in my mind

Heal me now
As I pray to you
I give you all that I have
Kill me now
As I reach for death
There wonât be any cure
