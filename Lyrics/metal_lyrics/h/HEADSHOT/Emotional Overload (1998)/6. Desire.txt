Face down, feelinâ low
Burned out, out of control
Fucked up, it ainât tight
Canât get no sleep tonight

Feels like Iâm shipwrecked
Caught in a spiderâs web
Trapped in a prison cell
Itâs just like livinâ in hell

My mind is hungry
My flesh is weak
My thoughts are empty
My only passion is my greed
Desire

Kick down the walls inside
Iâve got to free my mind
Stand up, make it real
But thereâs no way out
