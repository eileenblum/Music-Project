Emotional overload reigns my brain
A flood of information drowns me as I drain

Smile!
Step back in line and take the lies
My mind is overloaded
Iâm ready to rise

Emotional overload drives me insane
I lost my comprehension
Canât stop this pain

Smile!
Step back in line and take the lies
Facings are overloaded
Iâm hypnotized

I wonât take it!
My head explodes
Emotional overload
