Hail, hail to the new machine
A new messiah is born
We pray to computer god
Into salvation transformed
In technical ecstasy
We will spend our lives
We drown into cyberspace
With a virtual smile

Welcome to the brave new world
A never-ending progress
New drugs to excite my nerves
A never-ending excess
Conform or be cast out
This is the only way
Emotional overload
Come and blow me away

All colours fade away
Into different shades of grey

Dreams of infinity
Turning inside out
Realms of insanity
Put societies down
This is the meaning of life
Itâs the meaning of death
Will I return to life?
Will I ever come back?

All feelings fade away
Frozen in shades of grey
