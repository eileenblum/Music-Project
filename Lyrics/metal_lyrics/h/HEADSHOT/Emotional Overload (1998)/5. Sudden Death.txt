Out on the streets tonight
With intent to kill

Searching
Hiding
Waiting
Fighting

My victims have no choice
I love the thrill

Too late, too late
No turning back
This is the final hour
Sudden death

No warnings, no goodbyes
You wonât come back

Raping
Ripping
Smashing
Killing

Nobody will survive
My bloody attack
