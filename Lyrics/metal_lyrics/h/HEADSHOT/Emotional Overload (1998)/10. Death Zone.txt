Colours, voices unknown to you
Born in darkness, what can you do?
No arms, no legs, deaf, dumb and blind
Crippled and helpless, youâre left behind

Death comes slowly a few years ago
Death comes surely as we all know
Living in danger, living in fear
They keep on telling it canât happen here

Liquidators â sentenced to death
The reactor â poisons your breath
No protection â from the unknown
Death zone
