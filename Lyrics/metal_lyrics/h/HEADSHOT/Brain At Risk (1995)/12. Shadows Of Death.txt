I stand alone
I stand ashamed
My life means nothing
Wasted away
Dreams fade away
Nightmares come true
I'm damned with pain
That I never knew
Shadows of death
Drown my brain
Victim of fear
So insane
River of black
Running through my veins
In my world of hurt
In my life of pain
There is nothing to remain
I walk alone
I lost my way
My whole life
A desperate fray
Shadows of death
Drown my brain
Victim of fear
So insane
River of black
Running through my veins
In my world of hurt
In my life of pain
There is nothing to remain
Once I thought I would never lose
Once I thought I got it made
There was a time of better life
No way, too late
Full of love, full of life
No fears to haunt my brain
All has changed, what remains
Just hurt and pain
My eyes two deep black holes
My mind confused and old
My body crippled and weak
My heart, stone cold
Dark shadows comin' nearer now
Deadly forces taking my last breath
Flame of life is burning low
Shadows of death
Shadows of death
Shadows of death
