Reach down, deep down
Into my life that seems in vain
Morbid thoughts infect my mind
A morbid mind drives me insane
My life burns low
So low with a desperate flame
I've seen the writing in the wall
Try it from the other side
Drowned in a sea of madness
Lost in a river of pain
My life is in confusion
Again and again
Fight to survive
Caught in a struggle for
Life don't give up
Don't ever give up and
Fight for your mind
One of a different
Kind take control
Dig deep, real deep
Into my dreams for which I fought
Dead and gone, mostly insane
Me and myself are trapped and caught
My brain freaks out
A sick mind infects my thought
I've seen the writing on the wall
Make it to the other side
Drowned in a sea of madness
Lost in a river of pain
My life is in confusion
Again and again
Fight to survive
Life take control
Drowned in a sea of madness
Lost in a river of pain
My life is in confusion
Again and again
Fight to survive
Caught in a struggle for
Life don't give up
Don't ever give up and
Fight for your mind
One of a different
Kind take control
