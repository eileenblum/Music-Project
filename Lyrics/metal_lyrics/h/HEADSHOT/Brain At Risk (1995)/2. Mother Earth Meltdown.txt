Drop the bomb or scorch the earth
Blow up the planet I hate the birth
Living for death born to loose
Nothing else from what we can choose
The world is lying in a thousand debris
And the people with the power
they still don't see
That we're diggin' our own grave
But anyway it is much too late
Mother earth meltdown
Acid rain blackened sun
In my mouth the barrel of a gun
I don't give a shit about the human race
Someday we are gone lost without a trace
This worn out planet is falling apart
And I aks myself will we ever start
To solve our problems in a better way
Or is our fate just mankind's decay
Mother earth meltdown
