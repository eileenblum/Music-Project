Ignorance is strength
And slavery equals freedom
Ecstasy of fear
Is how the system works
Broken minds and memory
A future without past
The age of uniformity
Where thoughtcrime means the end
Execution of constitution
Termination immense decay
There's devolution no revolution
Annihilation wipes you away
You are controlled in every motion
Standing pissing sleeping
Denounced as a traitor
By your own son
Two minutes full of hate
Rage is breaking out
Those emotions could be used
As the power to overthrow
Execution of constitution
Termination immense decay
There's devolution no revolution
Annihilation wipes you away
Two minutes hate
