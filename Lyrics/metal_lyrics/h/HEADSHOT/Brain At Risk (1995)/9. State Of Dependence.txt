I am your master
You are my slave
I am the general
To lead you to the grave
I give you orders
You have to obey
Mine is the glory
On your final day
My world is built of lies
I laugh you start to cry
You pay the highest price
For you i'ts time to die
I go to heaven
You go to hell
I am the holy
Got your soul to sell
Send me your money
Send me your gold
I'll live forever
You won't get old
My world is built of lies
I laugh you start to cry
You pay the highest price
For you i'ts time to die
You are addicted
Addicted to me
You are the fool
I want you to be
You fly to rainbows
Then burn in fire
I am the dealer
Who knows your desire
My world is built of lies
I laugh you start to cry
You pay the highest price
For you i'ts time to die
