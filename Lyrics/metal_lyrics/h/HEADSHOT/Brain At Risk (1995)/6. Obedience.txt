Away so far
You're marching off to war
You're full of fear
The enemy lines are near
And when the battle has begun
They learn what war is all about
To fight, to run
There's no way out
Stand still, stand still in line
In array
Emotion not allowed
Obey
Fight for freedom so they say
Fight for peace anyway
Fight in the name of god today
Die alone, give your life away
Through war you see
Morbid morality
Absurd, paradox
Mindshredding reality
Forever nightmares haunt your brain
War's estate leaves your broken mind insane
To feel, to suffer
This eternal pain
Stand still, stand still in line
In array
Emotion not allowed
Obey
Fight for freedom so they say
Fight for peace anyway
Fight in the name of god today
Die alone, give your life away
Stand still, stand still in line
In array
Emotion not allowed
Obey
Fight for freedom so they say
Fight for peace anyway
Fight in the name of god today
Die alone, give your life away
