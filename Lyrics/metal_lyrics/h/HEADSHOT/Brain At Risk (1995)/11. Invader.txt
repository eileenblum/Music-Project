I see starving freedom
I see leaking rights
I see human animals
Running for their lives
I see running tears
I hear desperate cries
I heard too much lies
Proving all this right
Raping the women
Burning the land
Blow all their lives away
Slaying the men
Wading through blood
This is your final decay
Invader
Civilisation
Gives justification
For life in reservation
Torment and greed
Profit
The reason for oppression
Supported by religion
Justifies their war
Raping the women
Burning the land
Blow all their lives away
Slaying the men
In rivers of red
This is your final decay
Invader
I see upcoming movement
I feel rising anger
I start to hear loud voices
Breaking the ice
There is the will for revolution
And the need for changing action
Defrayment of the power
Is what the hell we need
Raping the women
Burning the land
Blow all their lives away
Slaying the men
Spilling the blood
This is your final decay
Invader
Invader
Invader
Invader
