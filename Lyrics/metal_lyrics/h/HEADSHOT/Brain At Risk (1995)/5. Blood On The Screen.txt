Headshots, bombdrops
Driving me insane
Slaughter, killing
Can you feel their pain
Torture, fighting
Adrenalin on high
Bullets, blood runs
As I watch'em die
Soldiers looting
Chaos in their brains
Bastards raping
Fear is what remains
Pictures of sorrow
Snapshot of the dead
Focus for cash
TV's runnin' red
Blood on the screen
Death
Machinery is paying me
Blood on the screen
War
For anyone out there to see
Blood on the screen
Death
Machinery is paying me
Blood on the screen
War
For anyone out there to see
Blood
Blood on the screen
Death machine
TV war extreme
How many victims of war have I seen
