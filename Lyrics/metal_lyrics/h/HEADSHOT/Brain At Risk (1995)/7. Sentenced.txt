See the life fade away
In our world of decay
I see starvation all around
And what I see is goddam pissin' me off
Fight for your life
In a land of rising death
Fight to survive
As you're taking your last breath
Nothing to eat
All you are is skin and bones
Big staring eyes
Will soon be two black holes
Anger - rapes my mind
Hatred - burns my soul
Pain - chokes my heart
Anger (rapes my mind)
Hatred (burns my soul)
Pain (chokes my heart)
Sentenced ...to death
Crawl on your knees
In the endless desert sand
Your screams and your pleas
Fade away in barren land
Your mind is confused
Tormented shattered soul
Death is so near
Insanity takes control
Anger - rapes my mind
Hatred - burns my soul
Pain - chokes my heart
Anger (rapes my mind)
Hatred (burns my soul)
Pain (chokes my heart)
Sentenced to... death
