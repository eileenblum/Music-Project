Fight back
I mean
White and black
To demonstrate strength
Let's take
Control
I wanna see
Heads roll
People judged by the colour of skin
This will ever be the biggest sin
If you're one of those who don't care at all
Cut your throat or hang yourself on a rope
As one the job can be done
Show resistance I wanna see your fist dance
Raging power is for what I yearn
The only way will they ever learn
Race war grows
White and black still attack
Strike back
I mean
By attack
Achieve a different level
To break
Their lies
We will not
Compromise
For a vision it is much too late
A decision must be made
Useless words in endless discussions
Problems rising done is nothing
Crime rules the chaos gets bigger
Solutions needed before I pull the trigger
Empty promises behind deceived eyes
Clear your mind don't believe their lies
Race war grows
White and black still attack
Break lies
We'll break lies
We'll break lies
We'll break lies
