I'm walking in
an unknown land
creatures around me
reaching for my hand
I can't escape
the darkness around me
though my eyes are open
I'm unable to see

Though I know
I'm in a dream
I cannot escape
and start to scream
I cannot wake
something's holding my hand
keeping me here
I'm frightened and I cry

Lux lucet in tenebris
