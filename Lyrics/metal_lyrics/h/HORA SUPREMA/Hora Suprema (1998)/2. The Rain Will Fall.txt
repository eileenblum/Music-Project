One day the rain will fall
on your stupid heads
and it will wash away your stupid smiles forever

Zapping through a brave new world
from style to style
from life to life
life's designed by life-designers

And the army of the party-people
marches, dances through the streets
raving, dancing, following
the forces of the programmed beats

One day...

Life could be so easy
life could be so sweet
swimming, floating
in an endless stream
sunbathing
in an eversmiling sun
but I can't expell these clouds
out of my mind

One day...

Party people keep on dreaming
Party people keep on smiling
Party people keep on following
the forces of a programmed life

Party people keep on dancing
Party people keep on raving
Party people keep on following
the forces of a programmed life

One day...
