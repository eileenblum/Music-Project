Voices shouting in my head
sometimes it?s whispering
makes me nervous, makes me mad
it makes me shivering

My self-control is just a word
who has the mastery
and all these orders that I've heard
it can't be part of me

Are these demons, monsters,ghosts
baneful creatures telling me
to do things I'd never dare
am I possessed or am I free?

Outside I'm looking so well-bred
I'm just so cultivated
but if you look into my head
it is just devastated

this would only be an evasion
I'm not in a demons use
I have to take the revelation
don't use no cheap excuse

It's just my drive theory
this is no big philosophy
It's all just a part of me
there are no demons I am free
