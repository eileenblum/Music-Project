Blood sets me free

It burns so fiercely in my mind
Lust for what I'm about to find
Recallings of the night before
Once more I was a predator

At dawn my faces intertwine
I hide beneath the covers of day
At dusk my hunger grows to serve this purpose of mine
At night I roam the streets for prey

I sneak up on you and in your flesh I bury my teeth
They rip your skin and grind your bones - show me what's underneath
I have the power to take it all away
It all is over before the break of day

It burns so fiercely in my mind
It burns so fiercely in my mind

Lurking, waiting, tracing, stalking
Once again a dead man walking

I draw near
My outlines now materialize
You cannot run, but then you feel - I see it in your eyes
The fear of death
Your end is what you see
Your scream fails, I'm unleashed - you'll die for me

You're trespassing my habitat
The scent of fear flows from your sweat
Your death, the key
Blood sets me free

Countless times I've sacrificed
Amounts beyond my wildest dreams
I drowned my past in still warm blood And saw that it was all good
