Empty shell - still extended to vast palace halls
There on the throne, the king of wraiths
He wears my eyes on my face only grey and pale
His death-cold grip makes sure I can't escape

I lost my grip, lost my reality
The screams they echo through the vast and darkened halls
As I awoke, sudden agony
Some evil will keeps me against the wall

âHush now! And behold! Slowly! The king arising
Kneel down! Bow down now! Your soul, is hisâ

Shock of panic breaks the spell, now Iâm on the run
Last spark of sanity drags me through the gates
The hollow eyes of the skull-shaped castle watching me
Ghastly resemblance of my own scarred face

Whispers
Rising
Turning into Screams
I scream

His angry hordes inside my head theyâre grinding up my mind
Chew up the ties then yank out my soul

Can barely claim that Iâm myself, the light leaving my eyes
The pit looming ahead
And as it's blackness swallows me, I breath my final sighs
Before they get me they'll get nothing instead

"In vain and futile! You won't defy your own fate!
We are immortal! We've taken what you owed to him now!"

Ascending stairs of bone, leaving all behind
Cheering crowd!
To rule the kingdom of the bleak, ever watching eyes
Allegiance to our liege!
Within this presence lies entrapped the glow of a soul
Under the Eboncrown
Until it fades and is renewed with a newly reaped one
Then forced upon the throne
