Running on fire while your mind is set ablaze
But what's the service you get in return?
They enter your mind and force you to kneel and believe
For unbelievers certainly will burn
The doctrine of fear of deceit and suppression
Is all that's ever counted as true
And those who oppose will suffer and face their end
The executioner is you

Don't they dare to refuse and keep their ways
Make them obey your laws
They turned you into a ravaging tool of hate
For power calls for force
You're part of the vile pillaging host
And with them you'll fight their wars
No remorse
Burn the blasphemic heretics
Your creed
Is all they'll ever need
Will they bow their heads or die in vain

Mercy's reduced to mere memory
It is of no avail for their violent reign

March! March!
March across their broken spines

A valiant deaths man you are
Lead by their rule, it's justified
Executing orders, you fail to notice
That ages go by, how many have died?
Their blood, their tears
Their suffering
That's the price! Redemption's for sale!
Salvation is granted, let true faith prevail

Fire, all the world is set ablaze
By now you feel the pain of righteousness
Fed up by the killing, you were caught showing sympathy
You're scarred by the truth, they made you confess

The doctrine of fear of deceit and suppression
Now that you opposed, you'll suffer and face your end
Defamed, arrested and tormented then sentenced to death

You realize, you worshipped a false god
Feel the injustice that you've brought
You've been betrayed by their false cause
