Save my soul imprisoned in a liberty long lost
Reflections in the hourglass resembling a ghost
A barrier that draws itself against the inner sake
Forgetful of the precious inner sakes that are at stake

Set-in-stone deficiency
For I am truth not honesty
The creature must be slain or my effort dies again
Destination destiny

Haunted - dark presence at the gates
Wanted - the renegade awaits

The black eye and the white eye
A Psychlops, half blinded mind
My lie becomes your lie
Apprentice of the minus human kind

Hypocrite, surrender your self
Behold the rotten match shadows and spells to cast
Wipe your tears on my lived body of scars
Our matches match but scars don't stretch
Our matches match but scars don't stretch
Oblivious

Keep my soul imprisoned in this liberty long lost
Secret torture on display shall silence the opposed
Domination, recklessness, a self-important mind
Visionary monarch to the minus human kind

I'll take you with me on my trip of misery
Where hopes and terrors conjoin
I'll feed you my destructive decency
Cleansing, putrefaction - two sides of the same coin

Afraid I'm not
The born and cherished leader
The dark tomes demand a worthy reader
Grim but weak
Creator and death of rebellion
Rust on the back of my medallion

Come to trust
All I disgust
I worship and despise
For I am hatred in disguise

Take it in and in return you nourish me
With life and all its powers
Lay an eye on this supreme calamity
All you see is ours

A frayed out knot
Try to hold it together
The sore spots
To cover I endeavor
Forget I'm forgotten
Enchanting, misbegotten
Distinctive yet the same
This life in chaos' name I claim

Kill my soul or let it die and this life will almost
Have burned out in my temple, itâs completely decomposed
Kill my soul imprisoned in a liberty long lost
My burning pain and agony can't fight eternal frost

The black eye
Half blinded mind
My lie
Minus Human Kind
