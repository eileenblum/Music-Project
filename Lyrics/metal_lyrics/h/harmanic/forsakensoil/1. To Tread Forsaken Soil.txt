There is a place you're not aware of
Still you're always a permanent guest
It is a place so dark and damp, you cannot breathe
Where your sanity is put to the test
A cloud of sound appears
It whispers and feeds your fears

Shallow voices speak in riddles
Show you directions with dead ends ahead
But on you walk, the endless miles, endless roads
Just to return to where your course was set

This unknown region, strange territory
Uncharted lands on the map of my sanity
Oblivion cast it's shadow across the plains
Not visible to me, I long to see anything

I struggle to recall, but I don't do at all
I don't feel misplaced, I feel I have been here before
I find a pathway that leads me further inside
To where forgotten memories hide
Hide beneath rocks and stones
Remains of what was known as
Wisdom's temple
Reason's fortress
Destroyed in wars of madness

And then you reach another dead end
You look around, strange sensations come over you
When suddenly a beam of light illuminates
The ground, the veil of doubt slowly torn apart

The veil of doubt slowly torn apart

I know this region
Black part of land on the map of my sanity
The spot of light on the soil makes me kneel
So visible to me, I can see everything
The earth is torn by my bare hands
My mud covered fingers, bruised and hurt
As rotten leaves and stones are past
I find my own face - buried in the dirt
