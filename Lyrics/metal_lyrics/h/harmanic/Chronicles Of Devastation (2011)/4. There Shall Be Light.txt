[2010, Holzreiter]

Disembodied souls piled up in the towers of deceit
Mesmerizing symbols of the freed
Bipolar minds forced into the catacombs of greed
Far beneath the towers of deceit
Architects of hollowness
Assassins all who follow this
This exodus into the realm
The realm of nothingness
Suppress the shape of things to come
- Never! Never!
Revise what will not have begun -
Never ever!
Thus spoke the Universe:
When the sacrificed unite to tear down the wall
With the first rays of light the fortress will fall
Mutilated souls dangling from the tree of destiny
Pendula of black utility
Helpless minds waving flags of silent slavery
Praying for the divination
Impact on the sin-wrecked
There shall be light
Come-uppance for the puppets
Thriving on their might
Impact on the sin-wrecked
There shall be light
All space is filled with numbing sound
All there is but cannot be is tumbling down
The arson well prepared
No single life be spared
The rumbling masses gathered
Thus spoke the Universe:
When the sacrificed unite to tear down the wall
With the first rays of light the fortress will fall
When blood-red fills the sky, we shall conquer all
With the first rays of light the fortress will fall
