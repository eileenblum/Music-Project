[2008-2010, Velankanny]

Swarming the surface, crawling all over hill and dale
An appalling lie of unicoloniality
Parasites nurturing, violently feasting on gifts of life
Isolated pinions in the machinery
Their spirit fuels the fire
Vanishing in the smoke and grime
Completely consumed in desire
Slaves to their own purpose till the end of time
Fettered by longings, all products of their greedy minds
Procreation's miracle degraded to merely an act of lust
Digging and drilling never stop killing while defiling sacred grounds
Behold! the blood-smeared face of
Gaia
Created long aeons ago
Made from the dust of the ground
Driven by hunger to know
Betrayal profound
Ever in throes of failure
Weakness turned to flesh and blood
Chance to be its own saviour
They'd rather be done with it for good
The chosen kind destined to reign
To wisely rule their new domain
But the gift of pure free will entailed divine hope once dreamed that - failed
Killing among the litter mates
Becoming the brothers bane
Bearing the bloody blame
Mimic remains the same, swallow the pain
They're living a life of lies to quench the thirst of industry
And even if innocence dies
Self imposed oil drenched slavery
Setting the sun recovers her wounds with the veil of night
As Gaia lies in agony, the engines of war set to ignite
Will these dark ages finally end in matricide?
