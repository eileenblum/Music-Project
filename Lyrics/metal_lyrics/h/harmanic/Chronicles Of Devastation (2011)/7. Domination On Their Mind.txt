[2008-2010, Velankanny]

Deep in the starless night, commotion stirs the dark
Pale fullmoon's cold light silence broken
Grey shadows make their way speeding paws leave their mark
Pursuing the trail of the stranger
Innocent little maid - tight in the riders arms
Shivering she prays - the wolves are coming
It's the voice of nature calling
Domination on their mind
Retrieve the captured lost one
Stolen from her kin
Hunting the wilderness he came across the den
Asleep among the whelps, there he saw her
Quickly he drew the blade to rescue her from them
Cold-blooded rage wolven blood spilled - remorselessly
In his grip the crying maiden
Suddenly arising howl
Glowing eyes around are coming charging to chase him down
Who is the hunted now?
The pack is closing in - he looks into the eyes of the child
And before his fall - he sees in them the gleam of the wild
It's the voice of nature calling
Domination on their mind
Retrieve the captured lost one
Stolen from her kind
