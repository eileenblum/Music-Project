[2010, Velankanny]

Soulless soaring bird of prey with bloodshot human eyes
On the prowl for distinct disarray, as its horrible cry rips the sky
Feel gorge feast flock
To be preying upon the least
For the pit-born beast
Creep across the waste
In manifold ways
The creature shifts its shape
As night devours day
One of many wretched deadly marvels
That this hellhole holds
We once called home
Ruined cities too familiar
Among the remnants stalks this one
Deceiving disguise
For it took the form of man
Wrapped in rags he is clad like the reaper
His very steps followed by a living black cloud
Deeply droning buzzing noises
Hellish choir of whispering voices
Contorted grin behind the moving shroud
Persuasive speech in the feeble's minds
Vermin fills the air and their humming words do terrible harm
Defiling scourge in human form
The wanderer commands the swarm

Kneeling in anguish
The raided weak
When the swarm is done they crouch in shock
The spirits reaped from the human
For the harvester to feast upon

When the fragile are consumed
Kept in his body's tomb
For the wicked sturdy looms
An afterlife-long doom

One of many vicious baleful errands for his death cold liege
The court of bone

Speeding back to his bleak master
He bears the black mark of the Eboncrown
