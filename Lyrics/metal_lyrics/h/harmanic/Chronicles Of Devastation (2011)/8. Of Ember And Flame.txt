[2009-2010, Velankanny]

Terrible scream of fright! Wrenched from my throat in the heart of midnight
Thirsting for my blood they've come for me
Drag me along with their vengeful hate
The price of sin must duly be paid
The ancient law that I did break says
"He who hath tasted Crimson,
Shall feed the Flames forevermore"
Tie him down and let him sear
Indulgence!
He's far from forgiveness
Transgression shall be punished with an endless woe
I stepped into the sacred forbidden shrine
A well of purple fire sprang forth invitingly
As I drank from it I was struck by bright feline eyes
And fled into the dark blessed by the scarlet grace
Stay awake
Endure the fiery penalty
Don't faint now!
You'll be lashed by the flaring tongue
You won't die!
You'll not be granted the peace of death
Far from it!
You'll be punished with an ever- burning woe
Terrible stream of light! Cracks from the earth, in the vividly dead night
Tied down at the punishing grounds, there's no regret
Flicker in their eyes of unforgiving hate
The price of mortal sin must duly be paid
The ancient law I set forth to break
"He who hath tasted Crimson shall feed the flames"
"He who hath tasted Crimson shall feed the flames forevermore"
Forevermore!
Here they rot, here they bur and the ground bestrewn with their ashes
All the infidel foul sinners
Who dared to defile what is sacred
Hear their wailing cries
Disharmony of atonement
Luring obscurity
Inner impurity
Damnable essence of my loss
In spite of flame's embrace I shall refuse to repent
I'll be its feeding ember
As the fire licks away my mortal shape
My scorched eyes behold
The rising of my crimson star
Be not afraid for you heard my call
I light the path through your rise and fall
Let your devotion inspire all
