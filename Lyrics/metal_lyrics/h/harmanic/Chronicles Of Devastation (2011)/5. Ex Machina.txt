[2010, Holzreiter]

Mankind's mirror metaphor
In kind devotion's wage
Mankind's mirror metaphor
In kind devotion's wage
Kindly kill my craving core
This night you'll come of age
In His name
Creation of shame
Innocence in no sense
Behind these walls in slumber deep
Unrepentant timeless sleep
Dormant lies the naked sheep
To fall from grace
Endlessly weep
When mend means break
Virtues mistake
Incarnated eternity
A blur of moral clarity
Thy servants bear thy serpent
On thee their backs they turn
Enlightenment bears all umbrage
Lord, thy bridges burn
Penetrated armor
Infiltrated harbor
Word to flesh to power
Evil's birthing hour
Ruthless stomps come cracking you
Dark and light ex machina
Thy servants bear thy serpent
- Black the hearts embraced
On thee their backs they turn
- The Angel leaves its place
Enlightenment bears all umbrage
- Obscurity to earn
Lord, thy bridges burn
Extinct instincts impending doom
Obligation freedom menaces loom
Worlds and borders transcendent orders
He who sees the wrong and right sees thy only bridge ignite
Mankind's mirror metaphor
Kindly kills my craving core
When fight means world
When straight lines curl
Where terror reigns
Where wisdom pains
Where see means mourn
Where dead means born
The bastard child won't learn
That Lord thy bridges still burn
