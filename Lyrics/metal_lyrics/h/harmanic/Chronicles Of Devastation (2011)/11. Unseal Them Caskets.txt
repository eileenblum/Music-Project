[2007-2010, Holzreiter]

Yes - No - Simultaneously
Where can it lead?
A stage of justice, stage of certainty
A stage for malice, burn the dragon seed

Preying off of fear and pain
Slaying what is good and sane
Colorblind the ignorance
And close the open mind

Concrete eyelids, impossible to see
Change of desire, self-hypocrisy
Yes - No - Simultaneously
Where does it lead?

Wake up

Stages of justice and all staged certainty
Shattered foundations of all reality
All our convictions are merged in belief
All that remains is just desperate grief

Call to the fathers that fathers were calling
When mothers and fathers called out to the fallen
Unseal them caskets for finite regress
Bother - a pit so bottomless

Stages of justice, outrageous certainty
Shattered foundations of all reality
The yes, the no, the constant contradictions
Lifetimes wasted, lifetimes spent consoling crude convictions
