[2008, Holzreiter]

A river separates our towns
Head for the ancient ruins -
Life unmade a desolate
Sight in the distance
Overgrown decayed
Detour to the sacred land
The cosmic preacher preaches my end:
"The last resort - rest in a vault
The hostile legions cannot be stalled
Legends told in riddles This endless battle is an infection
Unsolved henceforth ignored Death precedes resurrection"
But secretly adored
This endless battle is an infection
A river separates our souls Resurrection
Storm-streamed flag on the pole
Peaceful contamination of time Clear skies, that I will re-embrace
But sirens summon the lashing hail From perfect emptiness I resurface
And endless battles form a meaningless war
The hostile legions stand guard at your door
Darkness surrounding
The only source of light
Are your candles
That pierce eternal night
Distant brightness severs the gloom
Armed with torches closing in and I see you standing guard at my
Mercilessly slithering tomb
Illuminated destruction lies around me
No doubt left now that reality has found me
Unlocked chains to the bank they tie me still
Unlocked chains erase my mind, my will
On the horizon, my fears, cloaked in hoods
I try to tear the floods
Tear The Floods
Live together die alone
Wreckage of my broken throne
Invaded, defeated, kingdoms burnt to ashes
Unbuilt bridges can't bear the weight of my crown
