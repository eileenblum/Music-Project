Come now come savor joy in its purest form
Rejoice and revel
Fill your cup drink up and witness the spectacle
Rapture of the highest level
Zest decrees panem et circense
Off the bone, bloody meat
Stuff our maws and on we feed
Blood is shed, the slavering throng raves ahead
All ravenous shall be fed
Voracious cries will be heard craving naked flesh
Time to sate, morals unmade
Redefine sin in our lust parade
In times ruled by guile and slander
Our slaves shall build our promised land
They die for us in violent splendor
In ecstasy we cheer and chant
Mate! Feed! Kill! Repeat!
Mate! Feed! Kill! Repeat!
Mate! Feed! Kill! Repeat!
Mate and feed, kill then repeat!
And so it goes
On and on - towards Babylon
This is all but ritual that is both pleasure and decadent worship for
We want more
Conjure the Whore
Opulence bestowed
Shame unlearned and disavowed
Let your senses now be charmed in all delicious ways
Greed ensnared
Not a soul will be spared
The glorious plight of Caligula's heir
Fixated on sating, overpopulating, always copulating
Our kingdom come, second to none beastly deeds forever be done
Opulence bestowed
Shame unlearned and disavowed
This is all but ritual that is both pleasure and decadent worship to us
Till the end of days
Devour ourselves in malicious ways
For even if our kind is gone our hunger rages on and on
