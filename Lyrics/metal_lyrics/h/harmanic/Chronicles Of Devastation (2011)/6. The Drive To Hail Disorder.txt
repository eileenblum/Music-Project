[2009-2010, Velankanny]

At times when a struggling mind is far to weak to cope
Crippled senses overdose on whatever means blank out the most
Come drown the notion in a vast and hideous venomous ocean
The deep shall veil disorder
Weather-beaten soul went far to feed on hope
Fake intentions to get by can't reflect animate the lie
Come choke devotion let it's life rush past in cold slow motion
The drive to hail disorder now
Wait and see the carnage here
Chopped up bits and pieces of the fat stock
Wait for it to disappear
Locked up trapped in ever changing scenery
Black rain pouring down on me as I hear the music play
Let it play
Please don't - don't let it stop - the melody must stay in my head
Please! no! - just make it stop - let quiet peace take over instead
Please don't! - can't let it stop â no safe way back for I've let it spread
Please! no! - don't make it stop - the malady is all that I have
