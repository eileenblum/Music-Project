[2007-2010, Holzreiter, Velankanny]

It's only a matter of time - You're moribund
I pull the trigger - I watch it dive
Behold the horrid beauty from safely out of reach

Flesh, blood, bones
All across the horizon
Pain, demise
I will blacken the sun
I will blacken the sun

Unable to feel
They made me unable to feel
Burned by the heat of the nimbus
The end never seemed so real
Devastating heat of the nimbus

A blinding flash and deafening roar
You won't forget the sound of war, it won't leave your ears, nevermore
A vast blast of fire - Shatters the earth
Unfeeling empire giving horror a creeping dead rebirth

Lies, heed, kill
Do as the top brass say
Tunes of joy
Cover up the human disgrace

Cripple their children and their children to come
Cripple their children and their children to come
Victims of destruction, Chronicles of devastation
Generations born to radiant life

Badge of honour
Carcass cold
Death for currency
Peace was sold

Their war, their war
Man-made, man-made
Their hope, their hope
Unmade, unmade
In the wake of the cleansing storm
A new clear future ahead

As the last day ends, all innocence is gone
And a new bright sun arises
But you'll never see the dawn, for all that's left are only infected lost demises
In the wake of the cloud, I cannot feel
I am your doom (I am your doom)

They sowed bad seed
Of which we became
And now it's our turn
To sow that seed again
They sowed bad seed
Of which we became
And now it's our turn
To sow that seed again
