In a distant land,
When the magic is power
Many kingdoms fight,
Between themselves until death

[Chorus:]
With the force of warriors,
Kill the bastards of war
Conjure up the spirits, to be the guide
So the batlle began,
And dragons came from skies
Creatures born from beyond,
In the war then you fly
The hands of Gods have the power of revenge,
Arms of steel

[Chorus]

Hellish war
Finally the power is kept by soldier of metal
But cannot be over cause the war means eternity
