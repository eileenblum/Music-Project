Defender of metal
Take the sword
Kill the enemies
And fight to our world
With all your courage
Save the metal
Impulse the blade
The time is short
Then you must win the battle
Horses run
Togheter with warriors
Ready to kill
And to destroy the false metal
The age is cruel
It is impossible to escape
Try to survive
And always fight face to face

[Pre-chorus:]
The evil is here

We must destroy
Tonight
Take the sword
Fight to win
The power is yours
Never give up
Cause it is your life
Victory is all
That a warrior desires
And go ahead
Never look back
When the war is over
The victory will be yours

[Pre-chorus:]
The evil is here

We must destroy
Tonight
Take the sword
Fight to win
The power is yours

[Chorus:]
Defender of metal;
His pleasure is destroy
Defender of metal
All betrayers of heavy metal
