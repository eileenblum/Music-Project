The Sign God ask for blood,
It is time to mortal combats
Arise the envoy of Odin,
And the world will tremble
Then the sun disappear,
And the world will live in darkness
Vikings will sail in a sea of blood,
Barbarians will fight with anger
So the songs of braves go away,
To seek for the secret Trumphet,
The gates of Valhalla

[Chorus:]
The sign of destruction
The sign of aggression
The sing of cruelty
The sign of perversity

And when they arrive,
In a distant land
The song of the Trumphet,
Will stay in air
The wars will come to an end,
And sun will shine again
Everyone will look to the sky,
And Odin will just smile
