I am a Gladiator warrior,
Prisoner of war
Be forced to fight in Westplace,
I hope for my revenge
In a endless fight to survive,
I fight against my brothers
So look around in blood split,
I see the face of my friends
Fight, Gladiator, Fight
Fight or you will die

[Chorus:]
The sword is mine, Only friends in my hands
My hands, my hands
Will strike fatally, Up my enemies, my enemies
Enemies for destiny
Victims of fate, of fate
Enemies for destiny
Victims of fate
