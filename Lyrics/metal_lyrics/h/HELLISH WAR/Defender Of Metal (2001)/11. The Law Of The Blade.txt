In the age of wars, between the clans
Barbarians fought, against their enemies
With their, powerful swords
For the simple, pleasure of killing
Fight
Europe living, in total terror
The Germanic crowd, were everywhere
Marching on corpses, with an wild fury
Plundering and killing
Breaking out the Roman empire
Fight
Warriors bearing the heads
Of the enemies kings
To conquer lands
Of the kingdoms willings

[Chorus:]
The law of the blade
The law of the sword
