We are the knights of metal
Obsessed by victory
Feel the power of the blade
This is your destiny

[Chorus:]
We are living for the metal

We are the brave seamesn
We face the evil spirits
Through the waters of the oceans
Sailed for Seven Seas

[Chorus]

Fight for the metal
Don't break the oath
Live for the metal
We are the battle kings
And Odin the God of war
Enforce the law of metal
By the hammer of Thor
