In a world devastated by hate,
There is little chance to survive
Violence and tragedy make the laws,
Leaving everyone alert
Nowadays the world is not the same
In the past, Justice ruled
Only a grasped sword, Will make a difference now

[Chorus:]
Sacred sword, the time has come
Let's fight
Sacred sword, be by my side
Make it right

Let's look for it now,
We can't wait any more
Through mountains,
Seas and forests
No doubt, she will be there
Waiting for the true knight,
To combat the evil ones
Only a grasped sword,
Will make a difference now

[Chorus]

Let us get what is ours,
Because life gave us that
Let's make things right,
For those who believe
We won't put our guards down,
Because we also believe
Only a grasped sword,
Will make a difference now
