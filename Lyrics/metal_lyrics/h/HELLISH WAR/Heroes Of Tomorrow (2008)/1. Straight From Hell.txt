Wish-upon the darkest star
Demons rise from behind
Guiding him to the edge
Cold winds are standing still
Eternal fall begins
Fells on an one way road
Years spent in the abyss
Wounds healed by the soundâ¦
Of the red eyes man

[Chorus]
Straight from hell
Senses feel
All the lies
Left behind

Hidden by the darkest cloud
There is the stronger storm
Waiting just for the time
To fall right down on Earth
(Fire)seeking the weakest men
The ones whose world went down
Behind this piece of flesh
Sleeps tons of wrath
Beware!...Thereâs a blizzard within

[Chorus]
Straight from hell
Senses feel
All the lies
Left behind
