I feel the rage inside me
Growing more and more
I feel my wounds are burning
Now itâs time to raise my sword
I feel my blood is boiling
Blood that comes from a King
Blood I saw being splitted out
Nightmare from my childhood
Now Iâll follow my destiny
That was granted by me
Iâm seeking my revenge
Carrying a hatred heart
A son will never forgive
His own fatherâs murderer
The man once was my father
Taught me how to fight
With my mind and my heart
By the laws of our crown
Now Iâll follow my destiny
That was granted by me
I became a murderer
A murderer that once was

[Chorus]
The son of the King
My soulâs on fire
Son of the King
Revenge is my desire

Now Iâm tasting his blood
Under a pouring rain
I feel my thirst is satisfied
And my father now is avenged
Now there is no more King
No prince and no more crown
Loyalty,honor and pride
Father I bring you within
