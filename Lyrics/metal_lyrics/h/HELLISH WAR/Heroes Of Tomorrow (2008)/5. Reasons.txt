Sometimes I wonder why
Canât you leave your pride behind?
Tell me thereâs a way
To find my way out from this maze
Sometimes I lose my mind
Wondering about my life
My worldâs collapsing
And I feel like running blind
Nightmares are coming clear
Whispering about my own fears
Walking and facing the wind
So soft but,so cold and so mean
Falling pieces apart
Feeling always lost in the dark
Reasons to wonder why
What took myself through death?
Runninâ in circles,confuses my mind
Tomorrowâs coming and you gonna die
Believe in my words
Youâll taste my knife
Runninâ always blind

[Chorus]
Wasted night and day
Looking for my fate
Nightmares,every day
Leaving all by hate
