The battle rages on
And we still ride
Filling with thunder and lightning the black of the night
Stronger than ever
We just canât fall
Hammers held high
The law of the blade still prevails
The path we chose is clear
Victory draws near
The wing brings me air
To pass through those who I donât care
An ancient warrior said
ââStop just when you are deadââ
Horizon keeps burning
The twilight is coming
Feels like burning inside
That time is on my side
Day slowly turns
Metal still burns

[Chorus]
Metal forever
Weâll live to play
Metal forever
It shines our way

Stand tall forever
Endure the pain
Metal forever
Day after day
