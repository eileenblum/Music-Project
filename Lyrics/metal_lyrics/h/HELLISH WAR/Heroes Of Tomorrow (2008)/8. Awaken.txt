Some victories are worth the fight
Like running outta darkness right into the light
Thatâs why I donât expose my fears
And smile instead of shed my tears
Now I no longer feel the pain
As Iâm watching the rainbow after the summer rain
Thereâs a long and hard way until my end
And I may walk through hell but I wonât bend
Iâll worth my freedom
My strength
My dreams
My truth
My destiny and life
My everyday

[Chorus]
Born to be free
I ainât no prisoner of my mind
I fear no one
I stare into your eyes
Got to be wise
And trace down my own way
I feel no blame
Life will teach me all the way

I draw no lines
Lifting my dreams to the sky
I will not fail
I wonât live my life astray
I will not bend
To all my pride and sorrows
Now is my time
To awake all my desires
Awaken!
