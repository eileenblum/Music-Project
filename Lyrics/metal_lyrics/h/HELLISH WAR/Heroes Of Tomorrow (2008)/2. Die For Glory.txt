Long ago was born a man
Who wouldnât fear no tyranny
And courage will lead his way
To destroy a tyrant king
Slayers came and showed no mercy
Burned down everything they see
They set his soul and heart on fire
And his dreams were washed away
From the ashes rises the warrior
Ready to kill or die
From the ashes rises the warrior
And freedom he cries
Blood and tears will be shed
To spread this killing ground
A cold sweat runs through his spine
As heâs marching into the battlefield
So the time has come
And heâll fight for his belief
They ripped out his heart
But his spirit still lives on

[Chorus]
Guillis The Brave,died for his glory
Guillis The brave,one man and a story
