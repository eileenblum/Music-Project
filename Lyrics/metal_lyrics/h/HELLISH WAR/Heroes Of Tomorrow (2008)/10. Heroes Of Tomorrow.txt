I see the fire in your eyes
Burning like the sun up in the sky
Listen to the beating of your heart
Faster as the thoughts in our minds
Donât have to be a hero
To prove your courage if you are able to try
Donât have to be superior
To prove your power
Just face them and be strong
Now is the time
(if your)will now overflows
Iâll the truth
The lines you didnât know
Turn on your insight
Eyes just open wide
Never let them play with your pride
Face yourself today
Raise your will tonight
ââThere is a hero inside youââ
Give trust at first sight
Look them in the eye
Let your inner Hero fly

[Chorus]
Heroes of tomorrow
Spread your wings
Heroes of tomorrow
Through your actions
Trough your words or eyesâ¦
