Iâve been looking for answers
To the questions that came to me
Wondering in my dreams I try to find myself
The spirits hide the way(Where)I may go whit no fear
The gods from the other side
Will guide my agonyâ¦

[Chorus]
I need to find the light
I am walking alone
Donât see nothing beyond
Whereâs my freedom?

As the rain falls down on me
I look at the rainbowâs end
On this carved stone I stand
Traveling on my thoughts
Bloody rage possesses me
But this fury seems to be in vain
In this lonely village
Only silence will remain
In this lake I see my face
I see tired man
Lost soul from a distant world
A pain I cannot hold
A brave man fights âtill the end
My wounds will all be healed
So I die today
When my time comes then I will

[Chorus]
I finally see the light
My heart is hanging low
I see something beyond
Thatâs my freedom
