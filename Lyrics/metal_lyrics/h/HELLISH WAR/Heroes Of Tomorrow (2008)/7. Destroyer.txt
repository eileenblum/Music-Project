My glory leads my fate
And I canât see the end
I have a long way
Looking for the meaning of my life
Destroyer is my name
Tell me now my friend
That Iâm the right man to destroy at war
My horse runs through these valleys
Fast as I need
Through the tracks of the battle
I lead for my destiny
I bring the victory flame
And my time soon will end
And take me to where Iâm from
To the skies!

[Chorus]
Taste the pain of destroyer
Destroyer!
Face me again,
I'll destroy you
Betrayers are my target
Feel the hate of Destroyer
Destroyer!
Face my again,
I'll destroy you
Never surrender,no!
