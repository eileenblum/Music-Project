Running away from your fate, you go
Striving your soul, in the blade of your knife
Seeking peace you will find pain, oh no
How dangerous, daring, and fearful is life

Ripping parts from your skin, you sow
Your fear you fight, and you're there to defeat
But desperation is now in control
They're coming with anger, and death you will meet

Light you seek, but they won't let, no way!
Darkness keeps on saying follow me
They call you weak, but you can fight, you say!
You're going down, you know, you're losing your faith

Fire and killing around
Fire and killing unbound
Fire and killing around
Fire and killing unbound

Let there be, let there be, let there be: fire and killing!
