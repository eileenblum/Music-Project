Sometimes you don't wanna know
What hurts your feelings and kills your soul
Your mind needs to keep control
Only in this way you'll rule the world

Ride the wind and face the game
Fight it hard and take no blame
Leave out the fear and face the storm
Show the world why you were born

Get ready for...the challenge

No remorse
Your destiny
It lies in your hands

Never stop
Your destiny
It lies in your hands

Trust in you, it's a one way road
Either you win or lose the gold
Release the power within your soul
Losing your faith you'll lose the goal
