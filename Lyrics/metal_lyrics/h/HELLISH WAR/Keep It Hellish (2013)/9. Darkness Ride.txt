...And I'm always on the road
Turning darkness into hope
Trying to find my way home

I'm feeling down you need to come
To heal the marks in my soul
Before my mind changes our course

I'm coming here to stay
And there is no other way
The truth lies behind your eyes

And deceiving me with your mind
You can't take me apart
My strength is my guide

...and then
The night
Don't fear
The light

And I'm running out, out of my way
We need to move on, you can't stay
Trapped in time, light is the way
The patch is cleared of suffering and pain

Don't bring me down, you'll pay
You'll change the course, as I say
The rule is mine, you can't complain
You got to disappear, because I'm over here

And darkness seems to stay
But there's no need to pray
Because I'm here to save

And it's falling down the night
Soon the darkness will arrive
Be prepared to face the night

We can fight against it now
Hold the fire, take it down
Our desire will feed our power

In the end it's the same
And the moon will rise again
Time of darkness can't be changed
