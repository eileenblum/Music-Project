As soon as a promise is broken... you know it
The smell of betrayal is close... you feel it
No more stabs in your back... you've learned it
A light adorning your weapon... reflection

Your past is your shadow
It always stands beside you
Blade - mirror of death
As long as it reflects

Carrying an eye on your sleeve... observant
A breath between two steps... perceived
The sound of almost nothing... noticed
Deceivers will pay with their heads... tonight

Your past is your shadow
It always stands beside you
Blade - mirror of death
As long as it reflects

Reflects on the blade, you know
It reflects on the blade, you know
Reflects on the blade
It reflects on the blade

Your past is your shadow
It always stands beside you
Blade - mirror of death
As long as it reflects

Blade mirror
Attacking weapon as shield
Blade - mirror of death
As long as it reflects

Reflects on the blade, you know
It reflects on the blade, you know
Reflects on the blade
It reflects on the blade
