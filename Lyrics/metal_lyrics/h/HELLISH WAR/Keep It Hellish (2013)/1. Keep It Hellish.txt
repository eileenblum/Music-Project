Coldness - A long awaited friend
We salute - for all your care and warmth
Embrace - what you've been given
A chance you seek - to raise your voice out loud

Listen - Colliding grounds
Joining forces - to keep our souls alive
Understand - where you've been led
After the wait - by your troubles and mistakes

Places to see, wild hearts to meet
New brothers joining the war
Your home, our base, the gathering place
Return to the heavy years age

Places to see, wild hearts to meet
New brothers joining the war
Your home, our base, the catch and the chase
Feel the heat in your face

Hellish we keep - keep it hellish
Hellish we keep - keep it hellish
