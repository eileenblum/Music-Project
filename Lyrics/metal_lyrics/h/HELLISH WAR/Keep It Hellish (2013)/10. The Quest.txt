Lost in space, trapped in a maze
My fears overwhelm my desires
Standing alone, away from home
Leading an army of shadow and fire
Ran outta faith, blind in this haze
Not knowing what's about to come
Living my life, loneliness inside
Trying to break outta this hell

I have visions, that ain't religious
I won't wait for the messiah to come
This wave of faith, blinds the weak
But makes strong the brave
Searching for reasons, making predictions
For when the veil of mystery falls
We can count on just one thing
Is that death will come to us all

Is there a hope for an unbeliever?
I can't wait for God's decision
I'm the one who traces my fate
And I'll keep making it until the end

We paid for so long by the wrong decisions
But regrets are not a good ambition
Our quest must lead us to our destination
Should I trust it again?
Will I ever find my way?
