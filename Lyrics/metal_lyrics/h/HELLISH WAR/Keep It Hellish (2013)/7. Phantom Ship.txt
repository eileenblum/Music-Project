Cursed ones, under the moonlight
Seeking forgiveness
From their darkest sins
Breaking the waves, sailing on for eternity
Rulers of the oceans
Waving their black flags of misery

Undead crew, sailing into the night
Forgotten names
Written in blood
Battles are fought, never to be lost
In the ship of the black souls
Never reaching any shore

Consumed by lust, no God to trust
With power and greed
they are the crew of....the Phantom Ship

Ghosts of men, servants of hell
An endless nightmare
Shadows of home, long forgotten
In their hearts, an endless pain

Empty eyes, looking for a lost horizon
Doomed to sail on forever
In a world of hate and death
Bounded by the spell
They crossed the gates of hell
Inside the heart of darkness
They'll live to pay the price

Consumed by lust, no God to trust
With power and greed
They are the crew of....the Phantom Ship

Ghosts of men, servants of hell
An endless nightmare
Shadows of home, long forgotten
In their hearts an endless pain

They are sailing
on and on!
