Scars underneath your skin
Shows who you really are
Tell tales of your sins
No time can heal it all
The hurt you feel within
Is the pain you've caused
The fear you avoid to face
Is to know who you really are

I'm the man to kill
Don't threat me with your lies
There are no bounds for me
But you've crossed the line
My scars will never heal
I'm tired of your lies
Your words were unreal
I have a new scar

Tired of running away
And never going too far
Your past haunts your soul
And that's still dragging you down

The vows you've sworn
Were nothing more than lies
You'll rip what you have sown
A harvester of lies

I'm heeding the call
Just following your lies
I'm reaching the edge
There's no return

I'm heeding the call
Just following your lies
I'm reaching the edge
there's no return

I trusted my heart
And followed your lies
I've reached the edge
There's no return
