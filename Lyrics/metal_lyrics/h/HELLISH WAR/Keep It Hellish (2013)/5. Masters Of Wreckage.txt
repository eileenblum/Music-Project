Masters of wreckage
We rule the secrets
Infernal, blasphemed world
We kill the dragons
And haunt the beasts
Of your now destroyed world
Pillaging and killing
Raping the women
And leaving no men alive
Kings of nowhere
We come with no mercy
Singing our tunes of war

We are like rage
Thunder and lightning
We bring out the storm
Hunting together
Like wolves we share
Your skin and your rotten flesh
No tongues results
No lies and we have
Our way to rip it from you
Rage's all we got
Death's all we give
Spilling blood through the land

Here we come
To kill and destroy
Screaming higher

The loudest voice
The blood of the young ones
Is the wine for our vitality
Running red, fresh and warm
We are coming

Masters - end is near
Wreckage - end of fight
Masters - hell is here
Wreckage - end of times
