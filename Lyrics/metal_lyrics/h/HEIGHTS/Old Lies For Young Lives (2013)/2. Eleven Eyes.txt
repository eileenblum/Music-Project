[feat. Sam Carter Of Architects]Born and raised in these hollow days.

I'm sick, I'm tired.
Empty skulls run this place.
The world isn't working anymore,
The world isn't working at all.

Born and raised in these hollow days,
Empty skulls, black holes, white eyes, run this place.

Close your eyes, just pretend that I'm your friend.
Look out for yourself because there is no-one else.

Your life must be so fucking easy,
Living with your (eyes (closed) minds) never stop believing,
What they see through their empty skulls.

Give me something real,
Find me, somebody who feels
Different

I'm not the same,
I pray to God,
I pray to anyone,
I don't believe it anyway.
