I can't get any sleep,
I'm pulling out my hair.
It was grey, now it's gone,
It doesn't mean it wasn't there.

I'm scared of failure, scared of success,
Living life with a noose around my neck.

Weave the rope, with anxiety and fear.
Drown all hope in a swimming pool, it's locked away for years.

It may seem like the start of your day,
But it's the end of mine.

I'm not sleeping here tonight,
I'll lie here until the morning light.

And I wake up, just to fall asleep.
I wake up, wake up.
