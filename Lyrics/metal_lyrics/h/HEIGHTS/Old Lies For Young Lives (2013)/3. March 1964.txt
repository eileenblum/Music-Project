Mother, Father,
Who could I have been?
Mother, Father,
What could I have done?

Let's start a revolution,
Build our own wall.
Commit the crime of a century,
Because I want it all.

Mother, Father,
Build my own wall.
I wanna start a revolution,
Because I want it all.

Who could I have been?
What could I have done?
This is the March of 1964,
I could have been so much more.

I was unlucky to be born,
A part of the generation un-dead.
And if I could turn back time,
I would rewrite these lines for a meaning in my mind instead.
