I'll make amends for every mistake of life
If you make amends for every breath you took
Open my lungs, and finish what you started
Open my heart, and replace what you stole

Remember my name, remember my face
Remember where we've been
In the clear light of day
Your mind washes like the tides

I'll lead you down a well worn path, walk for days
Is there a light at the end of the road?
Rewrite my lines on the face of the sun
I'll hang them there for the world to see

Open you eyes, and witness the destruction
Open your ears, and hear what you've become

Is this where life begins
Find out who you really are

Remember my name, remember my face
Remember where we've been
In the clear light of day
Your mind washes like the tides

Remember (remember my name)
Remember (remember my face)
Remember (where we've been)

Open you eyes, and witness the destruction
Open your ears, and hear what you've become
