Let go of everything
You used to hold
Dare to regret
And dare to live

When you look and see
You haven't lived a single day
It brings you lower than you know
Moving mountains for you, mountains moving for me

How small we are
Next to this glorious dawn

I hope you realise

I hope you realise
That you meant everything
I'd smile to see you dig your grave
You're fucking dead to me
