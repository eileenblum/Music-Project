[feat. Jonathan Vigil from The Ghost Inside]We are, we are
The lost and alone
We are, we are
Never fucking going home

A test of will
A lesson learnt
I know there must be
More than this

Lungs collapse
Under the weight
Cries fall
On deafened ears

My cries fall on deafened ears

We are, we are
The lost and alone
We are, we are
Never going home

We are, we are
The lost and alone
We are, we are
Never fucking going home

Never fucking going home
