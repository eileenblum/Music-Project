Reap what you sew
Now its harvest season
Take back your words
I would change a moment
Clock hands
I'll turn them back
Hope of relief
Is history

This is a confession
This is a confession
This is a confession to my self

This smile a mask
Seconds of sleep
I'll close my eyes
So i cant hear or see you

Don't tell me life hangs on
The beating of a heart
I see your face everyday
Don't tell me life is nothing
Don't tell me life hangs on
The beating of a heart
I see your face everyday
Don't tell me life is nothing more

The air i gasp
Keep my head above
These waves that crash
Around my legs of stone

This is, this is, this is a confession

Don't tell me life hangs on
The beating of a heart
I see your face everyday
Don't tell me life is nothing
Don't tell me life hangs on
The beating of a heart
I see your face everyday
Don't tell me life is nothing more

Eye for an eye
Will make me blind

I put my life in these words i scream
I put my heart in this ink and bleed
I hope you hear my voice and know
That i mean every fucking word

Eye for an eye
Will make me blind
