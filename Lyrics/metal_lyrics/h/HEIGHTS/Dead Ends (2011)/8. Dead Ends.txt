I sit back and I sit alone
And watch you change with the seasons
You find yourself above it all
You can't drown when the rivers run dry

Where can you turn
When there's nowhere to turn
The cold truth of who you really are
I find it drags me deeper

I sit back and I sit alone
And watch you change with the seasons
You find yourself above it all
You can't drown when the rivers run dry

The people we used to be
Are dead to you and me
The people we used to be
Are dead ends
Are dead ends

We are dead ends
And that's all we'll ever be
