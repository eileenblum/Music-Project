Spiteful and filled with regret
Does that sound familiar to you?
Gonna go where no one knows my name
And bury my head in the sand

My love and hate now feels all the same
But at least I know I'm alive
In the eyes of your god I am not unique
And you're not strong

Wash the blood from your hands
I hope you try to forget
I don't cross your mind
Half as much as you do

I'll bury my head
In the sand

My love and hate now feels all the same
But at least I know I'm alive
In the eyes of your god I am not unique
And you're not strong

You're not as strong as you think you are
