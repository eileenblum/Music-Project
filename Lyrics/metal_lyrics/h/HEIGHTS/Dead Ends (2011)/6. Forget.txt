Faded photographs keep me from sleep
I see the stories in my minds eye

Where did I go wrong?
Where did I go wrong?

The sun will rise
And the time will pass
And I'll forget you
I will forget you

Days turn to months and months turn to years
As I search to find meaning

I had all the time in the world
And I lost myself
You had all the space in the world
And you found yourself

The sun will rise
And the time will pass
And I'll forget you
I will forget you
