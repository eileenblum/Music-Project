We act like animals
Who are we to decide a fucking thing
Whose next to be the messenger
Rising to defend what we will never let go
These secrets hold us down
Looking behind it all shuts us out
Nowhere to turn
We live in agony
Betrayed by the ones you love
The anger is burning your insides
Feeling has no more
In time it will eat us alive
Eat us alive
Make amends
Close your eyes
To the nonsense
Make amends
Close your eyes
To the nonsense
Reason with it all
And sing this song
Fear
Fear no one
Fear
Fear no one
Make amends
Close your eyes
We all live in this hell
