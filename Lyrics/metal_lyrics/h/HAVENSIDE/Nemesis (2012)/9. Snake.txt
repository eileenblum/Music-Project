You're sinking into the deep end
You surrounded yourself in
Putting all the mistakes to the side
No one cares if you live or die
You turned your back on the ones who were there for you
You stole from the ones that gave to you
Thinking real hard on the mistake
Won't change anything
What's done is done
What's said is said
Never take your friends for granted
The headlights in your head are dead
You need to turn around
Try to make your way home
These streets have no place for you
Make a change, stand up
State your reasons
For your wrongs
