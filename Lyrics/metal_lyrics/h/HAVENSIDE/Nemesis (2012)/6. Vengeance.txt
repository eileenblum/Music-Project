I can't trust no one
Everyone is out to get me
For those who judge

I am who I am
Nothing will change me
And yes - I'm cold-hearted
You would be
If you had everything stripped away
(everything stripped away)

I've been stabbed in the back
No truth in my past

I've once lost all hope
Giving it one last chance
Stay clear from my path

Fuck everything
Fuck everyone

Revenge will come to those
Revenge will come to those

I will find my peace
This is my destiny

I've been cheated, used and thrown away
I am who I am

Nothing will change my mind
Fuck everything
Fuck everyone

I've stood my own ground
I've learned to overcome
No truth in my past
No truth in my past

I can't trust no one
Revenge will come to those
I can't trust no one
Revenge will come to those
I can't trust no one
Revenge will come to those
