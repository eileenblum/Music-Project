[2x]
We are the victims
We are the change
We are the reason
There's no more pain

There's no more pain

Open up your mind
Let the clouds die
Let's wake up from our pathetic lives
Let's change our outcome
Take control, never lose hope
Never be broken down

[2x]
Hold your ground
Keep one foot in front of the other

[3x]
Don't lose hope

We are here to say what we need to say
You can try to bury us
We will dig ourselves back up
Getting stronger everyday

[4x]
Our hearts still beat

[2x]
We are the victims
We are the change
We are the reason
There's no more pain

There's no more pain

Our hope is our will

[5x]
Getting stronger everyday
