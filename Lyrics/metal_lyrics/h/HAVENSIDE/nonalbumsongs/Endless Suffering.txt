Forced to believe.
Endless fucking suffering.

In my mind your nothing but pain.
Sent to destroy everything that is sane. 
Everything that has meant something to me.

Today you can swim with the rats.
Your nothing more than straight gutterfied trash.
Feel free to drop off this fucking earth and get trapped under what you diserve.

Day to day through thick and thin i push forward. (push forward)
Never again will i let you pull me under. (never again)
Im holding on to more than a dream.
Im holding onto honor, friends, family.

I've never felt colder 
Living in this madness
Years are getting shorter
You said that this wasn't the end. 

Through thick and thin to conquer it.
You fill this emptiness with more sadness.

I hate everything. 
I hate you. (i hate you)
Born in this sadistic fucking world i pray for you. You call yourself a friend. 
Take a second to catch your breath, catch your lies.

Your cold, your sick, your nothing. How can you survive. 

Through thick and thin
Where would you run to?

Your in this alone
