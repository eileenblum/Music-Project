So bring the fucking hate..

Your dead to the world
Broken apart from the worlds minds
Wishful thoughts tighten up the chords
Beneath the skies you lie

No one can judge what i feel
What i see in fear
This is all im giving you
Cold dreams in sweat my dear

Did you know that
I never forgave you
Cold hands
Filled with broken promises
Did you know that
i never forgave you
Cold hands
Filled with broken promises

You built yourself so high
And now we all watch you fall
We all watch you fall like liers

I hope your hands are big enough
For all this hate
I hope your hands are big enough
For all this hate

You said fuck the world
No remorse for your actions
Lying 6 feet in the dirt
Everyone just speechless
Just speechless
No remorse for a better kind
Now fall

Fuck your world
And everything you built it on
Fuck your world
And everything you built it on
Fuck your world
And everything you built it on
