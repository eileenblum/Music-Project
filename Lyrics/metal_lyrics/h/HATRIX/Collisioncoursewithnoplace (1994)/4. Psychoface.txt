Resurrect another bad memory
Twisted by the shit it did to me
I can count the good days on one hand
Pain is the one thing I understand

It was God and she'd just sit there
Threw me down the stairs
So I could get some air
Bloody landing where I hit
Sickening, smiling, psycho face on it

Psychoface on it
Psychoface on it

Black shit scars my memories
In a hole that it made for me
Isolation my salvation, when I'm alone
There's no one beating me

It was God and she'd just laugh
Brains bashed 'til everything went black
Second son for the crucifix
Sick of smiling, psycho face on it

Psychoface on it
Psychoface on it

Re-enact the murder from memory
I did to it, just what it did to me
It got old it won't touch me again
Understand you weren't meant to understand

It was God and she went so fast
Now that trash is buried out in back
I flash back and I get sick
Sickening, smiling, psycho face on it

Psychoface on it
Psychoface on it
