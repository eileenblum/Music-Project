Gonna make a statement, terrorize the nation
About to waste, your lame ass I'll be famous
You'll be dead
Murder spree, mutilate, misery, ain't it great?

Everyone fears everyone, paranoia reigns
Swear that they've heard something
I love fuckin' with your brains
Can I use your telephone, I ran out of gas

In six months they'll find your bones
I'm havin' a blast
Paralyze humanity no one leaves there homes
I'll just plead insanity haunting voices
Won't leave me alone

I want more, I'll never stop
Fatal wound
Watch'em drop

Eeine, meanie, miney, moe
Close my eyes and point gotta laugh when
Some lady asks: "have you seen this little boy?"

I've forgotten who I've killed,
I'm starting to lose count
I guess I'll just keep weeding 'til I dig the bad seeds out

I stepped on a pretty flower; "Oops! Oh well, this is much fun,
I'll never miss my padded cell"

Picture in the paper and
Porky on my tail
Can you spare a million, bud?
I might need it for my bail

Funny guy, you better laugh, my diet plan, you're cut in half
I'll never learn my lesson, never ever stop
There's far too many
People help the population drop

Decapitate, lost your head, jugular vein, pouring red
What remorse, what do you mean pity?
I don't feel a thing I did what they told me
When I heard the angels sing

I'm back in my straight jacket,
They still think that I'm a basket case!
They'll let me back out someday

So little Jeffrey can play
Now all I can do is daydream of cutting into
Your bloodstream, let me back out
So I can murder - so I can finish God's work
