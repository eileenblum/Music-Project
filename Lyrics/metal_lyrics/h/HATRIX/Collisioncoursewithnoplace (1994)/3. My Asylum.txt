Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to myself
Outsiders aren't welcome in my private little hell
I'm a bastard, little bitch, I'm a fuckin' whore
Sometimes I get the best of me
At least I'm never bored
I know I am, who am I?

Alienated unconscious feeling
Rot away counting the dots on the ceiling
Overload, inside my attic
Withdrawn from the real world
Like an addict

D.T.'s I've forgotten my name
Who gives a fuck? I was never anyone anyway
Thoughts run together inside of my head
There's no brain cells livin' now
Cause we're all dead

My asylum, insane kingdom, delirium
Me, myself and I; asylum
Insane kingdom, delirium
Me, myself and I; asylum, my asylum
My asylum, this is my asylum
