It's hard to keep myself in line
In one ear and out of my mind
Who do I think I am?
I'm lost, I'm saved, I'm dead, I'm damned

It's not hard to hate
Exterminate, depopulate
Erase disgrace of human race

Playing God's my favorite game
Inside in flames, outside I'm the same
Walk among you like a friend
Guess again I am the end

It's not hard to hate
The ripping of your faith
Take you to your resting place

Not hard to, hard to hate
Hard to hate

Murder's in no more a sin
Execution, revolution
Pray for you don't pray for me
And choke on you're mortality

It's not hard to hate
Exterminate, depopulate
Erase disgrace of human race
