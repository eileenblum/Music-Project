I want to give it up, before they take it all
It's like a sick crush, torn between stand or fall

I've given up on me, addictions pain and grief
Sucks out my sanity, chokes on all I believe
A good excuse to me, the reason why I breath
I hate reality as much as it hates me

Soul doesn't fear you
My mind cannot think you
Faith doesn't feel you
My eyes cannot hear you

Enough's never enough
So what else have you got?
I need some self destruct
'Til the last cell is shot

I've given up on me, addictions pain and grief
Sucks out my sanity, chokes on all I believe
A good excuse to me, the reason why I breath
I hate reality as much as it hates me

Soul doesn't fear you
My mind cannot think you
Faith doesn't feel you
My eyes cannot hear you

Deprivation,
Deprivation
