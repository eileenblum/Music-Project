Afflicted with sight
Sure wish I was blind
Take away my choice
Close and lock my mind

Colors of black and white
Deformed yet divine
Can't see past the flesh
And know what is inside

Earthly pleasures hellacious pain
They're indivisible, feel just the same

I'm not your problem
You don't need to care
You can turn your back
Like I'm not ever there
I was never no one
No one is my name
Act like it's my fault
No one is to blame

Addicted to hate, I take more everyday
The smile on your face fades
And horror takes it's place

Hurt that won't heal
I'd kill just to not feel
In the shadows I reside or in a show carnival side

There's no pleasure, no peace, just pain
Nothing and I, we are one we're no one in the same

I'm not your problem
You don't need to care
You can turn your back
Like I'm not ever there
I was never no one
No one is my name
Act like it's my fault
No one is to blame

No one is to blame

Afflicted with sight
Sure wish I was blind
Take away my choice
Close and lock my mind

Colors of black and white
Deformed yet divine
Can't see past the flesh
And know what is inside

Earthly pleasures, hellacious pain
They're indivisible, feel just the same

I'm not your problem
You don't need to care
You can turn your back
Like I'm not ever there
I was never no one
No one is my name
Act like it's my fault
No one is to blame

No one, no one
