Fisk i GrÃ¸ndal beit ikkje pÃ¥
Til Ã¸yde seter han Nils laut gÃ¥
Og sengja seg innom stokke-nov
Med regnet tromma sÃ¥ godt han sov

Men brÃ¥tt han vakna og var i lag
Med folk og kretur i solljos dag
Det lydde bjÃ¸llur, lokk og raut
Og anga stulstell og lukt av naut

Ei ven budeie med mjÃ¸lking stulla
Og ein vidunderleg slÃ¥tt ho tulla
NÃ¥r inn i bue ho byttar bar
Og sila mjÃ¸lka i kjel og kar

Det rokk og varde til Nils fekk sjÃ¥
At det var huldra han lydde pÃ¥
Med slÃ¥tt i minnet, Ã¥leine att
Han som ein annan tok livet fatt

[English translation:]

Hulder Tune

Fish in GrÃ¸ndal wouldn't bite
To lonely mountain-dairy Nils had to go
And find rest in the corner of chopped logs
When the rain started drumming he was fast asleep

Suddenly he awoke and was in company
Of people and farm-animals in sunny day
Cowbells sounded, calls and moos
And tang of cabin-work4 and smell of cattle

A beautiful milkmaid with milking puttered
And a wonderful song she sung
When inside she carried the buckets
And sifted the milk into kettle and tub

A long time passed until Nils took note
That it was the Hulder he was listening to
With the song in his memory, alone again
He'd never live his life the same again.
