[Tim: I had a pumping riff which reminded me a bit of DIO]
[and i tried for months to get the right hook:]
[An individual person can not change the world.]

[vers:]
soon we realize 
that hole in the sky 
we don't know why 
there is no tomorrow 
our time it is borrowed 
for a while 
[ref:]
there's a hole in the sky 
but we don't know why 
maybe they want 
that all people die 
it doesn't matter 
who's wrong or right 
we really don't want to die 
by the hole in the sky 
[vers:] 
wake up all you people 
we know it's no secret 
we can't be that blind 
we hope it is fertile 
cause we don't want to die 
as long here to stay 
this is the right way
