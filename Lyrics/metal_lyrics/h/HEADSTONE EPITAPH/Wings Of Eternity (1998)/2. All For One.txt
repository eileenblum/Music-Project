[Martin: step by step i added the parts together and had]
[amazing results, cool, huh? A vagabond tells a story]
[About friendship and unity which is much more important than money.]

[vers:]
we live on the sidewalk 
on the path to hell 
seven golden years 
for our farewell 
it is not that easy 
to move from place to place 
where we are 
begins a scornfull chase 
we are not envited 
we're so pitiful 
far away from home 
and far off any rule 
[ref:]
we all live under the sun 
one for all and all for one 
allthough bad weather 
and cold and dirty air 
we don't give up in despair 
[vers:] 
sometimes more satisfying 
belonging to the poor 
your friends are very close to you for sure 
in the end don't regret 
cause we are feeling good 
we don't like the kings 
just robin hood 
we are not envited 
we're so pitiful 
closer to our friends 
and closer to the rule
