[Tim: i was looking for a riff that was classic speed metal.] 
[The song's About people WHO hypnotize you with their searing eyes] 
[and how impossible it is to see what?s behind them.]

[vers:]
you sear with your eyes on my skin 
I feel the pain allthough 
I'm so afraid but 
I still feed your flame 
[ref:]
searing eyes 
searing eyes 
[vers:] your touch on my skin 
like a burning laser blade 
destroying deadly lips 
praying it's not to late 
[ref:]
searing eyes 
searing eyes 
searing eyes 
[vers:]
you're playing your role 
with devotion so real 
that i can't feel 
your emotion
