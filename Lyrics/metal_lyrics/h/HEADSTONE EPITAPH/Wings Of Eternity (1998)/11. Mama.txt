[Martin: a heavy riff expressing an even heavier message: child abuse.]

[vers:]
Mama would you listen to your son 
would you listen to what I say 
can't you see that helpless one 
can't you see me how I pray 
I'm afraid to tell you what I bear 
say no word to no one 
by god you swear 
Mama do you know what I really know 
do you know what I conceal 
it is terrible and horrible 
and no one can feel what I feel 
I deny myself 
and I deny my pain 
my childhood turns 
from sunshine into rain 
[ref:] 
Mama are you blind 
if only the father in heaven is with me 
he gives me the answer to be 
I wish he could not find my hide-out 
if you're not at home 
those bad times 
if we are alone
