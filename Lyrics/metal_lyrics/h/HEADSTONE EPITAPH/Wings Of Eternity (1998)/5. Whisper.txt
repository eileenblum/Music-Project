[Tim: inspired by a psychEdelic moment where]
[i tried to create a ballad that wasn't to classic.]
[Lovers afflicted with doubts.]

[vers:]
will I follow words I've ever known 
will I leave you here leave you now alone my dear 
will I always know 
[ref:]
whisper my aim 
and let me know the same 
let me know what I don't know 
and what I always claim 
[vers:]
remember what I've told to you 
that I am susceptible to what you say is 
my command 
my will and my life is in your hand 
will I always know
