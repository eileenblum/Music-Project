[Tim: just a straight, fast and melodic song,]
[About Lovers torn by death but are still in spiritual communication.]

[vers:]
walking through the darkness again 
I'm not alone 
I'm surrounded by a friend 
deep in the night 
you said to me 
I'll be at your side 
I want you to be 
please rescue me 
[ref:] 
Burn for me a light 
Burn it every night 
light for me the way 
until the light of day 
[vers:] 
I've been always there 
to keep an eye on your heart 
no one should dare 
to tear it apart 
say it again over and over 
and over my friend 
I want to hear it again
