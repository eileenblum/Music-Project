[Martin: The song came About during a jam session with Jurgen,]
[We wanted to create a power hymn. then Frankie]
[and i had some more ideas and one night we finished the song]
[right over the phone Life is a fight and we are prepared.]

[vers:]
we are standing tall 
we are standing straight 
always be prepared 
never be afraid never 
will surrender never 
will devine 
hear our battle cry 
till the end of time 
[ref:]
we are the fighting sons 
but we don't fight with guns 
[vers:] 
there's something you should know 
there's something you should see 
look into my eyes 
be my enemy 
up from the cradle 
till they bury us 
we are very loyal 
loyal to the crust 
[ref:] 
we are the fighting sons 
but we don't fight with guns 
for all the world to see 
wings of eternity
