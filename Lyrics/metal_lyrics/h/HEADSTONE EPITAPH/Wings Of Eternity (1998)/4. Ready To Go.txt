[Martin: This song just arose very spontaneously in the]
[rehearsal room while we were preparing for studio]
[cause we needed another headbanger song.]

[vers:]
oh yeah we are the hopeless generation 
and so i wonder there's no revelation 
you live in the past alright 
[ref:]
ready to go 
to the future 
we are ready 
to go on i know 
to the limit 
ready to go on 
and on and on 
[vers:]
take care of the good friends 
maybe they are not like you 
and see all the good things 
go on to face the truth 
you live ini the past alright
