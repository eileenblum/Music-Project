[Martin: The basic riff was inspired by the music of an]
[old video game i played in my childhood.]
[The first song we wrote after our debut album.]
[it was really hard work: Most people are good actors.]

[vers:]
hey are you full of desire 
you keep on walkin? your way 
so hard you need to inspire 
cause you need the fringe group today 
wantcha to pass over in silence 
can't accept your way of life 
oheyoh every minute 
and all day through 
[ref:] 
oheyoh look under the sky 
all the people do believe in many lies 
if they only get along 
well with you every minute 
and all day through 
[vers:] 
hey you you couldn't be tired 
we'll keep on makin' 
you stay right now 
we're risin' up higher 
right now 
you wanna change 
the train we share 
the same conditions 
but we don't share 
you're way of life 
oheyoh every minute 
and all day through
