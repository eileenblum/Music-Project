[Martin: the basic riff was picked up by Tim with the idea]
[of a subtle electronic sound a Tribute to technique]
[which is fascinating and scary.]

[vers:]
we have electronic toys 
and elecrtronic pain 
I hear a voice deep inside my brain 
I hear you talkin' loud and clearly 
"every step you're walking" 
it said to me 
but in the end 
I wonder why 
it's comin' back 
[ref:] 
we are belovers of fidelity 
always forever on and on 
[vers:] 
I see a sign before my eyes 
a sign that says: buy me 
hear the awful cries 
hear what will be 
I see a sign that says: buy me 
[ref:] 
we are belovers of fidelity 
always forever on and on 
who knows if that is our fate maybe 
our fate to overdo fidelity...? 
[vers:] 
don't care 
care about ambition 
this is your aim 
this is your mission
