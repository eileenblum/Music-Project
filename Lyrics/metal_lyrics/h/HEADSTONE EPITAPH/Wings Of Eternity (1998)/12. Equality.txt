[Tim: actually a song from 1992. With new lyrics.]
[Inspired by my distinctive Feeling for equity.]

[vers:]
you can't beat the rhythm of my heart 
you can't declare your aim 
you want to rule the world on your own 
it does not mean the same 
you missuse the law 
as a punishment for the people 
you don't like you 
don't let them up 
you don't defend 
no you don't let them strike 
[ref:] 
we are the people you don't like to see 
allthough you promise equality 
[vers:] 
why can't you take me as i am 
why can't you leave me be 
i wanna be the person that i am 
wanna be the real me 
[ref:] 
we are the people you don't like to see 
allthough you promise equality 
[vers:] 
we all want to be free 
for all eternity 
until the end of time 
something in my heart just cries 
don't want to hear your alibies 
hope this is 
Your final excuse
