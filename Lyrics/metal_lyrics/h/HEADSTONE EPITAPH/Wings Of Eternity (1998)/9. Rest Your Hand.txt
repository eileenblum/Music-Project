[Tim: the first song i wanted since years to be straight, fast and melodic..]
[it's About my belief in eternal love and friendship.]

[vers:]
you are alone and so am I 
why don't we live together always 
and then be my best friend forever and ever 
we are so close 
no one would dare to come between our love 
take my hand 
and then i swear to 
rest your head 
[ref:] 
rest Your head on my shoulder 
rest your head on my shoulder 
I wanna hold your hand 
until the promised land 
at the horizons' sea 
so far away it seems 
[vers:] 
something in me said 
it's for always 
I'm not to blind to see 
it's for always 
[ref:] 
rest your head on my shoulder 
rest your head on my shoulder 
I wanna hold your hand 
until the promised land 
at the horizons' sea 
so far away it seems 
[vers:] 
you are the one for me 
no doubt about 
we believe there is nothing 
instead to hold your hand 
and rest your head
