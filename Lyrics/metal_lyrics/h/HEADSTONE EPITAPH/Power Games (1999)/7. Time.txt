[Sometimes we lose sight of a friend and aren't in touch for ages, just to meet once more and be really close again for a long time.]

Here we are again
It's time to say goodbye
Remember me my friend
We'll meet us in a while

It's just a promise but you will remember well
These are the words I have to tell

Time
Will make all our dreams
Come true forever
Together we cry for the moon and
Time
Wherever you are
I will be calling
If time should be lost
It won't be soon

Out in the world
And out in the cold
Hear our message
And remember what we've told

It's just a promise but you will remember well
These are the words we have to tell 
Time
Will make all our dreams
Come true forever
Together we cry for the moon and
Time
Wherever you are
I will be calling
If time should be lost
It won't be soon

Tell where you are
Tell me when you coming home
Will it be too long
Maybe I don't wanna go

It's just a promise but you will remember well
These are the words we have to tell

Time
Will make all our dreams
Come true forever
Together we cry for the moon and
Time
Wherever you are
I will be calling
If time should be lost
It won't be soon
