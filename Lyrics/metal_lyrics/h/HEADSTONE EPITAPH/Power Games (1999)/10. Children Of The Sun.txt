[Sometimes you lose sight of what's important and then it takes good friends to get you on the right track again.]

One lonely day in the city
One lonely day in town
It seems like there`s no pity
There`s coldness all around
I`m in the wrong direction
I dreamt that no one cares
And there`s a strong selection
It`s time to be aware
I`m feeling so bare
Children of the sun
Shine your light down here
There`s a shadow falling
Shows our darkest fears
In a world of wonders
That we knew before
Lead us from the darkness
To an open door

We all need conversation
Somebody break the ice
Lead us from isolation
And give us good advice
That shows us all the blindness
And shows us your disgust
We are losing hold of kindness
It`s something we can bust
You`re all we can trust

Children of the sun
Shine your light down here
There`s a shadow falling
Shows our darkest fears
In a world of wonders
That we knew before
Lead us from the darkness
To an open door

I want to fly away
I`m fine since we are free
We see the light of the day
Save us from misery
We`ve got the right direction
We now know that you care
And of your grand affection
We all should be aware

Children of the sun
Shine your light down here
There`s a shadow falling
Shows our darkest fears
In a world of wonders
That we knew before
Lead us from the darkness
To an open door
