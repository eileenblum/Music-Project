[Virtual war games in the kids' rooms belittle realtity ?!?]

We all thought that we're rebells
We all thought that we're fine
Convinced that we can live forever
And all the power in our minds
Oh, no we are not like angels
Oh, no we can't give you hope
Can't show the face behind the cover
Afraid you're falling down the slope

When you find yourselve alone
Can't get a piece of the action
And there's noone left to take you down
Be the

King of kill
Keep your iron will
Got to live forever
Give us the thrill

You move very nimble foreward
You move creeping by my side
Ther's not a chance for your enemy
There's not a perfect place to hide
Behind the doors and the windows
Behind every single wall
You sense always where the wind blows
You know you got to win it all

When you find yourselve alone
Can't get a piece of the action
And there's noone left to take you down
Be the

King of kill
Keep your iron will
Got to live forever
Give us the thrill

The time has come
You have risen from defeat
But not yet beaten
Till your rival
You shall meet
Behind the gallows
Appears a silhouette
One chance of vengeance
Is all that you will get

King of kill
Keep your iron will
Got to live forever
Give us the thrill
King of kill
Keep your iron will
Got to live forever
Give us the thrill
