[Believe, no matter what we believe in, to some extend helps us understand supernatural things.]

Far over the hills and far over the ocean
There is a place of absolute devotion
We have the power and we have the silence
So we can recover from evil and violence

And in control we heal our soul

From the mountains to the sea
Where the light can shine on me
Where the eagles in the sky
Find their place to die

Hear now the story, they told us a rumour
Of power and glory and blackhearted humor
Beyond the curtain of mercyful graceness
You bought off your friends cause
You can't give them kindness

So in control you heal your soul

From the mountains to the sea
Where the light can shine on me
Where the eagles in the sky
Find their place to die

If we return to heaven
Or wherever we come from
Our destiny lies hidden,
Like the clouds can hide the sun
The only thing that matters
Is there's something we can hold
That gives us all the power
To become the wise and old

From the mountains to the sea
Where the light can shine on me
Where the eagles in the sky
Find their place to die

From the mountains to the sea
Where the light can shine on me
Where the eagles in the sky
Find their place to die
