[I don't understand people that drown in self pity instead of looking at life as a game in which you can come up as a winner as well.]

I know there's a part of me
And i'ts what I call the game
So it is and will ever be,
It'll always be the same
And my life seems to be alright
And I believe in what I do
Gotta work every night and day,
Just to make my dreams come true

To win the game,
Means to have so much power
Cause in the game,
We don't need the coward

I might be a better man
If I believe in all the good
Could it be that you're wrong my friend
And you don't struggle like ya should
All the pain pushing down on me,
No this isn't what i need
I don't care bout the other guys
I just wanna get on my feet

To win the game,
Means to have so much power
Cause in the game,
We don't need the coward

We don't need to gamble
We don't need to play
Courage is the answer
For a better way

I remember all the good in life
And all the pleasures that we have had
So important to be powerful
And to be equal to the bad

To win the game,
Means to have so much power
Cause in the game,
We don't need the coward

To win the game,
Means to have so much power
Cause in the game,
We don't need the coward
