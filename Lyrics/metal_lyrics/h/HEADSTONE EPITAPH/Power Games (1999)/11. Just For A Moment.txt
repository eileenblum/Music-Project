[Due to generalisation and the media we're being swamped with bad news, which causes us to become impassive.]

Look me in the eyes there's something to regret
We don't know how to go ahead
Close the door to keep out the light
Don't deny yourself this simple right

Something in the air, something we don't know
Is is just a shelter to hide us from the flow?

Just for a moment, we let the children die
If there's a reason, noone knows just why
Just for a moment we see it on tv
If there's a reason, it's not the one for me

Something's in the air and if we only could take care
A thousand questions and we need to be aware
Take the easy way cause noone's got to know
Are we too gutless to revolt against the flow?

Just for a moment, we let the children die
If there's a reason, noone knows just why
Just for a moment we see it on tv
If there's a reason, it's not the one for me

On and on, the thought goes round in my mind
On and on, is this a part of the destiny of mankind?

Just for a moment, we let the children die
If there's a reason, noone knows just why
Just for a moment we see it on tv
If there's a reason, it's not the one for me
