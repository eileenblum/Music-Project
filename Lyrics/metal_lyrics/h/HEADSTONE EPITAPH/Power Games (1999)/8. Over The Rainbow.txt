[The meaning is close to 'The Game': help yourself.]

When you're in trouble
And when you feel pain
You hear it over
And over again
That demon inside you
He tries to persuade
It's such a tragedy
When it's too late

Over the rainbow
Far beyond the clouds
There's always something
But you can't reach out

It's sometimes hard for you
To overcome
You feel so much better
After it's done
Don't be so lazy
And don't be a fool
You are so stubborn,
As stubborn as a mule

Over the rainbow
Far beyond the clouds
There's always something
But you can't reach out
Follow the fire,
Hold on to your dreams
And with desire
You will find the means

Over the rainbow
Far beyond the clouds
There's always something
But you can't reach out
Follow the fire,
Hold on to your dreams
And with desire
You will find the means
