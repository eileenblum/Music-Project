[Some people and/or nations look at wars or manoeuvers during peaceful times as being a great adventure or game.]

There's a haze upon the water
And the smoke, it hides the land
A full moon is shining
And it's time to take a stand

We'll come,
We'll see,
We'll take the victory
One night in hell,
Then all is well

We'll come,
We'll see,
We'll take the victory
One night in hell,
Then all is well

Then you see the torture
Could it be a crime?
This humiliating justice
Puts indifference in their minds

We'll come,
We'll see,
We'll take the victory
One night in hell,
Then all is well

We'll come,
We'll see,
We'll take the victory
One night in hell,
Then all is well

Tear down the houses,
Burn down the fields
The wind blows the ashes
Over the hills

We'll come,
We'll see,
We'll take the victory
One night in hell,
Then all is well

We'll come,
We'll see,
We'll take the victory
One night in hell,
Then all is well
