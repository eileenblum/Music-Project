[Love in all of its many facettes takes both giving and taking.]

Don't want it, don't need it,
Be pissed off, or cheated
I never hurt my friends
I tell you my dreams
And my secrets, my sins
I know it's in good hands with you

Dont want it, don't need it,
To see what I believe in
We falsify the truth
Decision, submission,
You know that it sometimes hurts
To be the foolish one

Believe in the power of love
That comes from the heaven above
A saviour from heaven, not hell
We needn't be under his spell

Go onwards, go our way,
We're learning from yesterday
We have to make mistakes
I often think of you
I know that you do it too
This is the bond we justify

Believe in the power of love
That comes from the heaven above
A saviour from heaven, not hell
We needn't be under his spell

Believe in the power of love
That comes from the heaven above
A saviour from heaven, not hell
We needn't be under his spell
