Oh man, you must be strong
'Cause trust can prove you wrong
Feel the words of this song
The pain remains, but not for long

You see where it all started
Feeding your wounds with hatred
Giving up is for the dead
Live it up for what's been said!

[Chorus:]
Nothing is real but the pain inside
Suffer the loss of your own pride
Keep fighting for what you've been denied
You cannot win without a fight

Stop thinking about deceptions
And start taking actions
You've had your share of treasons
Get revenge with passion

Nightmares won't be erased
Until all hell is raised
Climb the walls that have been laid
And smile at those who have betrayed

[Chorus]

Now you can stand tall
The giant of your cause
Smiling at everyone
It's now so fun!

You think you've seen it all
You think it can't be worse
You just need to carry on
And see where you belong

Everything is real but the pain inside
Feel the rebirth of your own pride
Keep fighting for what you feel is right
You'll never win without a fight

You can't win without a fight!
