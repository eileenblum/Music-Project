The sun goes down
Their lives begin to fade away
Their spirits drown
Heading for a darker day
The ancient kings
Will haunt these catacombs

Their souls will fly

The supreme reign
Now part of history
The bloody rain
All over their territory
The desert war
Is pictured in the sand

The drawing of agony

Haunting the nights
Treasured kingdom
Of the ancient kings

Rise!
Fall...

The battle scars
Will be mummified
Under the stars
Bodies will putrefy
An evil spell
Shall be taking lives

Even in our times

2007 - nothing has really changed
The beast still roars in the Middle-East
They count their dead
To see who wins the game

The blood of all

Haunting the nights
Treasured kingdom
Of the ancient kings

Rise!
Fall...
