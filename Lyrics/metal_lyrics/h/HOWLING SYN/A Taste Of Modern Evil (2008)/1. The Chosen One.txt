That night, I cursed in fire
What should've been our hope
When you fell down, all my screams were cold
I carried our life on my deathbed
Like a queen, I gave all my blood
To kill the sight of my dying world

Since he was born, he was said to be the Chosen One
The prophecy was a lie - all hope is gone
Now he must face another path - visions undone
So dark that he's feared by all - darkness has won

My path was bound by your fate
And we heeded its call
No wise or fool could foresee your fall
My illusions drowned in your last smile
In the end, I hope you'll join me
Two orphans of what was meant to be

Since he was born, he was said to be the Chosen One
The prophecy was a lie - all hope is gone
He turned his gaze from the light - visions undone
Fear is now his sole ally - darkness has won
