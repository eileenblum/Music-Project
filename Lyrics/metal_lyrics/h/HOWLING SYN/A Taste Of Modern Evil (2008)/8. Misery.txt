I only trust my fate
I only believe in what my eyes see
I will find my way in my abyss of disbelief

I only love myself
I only live in darkness
All these years I was lying &amp; dying in my abyss of disbelief

You are my friend, Misery
You live in me, Misery
You think like me, Misery
You'll die with me, Misery

Hail to you, my shadow
Live my downfall - follow my path

Six feet under... The worms!
Be the witness - I'm falling from grace

You are my friend, Misery
You live in me, Misery
You think like me, Misery
You'll die with me, Misery

Hail to you, my shadow
Live my downfall - follow my path

Six feet under... The worms!
Be the witness - I'm falling from grace

Leave me alone, Misery
You won't control, Misery
Obey my rules, Misery
Are you myself, Misery?

Are you me?
