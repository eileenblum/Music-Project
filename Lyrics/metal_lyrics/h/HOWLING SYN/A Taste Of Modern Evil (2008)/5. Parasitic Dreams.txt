[Chorus:]
waking up in a trance
a nightmare full of romance
make the darkest alliance
while the skeletons dance
covered up with spiders
and countless creepy creatures
the bites eat you like fire
your hand becomes the vulture

take the road of the soulless zombies
or sip the life of the sleeping beauty
run away from the fierce wolfking
to meet the crow at the edge of the abyss

Have no fear...

[Chorus]

catch the broom of the wicked witches
crawl your way out of a bath of leeches
taste the evil the modern evil
and face the fear before your heart stops beating

Have no fear...

[Chorus]
