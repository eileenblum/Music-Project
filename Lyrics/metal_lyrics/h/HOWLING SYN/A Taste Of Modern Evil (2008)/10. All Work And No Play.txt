gonna hang the Pierrot today
gonna lock the jesters' slay-room
make it all work and no play

then make the white of this groom
crimson the bloom and turn to gray
can someone shove me back soon?

summed-up friends, threw them away
released in sad rhymes from this tune
where do my hopes stand from that day

and no play... me back soon... from that day

[Chorus:]
comfort from my box or cheers from the crowd
I need a detox from those silent shouts
heaven or cell - the clown keeps the clouds
my orphaned hell is only ups and downs

returning I'm not yet gone
my ragged world from their pain
adds a water side to my sun

now all warmth is down the drain
the tourniquet can carry on
and maybe I can breathe again

the clown is back from Babylon
his makeup running through his veins
is this really where I come from?

to my sun... breathe again... I come from

[Chorus]

all work and no play makes Jack a doll boy
