[CHORUS:]
Bloody Blossom
You stretch the black in our eyes to make us see
The nights turn red when the candles are burning high

Fear the hand of a man who wants to cleanse you of your sin
Eat the fruit of our lives while the claws are still within
Keep your faith in the blood of a sea of innocence
For the fate of your kind will live on ignorance

[CHORUS]

You've led the chase of 1000 years of suffering
And the day will come when the sun won't be rising
I can feel your emptiness but I could not set you free
I could fill you for a night but I'd be lost in your eternity

[CHORUS]

Sip the unholy dew of God's creation
Be the eternal beauty of a rose
And blossom through the dark ages that we know
Under the dreading eye of all the ancients

[CHORUS]
