So many years without light
So many moons without you
Afraid of the sun we are
The sorrow will reign

I feel so weak without you
This empty castle that echoes your voice
My pain and my fear of the sun have stopped me from saving your soul
You must stay in the dark to save your life from the other side
The bright side, their holy light will make us all die soon
For good!

When Iâll rise alone on my throne
All the memories will be coming from you
When Iâll stand alone in the sun
All the ashes will be going to you

All my nights have lost their black from visions of your suffering
I know some dusk youâll be back cause I still can hear you sing for me

So many years without light
So many moons without you
Afraid of the sun we are
The sorrow will reign
So many cries in my tears
So many crimes in my dreams
Burn you alive they did
Leave me in ache

With 600 years of eternal passion weâve felt the lust
Now I feel lost
Within those years of Darkness that we shared
I want you back, I need you back at any cost
Traveling through the years makes us old my dear
But I will keep my anger for those Killers of the Night
On your honor till we meet again
I want you back, I need you back
Till we meet again!
