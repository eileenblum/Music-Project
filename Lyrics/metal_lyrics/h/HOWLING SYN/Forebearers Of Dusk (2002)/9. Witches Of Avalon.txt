The witches are sometimes crazy, sometimes genius
So is this night!

War has begun to Avalon
War blood dripping under the sun
War has begun to Avalon
War blood is dripping on and on

Victory has a name
The witches are insane
Chivalry of fear
Peasants in tears
Battle for freedom
Made to own the kingdom
Witches vs knights
What a beautiful night

Welcome!
To the last battle for freedom

[REPEAT]
