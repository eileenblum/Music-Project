We'll meet the beast with our hands on fire
The kingdom lays upon them
The winds will carry clouds and ships
But the crown stands on the force of our breath

[CHORUS:]
On our curse lays our hope
On our spells lays our war
In our eyes flows our destiny
Your dark chivalry brings light to my soul

There is a spark in the eye of the beloved
And a becoming in their sword
But still the howling of the trees
Holds the gaze of the north wind's love

[CHORUS]

Evil curse, evil spells
Our destiny lies on dark chivalry

Run through the winter like a black wolf
But first cross the sins of the angels
And though the night is out of snow
There'll still be time for this cold blooming

[CHORUS]
