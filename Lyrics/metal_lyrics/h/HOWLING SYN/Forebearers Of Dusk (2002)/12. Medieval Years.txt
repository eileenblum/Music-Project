I will protect you with this holy sword
And I will convince you with my hidden words
I will kill the dragon of your fears
So listen to my story of Medieval Years

[CHORUS:]
I run, I run
She sees, she takes
The king she fights
She wins
She kills my sins
I killed the king
I lie dead on my throne

Ten days at the peak of the mountain
The rebellious angel finds her way
To my dark castle she comes again
To my dark castle... She'll never leave

[CHORUS]
