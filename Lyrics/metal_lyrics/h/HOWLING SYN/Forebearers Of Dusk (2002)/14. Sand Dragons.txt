Sitting in the desert
I listen to the sandy silence
That crumbles your name
Between a thousand fountains
As if the sun was only up there
As if the winds blew no more
Through these giant sand dragons

Sitting in the desert
Waiting for the night to end
To open my eyes
To these thousand fountains
As if the time never stopped for me
As if the sun hid in pain
Not to wake the sleeping dragons

Sitting in the desert
As if the sand was cooler than blood
I crumble their name
And for my last night
There arise the sand dragons
