Vampyra this is your symphony

Lay your soul to rest and face your demons then the fear inside you will disappear
Black wings, black angel
Take my hand Vampyra and dream of a better world where the time is lost in time
Fear, hate, darkness

Eternal reign of the night

This is your symphony

Eternal reign of the night
