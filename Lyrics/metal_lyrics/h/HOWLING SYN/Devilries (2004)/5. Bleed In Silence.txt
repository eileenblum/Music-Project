This hell-raising path that's pumping through my veins
Lying in my bloodbath it's my paradise again
They asked me to bleed in silence
At least they showed some mercy
Like it's my only sentence I just want to be free!

[CHORUS:]
Leave my soul in peace
Take away my crimes
Leave my soul in peace
Wash away my cries
Leave my soul in peace
Take away my pain
Leave my soul in peace

The hooks is my skin as painful as my sins
The screams in my head: a distortion for the dead
Alive in confusion, thoughts of disillusion
What should have been a game
Turned out to be my bloody pain

[CHORUS]

Take away my pain! Wash my sins away!

[CHORUS]
