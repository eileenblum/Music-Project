Every morning
I face up my frights
The sun is dark
And the wind is silent

I was hoping
To feel the sweetness
Of your soul
And your angelic chants

[CHORUS:]
I will cast spells and magic
To bring you back
Reality is the weakness of life
I wish I was dead
To feel you again
One last time
(Please) Whisper my name

Take my hand
And remember our past
The good things in life
Never last

You were so close to me
For this one night
Life and Death - give and take
The life we used to live is now decayed
Far away from our dreams

[CHORUS]
