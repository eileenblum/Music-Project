I am the Night
I am your dreams
I'm the one who makes you scream
I'm the tormentor
Twisting your mind into my nightmare
The violator
In all men's stare

You have entered my dreams
Now you see through my eyes
You feel my pain
All my fears have gone insane

I am the Night
I am your fears
I'm the one who catches your sleep
To unleash terror
Into the deepest part of your soul
The eternal hour
Where all men fall

You hold my rest
Between your claws I bleed
You took the beauty away
To fill it with Evil Ways
