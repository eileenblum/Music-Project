Why is my heart in sorrow?
All I did is to follow the leader
Why do I feel so sad?
For the tortured minds of our innocence

[CHORUS:]
We walk the Walk
Every night and day
We follow our footsteps
In our own shadows
We obey without regrets
We walk the Walk

Why are my smiles so empty?
All my time alive is a waste of time
Why are my eyes full of anger?
All I see is sadness, all I feel is shameless

[CHORUS]

A life is built with hopes
My life was built the same way as many
But emptiness is taking over
Like a disease eating me inside
I can't reach the end
Running won't get me there first
I just have to let myself go
And everything will be as dark as they said
