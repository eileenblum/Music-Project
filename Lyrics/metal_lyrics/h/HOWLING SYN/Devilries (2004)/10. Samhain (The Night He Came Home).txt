Silence - Darkness - Samhain â Halloween
Silence - Darkness - Samhain â You must leave
Blackened - Dead Leaves - Whispers - Agony

This is the night he came home
This is the night of the Halloween fright

Silence - Darkness - Samhain â You must leave

This is the night he came home
This is the night of the Halloween fright

Near the shadow stands the shape
In our blood lives the shape

Blackened - Dead Leaves - Whispers - Agony

He's haunting me
Look at the sky you'll see the thorn inside

Fear the hollow, feel the angst
The evil eye gives no chance

Silence - Darkness - Samhain - You must leave

He's haunting me
Look at the sky you'll see the thorn inside

Leave the shadow â it could cause your end
Under the knife of the shape
