Now I see the light...

How long have you been gone?
Seems like centuries
When I asked for you
All I got was the wind's lullaby

I was there waiting for you
But the other side seems so far
Everything turns red
Now your past life is calling you

[CHORUS:]
Is this our dream of tomorrow
Fading out with a scream?
You feel a threat... shameless, I breathe
Dying air out of everyone I cheat

I know these voices from the past
But only a symphony remains
Is it a dream? It is so real...
Maybe I'm living my second chance

I'm still here waiting for you
But your ghost cannot hear me
Will you ever come back
For the last time I'm calling you!

[CHORUS]
