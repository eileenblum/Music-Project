Eden-sweet devilry
Little evil things of beauty
Will you give in to those strange smiles?
Will your heart sink to their faded lullabies?
Painted scenes of mercy
Pretty faces hiding envy
Carnally frozen in after-death style
Eternal virgins in their lovely paradise

Guiltless queens of destiny
Ill-scheming smiling fairies
Have you said your prayers tonight?
Have you fed them with your dreams of holy light?
Never seeking for a treaty
This pale and weak divine army
Will show you their fleshly designs
But shall conceal the taste of their bitter wines

Angel I once was
Blessed and blue
Nothing wrong, nothing true
Open my eyes!

Plus un bruit, c'est la Comï¿½die
Charming verses, masks of pity
Feathery glimpses, voice of pure delight
Always their real eyes remain blind and out of sight
Eden-sweet devilry
Little evil things of beauty
I won't give in to those strange smiles
My heart won't sink to their faded lullabies

Back with you I roam
My wings turned black
Your faithless world is my home
And now these creatures make me laugh
Their pain unknown
There'll be no hope when I'm gone
Embrace my path
