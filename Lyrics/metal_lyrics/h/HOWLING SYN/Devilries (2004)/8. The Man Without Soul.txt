The emptiness of dawn
I see you're looking pale
You must hearï¿½ You do hear?
The wolves that howl in the night for us

A serenade of lust is tempting our senses
This true pleasure of lust is charming like a dying angel

Rippin' through the skin of the unholy sadness
My bones are dancin' under my bleedin' skin

[CHORUS:]
The words penetrate the brain of the man without soul
The shocking truth of the words untold
The man without soul
The dying life of a man with a heart of gold
Innocent prayers awaking the gods
Like a virus tearing as pins
Let's bring balance where the fools have begun
The fools have begun - The fools! Let's take your place!
So let me be the child of misery
This unborn soul that carried the curse of tragedy

Hiding the truth of an addiction
Will never kill your demon
So many mysteries unsolved that belong to our god

[CHORUS]

Let him rise from the hell he's created
Let him see what the mighty one has started
Wanna know how this is gonna end?
You will return like you've been sent

Whispering halo, desperate souls
Dying to leave in peace from the land that was their hope
