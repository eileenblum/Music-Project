Look at me Iâm chasing
After dreams left in the storms
What I am is all
That really matters now
That lies are gone
The lies are gone
And the lies are gone
The lies are gone

Tempting fate and losing
Friends along the way I loved
No regrets
Iâm standing
With a needle in my heart
Needle in my heart,
Needle in my heart,
Needle in my heart

Youâll never know
My life means everything
Still I scream because
Thereâs nothing left to do until the end

The world goes on
With all that Iâve become
And still I scream inside
For all the pain Iâve taken hasnât changed

Nothingâs changed at all
The truth is like a chain
Heavenâs calling me
The place that I belong
Killing pain
Killing pain

Close my eyes a million faces
Get inside my mind
Take a breath and fill my troubled
Soul with all mankind
Killing pain
Killing pain
Iâm killing pain
Killing pain

Youâll never know
My life means everything
Still I scream because
Thereâs nothing left to do until the end

The world goes on
With all that Iâve become
And still I scream inside
For all the pain Iâve taken hasnât changed

The man in black
Iâm coming back to spew my evil hate
My crown horns and bloody thorns
Iâll dig up what you fear

I am the shape thatâs in your room that
Watches over you
I am the needle in your heart â you
Disillusioned God

I am God, I am fate, I am all the sins you
Make, yeah â hate
I am black, I am white, Iâm the blood upon
The knife, yeah â hate

Since time began I made a vow to drag you
Underground
To steel your soul of purity and watch you waste away

I am pure, I am right, I am the God that
Makes you fight, yeah â hate
I am life, I am death, I will steal your final
Breath, yeah â hate

I prey upon your broken dreams you
Weakness gives me strength
Iâm laughing at your silent screams Iâll
Crush you with my hate

You take it all
And face the fear thatâs here
Until the Silent Screams
It leaves you with no choice to carry on

Youâll never fall
When all is said and done
The only Scream is here
The journey never ends â itâs just begunâ¦

The lies that never learned
The needles in my heart
And things will never change
So every time I scream Iâm killing pain
