[Bonus Track]

I realize I missed the day
But I'm too wrecked to care anyway
I look around and see the face
What the hell have I lost my taste
Don't want to find out
Just want to cut out

My head explodes, my ears ring
I can't remember just where I've been
The last thing that I recall
I got lost in a deep black hole
Don't want to find out
Just want to cut out

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Blackout
I really had a blackout

I grab my things and make a run
On my way out, another one
Would like to know before I stop
Did I make it or did I flop
Don't want to find out
Just want to get out

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Don't want to find out
Just want to get out

Blackout
I really had a blackout
