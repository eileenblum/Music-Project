[Halford/Downing/Tipton/Lachman]

When I saw your face
I Became a prisoner of your eyes
And I would do most anything
To stay and be with you.

How did we go wrong?
I can't believe it's over
Tell me why it's happening?
Who threw it all away?

Don't you hear me crying?
Take me in your arms again

Don't you hear me crying?
Take me in your arms again

Bring back what I'm living for
You're all I'm thinking of
Take me home to paradise
Give me back your love

No one takes the blame
You and I have wondered
We gave all we could to this
It's time to face the truth

Now we realize
All we had is over
Comes an end to everything
There's nothing left to give

Don't you hear me crying?
Take me in your arms again

Don't you hear me crying?
Take me in your arms again

Bring back what I'm living for
You're all I'm thinking of
Take me home to paradise
Give me back your love

Bring back what I'm living for
You're all I'm thinking of
Take me home to paradise
Give me back your love

Stop the heartache
We can try and start again
End the heart break
A little time - will help to ease the pain

I still see your face
When I close my eyes
If I opened up again
Would you still be here?

Don't you hear me crying?
Take me in your arms again

Don't you hear me crying?
Take me in your arms again

Bring back what I'm living for
You're all I'm thinking of
Take me home to paradise
Give me back your love

Bring back what I'm living for
You're all I'm thinking of
Take me home to paradise
Give me back your love
