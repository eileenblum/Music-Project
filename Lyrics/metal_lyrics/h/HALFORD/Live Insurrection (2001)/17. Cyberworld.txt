[Halford/Chlasciak/Z]

You're trapped inside my cyber world
Consumed up as my web unfurls
No secrets left for your mankind.

My virus lurks throughout your veins
I'm spreading there inside your brain
A trojan horse that eats your mind.

Cyber world
Cyber world
I've got your power.

Cyber world
Cyber world
I will devour, yeah...

At speed of lies I will connect
I search and surf as I infect
Computerized catastrophe.

Your information's what I steal
I scan you till you are unreal
Transmit your power into me.

Cyber world
Cyber world
I'll steal your mind.

Cyber world
Cyber world
For all mankind, yeah...

You're dying in my cyber world
You're lying in my cyber world
