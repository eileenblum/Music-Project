[Halford/Tipton]

Behold 'tis I the commander whose grip controls you all
Resist me not surrender i'll no compassion call

Tyrant captor of humanity
Tyrant conqueror of all
Tyrant hideous destructor
Tyrant everyman shall fall

Your very lives are held between my fingers
I snap them and you cower down in fear
You spineless things that belly down to slither
To the end of the world you follow to be near

Mourn for us oppressed in fear
Chained and shackled we are bound
Freedom choked in dread we live
Since tyrant was enthroned

I listen not to sympathy whilst ruler of this land
Withdraw your feeble aches and moans
Or suffer smite from this my hand

My legions faithful unto death
I'll summon to my court
And as you perish each of you shall scream as you are sought
