[Halford/Lachman/Baxter/Z]

I'm digging deep inside my soul
To bring myself out of this god-damned hole
I rid the demons from my heart
And found the truth was with me from the start

Holy angel lift me from this burning hell - resurrection make me whole
Son of judas bring the saints to my revenge - resurrection bring me home

I walked alone into a fight
No longer standing in satanic light
I tried to look too far ahead
And saw the road go to my past instead

Holy angel lift me from this burning hell - resurrection make me whole
Son of judas bring the saints to my revenge - resurrection bring me home

I've faced the things i've said and done
There is no bastard left to overcome
The peace of mind I thought was lost
Was right in front of me on paths i've crossed

Holy angel lift me from this burning hell - resurrection make me whole
Son of judas bring the saints to my revenge - resurrection bring me home
