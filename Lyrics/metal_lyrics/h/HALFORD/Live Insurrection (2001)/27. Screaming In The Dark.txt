[Halford]

Inner world trance of the lifeless souls
Search and destroy of the damned
Turning the grave of the bleached out bones
Rise of the ghosts of bedlam

Lay on the blade of the cold guillotine
Feeling the steel on my spine
Taste of the blood as it falls from my mouth
I'm evil suspended in time

Scream
In the dark
Of my world
Inner dark

Why?
Does the torture remain and persist?
Die?
Can I never submit and resistance?

Down on my side
The nightmares colliding
I'm writhing and raging in flames
Bite on the bitch on the back of the beast
Burning desert plains

Scream
In the dark
Of my world
Inner dark

Violence rides as the human race dies
Death bringer stabs away life

Scream
In the dark
Of my world
Inner dark

Screaming
In the

Screaming
In the

Screaming
Inner darkness of my world
