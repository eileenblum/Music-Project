[Tipton]

I move as fast as I can
I like to get around
I'm crazy like a mad man
My feet don't touch the ground

I move amongst the night life
And they just step aside

'cos when they see me coming
They know I'm running wild

Dead or alive
There's nothing that bothers me at all
I take on all comers
They back off or they fall

They raise their hands to stop me
I laugh and I defy
'cos what's the point in living
Unless you're living wild

No chains can hold me down
I always break away

I never hear society tell me what to do or say

I'll taste the life that pleases me
Or raise a storm for all the world to see

I never stumble never fall
Never stop for rest
I rebel but I walk tall
And I demand respect

I move amongst the night life
And they just step aside
'cos when they see me coming
They know I'm running wild

I'm running wild
Get gutta my way
I'm running wild
