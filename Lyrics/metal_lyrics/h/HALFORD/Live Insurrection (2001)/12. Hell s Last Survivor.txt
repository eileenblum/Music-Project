[Halford/Chlasciak]

I cry from the madness
Then reach for a hand
Stay on the lifeline
'till I understand

I watched my worlds collide
And drive me underground
I've been to hell and back
And beat the devil down

I'm all I have
I'm all I need
The last survivor
I fought and won
And now I'm free
The last survivor

I pray for deliverance
Grown from the guilt
Live from the bottom
Destroy what I built

I watched my worlds collide
And drive me underground
I've been to hell and back
And beat the devil down

I'm all I have
I'm all I need
The last survivor
I fought and won
And now I'm free
The last survivor
I will survive
