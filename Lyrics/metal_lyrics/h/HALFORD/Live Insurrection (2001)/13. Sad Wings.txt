[Halford/Lachman/Chlasciak]

Who can say they've never made mistakes?
Only fools will suffer what they make
Owning up rids poison when you can
Admitting you were wrong makes you a man

It's every where
But do you care?

Sad wings of destiny,
Where have they gone?
I know eternally
I'll carry on.

Did you think that I would disappear?
Were you so dried up from all your fear?
Thought you'd make me feel impossible
You were wrong now who looks like the fool?

It's up to you,
What did you do?

Sad wings of destiny
It used to burn.
I know that faithfully
I'll see you turn.

It's everywhere
But do you care

Sad wings of destiny,
Where have they gone?
I know eternally
I'll carry on.

Sad wings of destiny
It used to burn.
I know that faithfully
I'll see you turn.
Sad wings of destiny
