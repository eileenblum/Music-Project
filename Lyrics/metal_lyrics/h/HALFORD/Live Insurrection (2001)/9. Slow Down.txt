[Halford/Marlette/Z]

Let it be
Still my anger
Bring me peace
From my temper

I'm trying every way I can
I'm doing wrong I understand

Let it be - slow down - watch the pressure fall
Bring me peace - slow down - I can't have it, I can't have it all.

Break the strain
Feed my hunger
Tell my mind
To be stronger

I've got to move and make it real
I've got to make myself a deal

Break this strain - slow down - give up what I crave
Tell my mind - slow down - watch what I can, watch what I can save.

Will I rise
Out of shadow?
Staying calm
Feeling hollow

I'm here to give me one more chance
That choice is resting in my hands, yeah...

Let it be - slow down - watch the pressure fall
Bring me peace - slow down - I can't have it
I can't have it all

Break this strain - slow down - watch the pressure fall
Tell my mind - slow down - I can't have it
I can't have it all
