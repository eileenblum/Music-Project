[Halford/Downing/Tipton]

Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light
Glowing god of mars
Body burning bright

We'll I'm riding, riding on the wind
Yes I'm riding, riding on the wind

Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power

We'll I'm riding, riding on the wind
Yes I'm riding, riding on the wind

Thunder bolt from hell
Shattering aloud
Screaming demons yell
Bursting through the clouds

We'll I'm riding, riding on the wind
Yes I'm riding, riding on the wind
