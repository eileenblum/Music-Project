[Halford/Tipton]

Wild eyed and tight fisted
I'm fused to the bone
I stand contemplating
Reacting alone

Impaled with betrayal
The tourniquet turns
Society's creation
Pole axed out and burnt

Long ago when man was king
His heart was clean
Now he's stained class

Time has slashed
Each un-touched thing
So now he's just
A stained class king

Transfixed at deliverance
Is this all there is?
Faithless continuum
Into the abyss

Fierce is my conviction
Absolute my belief
I spit at you apathy
And seducer deceit

Long ago when man was king
His heart was clean
Now he's stained class

Time has slashed
Each un-touched thing
So now he's just
A stained class king

Lethal, deadly, hung, drawn
And quartered he slaughtered and faltered
And altered the world.

But by doing so smashed
All his hopes and utopian dreams

Whipping, stripping peeling the flesh off
Relentless and senseless

His lust snapped like vipers
Whose fangs sank in deep
To infest and decay from the core.

Impaled with betrayal
The tourniquet turns
Society's creation
Pole axed out and burnt

Long ago when man was king
His heart was clean
Now he's stained class

Time has slashed
Each un-touched thing
So now he's just
A stained class king

Stained class king
