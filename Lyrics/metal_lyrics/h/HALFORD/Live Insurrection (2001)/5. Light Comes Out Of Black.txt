[Halford]

Innocence is calling
Raptures in the past
Craving for salvation of the mind

Serenity is calling
Seeking only truth
Vision block forever left behind

Light comes out of black
Stand and face the fear
Give him eye too eye
Walk the walk right here

Images unraveling
Saw through the disguise
Crystal clear and shining through and through

Liberation traveling
Bringing down the wall
Universe waking coming too

Light comes out of black
Stand and face the fear
Give him eye too eye
Walk the walk right here

Let the fight begin
Watch the power soar
Work the magic now
Free forever more

Now feel the light
Lifting up and rising all alive
Now feel the light
Keep the faith inside and i'll survive...
Innocence is calling
Raptures in the past
Craving for salvation of the mind

Serenity is calling
Seeking only truth
Visual blocked forever
Left behind

Light comes out of black
Stand and face the fear
Give him eye too eye
Walk the walk right here

Let the fight begin
Watch the power soar
Work the magic now
Free forever more

Light comes out of black
