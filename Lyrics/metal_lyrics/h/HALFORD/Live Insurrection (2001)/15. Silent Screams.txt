[Halford/Marlette]

Look at me I'm chasing
After dreams left in the storm.

What I am is all that
Really matters now
The lies are gone.

Tempting fate and losing
Friends along the way I loved.

No regrets I'm standing
With a needle in my heart.

You'll never know.
My life means everything.
Still I scream because
There's nothing left to do until the end.

The world goes on.
With all that i've become.

And still I scream inside
Though all the pain i've taken
Hasn't changed.

Nothing's changed at all
The truth is like a chain.

Heaven's calling me
The place where I belong.

Killing pain

Close my eyes a million faces
Get inside my mind.

Take a breath and fill my troubled
Soul with all mankind.

Killing pain

The man in black
I'm coming back
To spew my evil hate.

My crown of horns
And bloody thorns
I dig up what you fear.

I am the shape
That's in your room
That watches over you.

I am the needle
In your heart,
You're disillusioned god.

I am god
I am fate
I am all the things you make.

Yeah.

Hate.

I am black
I am white
I'm the blood upon the knife.

Yeah.

Hate.

Since time began I made a vow
To drag you underground.

To steal your soul of purity
And watch you waste away.

I am pure
I am right
I'm the god that makes you fight.

Yeah.

Hate.

I am life
I am death
I will steal your final breath.

Yeah.

Hate.

I prey upon your broken dreams
Your weakness gives me strength.

I'm laughing at your silent screams
I'll crush you with my hate.

Yeah.

You face it all
And face the fear that's here.

Until the silent screams
Leaves you with no choice to carry on.

You'll never fall
When all is said and done.

The only scream is here
The journey never ends
It's just begun.

The lies that never learn.
The needle's in my heart.

And things will never change.

So every time I scream I'm killing pain
