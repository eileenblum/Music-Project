Light of the world, there's a place You live
Here in my heart, I know
Light of the world, all my dreams are made true
By the love You show

I can say with honestly, that You set me free
From the day that we met
Light delight is a distant star, put me from afar
I can't ever forget

Light of the world, I'm in home, I'm glad
Safe from the pain I know
Light of the world...
All of my life I've grown

When I think all the special thing
There's so much to say
I don't know where begin

But I guess that You understand...

Light of the world, it's so easy now
You stand by me, I know
Light of the world, all I have to do
Here, what's to say, let's go! Go!

You're my Light of the world [x2]
Light of the world...
