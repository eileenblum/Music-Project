Oh, come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
Oh, come ye
Oh, come ye to Bethlehem

Come and behold Him
Born the King of angels

Oh, come let us adore Him
Oh, come let us adore Him
Oh, come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing all that hear in heaven
God's holy word

Give to the Father
Glory in the highest

Oh, come let us adore Him
Oh, come let us adore Him
Oh, come let us adore Him
Christ, Christ the Lord
