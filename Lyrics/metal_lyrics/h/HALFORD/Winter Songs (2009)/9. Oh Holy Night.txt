Oh holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the spirit felt His worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder beams a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
Oh, night divine! The night when Christ was born!
Oh, night, oh holy night, oh night divine
Truly he taught us
To love one another
His law is love and
His gospel is peace
Chains shall he break
For the slave is our brother
And in his name
All oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in
Grateful chorus raise we
In our hearts
We praise his holy name

Christ is the Lord
Then already we praise Him
His power and glory evermore proclaim
His power and glory evermore proclaim
Oh night, oh holy night, night divine
Oh night, oh holy night, oh night divine
