When the children sing
And the snow starts falling
When the sleigh bells ring
Saying Santa's calling

There's an open fire
And a tree that's glistening
It's the middle of the night
As we all lay listening

[Chorus:]
When Christmas comes for everyone
It brings us all together
For just one day there's peace in the world
We wish would last forever

Then we all wake up
And the kids go crazy!
Let the good times roll
Tough we all feel lazy

There's a brand new day
And we're full of cheer
Gonna rock all night
Like we did last year

[Repeat chorus]
