Oh come, oh come Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear

Rejoice! Rejoice!
The Son of God! Rejoice!
Oh Come thou wisdom from on high
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
In one the hearts of all mankind
And death's dark shadows put to flight

Rejoice! Oh, rejoice!
The Son of God! Rejoice!
Rejoice! Oh, rejoice!
Oh, come, oh, come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God He will appear

Rejoice! Oh, rejoice! Emmanuel! Rejoice!
Rejoice! Oh, rejoice!
The Son is here! Rejoice!
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
