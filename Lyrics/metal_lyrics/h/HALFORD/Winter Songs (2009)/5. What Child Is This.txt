What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While the good shepherds watch are keeping

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant, king to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The babe, the son of Mary

Oh raise, oh raise the song on high
His mother sings her lullaby
Oh joy, oh joy for Christ is born
The babe, the son of Mary

What child is this?
What child is this?
What child is this?

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The babe, the son of Mary, of Mary, of Mary
