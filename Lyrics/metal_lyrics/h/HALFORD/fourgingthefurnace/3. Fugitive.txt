[European bonus track]

A desert moon is rising
Down that road's a distant place
A home where I have run from
A town where I can't show my face
I put myself before you
I should have known where that would lead
You wanted to possess me
And make me into what you need

Ride on fugitive
Running low
Lone life as a renegade
Riding on

I won't become that empty
I take elusive hard to find
So you can't wait forever
I'll never be the wanting kind
I found myself in solace
I am the friend you never had
You vowed to be a stranger
As I keep walking on my back

Ride on fugitive
Running low
Lone life as a renegade
Riding on

And though my best is left intact
It's so much harder coming back

Ride on fugitive
Running low
Long life as a renegade
Riding on
And on

Ride on fugitive
Running low
Long life as a renegade
Riding on
