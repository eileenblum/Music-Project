I can't find what I want or make sense of this life
Too much hypocrisy in what is wrong and right
I see it everywhere but still I can't relate
I got to much to do can't sit around and wait

This world won't pass me by
I'll get all that I need
I'm given all I have - and I won't concede

We're the forgotten generation
But we know what we're living for
We're the forgotten generation and
We don't need you anymore

I'll base my life on what I want and you can't see
Don't analyze the labels that you put on me
I open up my eyes but I'll shut out your voice
You kept me in the dark and never gave me choice

My being different to you still makes me a man
And soon I'm gonna let the world know who I am

We're the forgotten generation
But we know what we're living for
We're the forgotten generation and
We don't need you anymore

I'll take the things I need that you can't understand
I'm getting stronger by the choices I demand
You're living in the past and that's right where you'll stay
I'm in the future and I'm gonna walk my way

In time you'll realize the dreams that we achieved
And give us back respect for what we all believed

We're the forgotten generation
But we know what we're living for
We're the forgotten generation and
We don't need you anymore
