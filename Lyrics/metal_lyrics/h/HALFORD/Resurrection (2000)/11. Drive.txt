[Halford/Roy Z/Marlette]

I've got you under my wheels now baby
That's where you belong
I've got you under my wheels now baby
I'll drive you all night long

I've got you under my wheels now baby
There's nothing you can do
I've got you under my wheels now baby
My heart is coming through

You'll never go too far or go too fast
Let's rev it up and feel the engine blast

Drive, drive, drive with me
Our love will set us free

I've got you under my wheels now baby
You're moving way too fast
I've got you under my wheels now baby
We've got to make it last

You'll love it when you feel my engine roar
You'll love it when you feel the power soar 

Drive, drive, drive with me
Our love will set us free
Drive, drive, drive with me
The road will set us free

Let's crank it up and drive this heavy load
It's time to rock - Come on let's hit the road

Drive, drive, drive with me
Our love will set us free
Drive, drive, drive with me
The road will set us free

(Keep driving all night long)
