[Halford/Lachman/Chlasciak/Roy Z]

I know what's going on inside your crooked mind
I've been around too long to know about your kind
I made you feel I was a victim of your prey
I let you tie me down though I can get away

Don't you lead me into temptation
Don't deceive me into temptation

You gave so much to me you left me feeling numb
So full of emptiness from stealing what you've done
How can you bear to stand the life you try to live
A sad and broken heart is all you've left to give

Don't you lead me into temptation
Don't deceive me into temptation

A slave to your touch
I can't run cause I'm blind
