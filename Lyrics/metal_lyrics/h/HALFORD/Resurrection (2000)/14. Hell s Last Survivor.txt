[Halford/Chlasciak]

[Bonus - Japan only]

I cry from the madness
Then reach for a hand
Stay on the lifeline
Till I understand

I watched my world's collide
And drive me underground
I've been to hell and back
And beat the devil down

I'm all I have
I'm all I need
The Last Survivor

I fought and won
And now I'm free
The last Survivor

I prayed for deliverance
Grown from the guilt
Lived from the bottom
Destroyed what I built

I watched my world's collide
It drove me underground
I've been to hell and back
And beat the devil down

I'm all I have
I'm all I need
The Last Survivor

I fought and won
And now I'm free
The last Survivor

I will Survive
I will Survive

I'm all I have
I'm all I need
The Last Survivor

I fought and won
And now I'm free
The last Survivor
