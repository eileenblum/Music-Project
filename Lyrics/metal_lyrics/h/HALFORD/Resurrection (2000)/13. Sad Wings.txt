[Halford/Chlasciak/Lachman]

[Bonus - Japan only]

Who can say they've never made mistakes.
Only fools will suffer what they make
Owning up rids poison when you can
Admitting you were wrong makes you a man

It's very where
But do you care?

Sad wings of destiny
Where have they gone?
I know eternally
I'll carry on

Did you think that I would disappear?
Were you so dried up from all your fear?
Thought you've make me feel impossible
You were wrong now who looks like the fool?

It's up to you
What did I do?

Sad wings of destiny
I used to burn
I know that faithfully
I'll see you turn

It's very where
But do you care?

Sad wings of destiny
Where have they gone?
I know eternally
I'll carry on

Sad wings of destiny
I used to burn
I know that faithfully
I'll see you turn
