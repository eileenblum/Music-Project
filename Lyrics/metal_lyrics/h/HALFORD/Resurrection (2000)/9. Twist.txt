[Bob Halligan Jr.]

Got a grip like steel on wood
This is all for your own good
And If you wanna get away - wanna be free
Wanna get anywhere but right here beside me - you'll have to

Twist, twist, twist away from me
Twist, twist, twist - away

Twist, twist, twist away from me
Twist, twist, twist - away

Wonder why you try to run
Ought to quit admit I've won
No one is gonna hear your cry
Gonna hear you scream
Better get used to knowing it's just in your dreams - that you can

Twist, twist, twist away from me
Twist, twist, twist - away

Twist, twist, twist away from me
Twist, twist, twist - away

Never get away
Never twist away
Never get away

Wanna get anywhere but right here beside me - you'll have to

Twist, twist, twist away from me
Twist, twist, twist - away

Twist, twist, twist away from me
Twist, twist, twist - away

Never get away
Never twist away
Never get away
