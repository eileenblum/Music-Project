[Halford/Lachman/Roy Z]

I'm set to paralyze
I'm older so I'm wise
I have been crucified
With words personified

Here I am now, I'm your savior
There can be only one
I'm the master, past and future
Now the end has begun

I've always stood alone
Your time got overgrown
Those words shot way too wide
No hate can take my pride

Here I am now, I'm your savior
You can see I'm the one
There's no reason for such treason
Now your end has begun
