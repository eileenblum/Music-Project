[Halford/Lachman/Roy Z]

I've got no sympathy
For all you've done to me
I'll bring you to your knees
And give you what you please

I'm gonna get to you
Just like you got to me
And then I'll do to you
Just what you did to me

I'm gonna shoot it,
I'm gonna shoot it,
Cause I'm locked and loaded

I'm gonna shoot it,
I'm gonna shoot it,
Cause I'm locked and loaded

I aim to make you high
Won't stop until you cry
Just when you think I'm done
I've only just begun

I'm gonna get to you
Just like you got to me
And then I'll do to you
Just what you did to me

I'm gonna shoot it,
I'm gonna shoot it,
Cause I'm locked and loaded

I'm gonna shoot it,
I'm gonna shoot it,
Cause I'm locked and loaded

I'm gonna get to you
Just like you got to me
And then I'll do to you
Just what you did to me

I'm gonna shoot it,
I'm gonna shoot it,
Cause I'm locked and loaded

I'm gonna shoot it,
I'm gonna shoot it,
Cause I'm locked and loaded
