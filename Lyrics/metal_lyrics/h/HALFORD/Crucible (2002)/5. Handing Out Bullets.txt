Cowards are unholy
Parasites that hide
Detonate the human bomb
Hands are all awash in blood

Carnage from the scriptures
Slaughter of the lamb
Break the neck of the white dove
Run down by the tracks above

Whip the back
Of your messiah
Your peace kills by death

Bow your head
The prayer calls to violence
That history rejects

Waiting wall of murder
Consummating hate
League of perpetuity
Will open wounds of disbelief

Through self immolation
You desecrate the ground
Annihilate the innocents
In crucifixion crashing down

Whip the back
Of your messiah
Your peace kills by death

Bow your head
The prayer calls to violence
That history rejects

Motuhs are spitting venom
Shocked senseless by the grief
Another day of dying
As your terror cry abominates

Mushroom cloud is coming
Hanging by the nails
Gasoline the olive branch
Start digging up more body pits

Whip the back
Of your messiah
Your peace kills by death

Bow your head
The prayer calls to violence
That history rejects
