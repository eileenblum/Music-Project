Such desperation
Left you in shame
This bitter harvest
Bearing all the blame

Man will never end your suffering
Stealing all your years
God is with you but won't save you
From your Trail of Tears

From this oblivion
Seek dignity
Just human cargo
Crying to be free

Man will never end your suffering
Stealing all your years
God is with you but won't save you

Change it
Gonna change it - change it

Greed of man has pushed you over
Feeding on the fears
Poverty will always prosper
On your Trail of Tears

Man will never end your suffering
Stealing all your years
God is with you but won't save you
From your Trail of Tears
