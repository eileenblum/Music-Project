She is the one who fills my soul 
With grace and dignity so rare 
A jewel that shines upon her child 
And lifts me to a higher place - a higher place 

She sang to me before I breathed 
Alive inside she gave me life 

I felt her heartbeat as if touching mine 
The rhythm stays and never leaves 
She smiles and warms the coldest of the days 
Her soft caress brings peace and hope 

And when I'm gone she's always there 
To carry me through troubled times 
She held me to her simple truth 
That all I need is what she gives 

In dreamland where the child still lives 
Forever pure in arms of love 

In dreamland where the child still lives 
Forever pure in arms of love 

This virtue leaves tranquility 
As ever radiant it's always light 
Her laughter drifts across a thousand miles 
And takes me back to innocence
