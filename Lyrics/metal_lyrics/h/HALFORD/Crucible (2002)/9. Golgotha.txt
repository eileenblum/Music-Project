Golgotha, rise up from your tomb
Devil's had a taste of holy water
Lost children need your guiding hand
Take them through the fire of the promised land

Now we've come together
We're all waiting for a sign
If it takes forever
We believe in the divine

Grand Canyon, source of all our dreams
Protected from a billion years of evil
Golden fire - thunder all around
Covenants will cover up you sinners

Now we've come together
We're all waiting for a sign
If it takes forever
We believe in the divine

Overcoming tyranny to desecrate the entity - satanical
Laying waste this sick disease
That crippled, maimed, feel to our knees - like Jericho

Pile of skulls crunched under foot
Torched remains are crying out - satanical
Rising up to purge and scourge the killing of our paradise - like Jericho

Salvation...

Now we've come together
We're all waiting for a sign
If it takes forever
We believe in the divine
