The way you look at me
Feel all your hatred building
I won't be what you see
A nation built for killing

The color of the skin
Dividing church's saviors
The wars that you begin
Reflect in your behavior

We live and die
From all this isolating
We live and die
When we stop procreating

Genetic blasphemy
Resisting devastation
Corrupting heresy
To save the population

We live and die
From all this isolating
We live and die
When we stop procreating

We live and die
To generate existence
We live and die
A life line of persistence

We live and die
And all we feel is sadness
We give and try
Mankind embraces madness

We live and die
And all we feel is sadness
We give and try
Mankind embraces madness
