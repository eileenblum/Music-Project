White swords of blinding razor light
Blast round the earth
Validating with immortal strength
Courage of the brave

From the aftermath of dust and flames
Resilience soars
Upon the searing light's reflected blade
That guards and saves

The dark sky
The victims
The air is full of vengeance

From now on
No mercy
The wrath of God
Reins on you

These monuments of power and steel
Carved in each soul
Stand forever indestructible
For all mankind

The face of mighty nations liberty
In stoic resolve
For all the hated evil that men can do
Will be avenged

The dark sky
The victims
The air is full of vengeance

From now on
No mercy
The wrath of God
Reins on you

It's over
You're wasted
Now you're incinerated

In hell
I'll meet you
And once again
Defeat you

And though the light is dimmed to black someday
Inside it burns
A raging fire to virtues endless war
And freedom's cause

The dark sky
The victims
The air is full of vengeance

From now on
No mercy
The wrath of God
Reins on you

It's over
You're wasted
Now you're incinerated

In hell
I'll meet you
And once again
Defeat you
