I see the gods in the arena
They stand beneath the blinding lights
The roar becomes a deafening silence
In reverence before the fight

One will live tonight
One will die tonight
One will stand and
One will fall

One in victory
One in misery
Only one will take it all

Then all at once begins the rumble
A mass of body hits the floor
Locked in a battle - strength and honor
Blood, sweat and tears becomes the score

One will live tonight
One will die tonight
One will stand and
One will fall

One in victory
One in misery
Only one will take it all
