Smell your world when you come
I won't make a victim
I lie awake and I'm forsaken

From all the holes in my time
You saved up for this true lie
The devil bides her time in waiting

And still she comes

Crystallized in paranoia
Lost yourself inside her madness
Beast has glazed your being
With its torture

All the faults in your life
This suffering can't be mine
The curse will grow with what you prey for

And still she comes

She's calling
I'm falling
She makes me mine
Still calling
I'm crawling
She is benign

Smell your world when you came
Now I am a victim
I lie awake - I swim inside you

And still she comes...
