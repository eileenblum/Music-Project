Well it don't matter âbout the things they say
We got nothing to left to prove
And we wouldn't have it any other way
So let them make their move

When you got something that's as strong as this
Don't matter if you fall
You get back up and face another day
Ready to make that call

[Bridge]
Nothing in life is easy
Nothing in life is free

[Chorus]
I'm the thunder to your lightning
Can you feel it?
What we got is so exciting
It's a love they can't deny

Now me and you we got a simple heart
We don't need that much to make it run
Our souls are living proof right from the start
You got to get your knees dirty one by one

So when you look at me I wanna cry
This is good as all I ever need
Cause I'll be with ya till the day I die
Something that we both believe

[Repeat bridge &amp; chorus]

They can't take it, they can leave it
We don't care cause
This will always be our secret
For the rest of our lives

Nothing can bring us down
We'll always be around
Nothing can stop us now

I ain't a dreamer, I know what's real
And you are just the same as me
So if the cards of life can't break the deal
Then what is there left to see

Roll out the freedom bell and cross your heart
Cause me and you we love to sing
And they don't like it they can go to hell
So come on baby make it ring

[Repeat bridge &amp; chorus]

They can't take it, they can leave it
We don't care cause
This will always be our secret
For the rest of our lives
