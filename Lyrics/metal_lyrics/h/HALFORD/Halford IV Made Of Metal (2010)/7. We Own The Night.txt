We're not alone, we have a chance you see
Let's live the dreams we have in life
There's nothing left if you can't walk with me
You know we need to put it right

[Chorus]
We own the night
And whatever comes our way
Nothing will hold us back
When we love and we obey

When I'm with you, you give me all your strength
And with your love I carry on
Well we both know it takes the two of us
To face the truth don't need to run

[Repeat chorus]

Let's take tonight
And forget about the day
Stand at the edge of life
Let the starts come out to play

You wait and see
Our light will grow and grow
Open eyes will realize
The ray of life to hold

Our world of calm
It sings right from the heart
Can you hear the storm of fear
Can't tear this love apart

If we don't leap for faith
How can we be free
We can't deny or say goodbye
We found our destiny

Don't leave me alone
I can't stand the thought of being here without you
My heart turns to stone
Look in my eyes, my words are true

[Repeat chorus]

I'm not alone
But ships pass in the night
Hold me now, hold me now
Before my heart takes flight
