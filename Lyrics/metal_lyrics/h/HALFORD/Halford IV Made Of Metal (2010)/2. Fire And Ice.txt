Radiator radio the energy and afterglow
That keeps me comin' back to what you give
You say the things I want to hear and every night you make it clear
The messages you send out make me live

[Chorus]
Fire and ice, I know you're waiting for me
Staying alive with all the love, love in your heart
Don't ever think twice as far as the eye can see you
You're never alone when you're with me
We'll always be like fire and ice

Every day and every night
The sounds you make me feel alright
That keeps me going strong
With what you say

You've been with me through thick and thin
You held me up when I gave in
A friend for life
That's with me every way

[Repeat chorus]
