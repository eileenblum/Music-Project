I can't remember
When the moment started
It creeps up
When you least expect to fail
You try to tell yourself
That you are selfless
But that's the big mistake
That sets your sail

The signs are all around you
But you miss them
You turn your back
On every friend you know
The games you play
To justify your madness
Will leave you crying
For the pain that grows

[Chorus]
Twenty-five years, twenty-five years
I tried to be a man and face my fears
Twenty-five years, twenty-five years
I've had the devil on my back for twenty five years

For when you fall
You have to reach the bottom
And count your blessings
That you're still alive

That's when you look
To someone who was with you
At every single step
Right by your side

It's said from this you grow
Inside much stronger
That may be true
But I am still so weak

There's days that seem
So endless makes me wonder
Will something come
To close this losing streak

[Repeat chorus]

I'm tired and so lonely
From this journey
And still can't figure out
Some things I've said

But all I know
Is there's a place that's calling
I'll find that place
And rest my weary head

Twenty-five years
Twenty-five years
I tried to be a man
And face my fears

Twenty-five years
Twenty-five years
I've had the devil on my back
For twenty five years
