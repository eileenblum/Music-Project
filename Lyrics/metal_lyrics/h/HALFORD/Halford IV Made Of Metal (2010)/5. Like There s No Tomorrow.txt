One chance, one dream for you
No limits to deny
Move on and grab the prize
Like diamonds in the sky

[Bridge]
Stay strong and you'll believe
Stay strong and then you'll see

[Chorus]
Beg steal or borrow
Like there's no tomorrow
Your fortune is fleeting
But love has no bounds
Dare to be open
Your wild heart has spoken
Each one of us has
What we know must be found
Must be found

This is the moment
That is rightful in your soul
Do what it takes to make
That victory your goal

[Repeat bridge &amp; chorus]

Stand at the top of the mountain
With all of the world at your feet
You're seeking the eternal fountain
Drink up yes drink all that you need

[Repeat bridge &amp; chorus]
