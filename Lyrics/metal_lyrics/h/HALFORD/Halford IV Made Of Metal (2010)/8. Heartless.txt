I'm walkin' the streets now, baby
Go it alone
Got nowhere to crash
Ain't got no home

Don't know where I'll be tomorrow
My heads in a daze
Should I make amends and mend my ways

[Chorus]
Heartless, heartless
I'm in a world of darkness
Heartless, heartless
You make me feel
So heartless

Talk to myself and wonder
What did I do wrong
Am I in the place where I belong

Part of the problem, baby
Something I lack
I pray there's a chance
You'll take me back

[Repeat chorus]
