I ain't got no time for forgiven
I ain't got no time be afraid
I ain't got no time to be slowing me down
With one foot in the grave

I ain't got no time for my loving
I ain't got no time to be said
I got no time for the foolish man
When the world treats him so bad

Oh no, here I go
Other sides calling me getting me low
Oh, I always know I'm living till the day I die
Oh no, here I go
The other sides calling me getting me low
Oh, I always know I'm living till the day I die, yeah!

They say there's light in the tunnel
They say there's a name in the book
But I don't care for the rumor mill
That hangs you on a hook

Soon I'll be meeting my Maker
Then I'll deceased and desist
I'll leave my name in the air somewhere
Where I can get some peace
Where I can get some peace

Oh no, here I go
The other side's calling me getting me low
Oh, I always know I'm living till the day I die

Oh no, here I go
The other sides calling me getting me low
Oh no, I always know I'm living till the day I die
Living till the day I die

I don't know if I'm ever coming back
The light in the tunnel might turn to black
Take my chances I won't ask why
I'm living till the day I die
Living till the day I die
Living till the day I die

I ain't got time for forgiving
I ain't got time be afraid
I ain't got time for living my life
With one foot in the grave
One foot in the grave
