I'm always there but never seen
I live inside you like a scream
Let it be known as I attest
I never sleep I never rest

Just like a fighter with his stealth
We don't need fame we don't need wealth
To find the heroes in our selves

I can hear you, I can see you, I can feel you
Speed of sound

The world is ours so understand
No matter what we take the land
Identified by how we look
To recognize the ground we took

This bond can't break through thick and thin
The blood runs red under each skin
We know our kind when we begin

I can hear you, I can see you, I can feel you
Speed of sound

I dedicate myself I must
And forge against who are unjust
A brotherhood born out of trust

I can hear you I can see you, I can feel you
Speed of sound
