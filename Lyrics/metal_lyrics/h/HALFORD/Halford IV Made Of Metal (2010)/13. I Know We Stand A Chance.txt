Tranquilized here by your touch
You know I'll never get enough
Everything you do to me
Always sets me free

In me in you
I know we stand a chance
This time could be
Could be our last romance

I find myself in you
And I can't let you go
In me in you

When you're far away from me
All I have's uncertainty
Bring me back with what you give
You know you make me live

In me in you
I know we stand a chance
This time could be
Could be our last romance

I find myself in you
And I can't let you go
In me in you

When you get inside my head
I forget the things you said
All that's left is just a dream
All I do is scream

In me in you
I knew we'd stand a chance
This time could be
Could be our last romance

I found myself in you
And I can't let you go
In me in you
