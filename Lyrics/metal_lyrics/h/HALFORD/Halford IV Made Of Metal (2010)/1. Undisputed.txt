He's king of the world
On top of his game
He only holds back
To take perfect aim

He turns days to nights
With all that he has
A signature blow
Turns jaws into glass

Opponents line up as they meet him
And watch as they fall one by one
The title is held by the leader
He gets there by shock and by stun

Ready to fight and to make it all right
He's the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
Taking the prize to dismiss and demise
He's the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
The undisputed heavyweight champion of the world

So easy to judge
The temper that boils
He'll take the mistakes
To the victor the spoils

Pugnacious and firm
Combative by rule
The charm's in his fist
So pity the fool

Don't step in the ring, or its owner
Enables that justice prevails
It's hard to give in and then own up
No limits when you're hard as nails

Bring it all on and do what must be done
He's the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
Give up your hopes you'll be left on the ropes
He's the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
The undisputed heavyweight champion of the world

A battle of wits
That's made in the mind
With physical force
He's cruel to be kind

The struggle's within
The outcome is plain
The effort pays back
And nothings in vain

Opponents line up as they meet him
And watch as they fall one by one
The title is held by the leader
He gets there by shock and by stun

Time to make peace or to beg for release
He's the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
Look in the face of the deadly embrace
He's the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
The undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
