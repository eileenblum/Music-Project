As I stand in front of your tombstone
I remember your grace and feel so alone
As I kneel here in the pouring rain
I sense it growing, Oh the aching pain
Misery haunts me and my tears won't dry
Try to hold them back but still I cry
We've been best friends for so very long
Blood brothers ever since we were young

As the winds of grief touches your grave
I pray that you would be alive for another day

[Chorus:]
We're brothers forever
We're brothers forever
We're brothers forever
We're brothers forever

I still remember the night when you died
I didn't even got the chance to say goodbye
Now you're an angel telling me to be strong
We'll meet someday although the road to you is long
The bound we both shared is so hard to leave
As for many years to come I will now grieve
I wish that your body wouldn't have become cold
Because it hurts so bad in my heart and soul

As the winds of grief touches your grave
I pray that you would be alive for another day

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus x2]
