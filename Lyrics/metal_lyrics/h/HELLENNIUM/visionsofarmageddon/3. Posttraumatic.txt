The world is dark and dead
No one can hear our screams
The final blow has struck
HellenniuMÂ´s rage is gone

Hell...

[Chorus:]
After hell we will rise
The world is ours, ours to rule
Blood is spilled, bones are cracked
The time is in, this is it

The casualties are dust
Survivors feel the pain
Begin new life on earth
Accept our fate, be strong

Yeah...

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Since years of raping earth
This was no surprise
The vengeanceÂ´s tough but fair
A victim of our way to live

Die...

[Chorus]

Hell...screaming of rage...HellenniuMÂ´s done...
How will it end? Hell!
