When the 3rd millennium comes, Armageddon will strike. 
At year 3000 month six, day six, at six Pm gone will be light. 
Thunder and storm clouds will run blazing across the northern sky. 
For one hundred of years rivers of blood the horizon will cry. 
Then gusts of fire will cover the world and mankind. 
No life shall then long afterwards on earth be found...
Welcome to HELLENNIUM!
