Your life has finally reached the end of the line
Eyes bleeding tears, flames burning from inside
Running short on breath, freezing hands holding tight
Time is running out as you fade away from the light

As your screams will echo down the hall
Forces of hate, shall make you crawl
As your screams will echo down the hall
I will paint your blood on the walls

When you stare on through the eyes of the damned
You shall be crucified with hammered in nails
I will watch your pain until you are diseased
ThatÂ´s the only thing that will make me feel pleased

[Chorus]

[Solo]

This is the day when all hell breaks lose

[Chorus x2]
