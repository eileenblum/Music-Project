[Words/Music: Hellennium]

Some choose to fight for something in their life
Others waste it on putting others down
Live for something, or choose to die for nothing at all
Never forget, you are what you protect, when the final day arrives

Life is a struggle that will bring you to tears
So donÂ´t waste your fucking life living in fear
No one will ever heal the world with just a song
But at least it can, make their nights, half as long

Push, hold the line and live to win over the resisting shame
Believe in the day, when triumph is your name
Push and hold on forever

We are all writing the history of our lives
Bite on your wounds you still have a long way to go
Surrender today and all the blood will be wasted away
Few has died, by believing, although many by letting go

Push, hold the line and live to win over the resisting shame
Believe in the day, when triumph is your name
Push and hold on forever

[Lead: Martin Lindberg]

Push, hold the line...
