[Words/Music: Hellennium]

Your life has finally reached the end of the line
Eyes bleeding tears, flames burning from inside
Running short on breath, freezing hands holding tight
Tonight youâll face the trial for all of your lies

As your screams will echo down the hall
Forces of hate, shall make you crawl
As your screams will echo down the hall
I will paint your blood, blood on the walls

When you stare on through the eyes of the damned
You shall be crucified with hammered in nails
Then slowly I will be tearing of your hide
Grumbling like cattle before you go down

As your screams will echo down the hall
Forces of hate, shall make you crawl
As your screams will echo down the hall
I will paint your blood, blood on the walls

[Lead: Martin Lindberg]

This is the day when all hell breaks lose

As your screams will echo down the hall
Forces of hate, shall make you crawl
As your screams will echo down the hall
I will paint your blood, blood on the walls

As your screams will echo down the hall
Forces of hate, shall make you crawl
As your screams will echo down the hall
I will paint your blood, blood on the walls
