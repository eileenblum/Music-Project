[Words/Music: Hellennium]

Sharing a bond stronger than steel, thicker than blood
Knowing our hearts shall never heeds the voices of the world
Open again the chapter where fashion is not the way
Or let the false wind keep on whipping your back

Let your lungs ignite with fire and flames
Then scream louder than a megaton blast

Heavy metal alliance, walking through fire
Ascending from hell, sent back here to reign
Heavy metal alliance, born from the ashes
Wild winds of fury are unleashed once again

We have listened to our will and chosen our side
We are the bringers of change, not the followers of lies
The flame shall always burn for the once who believe
In sound of how heavy metal is meant to be

Let your lungs ignite with fire and flames
Then scream louder than a megaton blast

Heavy metal alliance, walking through fire
Ascending from hell, sent back here to reign
Heavy metal alliance, born from the ashes
Wild winds of fury are unleashed once again

[Lead: David Borg-Hansen]

Heavy metal alliance, walking through fire
Ascending from hell, sent back here to reign
Heavy metal alliance, born from the ashes
Wild winds of fury are unleashed once again

Heavy metal alliance, walking through fire
Ascending from hell, sent back here to reign
Heavy metal alliance, born from the ashes
Wild winds of fury are unleashed once again
