[Words/Music: Hellennium]

I have walked for many miles, on the battlefield of life
Through mud and snow, fire and rain
In my back I felt many knives
But none made me falter, in the vision that I roam

With all my heart, with all my honor
I truly wish death to the false
With all my heart, with all my honor
I truly wish death to the false

Those who empty others lives, make it harder to live
Have lost their whole worth of life
In the face of my enemies
I have made a vow that I will stand until I die

With all my heart, with all my honor
I truly wish death to the false
With all my heart, with all my honor
I truly wish death to the false

Many are those against me who try to make my journey hard
But I have never been the one with a weak of heart
Cold winds have only made me stronger every day
To stand tall against the abominations of the false

With all my heart, with all my honor
I truly wish death to the false
With all my heart, with all my honor
I truly wish death to the false

[Repeat chorus until end]
