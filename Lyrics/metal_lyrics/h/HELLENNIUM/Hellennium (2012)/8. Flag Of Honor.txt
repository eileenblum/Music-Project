[Words/Music: Hellennium]

Standing in times when others kneel, we live with honor
The echoes of our will are more than divine, they're pure and intact
We are real brothers, we've taken our pakt, to march forever

Hoist the flag of honor, it's the unconquerable, above all
Speared through the chests of deceivers, forever standing tall
Hoist the flag of honor, it's the unconquerable, above all
Speared through the chests of deceivers, forever standing tall

Time to stand and unite under Hellennium law
We're gathered against the enemy as one, 'til the day we die
Our words might be forgotten, but our names will live forever

Hoist the flag of honor, it's the unconquerable, above all
Speared through the chests of deceivers, forever standing tall
Hoist the flag of honor, it's the unconquerable, above all
Speared through the chests of deceivers, forever standing tall

[Lead: Martin Lindberg]

Through the smoke and darkness our day will appear, leading the way
Relentless we keep aiming our spears, into their hearts
We'll raise the flag together, at the end of this infernal march

Hoist the flag of honor, it's the unconquerable, above all
Speared through the chests of deceivers, forever standing tall
Hoist the flag of honor, it's the unconquerable, above all
Speared through the chests of deceivers, forever standing tall
[Screams until end]
