[Words/Music: Hellennium]

Machinery of fury enraging with full force
Kingdom of hell released unto the world
Beaten down, rising and falling again
Then rising from disaster stronger than all

Our fire is running wild, to the fullmoon we howl
We will smash the hammer of heavy metal to the ground

This is the day when all hell breaks loose
Everything loose ground
Quickening of heavy metal begins
When all hell breaks loose

Slowly but steady we build our reich
Hellennium revelation welded on the skies
We campaign against the false ones side by side
Come forth and let the new era arise

Our fire is running wild, to the fullmoon we howl
We will smash the hammer of heavy metal to the ground

This is the day when all hell breaks loose
Everything loose ground
Quickening of heavy metal begins
When all hell breaks loose

[Lead: David Borg-Hansen]

Oh, oh, oh...

Hellâ¦Hellâ¦

This is the day when all hell breaks loose
Everything loose ground
Quickening of heavy metal begins
When all hell breaks loose

This is the day when all hell breaks loose
Everything loose ground
Quickening of heavy metal begins
When all hell breaks loose
