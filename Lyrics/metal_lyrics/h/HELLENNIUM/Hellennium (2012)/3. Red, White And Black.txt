[Words/Music: Hellennium]

Three colors have sown the flag that we hold
The phoenix is the sign, guiding our way
Metal brought us together a long time ago
Creating a brotherhood the world has rarely known

A banner to show the world, this is more than a trend
The colours painted in our hearts, shall never be washed away
Even if you throw our flag of honor to the flames
This world will never live to forget our name

Oh, oh, oh...

Red, for the blood we've shed on our way
White, for our virtue in a decieving world
Black, for our vow that we will never change
And the Phoenix, our spirit, yield to none

Red, for the blood we've shed on our way
White, for our virtue in a decieving world
Black, for our vow that we will never change
And the Phoenix, our spirit, yield to none
