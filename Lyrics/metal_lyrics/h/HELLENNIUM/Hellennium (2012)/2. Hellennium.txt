[Words/Music: Hellennium]

Suddenly then the blue sky will be coloured black and burned
A stormwind of raging fire will blow and cover mother earth
Rain, sunshine and life will vanish far away into the black
Total darkness arrives as the reaper will rush to heÂ´s attack

As the third millennium reaches it's dawn
The era of Hellennium won't be long gone

Hellennium, Hellennium, the final reich
Hellennium, Hellennium, the era of
Hellennium, Hellennium

As the Hellennium reich comes nothing will remain the same
The world you know will transform to an environment of decay
Gusts of nuclear wastewinds will only remain, on judgement day
This will your very last breath and it wouldn't help for you to pray

As the third millennium reaches it's dawn
The era of Hellennium won't be long gone

Hellennium, Hellennium, the final reich
Hellennium, Hellennium, the era of
Hellennium, Hellennium

[Lead I: David Borg-Hansen]
[Lead II: Martin Lindberg]

Oh, oh, ohâ¦

Hellennium, Hellennium, the final reich
Hellennium, Hellennium, the era of
Hellennium, Hellennium

Hellennium, Hellennium, the final reich
Hellennium, Hellennium, the era of
Hellennium, Hellennium
