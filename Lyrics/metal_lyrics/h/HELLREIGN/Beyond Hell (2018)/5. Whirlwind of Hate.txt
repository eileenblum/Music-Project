In the cold ancient mountains
Where mystic battles of war
Were fought

It's time
For demonic war!!
This is real
Black fucking evil!!!
...killing giants
With a whirlwind of hate!

My wings are spreading
Across the land
Total merciless fury
You'll drowned in sand

Forcing my fire
Down upon you
...I don't need
A demon army

Whirlwind
Of lightning and hate
Whirlwind
Meet your fate
