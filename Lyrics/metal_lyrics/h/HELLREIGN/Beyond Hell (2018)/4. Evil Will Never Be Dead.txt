Here is my flag of hatred
The innocent cry in pain
Chained, tortured, and beaten
Evil will continue to spread!!!

Evil Will Never Be Dead
Always there to choose
Even with the world destroyed,
Darkness will stay

Here is my flag of hatred
The innocent cry in pain
Chained, tortured, and beaten
Evil will continue to spread!!!

Evil Will Never Be Dead
Always there to choose
Even with the world destroyed,
Darkness will stay

Burning in Hell with Baphomet by my side
The serpents will bring fear

And the demons ascend
With swords in their hands
Ready to reign
Across the land

Hell will reign
