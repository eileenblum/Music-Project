Asteroid fields surrounded by death
Planets obliterated to nothing but dust
So begins a new age of darkness
All life extinguished but I still stand

Breaking the bounds of the universe
The end of the ancient and forgotten lores
Feel the wrath of my satanic force
My enemies will be shown no remorse

Asteroid
Armageddon

Destroyer of worlds
resistant to any weapon
