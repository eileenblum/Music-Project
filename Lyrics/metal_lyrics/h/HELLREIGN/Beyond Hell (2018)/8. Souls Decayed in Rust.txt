The ultimate evil
The bringing of death
A supernova to obliterate the earth
And burn it until nothing's left

And when your skin will rot,
Your bones will turn to ash
And when your body will vanish
Your soul shall forever rust

When the moon rises in the sky
You'll hear the howl,
When the light shines over a funeral pyre
It'll be your final hour

Soul rust, bones turned to nothing but dust
Soul rust, the dream of apocalypse
That you distrust

Human disgust
Souls decayed in rust
