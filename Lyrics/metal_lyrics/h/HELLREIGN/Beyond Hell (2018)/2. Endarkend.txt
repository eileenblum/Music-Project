The truth is nature's ugly
To think your morals mean something
It's most unlikely
The truth is the universe
is not fair
Without any chaos
The meaning of life is unclear

Within myself I see no mercy
To accept reality
I must embrace cruelty

Heaven shall burn
666
The sky turns red
And demons possess

Within myself I see no mercy
To accept reality
I must embrace cruelty

Tormenting your soul
With a blade of angels
Raping the world
Just to hear it cry

Endarkend by reality
