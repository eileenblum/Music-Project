In the flame, through the screams of pain
Dark inferno
Burning to a crisp, in the abyss
Hell eternal
Where horses of the apocalypse ride
Descending from the black sky

Blood to spill
For sacrifice

The burning stench
Of rotting flesh
Reeks, fire chaos and death
Arisen from the grave to the throne

Beyond Hell
Torture at night
Cruel blasphemy
Burns all in sight
Beyond Hell
Enter to die
Evil demons rise
Beyond Hell
