A sacrifice of blood
An awakened soul
The fire in the eyes of the beast
Pierce through
And devour its feast

Crushing
The victims with its teeth
Battered limbs
Of the feeble weak

The evil face
Of the wolf
Blood dripping from its mouth
Cracking their skulls
This is that horrid sound

A sacrifice of blood
An awakened soul
The fire in the eyes of the beast
Pierce through
And devour its feast

Crushing
The victims with its teeth
Battered limbs
Of the feeble weak

Taste the blood
Of the wolf
Feel the beast's power
Within

Blood of the Wolf!
