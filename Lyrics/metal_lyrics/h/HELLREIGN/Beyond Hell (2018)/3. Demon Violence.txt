Your guts have spilled out your body
A bloody pile of human waste lies ahead
A beauty I can't ignore
All these weak mortals
I've slayed before
Meet your fate at the end of my sword!
Forever
Your world shall burn...

Demons of Hell I summon thee
Demons of death it's not enough for me
Casting a spell forever in Hell
Demons come to me

Your guts have spilled out your body
A bloody pile of human waste lies ahead
A beauty I can't ignore
All these weak mortals
I've slayed before
Meet your fate at the end of my sword!
Forever
Your world shall burn...

Demons of Hell I summon thee
Demons of death it's not enough for me
Casting a spell forever in Hell
Demons come to me

Demon Violence
Their eyes cut out
Demon Violence
Love the sweet taste of death
Love to watch them beg and cry
As I take their lives
Take their lives!!!
