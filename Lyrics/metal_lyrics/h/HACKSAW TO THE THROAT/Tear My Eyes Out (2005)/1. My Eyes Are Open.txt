the world you pulled over my eyes
finally revealed
released from my illusion
that you could actually be
You never let me breathe
smothered in the fake
that you made seem true
my weakness is your strength
leaving me in shit
kicking in my teeth
finally escaping illusion
enclosed inside your words
I can't decide alone
you strive for our destruction
but to you its perfection
created for my improvement
but left unwilling to let go
rebuilt, individualized
but still conformed to you
fighting to get freedom
destroying to create the obsolete
my only escape is death
