Welcome home again...
Reek of Putrefaction drives you insane
I laugh as you rot in Hell
From my basement comes the foul smell

Hung up limbs...Heaps of Rot
Mangled Bodies on the floor

Steping on the scattered insides
Carnal debris in putrefaction
Floating in Formaldehyde...
My anatomical collection

Hung up limbs...Heaps of Rot
Mangled Bodies on the floor

Morgue sweet Home...Sickly nice
Morgue sweet Home...Foetid Paradise

Gloomy rooms full of remains
Vermin, maggots and insects
Among cadavers I dwell
I love all that you detest

Human waste...Streams of Blood
Splattered offals...Pus-stained walls

Morgue sweet Home...Sickly nice
Morgue sweet Home...Foetid Paradise
