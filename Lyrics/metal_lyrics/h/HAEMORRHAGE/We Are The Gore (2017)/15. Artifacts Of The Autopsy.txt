Puncturing the abdomen blackened by necrosis
Dislocating rigid limbs after rigor mortis
Gases leak out from swollen entrails
Death bacterias feast on decay
Accidents in the autopsy process
Postmortem consequence of a rough dissection
Lacerations in the scalp - Cut marks in the cranium
by forensic tools made of steel and titanium
Blunt force trauma has crushed the brain
Eyeballs pushed out due to the strain
Accidents in the autopsy process
Postmortem consequence of a rough dissection
Artifacts of the autopsy
Artifacts of the autopsy
Artifacts of the autopsy
Aftifacts of the autopsy
Pathologists distorting the laws of anatomy
Determining a erroneous cause of death
Deliberately inflicting postmortal injuries
Occulting malicious forensic mistakes
Dignity is defleshed
Intended truth detruncation
Weird taphonomy
Cadaveric alterations
...organs eaten by insects
...iatrogenic fractures
Sick jurisprudence
Tries to justify the mutilation
Signs of violence
as a posthumous manifesto
...broken skeletal remains
(...careless exhumations)
