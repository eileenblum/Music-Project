Daily exposed to contact with fatal infections
Deafening to auscultate distorted bruits
Queasily we collect the patient's excretions
Getting sick with the smell of embalming fluids

We eviscerate...
...to operate the patients
We mutilate...
...drenched in pus and blood
What you detest...
...we do the sickest labors
The goriest jobs
...everything you deplore

Dehydrated, bear the heat during the cremation
Twelve- hours shifts in the Morgue breathing rot
Removing viscera from the operating table
Transporting casualties full of gore

We dig the graves
...to bury your cadavers
We embalm the dead...
...we just live to dissect

What you detest...
...we do the sickest labors
We deal with death
...we avoid you see the pain

Disgusting...Annoying...Hazardous...Necrotic...
Injurious...Repulsive...Nauseating Employements

Chosen to perform the most disgusting professions
Trained to become Healthcare system slaves
Spending our workdays among death and putrefaction
Carrying out the tasks that nobody wants to make

We lacerate...
...striving to dismember
We incinerate...
...we dispose human waste
What you detest...
...we do the sickest labors
What you despise...
...we come to sanitize

Disgusting...Annoying...Hazardous...Necrotic...
Injurious...Repulsive...Nauseating Employments
