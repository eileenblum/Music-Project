Coroner's van on the road
In route to the morgue
Every night boring job
Deadly routine
Body bags to dispatch
Sinister load
Driving fast in the night's freezing silence
Carrying the deceased in their last ride
Muscles crack
Don't look back
It's only a corpse
Transporting cadavers
Transporting cadavers
Transporting cadavers
Transporting cadavers
Gases creak... rotting bowels
Gurgling fluids... inside the box
Decrepit limbs stiff
Rigor mortis
Lungs expire a last word in the casket
Heard that voice and your car crashed
Now you are a corpse
Transporting cadavers
Transporting cadavers
Transporting cadavers
Transporting cadavers
