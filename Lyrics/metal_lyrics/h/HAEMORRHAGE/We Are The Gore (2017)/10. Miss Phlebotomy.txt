Gruesome benefits of hospitalization
Cruel venipuncture as a morbid obssession
Iron overload poisoning my veins
Haematochromatosis
Drastic remedy for polycythemia
Trained to exsanguinate on medical criteria
Sadistic devices and syringes displayed
She enters the infirmary
To pierce...drill...jab...
Push in the syringe
Pierce...drill...jab...
Inside my veins
Ready to perform a new perforation
Only she can stop my blood circulation
The touch on her gloves on my morbid skin
Increase my hematocrit
Violently overwhelmed by the situation
My arteries explode in every direction
Drops of crimson cruor splash on her face
She tastes my haemoglobine
To Pierce...drill...jab...
Deplete my vessels
Pierce...drill...jab,
Stick the needle
Deplete my veins before I go insane
Drain me
Extract all fluids from me
She's Miss Phlebotomy
My heart is speeding-up
Fatal cardiac disease
a smile draws on her lips
She's Miss Phlebotomy
Deplete my veins before I go insane
Drain me
Extract all fluids from me
She's Miss Phlebotomy
My heart is speeding-up
Fatal cardiac disease
a smile draws on her lips
She's Miss Phlebotomy
