Clean the gore!
Cold remnants of a murder
Vestiges of suicide
Pieces from crippled corpses
Blood splattered on the walls
...On the floor bile and vomits
...Severed legs and limbless bodies
Armed with brooms and sponges
We enter the scene of a crime
Picking up shredded organs
Limbs put in plastic bodybags
...Chopped entrails - flesh leftovers
...Guts removed with a shovel
...Flies and grubs in the carpet
...Putrilage stained the mattress
Gore...Human waste...Gruesome commitment
Crime scene cleaners
Rot...Nauseous stench...Sick Environment
Crime scene cleaners
Dissolving...absorbing...we clean up the gore
Striving to clean up the gore Dissolving...absorbing...we clean up the gore We're working to clean up the gore
Sweeping out sliced tissues
Residuum is brushed away
We pour our caustic liquids
to sanitize this fucking place
Gore...Human waste...Gruesome commitment

Rot...Nauseous stench...Sick Enviroment
