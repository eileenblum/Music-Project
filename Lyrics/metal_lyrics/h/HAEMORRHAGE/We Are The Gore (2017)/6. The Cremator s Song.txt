Corpses, Corpses, Corpses
burning down the
Corpses, Corpses, Corpses
set on fire
Foul smell of cremation
comes from the funeral home
You can breathe the smoke
of scorched flesh and bones
Fueling the furnace with bodies of the dead
My mind is mesmerized gazing into these flames
Consuming coffins and decayed human remains
Don't ask me where I work...I work in hell!!
Corpses, Corpses, Corpses
burning down the
Corpses, Corpses, Corpses
set on fire
A pile of smouldering ashes
is all that left of you
your life is reduced to dust
into a funeral urn
Fueling the furnace with bodies of the dead
My mind is mesmerized gazing into these flames
Consuming coffins and decayed human remains
Don't ask me where I work...I work in hell!!
Ashes to Gases...
Pus to dust...
See them vanish
Rest in fire...
