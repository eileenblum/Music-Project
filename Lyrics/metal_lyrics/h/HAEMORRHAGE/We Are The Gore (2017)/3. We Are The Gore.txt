We're paid to mutilate
Embalm, cremate and dissect
Nauseous disgusting professions
Sick duties that others detest
Rip and hack - bloodstained wage
Bury and burn everyday
We're the gore... that's our job
We're the gore... we're so proud
Surgeon, embalmer, undertaker
Crematory operator
Butcher, mortician, prosecutor
Funeral director and nurse
Loathing work - horror trade
Alive or dead - we don't care
We're the gore... that's our job
We're the gore and we feel so proud
