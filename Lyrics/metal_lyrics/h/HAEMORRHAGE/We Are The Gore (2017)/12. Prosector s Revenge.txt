Cadavers I select with random criterion
Taking them from the morgue to the autopsy table
...enslaved to dissect
...do what they say
Washed away and prepared for the demonstration
Dissecting under command of arrogant professors
...enslaved to dissect
...Cut the crap!
Formaldehyde smell disturbing my brain
Surrounded by corpses I spent my workday
Ignored and exploited - I'm treated with contempt
but one day they will taste my scalpel blade
Prosector's revenge
Anatomy of hate
Prosector's revenge
...it's over now
