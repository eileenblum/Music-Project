Rushed into butchery
Comatized by sedation
The cap, the face-mask, and the scrub...
Pre-operative ritual

Blood-stained instruments
The patulous entrails
Your eviscerated fate
Under my scalpel blade

A flat line carved in flesh and bone
Pathology of terror
Atrocities of medicine
Internecine carnage

Blood-stained instruments
The patulous entrails
Your eviscerated fate
Under my scalpel blade

Pulse is fading down
As blood on the green gown
Re-opened cavities
Emetic feelings

Undergo the operation
First incisions, mortal cuts
A butcher's knife to split the omentum
Intestines torn apart

Resecting... Portions of the bowels
Depleting... Organs swamped in gore

Gazing at the ripped abdomen
Razed tissues, shreds of fat
Stomach ejecting his contents
Purulent innards I extract

Excising... Festered cysts I grab
Suturing... The surgical wounds

Depict the splattered epitaph
Blasphemous vademecum
An obituary as prognosis
Post mortem nursing care

Blood-stained instruments
The patulous entrails
Your eviscerated fate
Under my scalpel blade

Just another corpse
Onwards to the morgue
