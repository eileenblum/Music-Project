Tourniquet applied above the bleeding wound
Constricting blood flow along necrosed tissues
Dislocated limbs infected of gangrene
There is no salvation for the extremities

Anatomic loss...
Obnoxious protocol
Drastic surgery
Amputate it...

Patient rushed to the emergency room
Decision is hard but it must be done
Slicing the muscles sawing through the bone
A clean cut to leave a beautiful stump

Anatomic loss...
Obnoxious protocol
Drastic surgery
Amputate it...

Wrong surgery!

PO Complications - The problem remains
Evaluation reveals a fatal mistake
Malpractice occurred - diagnose confirms
Amputation of the wrong extremity

Anatomic loss...
Obnoxious protocol
Drastic surgery
Amputate it...

Amputation protocol
Amputation for you all
