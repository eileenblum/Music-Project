Syncoped cardiopath's heart
Arteries about to infarct
Blood freezes inside your veins
Sudden cardiac arrest

Extreme manoeuvres
Of resuscitation

Desperate CPR
Thrusting your chest till it cracks
Bruised thoracic cage
Charred at defibrillation

Extreme manoeuvres
Of Resuscitation

Livid
Pulseless
Unresponsed reanimation
Rigid
Breathless
Aborted resuscitation

[Lead: Flat line cacophony by Ana]

Thoracostomy
Direct cardiac massage
My hand pumps your heart
Through the intercostal carnage

No oxygen in your lungs
Cardiograms becoming flat
Last high-voltage discharge
Your body set on flames

Extreme manoeuvres
Resuscitation fails
