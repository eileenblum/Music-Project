Medical corporations - genetic industry
repulsive master plan to fight against disease
embryos brood
in brain dead moms
to extract organs and limbs
banks of sane tissues
to replace the sick

Born on the mortuary slab
dead from delivery
foetus for spare parts
necronatology

Human farms
mass clonation to rise their benefits
embryocide
wierd selection from the afterbirth
horrific malformations
obsteric teratism
biotech mistakes
grim monstrosities

Born on the mortuary slab
dead from delivery
foetus for spare parts
necronatology

Doomed from within
sentenced to be killed

Fertilized with pyosperm
defective insemination
mechanized incubation
spawn of living dead

Foetal cadavers

Forceps brought them to this world
of death and mutilation
closed eyes that never see
the morgue where they're born

Foetal cadavers

Carrion for the gods
science of madness
