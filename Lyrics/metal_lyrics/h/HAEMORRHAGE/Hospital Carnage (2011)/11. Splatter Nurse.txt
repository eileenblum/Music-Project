In white uniform, dressed to kill
enter my room
the touch of her latex gloves
make my wounds bleed

Pierce my heart with your scalpel
burst my veins with injections
cure my scars, disinfect them
poison me, let me breathless

Sweet nurse... heal me
Splatter nurse... leave me bleeding
Death nurse... kill me
Splatter nurse... please relieve me

Icecold eyes stare at me
stick the needle
take out my blood - give me pills
pump that syringe

Purge my guts with your enemas
as alcohol burns my bedsores
torn me apart... chop my head off
saw my bones with your chainsaw

Sweet nurse... heal me
Splatter nurse... leave me bleeding
Death nurse... kill me
Splatter nurse... euthanize me now
