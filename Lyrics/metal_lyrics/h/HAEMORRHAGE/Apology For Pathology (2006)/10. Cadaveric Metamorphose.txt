Necrotic plasma in celular decay
Rotting enzymes autolisyfied remains
Fetid pyosis oozing thru the flesh
Breeding parasites, ebullition in the dead

Disintegrated and decomposed
As maggots munch - metamorphose

Voracious turmoil of starving grubs
Masticating innards, drinking all the pus
Devoured carcasses, bones is all that felt
Procreating larvs - spawn of death
