Prone on the mortuary slab - naked and sedated
Horrified - undergone my sick thanatopraxis
Removing viscera - purging fluids I extract
Arteries I deplete - cavities filled with formalin

Antemortem disembovelment

Cotton in nostrils and throat - slow suffocation
Muscles and fendons I snap to dislocate the stiffened limbs

Antemortem disembovelment

Face features molded from wax - grotesque disfigurement
Effacing surgical scars - necroplastic surgery

Glued eyelids - hairstyled scalp
Tied-shut mouth - face made-up
Lavaged and perfumed
The corpse is now ready to be inhumed

Antemortem disembowelment
