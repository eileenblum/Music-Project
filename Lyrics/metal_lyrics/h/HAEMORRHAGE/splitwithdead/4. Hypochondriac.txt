Chronical aches fictitious pains - unprobed legions
Parasited by endemic fears - contagion panic

Under the septic siege ...immunological risks
Perpetual quarantine ...i live in sickness

Self medicated pharmacoadict - Toxic Placebo 
Over prophylaxed and  disinfected - Sterile Methods

The horror of disease ...Diagnostic quandary
Bizarre pathologies... Addict to sickness

Hypochondriac ... Envious of the sick
Hypochondriac ... Obsessed by Disease
