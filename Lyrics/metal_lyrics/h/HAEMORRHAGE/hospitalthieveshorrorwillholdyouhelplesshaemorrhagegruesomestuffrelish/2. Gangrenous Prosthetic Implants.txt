Repairing extremities...
Limbs afected by severe lessions
New prostheses made of steel,
Mishandling causes infection

Prosthetic members - bone plates and hip nails
Fungo-bacterial decay
Bone screws, extensors and femoral heads
Metal corroding your flesh

Crystal eyeballs, gastric bands, weird palatal obturators
Gangrened adjacent tissues-macerated in suppuration 

Plastic meniscus eroded cartilage
Heart valves, cardiac arrest 
Uretral conduits for urine drainage
Odd drain-bags for excrements 

Polyurethane bones - deformed plastic legs
Skeletal insertions...
Putrefy

Replace missing body parts
with artficial extensions
Orthopaedic surgery - septic allograft rejection 

Prosthetic members - bone plates and hip nails
Fungo-bacterial decay
Bone screws, extensors and femoral heads
Metal corroding your flesh
