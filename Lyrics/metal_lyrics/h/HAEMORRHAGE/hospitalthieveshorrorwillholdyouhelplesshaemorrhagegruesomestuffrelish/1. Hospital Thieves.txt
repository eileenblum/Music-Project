Wander corridors seeking out for gore
Raptors disguised in medical gowns
Sedated inmates are the easiest preys
Newborn Infants grimly I take away

Abducting...Sequestering
Kidnnaping the patients

Hospital Thieves
Hospital Thieves
Bandits in bloody scrubs
Hospital Thieves

[lead: Clinical delinquence by Ana]

Stalking the rooms to plunder the sick
Complete bodies, sometimes only limbs
Rapid surgery - furtive organs theft
Injured patients - slaughtered in their beds

Abducting...Sequestering
Kidnnaping the patients

Hospital Thieves
Hospital Thieves
Bandits in bloody scrubs
Hospital Thieves

Vile assault to extirpate
Maiming the convalescent
Torn apart - ripped to shreds
Your entrails I appropiate

Blood and bones, mangled flesh
Hearts and kidneys I collect
Gory swag - loot of entrails
Silently I slip away

Abducting...Sequestering
Kidnnaping the patients

Hospital Thieves
Hospital Thieves
Bandits in bloody scrubs
Hospital Thieves
