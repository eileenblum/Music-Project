[Instrumental]Outpost in the plains, yield us sight upon what was.
Conquered and erected upon the high ground of old.
Not that of mortals, but that of the ways of fist and axe, the ever-prevailing standard of right and wrong.
It was them that did and always will deal out the restricted sets of feathers, ink and parchment to be nailed to the town gates, holding each and all accountable by ways of its contents.
Outpost, yield us sight upon a place, a rich broth to fill entrails with wisdom.
Hindsight is foresight. Past is prosperity. Culture is craft.
