[originally by When Bitter Spring Sleeps]See them fall
In drawings on cave walls
From centuries gone
Their history fading

Oh how they rose
In grandeur and majesty!
But their magick was too strong
It dragged them down and they drowned
In their own greed for more
Their hunger for wisdom

And the old ones they say
That the sky has not always been this grey

They held their words in their hands
Sent knowledge through sky and light
But forgotten their Mother
Their place in the web of this ancient way

A tenuous grasp of a small part of Nature
And a future they'd never live to see
Razed forests for towers
But the waters came rushing in

Oh how they shone
In grandeur and majesty!
But their magick was too strong
It dragged them down and they drowned
In their own greed for more
And a future they'd never live to see

And the old ones say that the
Sky has not always been this way

Look beyond these sands my sons
And gaze into the past centuries forever lost
A time where seasons thrived
In light of a brilliant sun

But rang aloud a clamor of greed
A foul and odorous blood they drained it dry
And choked the light from their skies

All reason came to an end
While cowering in sterile tombs
Their seasons came to an end

This is the wherefore we break our backs
To wrest life from this soil
And attend to the beat of Her feeble heart
I beseech that your sons will know as well
