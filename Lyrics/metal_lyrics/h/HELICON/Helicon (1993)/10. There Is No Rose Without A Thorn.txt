Run all day through this life with blinded eyes and never find an answer
Burning like a candle light, flickering in the wind of destiny
Step in traps, it's so sad, tired of life like flies that swarm in the fire
And I wanna die melting by this random love, with passion like a fire

When you see my smiling face you don't know what I feel
Baby, don't you know that I am facing
You should never know, whatever have you done to me?
Oh, you had no right to break
Oh, you're a devil's fake, but stay
Oh, don't you turn my heart away
It's like a game you had to play
And I'm the loser, had to pay
It's like a never ending fight

I watch your face and look at my heart, wounds could heal, but scars are digging deep
And I tried to save, to save my tears, for somebody who is worth enough
And i wanna die melting by this random love, with passion like a fire
I'll never know such a love affair, should never end, it's burning with desire

When you see my smiling face you don't know what I feel
Baby, don't you know that I am facing
You should never know, whatever have you done to me?
Oh, you had no right to break
Oh, you're a devil's fake, but stay
Oh, don't you turn my heart away
It's like a game you had to play
And I'm the loser, had to pay
It's like a never ending

There is no rose without a thorn
And after sun there comes the storm
You had to know that games take their own price, their price
You want to know no lies
You want to know no lies
I had to pay a price!

There is no rose without a thorn
And after sun there comes the storm
You had to know that games take their own price, their price
You want to know no lies! Stay!
I'm going to turn my heart away
It's like a game you had to play, yeah
And I'm the loser, had to pay
It's like a never ending fight
