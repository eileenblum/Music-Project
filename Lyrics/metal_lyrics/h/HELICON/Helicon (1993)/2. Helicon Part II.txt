He's the winner, call him death
You will have no time to rest
Feel the sign, it's crime time in town
Don't you know it's evil vice

No sun will shine
The full moon's shining bright

There are painful throes of death
You will have no time to rest
It's Satan who taints the town
Unknown faces spinning around

Oh, now they cry for nations
Oh yeah, they're crying in the night
Oh, now they cry for nations
Oh yeah, they're fighting for their pride

Alright! Alright, they fight
Never to unchain their pride
Your pride and slight is
Changing now to fear
Too long they'd lived a living death
Now is the time for...
Alright! Alright
Oh please save your jeer

They're not dead, they're still in town
Can't you see that Zeus' daughter died
Too weak to fight

Human lay down fantasy
Human you have never seen this fight
Oh Thalia died

There you are standing with your fright
It's too late to lay down pride

Alright! Alright, they fight
Never to unchain their pride
Your pride and slight is
Changing now to fear
Too long they'd lived a living death
Now is the time for...
Alright! Alright
Oh please save your jeer

You had to know that there's one day you have to pay a price
With closed eyes you will never see all these lies
You hear the breath, living death
Human, too long you had to run so blind through the night

With blind eyes you will never see all these lies
You had to know that there's one day you have to pay a price
You hear a breath, living death
Human, too long you had to run so blind through the night

Human sinner who will bless
You will have no time to rest
A piece of legend is now born
Oh it's blood it's cold as ice

Oh, now they cry for nations
Oh yeah, they're crying in the night
Oh, now they cry for nations
Oh yeah, they're fighting for their pride

Alright! Alright, they fight
Never to unchain their pride
Your pride and slight is
Changing now to fear
Too long they'd lived a living death
Now is the time for...
Alright!

Alright, they fight, bad times are coming tight [x3]

Alright, they fight
Never to unchain their pride
Your pride and slight is
Changing now to fear
Too long they'd lived a living death
Now is the time for...
Alright! Alright
Oh please save your jeer
