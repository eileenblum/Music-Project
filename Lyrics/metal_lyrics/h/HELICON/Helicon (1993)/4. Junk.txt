I know what you suffer, fear
You're all day on the run to disappear
All day my tears you don't see
Can't you see these chains you put on me
Your eyes are not looking back
To see your empty eyes that makes me sad

Don't you know that i feel pain?
Don't you know life's not a game?

Hey man, live life real
Or will you leave it?
Stay man, leave this hell!
[repeat]

So long yeah, so long yeah I had watched your face
Don't you know that Satan plays a game
I saw you at the station, you're dealing, oh you're blind
I see that there is nothing left to fight
It's time now to forget you, no tears are left to cry!

I know that you got no chance to try again
You wish your heart was made of stone
I know you always look for a getaway
I know, I know, stop, oh you're killing me!

Today, goodbye my friend, you died
You leave the place where you had to fight
Today oh, I see the sun
I remember good times, we had fun

Don't you know that i feel pain?
Don't you know life's not a game?

Hey man, live life real
Or will you leave it?
Stay man, leave this hell!
[repeat 3x]
