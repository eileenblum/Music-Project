Friends, when I saw her some years ago
No, we swore to be friends for life
We had a good time playing in town
We made fun, restless, wild

Playing with fire, playing light minded
Friend, we don't need anymore
The end of friendship's coming tight
I was sitting in your car

Now you're a stranger, I saw you last night
You were looking downcast, I'll hold you tight

Come on, rock!
Nothing can destroy this friendship
Come on!
Never will forget these good times
Come on, rock!
Baby take my helping hand now
Come on!
You had helped me through the bad times

You were like my brother, I loved you with passion
I told you whatever I feel
We were good chums, best in town
I never will forget

Time passed away and we'd grown older
Your foreign eyes make me sad
The end of friendship's coming tight
I was sitting in your car

Now you're a stranger, I saw you last night
You were looking downcast, I'll hold you tight

Come on, rock!
Nothing can destroy this friendship
Come on!
Never will forget these good times
Come on, rock!
Baby take my helping hand now
Come on!
You had helped me through the bad times

I never can support if you feel not well
Will always wish your enemies to hell
Pride's like a knife, it hurts inside
Don't ya, don't ya, don't ya...know?

Your foreign pride hurts me deep inside
Oh, why do you behave like a sulking child
If you need help, I will be there
Don't ya, don't ya, don't ya...know?

This friendship can be right
Cause it burned deep inside

How long?
The sun will be shining
How long?
Flowers will be growing
How long?
A reason for living
How long?
Forever.

Come on, rock!
Nothing can destroy this friendship
Come on!
Never will forget these good times
Come on, rock!
Baby take my helping hand now
Come on!
You had helped me through the bad times
Come on!
