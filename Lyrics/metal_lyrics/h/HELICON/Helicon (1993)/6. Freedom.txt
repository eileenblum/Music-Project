They'd thrown you outside
Oh you were just a child
You were a child living on the streets and hanging around

You'd felt so lonely
Oh yes in many nights
And you'd missed a helping hand in lonely times

When they mocked you and you've been crying
A thousand deaths you're always dying

Can't live in freedom, what's going on? [x2]

Oh, in this town the people ignore nuisance
Oh, in this town you're unnecessary

Can't live in freedom, what's going on? [x2]

Oh yes, I can see you dream of better times
Oh your rotgut helps to dream

You see a lady and she feeds her dog with cake
Oh it's a shame your hungry eyes they do not see
Oh you learned to be a skip jack it's not the first time that you feel sad
Take a gulp and dream of better times

Too many years the people have despised you
And now they wonder that you don't accept their law
Oh, you see the grass is green on the other side
When they mocked you and you've been crying and I bet you're always crying?

Can't live in freedom, what's going on? [x2]

Oh, in this town the people ignore nuisance
Oh, in this town you're unnecessary

Can't live in freedom, what's going on? [x2]

Oh yes, I can see you dream of better times
Oh your rotgut helps to dream

They had told you that you should believe in god
They had told you that all people will have equal rights
They had told you if you try you could find a job
They had told you if you try you could reach everything

Oh, no, don't close your eyes
Don't believe in silly lies!

Oh yes, I know this pain
Oh you are down and feel ashamed
Oh, with pink glasses on
You mustn't see what happens really
[repeat]

We wanna live with approbation
Equal and free with liberation
Maybe after the day when I die
I will know the reason why!
[repeat 2x]
