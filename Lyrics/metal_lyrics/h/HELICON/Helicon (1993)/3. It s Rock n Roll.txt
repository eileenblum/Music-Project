It makes my blood run through my veins
It's like my breath, oh I never can stop, pay any price
Oh yes, it's like a fever that's burning
Was my first love, oh it never can be dying

Some times I hate it, oh I wish I'd never known
It's like a mania, I want to rock your heart

It's rock and roll
I know that I'll never let it be
It's rock and roll
Whatever will happen to me
It's rock and roll
It's there when the bad days are coming
It's rock and roll
It burns me with fire

Oh I'd checked, I shouldn't look back
Choose a way but I don't know is it wrong or is it right
Choose a way, oh the good friends they leave me
It's not fate that hits my heart

Choose a way, oh so many are dreaming
Choose a way, maybe never will be winning
Oh business is faking, your money they'd taken
Puppets of business we are

It's rock and roll
I know that I'll never let it be
It's rock and roll
Whatever will happen to me
It's rock and roll
It's there when the bad days are coming
It's rock and roll
It burns me with fire

You must be crazy for playing this game
Working so hard for a moment of fame
Oh yes, I will never know reasons why
But I hope never to be on bended knees

Sometimes I think to work in chains
I work so hard for a moment of fame
Won't realize, I fall in a trance when the audience is screaming
Yes, it is the reason why my heart is beating

Sometimes I hate it, oh I wish I'd never known
You don't know what I feel
Sometimes I hate it, oh I wish I'd never known
When it happened to me
It's like a mania, I want to rock, rock, rock, rock to your heart!

It's rock and roll
I know that I'll never let it be
It's rock and roll
Whatever will happen to me
It's rock and roll
It's there when the bad days are coming
It's rock and roll
It burns me with fire
