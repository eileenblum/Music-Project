Woman, woman, not always famous like Mona Lisa
Woman, woman, some of them living in dusty dirty subways

And strong, yeah, in the USSR
And strong, yeah, wherever they are
And strong, yeah, in America
And strong, yeah, wherever they are

You are only a woman and pretty you must be
It is not worth what's in your mind
That is so much older then, than human life on earth
That is the way until your birth

They'd kill the witches, have killed 'em all
And at the end they take your soul
They'd kill the witches, have killed 'em all
And at the end they take your soul

Woman, woman, many of you have lived inconspicuous
Woman, woman, need much more power if they wanna rise up

They will always bring you down without the respect you feel
Played battlefield, they do not see bad playing games
Woman take but women bring you ever to woman to love
She dried her tears, she loves all the time, she wants her chance to love

You are only a woman and pretty you must be
It is not worth what's in your mind
That is so much older then, than human life on earth
That is the way until your birth

They'd kill the witches, have killed 'em all
And at the end they take your soul
They'd kill the witches, have killed 'em all
And at the end they take your soul

Woman, woman, not always famous like Mona Lisa
Woman, woman, some of them living in dusty dirty subways

They have always brought you down without the respect you feel
Played battlefield, they do not see bad playing games
Woman take but women bring you ever to woman to love
She dried your tears, she loves all the time, she wants her chance to love

You are only a woman and pretty you must be
It is not worth what's in your mind
That is so much older then, than human life on earth
That is the way until your birth

They'd kill the witches, have killed 'em all
And at the end they're gonna change you and bring you...

They'd kill the witches, have killed 'em all
And at the end they're gonna change you and bring you to hell
