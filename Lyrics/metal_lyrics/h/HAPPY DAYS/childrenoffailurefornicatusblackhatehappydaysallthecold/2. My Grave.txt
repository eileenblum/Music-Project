[performed by Fornicatus]Life fade away
From this unreal garden
...of this unreal garden
A world without joy
One soul forever suffer
It's time to bury me
It's time to forgot 
Every night must search the exit
Every day one step closer the Death
Time of my Death doesn't matter
Cos my mind is dead already
