[performed by Happy Days]We live
We Die
Its all part of life
This is our reality
That we cannot deny
Why does it have tobe this way.
Is there no light in darkness?
Every breath i take.
Pollutes and posions my lung
This decrepit air.
Is there no escape to this?
Its so thick
I cant breathe..
Please make it stop..
I dont want tosuffer anymore..
I just want to be left alone...
To Die....
Because thats the truth about life..
We are Born alone...
And we die alone...
