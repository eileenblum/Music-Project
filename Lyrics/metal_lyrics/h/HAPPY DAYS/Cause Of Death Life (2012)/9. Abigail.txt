[Soundclip from the film Closer:] 
"I don't love you anymore.
Since when?
Now. Just now. I donât want to lie. Can't tell the truth, so it's over.
It doesn't matter. I love you. None of it matters.
Too late. I don't love you anymore. Goodbye.
Here's the truth, so now you can hate me. Larry fucked me all night. I enjoyed it. I came. I prefer you. Now go.
I knew that. He told me.
You knew?
I needed to hear it from you.
Why?
Because he might have been lying. I had to hear it from you.
I would never have told you, because I know you would have never forgived me.
I would. I have.
Why did he tell you?
Because he's a bastard.
How could he?
Because he wanted this to happen.
But why test me?
Because I'm an idiot.
Yes. I would have loved you... forever. Now, please go.
Don't do this, Alice. Talk to me.
I am talking. Fuck off.
No I'm sorry. You misunderstand! I didn't mean to.
Yes you did.
I love you!
Where?
What?
Show me! Where is this love? I... I can't see it, I can't touch it. I can't feel it. I can hear it. I can hear some words, but I can't do anything with your easy words. 
Whatever you say is too late.
Please, don't do this!
It's done.
Now, please go, or I'll call security.
No, you're not in a strip club, there is no security.
Why did you fuck him?
I wanted to.
Why?!
I desired him.
Why?!
You weren't there!
Why him?!
He asked me nicely.
You're a liar.
So?
Who are you?
I'm no one!"

Abigail....
