Tell Me How Worthless I Am...
I Need To Know...
Because...You Were All That Mattered..
For filth is what we turn too...
Once the world..finally comes to an end...
You took it all from me...

I don't think theres any blood left in me...
No more tears to shed...
No More screams...
No more begging..
Just acceptance...
For These Wounds Will Never Be As Deep As This Emptiness...
