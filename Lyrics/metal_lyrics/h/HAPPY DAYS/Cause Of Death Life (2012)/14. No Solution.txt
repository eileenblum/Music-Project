And so Begins,
Another battle,
Between life and death,
Struggling to stray away,
From the Temptation,
Will this night be another separation?
Trembling from this confliction.
Will there be nothing left?

Feeling more and more lifeless during each session,
Trapped by my own fixation,
The addicting overdose injection,
I remember everything...

Theres no escape from this mental illness,
Losing all control of my thoughts,
Eaten alive by this morbid sickness,
This time i will be forever gone...
