Take a look,
In my eyes,
Take a walk in my shoes,
And see Why I am this way,

Watch as your life starts to fall apart,
Watch as your life begins to decay,
This forest was once full of life,
Flames begin to ignite,
Watch it all get destroyed,
What was once beautiful has become ugly,
This is my world,
And I cant get out...

No matter how hard I scream,
No matter how hard I plead,
It always falls on deaf ears,
So as you watch through my eyes,
You can begin to understand,
And see why I am this way,
You cant save me,
I've begun to fall apart...
