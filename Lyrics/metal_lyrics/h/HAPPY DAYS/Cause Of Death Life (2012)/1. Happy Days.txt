I remember when there used to be colors all over,
and I could wake up and barely open my eyes,
Having a simple mind,
Feeling so euphoric,
Not knowing what later lurks in my lifetime,
Wanting to stay in this moment always,
Now my days are fading every time i blink,
Foreseeing images,
Flashing in my head,
Violent voices,
Wanting me dead,
Opened eyes start to burn now,
The sun is just too much
And when I close them the darkness engulfs me

As I'm growing 
Things are dying,
It only takes one mistake,
To beget another,
I can never see this happening,
Im still young,
Please don't take this away from me,
Let me at least keep this
As a memory,
Now all that is left,
Is entering this path,
Where my miserable life starts,
Just as I watch the colors fade away,
I begin to step towards this black void,
Where no light is found here,

I will miss these moments where things were still innocent.
The days where I still believed.
I will miss these everlasting beautiful fields,
Where i would run and reach for the sky,
I will miss these happy days,
I will miss it,
oh how i will miss it...
