I sit,
And wait,
Seems as though time has stop,
I stare once more towards my scarred up wounds, 
Reopening them,
Hoping that its my time,
To forever Fade away,
I don't belong here. 
I need to die,
I cant take this waiting anymore,
Once again i sit,
and wait,
This time with nothing to comfort me, 
The blades are dull,
The nooses are broken, 
Theres nothing left for me to grab onto,
I am forever alone and cold,
Nothing can save me now...
