Each day passes by slower and slower,
Rotting little by little,
Agony and suffering is all I know,
Am I meant to commit suicide?
The more and more i realize,
In the end nothing really matters,
You can have a happy life with nothing wrong,
Sounds more of like a Fantasy to me,
Happiness doesn't last,
Depression and Negativity will always triumph,

So why continue on living,
Why not just end it already,
Jump in a pool of Razors,
Hang yourself,
Jump off a building,
Review your entire life,
Realize what a great waste it was...
