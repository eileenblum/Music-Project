Cut me,
Reopen my wounds,
Pour your salty touch,
Watch me scream,
I beg you to stop,

Your words cut me
Slashing my skin
And crushing my bones
Until I am nothing 
Beneath you
Reduced to Dust,

You said you always cared,
But when i looked back,
You where never there,
Just a gun and a knife,
Giving me a warming stare,

You told me you wouldn't leave
You told me you would care
And I believed your every word
Now I sit alone and stare at you
With you laughing in my face
Coldly...
