This bullet to the head didn't work...
What the fuck happened?
Laying on the cold stretcher.

In a white room.

Strapped down...
Faced down...
Losing the joy of movement...
Struggling physically and mentally...
Trying to break the chains that bind me...
My cries for help go unheard (as always)
As it echoes through the black halls...
But evryone else has passed their expiration date...
Why am I still alive?
