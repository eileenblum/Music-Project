This emptiness I feel inside,
This void I cannot fill,
What do you do when everything is lost,
When the one thing that mattered is gone,
Everyday gets slower,
Just pull the trigger on the gun,
Stab the knife into my heart,
Why suffer any longer?
Why prolong the pain?
Truth is as long as I know there's a chance,
Even in the slightest...
That one thought,
That one hope of being in your arms again,
Is what keeps me going,
It's me clinging onto this worthless life,
Clingig onto a chance of happiness,
A chance at feeling like in something,
Why do I keep lying to myself?
