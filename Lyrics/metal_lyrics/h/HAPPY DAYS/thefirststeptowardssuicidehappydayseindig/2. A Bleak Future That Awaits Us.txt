Darkness all around,
Not able to foresee,
The torture and bleak future,
That awaits me,
No one to care for you,
No one wanting you,
Like trash,
We all get disposed of,
If not now then later,
The path I'm on has no end,
Countless beatings,
Countless catastrophes,
So much blood,
Make it stop,
Even after all the wars I've fought,
I am unable to wash my hands,
For this stain,
Will always remain,
In my life,
Wich is full of strife,
Now and forever...
