Our time has come. This is were time stops.
This is where everything turns black.
Where everything ends, and everything
begins. I know I wont be missed.
I know, I know...
Don't pretend that you will.
I'm tired of all these lies, I'm tired of
my helpless cries, so don't try to stop me
from pulling this trigger. Let me have this
one moment, to have rejuvinate myself and
get rid of the dirty stench that I placed
on this earth (Me). No bullet can
accomplish this task, I never trusted
the weapons that were created by man.
Ther is no life after death. But before I go,
Let me watch look through the infinite trees.
Let me dance to the snowstorm and sing along
with the winds as i reach for the sky. My
tears can't stop flowing, everyone says to let
go of the past, so I jumped off the mountain
that I once stood still on, watching myself fall
Let me close my Eyes and never wake up. I am
finally letting go, I am finally going to stop
breathing. Hearing his voice in my head saying.
Let it go, let it go, you have lost it all, you
have done it all, this journy is finally over.
You don't have to suffer anymore. Let it go...
