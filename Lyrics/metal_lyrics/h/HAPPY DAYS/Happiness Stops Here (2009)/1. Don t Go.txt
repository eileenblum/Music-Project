Please Don't Go,
Please Don't Go...
I thought you were everything,
I thought you were the one...
But once again I'm still blind,
By the fake mask of life.
Again I fell for its trap,
Again I fell for its lies...
And now you are leaving,
And I'm begging you to stay...
What we had was something special.
What's going on? It's getting hard 
to breathe. I'm torn open,
I'm on my knees, asking you 
to stay and not to leave.
Please Don't go,
Please Don't go...
