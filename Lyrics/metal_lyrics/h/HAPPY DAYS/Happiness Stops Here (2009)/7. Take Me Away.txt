Together we stay,
Together we die,
For there is no tomorrow,
No sunrise that will shine.
These days seem cold,
Feeling lifeless,
Felling hopeless...
Please,
Just take me away.
Take me away,
take me away...
All I've done is suffer,
and fell the knife of life,
stab me on my back.
making it's mark on my skin.
There's no reason for me
to be here. So please, just
take me away.
Take me away.
Take me away...
