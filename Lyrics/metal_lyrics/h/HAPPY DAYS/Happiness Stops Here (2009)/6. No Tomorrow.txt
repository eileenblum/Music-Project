Open these bleeding valves
Devour this world with my filth
Pollute the air you breathe
Pollute your eyes so you can see,
The reality of what this world has
become, this is the last sunrise.
So enjoy this false happiness,
because the is no tomorrow.
No tomorrow, Slit your final
vein, close your eyes, this is your
last day, make the most of it.
Don't be scared, don't be sad.
You were at your peak and you
lived your life. You served your
purpose. Death is calling your name
Let me lead you, just follow me.
I'm the voice in your head that's
telling you...
There is no tomorrow...
