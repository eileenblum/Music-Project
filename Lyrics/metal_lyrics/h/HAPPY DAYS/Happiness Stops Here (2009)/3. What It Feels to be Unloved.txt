Heart broken. cut me till my 
wounds reopen. Hate me till 
your heart turns black. Love me 
for the piece of shit scum I am. 
Let this circle of rage grow within 
you. I want you to hate me. I 
want to be unwanted. Seems 
like that's all I ever recieve from 
this disgusting human fucking race. 
All you humans are the same. All
talk but cant walk. Yur hatred 
is my remedy. It's what still keeps 
me alive. It's only benefitting me 
more and more. This whole world 
is shit. You will never know what 
it feels to be unloved. You will
never know! You are nothing.
We are nothing. Your family 
is nothing. Your thoughts are
nothing. Your life is nothing!
