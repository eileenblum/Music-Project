[originally by Life Neglected]I hate my father for what he did to her that night
I hate my mother for what she let out of her body
I hate them for what they created
I hate life, you hate life
You hate being here, you hate being one of us
Another weak mind, stuck to the decease called love
Stuck in it's poisonous, safe arms, you're decieved
You hate life, i hate life
After nine months it was too late
I entered, with open eyes I inhaled the filth called air
Hand in hand with my lungs they kept me alive
I hate life, you hate life
With dead eyes you watched her smile
It brought you life, she died
Isn't it beautiful?
You hate life, i hate life
