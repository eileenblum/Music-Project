Never have I seen such insolence
Playing with the fire of innocence
Unaware of the fate that awaits them
Say goodbye to your life of ignorance

Taste the flesh I crave
Feeding your remains to the monster of pain
See what you have done?
Now it's time to pay
Don't you dare feel ashamed...
Where was your remorse when I begged for you to stop?

The rest of you I'll slay
Eventually you will forget...
But when you shut the light and close your door
I will be there to slit your throat...

When you least expect it
When you feel the safest
I will be there to destroy everything you love
And leave you with nothing...
