With every step I take I'm closer to the flame
In hopes to cleanse my flesh from all the human stains
Sick from every plague
That tore open my veins
From all the loss of faith
My heart is gone today
Drink away my hope
I laugh while on the floor
And all the things we do
Is hurt each other for you

Living in the moment
Burning within the ashes
Of everything that's gone
Nothing can be done
Each day I live through this
And hope that things are bliss
But everything's the same
Why do I exist?

Defeated by the times
From every breath I take
If this was meant to be
How can we survive?
Sleeping in the streets
The future looks so bleak
Soon we'll all be here
This is what I fear...

Sleeping in the streets
The future looks so bleak
Soon we'll all be here
This is what I fear...
Children left for dead
Money owns the rest
Death will end our fate
Unable to escape

Sleeping in the streets
The future looks so bleak
Soon we'll all be here
This is what I fear
And the same question always appears
Will we make it?
