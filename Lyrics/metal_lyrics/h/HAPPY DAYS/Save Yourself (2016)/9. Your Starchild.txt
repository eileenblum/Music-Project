Stepping on the ashes of those that never made it
How can I be the only one left?
With nothing left to hope for
With ever step I suffer
After all these years somehow I'm still here
Dead inside I see no reason to stop
Each wound a reminder of all the horror I've seen
Of where I have been
Of what I have become...

Children eat their own flesh just to survive
As we continue declining
No one will mourn the day when we are all gone...

Never to fulfill what the world expects of me
And you scream confessions of all the jealous truths
Of the life I never had
A friendly reminder of things I can't achieve
A friendly reminder of things I will never be...
