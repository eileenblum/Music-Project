Can you feel your heart begin to race?
At the thought of seeing each other again
Do you still have my scent attached to your skin?
From the endless tides of emotions
Devour every moment
I yearn for your very existence
To feel your warmth once more...

A line that seperates the entrance
I speak to the night crawlers to propose an offer
My life for your presence
My life to be taken
To feel your touch again
Nothing even comes close
Such love you've given me
And within seconds your touch is felt
I embrace the beauty that holds me
