Hate towards the masses
Bodies burn to ashes
Hiding from the shadows
Scared of what will happen
Trapped within the corner
Caged inside I'm hopeless...

What have I done to deserve this?
What can I do to fix my mistake?

Facing my own demons
Breaking every promise
Losing all my friendships
Ruining my own life

Isn't it wonderful to know that it's too late
Seeing shadows everywhere
I never stood a chance...

I embrace the black abyss
I have suffered long enough
All my regrets don't matter now
I welcome the reaper...
