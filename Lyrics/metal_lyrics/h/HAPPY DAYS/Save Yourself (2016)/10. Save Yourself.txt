I am drowning in fear
From these modern times
No longer able to survive
Dreading the moment when they finally come to kill me...

In the hole you go
Where promised words are lost
Down the drain below
Where all my dreams have gone
It all leads to this
Dreadful black abyss
The pain I have dismissed
Nothing left but bliss...

And you beg for deliverance
You reach out for anything
Just to feel a small dose of relief
Instead you're left behind...

No one cares...
No one is there...
