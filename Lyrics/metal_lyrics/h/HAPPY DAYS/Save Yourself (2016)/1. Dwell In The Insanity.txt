Unveil the curtain of uncertainty
Cast out the first born son
Consumed by the hate of ferocity
As my life remains undone
The path I dwell in was meant for me
Unable to change its course
I drown my sorrows in the wretched sea
Before the pain gets worst...

Losing what's left of such reveries
Extracting my final thoughts
Watching the world fall to travesty
Helpless I choke and breathe
Wanting to achieve total apathy
To avoid the shame of despondency
Cities crash and burn from atrocities
Nothing left for me but agony...

Walking through these empty streets
I feel the dread of all...
Where they once have stood in the past
Is now a haunting hall
The rain resumes the endless stream
And piercing through each stone
It burns my flesh and rots my soul
My wounds reopen and bleed

Each day I wake and die inside
From all the things I've seen
I let the tides take over me
In hopes I cease to be
Too late to cure my ignorance
As I watch our species fall
Wishing to save what's left from this
Before we're dead and gone...

Nothing left for me but tragedies
Nothing left for me but everlasting suffering...

I hear their voices and all the anguish they feel
But it's too late for them to come alive
It's useless to try and fix the rest
All this time I believe that hope would shine
Yet I make the ruins as the void consumes my soul
And the silence remains eternally...
