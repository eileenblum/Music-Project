Welcome to your new life
That seems quaint doesn't it?
But do't feel fooled
It's meant to feel this way to numb the pain
For your aspirations
Are merely weak against your own addition
Can you feel your eyes bleed?
You hope to never live another night again...

We pray to be saved as we rot and decay
Yet the angels never came
You look into their eyes as you watch them all die
And their children will cease to be
Each building is trashed and the windows are smashed
Yet you walk along the path
Inside these old walls is where we all seem to fall
And the dying screeches remain...

Why do I do this to myself?
I am a slave to my own weakness
Why do bad things feel so good?
I can't control my life or my temptations
I am on my knees
To see if maybe something will change

Chaos, sadness
Relinquish your feelings that shift your decision

Hopeless, madness
Accept what is real and embrace the downfall

Useless, coldness
Abandon your emotions and escape to your death

Heartless, darkness
Cover your eyes to escape your own pain

Gutless, helpless
Having no shame when your carve out your eyes

Formless, dreamless
Knowing full well that your dead deep inside...
