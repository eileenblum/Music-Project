After everything....It still doesnt matter...
After all of my sacrifices....It still doesnt change....
Time just repeats itself....
Or At least it feels like it....
You can try to make things perfect.....
But youre better off climbing the endless staircase....
Things that are meant to be broken.....can never be fixed....
The more time you waste...the more it hurts....
But instead you keep going.....
The indenial stage can be very powerful....
As powerful as any drug that causes conflict to the mind....
It's finally over....
Nothing left to live for...
Staring at the pool of razorblades....
As it invites you more and more towards it......
The Suffering has only just begun....
