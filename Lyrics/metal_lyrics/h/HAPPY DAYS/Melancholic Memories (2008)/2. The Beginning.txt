All that I can hear are my own screams....
But no one listens.....
I slit my wrists.....
a cry for help....
But no one cares.....
Feeling alone with nothing to hold onto....
No shoulder to cry on.....
No one to run to....
These endless tears continue to shed......
To a point where nothing but blood descends from my eyelids.....
I still wait for my death to finally come....
I cant breathe...
This overwhelming depression that i hold....
Will never leave me....
It will forever huant me with my temporary states of Euphoria...
These days seem to go by slower and slower...
It acts just like....
