[performed by Happy Days]Deceiving the world through smiles and grins
Not knowing what goes on from within
Countless thoughts that race through the mind
The mental struggle that leaves one blind
Pretty soon I wont be alive...

Forsaking the skin that wont stop bleeding
Much of it has lost all meaning
Severing the rest of the pulsating veins
No longer feeling life's torment and pain. 

Free from the shackles that held you down 
Hearing myself from a distant sound
Salvation is the only way...
Into the ashes your whole ad free
As you shove the blade vein deep
Say good bye to those who weep
What a beautiful pathetic being...
