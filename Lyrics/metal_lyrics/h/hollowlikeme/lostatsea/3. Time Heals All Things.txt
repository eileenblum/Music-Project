I won't stand still
And I can't wait
I'll make my dreams a reality

This feeling in my throat
Make it go away
It'll be a long time
Before I feel ok
Time heals all things
But the void you left
Will always stay
I need to wake up
I need to wake up
From this disturbing dream
Before I let my noted past
Catch up to me

A glimpse of light
Gives the weakest man
Something to cling to
Imagining the perfect image
Of what I've made of you
I am holding on to you
I'm holding on to you
Through the depths I've created
Though I put myself here
I know I can make it out

[Chorus:]
I can't just sit and watch myself
Drown in my own mistakes
Something has to change
This pain has to go away
As deep as my scars run
I know time can heal everything
Once I've learned who I am inside
I can rise up

I am holding on
To the memories
And the dreams
And all the times I've reached out
I will make you know
That I'm here until the end
This tension pulls me closer
To the fall
Losing all feeling
I don't regret
I simple live
This wasn't something I've learned
It's something we all have to face
Through the depths I've created
Though I know I put myself here
I know I can make it out

[Chorus:]
I can't just sit and watch myself
Drown in my own mistakes
Something has to change
This pain has to go away
As deep as my scars run
I know time can heal everything
Once I've learned who I am inside
I can rise up

Let me live my life
I can move on
