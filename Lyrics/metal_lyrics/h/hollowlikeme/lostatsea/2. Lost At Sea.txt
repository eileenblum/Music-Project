Wading through the waters
Of the lost and the scared
Searching for a reason
To reunite with the damned
I'm lost like all of them
No shoreline in sight
Where am I now?
I've lost all sense of time
I couldn't be less aware
Now you're searching for
That message in a bottle

It's so much easier to give in
To just drown in it all
The waves tower over me
In this desolate storm
And I've got no way out
Of this mess I've made.

Despair starts to take its hold
I clench my fists
And drunken madness
Is all that I have
Leading me to the grave
And I'm the one
That carelessly follows
It's like I'm lost at sea
Lost in the sea
Of my own fucking mind
I'm desperately trying
To keep my head above water
While constantly drowning
In the lies of the hypocrites
That surround me
What is the point of it all?

[Chorus:]
Alone with me, myself, and I
There's nobody here to hear my cry
Bide my time, close your eyes
All hope seems so lost
And I'm searching for that light
And I can survive
The taste of salt I'll never forget
Here, there's nothing
That I can regret

The undertow drags me through
My lungs are filled with water
There is no eye to this storm
I've got to hold my own

[Chorus:]
Alone with me, myself, and I
There's nobody here to hear my cry
Bide my time, close your eyes
All hope seems so lost
And I'm searching for that light
And I can survive
The taste of salt I'll never forget
There's nothing that I can regret

The storm is coming
Fuck
