Blinded sights of altered vision Corresponds to self deception
I haven't proved anything
To make this worth while
I'm dropping to my knees screaming
"This is my life"
Pulling every ounce of blood
Taking the sanity of a boy
Who once believed in everything
Has everything already happened?

Deterring sights
In the wrong direction
Judgement placed in opposition
Take this picture
Insanity holds its grips within
Its memory of a lifetime

[2x:]
Collapse the lungs
Twist the bones
Destroy my heart
There's always a way out

[Chorus:]
Piecing back together
My tattered and broken mind
I will stop at nothing
To capture my sanity
My lips part but no words come out
Even when I think I've lost it all
I can still hold strong

You've guided me so high
To just bring me down
Even perfectionists have their flaws
That doesn't mean I'll have mine
Ha-ha-ha-ha

The will to fight is no more
It's been lost in the abyss
Of my mind
???
You've never looked so beautiful
You need to know
That you are beautiful

[Chorus:]
Piecing back together
My tattered and broken mind
I will stop at nothing
To capture my sanity
My lips part but no words come out
Even when I think I've lost it all
I can still hold strong

It's getting inside my head
It's in my head
I'll rip it out
Get out

Get out of my head

The devil loves his company
And so do I
We'll paint this picture of a dream
We have fore sought to see
It's given up more
Than my own properties
Within my own mind

[Chorus:]
Piecing back together
My tattered and broken mind
I will stop at nothing
To capture my sanity
My lips part but no words come out
Even when I think I've lost it all
I can still hold strong
