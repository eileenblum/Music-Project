You keep trying to get under our skin
We'll dig you out with a scalpel
Like the parasite you are
We put our faith in too much
So it's so fickle and so weak
Hoping and searching
For the will to move on
Go ahead and tear us down
With every word you speak
It brings us up
And up we won't back down
From the likes of you
You're the last thought
Inside our minds
Keep dreaming
I won't be the one
That falls this time

Speak your mind
Cause we sure as hell
Will do the same
Fuck you and everything
That you stand for
Don't pretend you can live our lives

[Chorus:]
Why do I let you build me up?
When I know you'll just tear me down
I should know by now
That there is nothing
Left to prove to you
I've got a mind of my own
A heart of my own
To do with what I please
Untangle your web of lies
That's so clearly tying me down

I've been told to be someone else
To abandon my dreams
And lose my mind
All these years I've tried
To find myself
And finally know who I am

(Tell me why)
(I haven't felt this way before)
(I can't help but feel)
(Like you're in my way)
(I never said you could stay)
(When I wake I hope you're gone)

There is no spell
And no pill that can change you
If they can't love you
For who you are
Then they don't deserve you
So burn those bridges down
Draw the flame

[Chorus:]
Why do I let you build me up?
When I know you'll just tear me down
I should know by now
That there is nothing
Left to prove to you
I've got a mind of my own
A heart of my own
To do with what I please
Untangle your web of lies
That's so clearly tying me down
