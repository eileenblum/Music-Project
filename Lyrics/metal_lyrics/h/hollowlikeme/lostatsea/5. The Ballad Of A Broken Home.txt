Up to your throat in obscenities 
Swimming in a sestpool 
Of his filthy fucking lies 
It'll take a lot to pull you out 
But I've at least got to try 

His words fall on deaf ears 
They suck the joy from your life 
He thinks he's got all the answers 
But not this time 

[Chorus:] 
Go ahead 
And make fun of somebody's son 
That's afraid to go home today 
Take his change 
Call him names 
T'hats the least of his concerns 
Have you ever wondered 
Why he's so quiet? 
Speaking up at home 
Makes him a fool and a liar 

Show us your true colors 
And quit playing your fucking games 
Leave your mask behind 
I've never once seen your true face 
Even actors drop their character 
When they walk off the stage 
Drop your act 
You're not fooling anyone 
I hate your guts 
You're going to loose your only sons 

[Chorus:] 
Go ahead 
And make fun of somebody's son 
That's afraid to go home today 
Take his change 
Call him names 
T'hats the least of his concerns 
Have you ever wondered 
Why he's so quiet? 
Speaking up at home 
Makes him a fool and a liar 

I've watched his promises fall apart 
No surprises from here on out 
When I see you 
In the same place as me 
I can't help 
But could've done this sooner 

Lift your chin up and rest easy 
I'm by your side 

[Chorus:] 
Go ahead 
And make fun of somebody's son 
That's afraid to go home today 
Take his change 
Call him names 
T'hats the least of his concerns 
Have you ever wondered 
Why he's so quiet? 
Speaking up at home 
Makes him a fool and a liar 

[4x:] 
A fool and a liar
