Ahh 
Bweah 

These binds that hold me down 
I am trapped in a false existence 
This World is full of lies 
It's impossible to live in peace 

Explode 
The spirits are rising this way 
Awakening 
No, you won't 
You won't take this away 
They're pulling the skin 
Straight from my bones 
I can fill it ripping 
Tearing away from me 

[Chorus:] 
You've taken everything 
And left me lying on the floor 
(I have nothing left) 
(This was all I had) 
Your empty promises 
Keep me searching for more 
(I won't keep this down) 
(And I will find a way out) 
I can't believe you tried 
You tried to bring me down 
(You tried oh so hard) 
(But you wont stop me now) 
You mean nothing to me 
I will put you in the ground 

Take the filth you spew 
Take the lies you've shed 
Rip your life away 
From the face of existence 
Rip you fucking life away 
And take your shame with you 
I won't be the one to help you up 
I won't give a fuck 

I won't give a fuck 

This world is full of lies 
It's impossible to live in peace 

[Chorus:] 
You've taken everything 
And left me lying on the floor 
(I have nothing left) 
(This was all I had) 
Your empty promises 
Keep me searching for more 
(I won't keep this down) 
(And I will find a way out) 
I can't believe you tried 
You tried to bring me down 
(You tried oh so hard) 
(But you wont stop me now) 
You mean nothing to me 
I will put you in the ground 
In the fucking ground
