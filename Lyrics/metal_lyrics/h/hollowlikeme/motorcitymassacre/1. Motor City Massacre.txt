We'll send your walls crumbling 
Down upon you all 
We came to your city 
It was pretty fucking shitty 
Eight miles of "who the fuck cares" 

You are pathetic and useless 
Just an act to fill up the night 
I can't understand your reasoning 
Justifying you to pick this fight 

You're just a waste of their time 
You're just wasting our time 

[Chorus:] 
Wo-o-o-o-oh 
I bet you never saw this coming 
So pick your jaw up off the floor 
Hold the fuck up 
Cause we're not done 
We've got plenty more 
Tie your nooses 
And carve your caskets 
There's a burial in store 

We didn't even start this shit 
But we'll lay it the fuck to rest 
Fuck you 

What makes you so much better than us 
You wouldn't last a day 
Shut the fuck up 
And enjoy the show 

Hell yeah, we're talking shit 
Because haters make us famous 
A-ha 

Fuck you and your bullshit posse 
We fucking run this shit 

[Chorus:] 
Wo-o-o-o-oh 
I bet you never saw this coming 
So pick your jaw up off the floor 
Hold the fuck up 
Cause we're not done 
We've got plenty more 
Tie your nooses 
And carve your caskets 
There's a burial in store 

We didn't even start this shit 
But we'll lay it the fuck to rest 

Keep running your mouth 
And we'll keep shutting you up 
Your words are empty 
And so are your shows 
So step up or shut the fuck up 
Eah 

Get fucked 

We'll send your walls crumbling 
Down upon you all 
We came to your city 
It was pretty fucking shitty 
Eight miles of "who the fuck cares" 

[Chorus:] 
Wo-o-o-o-oh 
I bet you never saw this coming 
So pick your jaw up off the floor 
Hold the fuck up 
Cause we're not done 
We've got plenty more 
Tie your nooses 
And carve your caskets 
There's a burial in store 

We didn't even start this shit 
But we'll lay it the fuck to rest 

Take your ball and go the fuck home 
You picked a fight 
With the motherfucking all-stars
