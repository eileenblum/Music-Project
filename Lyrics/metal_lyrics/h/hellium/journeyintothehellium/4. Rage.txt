[Verse I]
Liar, fucking liar!
Remember what you did
You know you can't deny it
You're implied
All this rage inside me
To a boiling point
That I can't control

[Verse II]
Madness filled with hate
Now's just to late
To run and hide
You better have some pride
Stand up and fight!

[Chorus]
You'll meet your end
Can't forget
All the pain you put me through
Face the truth
You're to blame
Imprisoning me

[Verse II]
Hatred fuel for hatred
I can't believe I thought
You won't betray me
Perpetuated
Fear, anger and pain
I will prevail!

[Chorus]
You'll meet your end
Can't forget
All the pain you put me through
Face the truth
You're to blame
Imprisoning me
