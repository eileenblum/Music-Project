[Verse I]
No more tears of anger 
No more tears of hate 
Even though I've got a chance 
You know it's just too late 

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta end this madness 
Got to end this pain 
Maybe fooling everyone 
But am I fooling me? 

[Chorus]
Lying to friends 
Lying to strangers 
Lying to elders 
Lying to yourself 

[Verse III]
Livin' down life spirals 
Bigger by the day 
Silent suffering in the night 
There's no one I can pray 

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta end this madness 
Got to end this pain 
Maybe fooling everyone 
But am I fooling me? 

[Chorus]
Lying to friends 
Lying to strangers 
Lying to elders 
Lying to yourself 

[Interlude: ]
"I don't wanna lie, it's just that.. I don't know how to find a way out, how to end this misery, maybe there's a solution... maybe not... I just want some peace of mind"

[Verse IV]
Livin' in this darkness 
Put myself to test!

[Pre-Chorus]
His is birth for violence 
No room for regret 
Maybe fooling everyone 
Am I fooling me? 

[Chorus]
Lying to friends 
Lying to strangers 
Lying to elders 
Lying to yourself 

Dig a hole and dive in it 
Lying to children 
Lying to friends 

Lying your lover 
Keep her deceived 
Lying your elders 
They just can't feel it 

Lying to friends 
Lying to strangers 
Lying to elders 
Lying to yourself 

Lying your lover 
Keep her deceived 
Lying your elders 
They just can't feel it 

Lying to friends 
Lying to strangers 
Lying to elders 
Lying to yourself!
