[Verse I]
In this land you'll cry
In this night you'll fight
Give up! Your soul is mine

[Verse II]
Now! You're my puppet
Return from whence you came
You must do as I told
Be sure to spread my word
Create a brotherhood

[Verse III]
In disguise you crawl
With their minds you'll play
All of them will fall
At my feet they'll kneel
Corrupt them with hate
Make them slaves of pain
Senseless they'll became
Victims of fate!

[Chorus]
Slaying their hopes and dreams
They just got no escape
You better believe what I say
Under my spell without trust nor regret
They'll follow me to death

[Verse IV]
Now they're my puppets
Without free will nor pain
They do as I command
No one can stop me now
The world as you know it's gone

[Verse V]
In disguise you crawl
With their minds you'll play
All of them will fall
At my feet they'll kneel
Corrupt them with hate
Make them slaves of pain
Senseless they'll became
Victims of fate!

[Chorus]
Slaying their hopes and dreams
They just got no escape
You better believe what I say
Under my spell without trust nor regret
They'll follow me to death (x2)

[Outro]
Come with me
I'll promise you never regret
The world is mine and so are they
My time has come and you'll be by my side
Is this what you wanted, right?
