[Verse I]
Down in the valley of damned 
You'll see life's just a fiction 
The real one's in flames 

[Verse II]
Die a few seconds 
And travel to the unknown 
Stay just a minute in hell 

[Pre-Chorus]
Here is the truth 
You'll perish and you'll be here soon 

[Chorus]
Don't be afraid 
This is the Other Side 
Your so called "Life" 
It's just a dream 
Come to the other side 
And reborn for me 

[Verse III]
One step behind me 
Beyond the old mirror 
Great demons await you to come

[Pre-Chorus]
Here is the truth 
You'll perish and you'll be here soon 

[Chorus]
Don't be afraid 
This is the Other Side 
Your so called "Life" 
It's just a dream 
Come to the other side 
And reborn for me
