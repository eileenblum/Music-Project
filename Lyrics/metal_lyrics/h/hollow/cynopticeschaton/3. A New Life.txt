Rise of the carnage,
Price for all knowledge,
Strife, everlasting,
Dawn of a new age.

Since the beginning of time, man has fought his peers.
Discovery of fire light, a flint is all we need.

Evolution endowed us with the gift of speech,
But fast are we to use our tongue and decimate the weak.

Science came through for our race, and changed the way we live,
Science came through for our wars, plutonium was the key.

One day, as it was foretold, a child will come to be,
From our mother GaÃ¯a's womb, and set the people free.

Freed from all they endured,
A new life awaits thee all.

A new life awaits thee all,
A new life awaits.

Rise of the carnage,
Price for all knowledge,
Strife, everlasting,
Dawn of a new age.

Freed from all they endured,
A new life awaits thee all.

A new life awaits thee all,
A new life awaits.

Rise of the carnage,
Dawn of a new age.
