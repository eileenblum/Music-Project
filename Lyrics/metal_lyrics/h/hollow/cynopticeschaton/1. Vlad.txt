Sold as a slave, the prince returned, brave,
Starring down at his father's grave,
Crying revenge!

Raise our banners high,
Feed them fear and sorrow,
Desecrate the earth and father it with horror.

Raise our banners high,
Feed them fear and sorrow,
Desecrate the earth and father it with horror.

Twenty thousand dead, forest of the impaled,
Savage king ruled with and iron hand,
Prosperity!

Raise our banners high,
Feed them fear and sorrow,
Desecrate the earth and father it with horror.

Drink the blood of life,
Let crows feast on the morrow,
Let your bodies die and glory fill the hollow.

Raise our banners high,
Feed them fear and sorrow,
Desecrate the earth and father it with horror.

Drink the blood of life,
Let crows feast on the morrow,
Let your bodies die and glory fill the hollow.
