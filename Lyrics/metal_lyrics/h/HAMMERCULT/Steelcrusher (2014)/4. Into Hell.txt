ARIOCH!!

I fall into the spell,
my body twitches flail
My mind is letting go
I follow the path and places that I've never known

I reach into the black
and never looking back
My soul and spirit dwell
I'm heeding the pack; I summon you to the duke of Hell

I'm heeding the pack; I summon you to the duke of Hell

All hail the beast Inferno
All hail the fire king

I rise from ruins
Into the black I dive
Hail my new master
The spell swords shall be mine

As I dive INTO HELL
As I dive

Enter the shading gate
Enraged with burning hate
And hack your way with Steel
Urging my fate and destiny to be revealed

Into the pulsing cave
and to an early grave
Yet I'm reborn again
Stormbringer song of battle echoes in my brain

Yes, I feel her power rushing through my veins

All hail the beast Inferno
All hail the fire king

I rule the runesword, into the black I ride
Reborn in fire, stormbringer by my side
She bears my sorrow; she is my weakness and my strength
I feel her power, her magic runs deep through my veins

As I dive INTO HELL
As I dive

INTO HELL
INTO HELL
INTO HELL
INTO HELL

Facing my fate in terror
I'm one with the black blade

I fall into my doom
into a life of gloom
My mind is letting go
I follow the path and places that I've never known

Within the pulsing cave
I found my early grave
Into a new life I dwell
Forever to serve my master am the sword of spells

Oh, how deep is my hate for you, the duke of Hell

ARIOCH!!

I rule the runesword, into the black I ride
Reborn in fire, stormbringer by my side
She bears my sorrow; she is my weakness and my strength
I feel her power, her magic runs deep through my veins

As I dive INTO HELL
As I dive

INTO HELL
INTO HELL
INTO HELL
INTO HELL!!
