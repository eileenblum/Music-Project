Born out of angst, you're embroiling just for fun
You Lie for nothing while you mess with everyone
You thrive on bullshit and you sell it by the pound
I'll get you cornered, no, I do not fuck around

OBEY THE LAW
I AM INVINCIBLE!
I PREY ON LIES
FOREVER STANDING TALL!

I'll rise to see you fall

I do not give a shit; you're a fucking waste of skin
Now or later, in the end you're going to learn - I win!
Closed fists will make you humble; paint your face in red
Bust new holes in your anus and in your face

I paint your portrait sitting on the toilet seat
Yes, pun intended, you're an asshole full of shit
You've got a big mouth and it's spitting ruthless Lies
I'm going to shout it as I piss on your demise

I deal with pain
Your Lies in vain

OBEY THE LAW
I AM INVINCIBLE!
I PREY ON LIES
FOREVER STANDING TALL!

I'll rise to see you fall

I do not give a shit; you're a fucking waste of skin
Now or later, in the end you're going to learn - I win!
Closed fists will make you humble; paint your face in red
Bust new holes in your anus and in your face

You're a cock sucking Liar,
I'll rip your fucking face
Pucker up motherfucker,
kiss my ass

I'll make you humble - Closed fists will make you humble
I'll make you mad - Paint your face in red
'Cause you're a Liar - Bust new holes in your anus
So just drop dead - And in your face
