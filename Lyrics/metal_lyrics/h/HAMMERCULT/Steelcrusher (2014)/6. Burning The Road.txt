BURNING THE ROAD!!

BURNING THE ROAD!!

Full throttle with vengeance
on a beast made of steel,
my soul is on fire
MONSTER ON TWO WHEELS

The tires are Burning
like the flames in my eyes,
the engine is screaming
AS THE METERS RISE

AS THE MOTHERFUCKING METERS RISE

GEAR UP
FOR WAR
I'm coming back for more

Ride out for vengeance
Rise up in pain
Light up the fire
Burning The Road

Ride out for vengeance
Rise up in pain
Light up the fire
Burning The Road

BURNING THE ROAD!!

BURNING THE ROAD!!

No remorse in my heart
and the fuel is my hate,
I bring torment eternal
I'M DEATH INCARNATE

Spreading blood on the rails,
rusted crimson in sight
and the vision compels me
I'M ONE WITH THE NIGHT

For I bring the end of light
Yes, I ride with death tonight

GEAR UP
FOR WAR
I'm coming back for more

GEAR UP
FOR WAR
I'm coming back for more

Ride out for vengeance
Rise up in pain
Light up the fire
Burning The Road

Ride out for vengeance
Rise up in pain
Light up the fire
Burning The Road

Full throttle with vengeance
On a beast made of steel
My soul is on fire

The tires are Burning
Like the flames in my eyes
The engine is screaming

As I Burn The Road tonight

Burning The Road

BURN!!
