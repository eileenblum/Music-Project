Join us, start the riot, let the party begin
Fuck 'em; fuck the bastards, now it's time for the People to reign
It's the dawn of destruction; we're the sons of decay
No more lies, we're not blind and we're sick of the bullshit you say

MARCHING
THROUGH THE STREETS
WE HAVE AWAKEN
AND WE WILL ARISE

Taking control, Metal 'til dawn
WE ARE THE CURE AND WE'RE BURNING THIS TOWN
Ready to fight, let us unite
WE ARE THE PEOPLE tonight!!

Bring it, we are ready, we are ready to die
Martyrs, not for money nor for God but for our way of life
No escape from the madness, drink our way into Hell
Grab a bottle, bottoms up, let us serve them a Molotov cup

MARCHING
THROUGH THE STREETS
WE HAVE AWAKEN
AND WE WILL ARISE

Taking control, Metal 'til dawn
WE ARE THE CURE AND WE'RE BURNING THIS TOWN
Ready to fight, let us unite
WE ARE THE PEOPLE tonight!!

Rules are meant to be broken;
Laws are made for the weak
There's no chance we are losing
'Cause we're ready to die

Taking control, Metal 'til dawn
WE ARE THE CURE AND WE'RE BURNING THIS TOWN
Ready to fight, let us unite
WE ARE THE PEOPLE tonight!!

The People arise, hate in our eyes
TAKEN BY FORCE AND PAY FOR YOUR LIES!
Ready to fight, let us unite
WE ARE THE PEOPLE tonight!!
