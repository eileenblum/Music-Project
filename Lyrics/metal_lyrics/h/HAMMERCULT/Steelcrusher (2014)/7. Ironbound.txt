Show them no mercy; strike them with fear, spirits of the brave
Riding to glory, willing to die, laughing to the grave
United by Metal, blessed by Steel, skulls smashed on our way
Praised be thy Hammer, never defy, the gods decide this day

RUINS in fire,
SERVANTS defiled
IRON is on our side

BODIES lay broken,
BANNERS held high
VENGENCE for those who died

Hymn To The Steel
Splendor of magic and might
Stained in blood
Anguish for all those who died

Iron will
Forged within fire and ice
With our names
We are the cursed - Ironbound

We're Ironbound

Wrath in my voice and hate in my eyes, I have more blood to spill
Blessed the creed, oath of the wolf tribe, hungry for the kill
The scars on my body, adorned on my flesh, a small price to pay
Living for honor, slay for the truth, born to die on this day

RUINS in fire,
SERVANTS defiled
IRON is on our side

BODIES lay broken,
BANNERS held high
VENGENCE for those who died

Hymn To The Steel
Splendor of magic and might
Stained in blood
Anguish for all those who died

Iron will
Forged within fire and ice
With our names
We are the cursed - Ironbound

Into the fire, killing as one, soaring on command
Sound of the trumpet, screaming with hate, make our final stand
The blade knows no mercy, killing in sight, cutting to the bone
Righteous and holy, Restless And Wild, the Iron takes its toll

BURN IN HELL

OR DIE AS A KING

United by Metal, blessed by Steel, skulls smashed on our way
Praised be thy Hammer, never defy, the gods decide this day

Hymn To The Steel
Splendor of magic and might
Stained in blood
Anguish for all those who died

Iron will
Forged within fire and ice
With our names
We are the cursed - Ironbound
