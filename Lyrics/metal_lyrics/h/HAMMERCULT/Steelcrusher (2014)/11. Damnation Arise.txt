Riding the winds of Damnation, storming the tides for revenge
Unleashing the wrath of the spirits, raising their cry from the grave
Awaken the beasts of destruction, hungry to kill on command
May destiny lead us to battle; we've taken the oath of the Damned

No one escapes the Metalstorm

The fire rages the sky
The heavens are burning divine
The fates and the furies are mine
Winds of Damnation Arise

Trampled those who denied us, crushed by the Hammer of war
For no God can challenge the wicked and no man can outstand the storm
Your head will ride on my banners; thy carcass will be dragged in the mud
The crows will feat on your flesh and dogs will be licking your blood

Damnation
Into the storm

Wrath of the tempest maligned
Enraged by the hatred divine
The spirit of vengeance is mine
The skull and the Hammers - my guide
By fate and by fury we ride
Winds of Damnation Arise

I swear this oath of blood
To tear your soul to pieces
The wind carries my cry
Thirsting for revenge

Inferno arise from the Hellstorm, scorching the fields of the kill
Nothing remains from the slaughter, this token of vengeance fulfilled
The fire will burn on forever with flames of hatred and will
We slay for the glory of Metal, for we are the bastards of Steel

No one escapes the Metalstorm

Wrath of the tempest maligned
Enraged by the hatred divine
The spirit of vengeance is mine
The skull and the Hammers - my guide
By fate and by fury we ride
Winds of Damnation Arise
