Riders on the storm
Through hail and fire
Heading forth For War
Stronger than before

Hatred in our hearts
Bloodshed and slaughter
Violence and force
There is no remorse

Take mortal lives, may death arise
The crimson flaws and may it never dry
Take mortal lives, may death arise
The crimson flaws and may it never dry

May the Fallen behind us
Lead our way tonight
Death in glorious battle
On this day we die

As the sound of horns
Turns into sirens
Say your prayers and mourn
Ready to be torn

Ramming down the gates
There is no mercy
Revel in their pain
Pleading in vain

Take mortal lives, may death arise
The crimson flaws and may it never dry
Take mortal lives, may death arise
The crimson flaws and may it never dry

In The Name Of The Fallen
Set them all aflame
As we rise from the darkness
They will curse our names

Clashing iron and fire
Sate my steel with hate
Let us crush the deceivers
As we seal their fates

Splendor of bloodshed and death

Riders on the storm
Through hail and fire
Heading forth For War
Stronger than before

In The Name Of The Fallen
Set them all aflame
As we rise from the darkness
They will curse our names

Clashing iron and fire
Sate my steel with hate
Let us crush the deceivers
As we seal their fates

Riders on the storm
Through hail and fire
Heading forth For War
Stronger than before

Splendor of bloodshed and death
