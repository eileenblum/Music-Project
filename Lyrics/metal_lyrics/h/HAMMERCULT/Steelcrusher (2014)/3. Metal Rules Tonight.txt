FUCK YEAH!

Have a beer to kill the pain
Bang your head, bash your brains
Brothers shout the ancient call
"WE'RE FUCKED UP ON ALCOHOL!!"

I'm so wasted I can't stand
Grab a pussy, get some head
Speakers blasting through the hall
MASTER OF PUPPETS AND BALLS TO THE WALL!!

IT'S OUR termination!!
JOIN OUR revelation!!
WE ARE the Metal nation!!
THIS IS intoxication!!

This is the sound of rebellion
Forged in the fires of Hell
Stronger than faith and religion
Fuck 'em all

Metal Rules Tonight

Metal Rules TONIGHT!

METAL RULES!

All for one and one for all
Wimps And Posers - Leave The Hall
A shot of whiskey, one more beer
WINE IS FOR POSERS, EMOS AND QUEERS!!

Drawn into the fire

Burn in flames of lust

BANG YOUR HEAD IN FULL CONVICTION!
RAISE YOUR FISTS AND SHOW THE HORNS!
NO REMORSE OR LAMENTATION!
PLAY IT LOUD

OR DIE!

METAL RULES TONIGHT!
Metal Rules Tonight

METAL RULES!

Trends will come and fade away
Heavy Metal is here to stay
We are Damned but we are free
IT'S OUR WAY OF LIFE, THE WAY IT SHOULD BE!!

Metal!
