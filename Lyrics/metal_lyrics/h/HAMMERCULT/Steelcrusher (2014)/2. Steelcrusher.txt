Stench fills the air, a putrid smell of death
He thrives on terror and bloodshed in his path
Blood stains the fields, drops like pouring rain
I am the master of torment and of pain

Burning Hammers SMASH YOUR FACE
Sharp edge razors kiss your flesh TO SHREDS
Bloodstained bodies HIT THE GROUND
Scattered armor all around

Steelcrusher!!

Flee for your life
From me you cannot hide
Pounding inferno
On winds of Hell I ride

Burning Hammers SMASH YOUR FACE
Sharp edge razors kiss your flesh TO SHREDS
Bloodstained bodies HIT THE GROUND
Scattered armor all around

Steelcrusher

Bone and rust grinded to dust
Flesh and steel conquered by will

Conquered by will!!

Cries fill the mist, hear the smashing Steel
There is no mercy and more blood must be spilled
Rust stinks the air, a putrid smell of death
Both flesh and iron are rotting in his path

Burning Hammers SMASH YOUR FACE
Sharp edge razors kiss your flesh TO SHREDS
Bloodstained bodies HIT THE GROUND
Scattered armor all around

Steelcrusher
