Infamous with no morality
No direction left to sway
Bastards of society
Manifesting misery

Bashing rules and no remorse
Again we strike with a brutal force
It's not for the faint of heart
This is the Unholy Art

True freedom lies

Unholy Art

Empty with scattered density
Perfect but incomplete
Molders of atrocity
Nothing but pure ecstasy

The blackest hearts and darkest minds
You never know just what you will find
It's not for the faint of heart
This is the Unholy Art

Dishonored, a branded kind
The masses will burn in the flames of our pride
We'll rise to our own blackened skies
And devour the worlds and we're starting tonight

Force fed and full of sympathy
Thriving on our ignorance
Hunger killed by gluttony
Freedom raped by slavery

Lift the veil that leaves you blind
Because now it's time to choose your side
It's not for the faint of heart
This is the Unholy Art

UNHOLY ART!

Infamous with no morality
No direction left to sway
Bastards of society
Manifesting misery

The blackest hearts and darkest minds
You never know just what you will find
It's not for the faint of heart
This is the Unholy Art

Dishonored, a branded kind
The masses will burn in the flames of our pride
We'll rise to our own blackened skies
And devour the worlds and we're starting tonight
