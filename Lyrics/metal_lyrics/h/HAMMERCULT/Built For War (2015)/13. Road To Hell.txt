Like a plague infecting minds
But this time you know it's wrong
It's your place in a world you know what's true
And money is a virtue

The terror, our error
Their machine is your surrender
I'm the one riding down
To kill everything in my path

Destruction within, I'm burning stronger
Ail that I am is taking me back to the

Road to hell
I'm burning down the world behind me
Road to hell
Yes, I'm burning down, burning down

Face the facts
There is a chance that all you knew is lost
Tooth and nail, cause the fight is never through
And 'til give it all to break you

Black flag in my eyes
I'm coming to take you down
On wheels of destruction
My dark horse is hell-bound
