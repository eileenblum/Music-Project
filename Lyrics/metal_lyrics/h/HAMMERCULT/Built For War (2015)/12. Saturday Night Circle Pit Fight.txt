Human tornado spinning with might
Swirling disaster burning the night
Bodies are clashing, better prepare
Sweat pours like water, fists w the air

Going insane, brothers are moshing tonight
A ritual of pain, power and sonic delight

Can I get a "hell yeah"
Can I get an "alright'
Let me see some action
Forget the rat race
You're in the right place
Saturday night circle pit fight

No mosh pit? No stage dive?
You got to be fucking kidding me?
Posing a boycott? No fucking way
You better fuck off, get ready to pay
