I feel the fire in my veins
Expect no warning, there is no second chance
So fly our banners as we ride
The beast awakens, it will not be denied

They're banging their heads
Unleashing inferno
So welcome my friends
Into the show

Hell, hell
Let's break some fucking necks
And live for one more night
Another town will burn
We're gonna raise some hell

Another city, fallen prey
The party is over, but I don't give a fuck
I know the story all too well
My soul's on fire, I wanna raise some hell

Nothing stands in my way
Cause I'm living for today
No one can stop me now
Hell, no

As long as blood runs in our veins
The party as never over
