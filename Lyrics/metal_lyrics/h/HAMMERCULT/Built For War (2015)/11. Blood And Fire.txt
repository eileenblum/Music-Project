Tempered by steel, torment and pain
Heart made of iron, tested again
Those who wont try surely will far
Fierce is the passion of those who prevail

Bets on the wheel
Taking a spin
Giving it all
Playing to win

The power of will
The strongest survives
The conquest of steel
For glory awaits
For those who live by blood and fire
Blood and fire

The voice of the wind calling your name
Rise to the challenge and conquer again
Life is like war, it's not meant to be fair
The victor, the spoils for those who will dare

The power of will
The strongest survives
The conquest oh steel
For glory awaits
My destiny's written by blood and fire
