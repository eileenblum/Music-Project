Burning, the will of my heart
Passion, desire and blood
Fast lanes, wind blows in my hair
The rubber is starting to char

Fire, flames in my eyes
I'm burning inside - I live to ride
Rage and power divine, ambition and pride

Let it roar
What are you living for?
This is all I know
Cause there's no return
I don't give a fuck

Yearning, I only live once
And die when I'm ready to go
Not yet! The voice of my soul
Screams what I already know

I'm living hard and I'm riding fast
An iron horse - I'm built to last
Push the engine, paddle to the floor
I feel the fire, I let it roar
