Ride - unleash our vengeance
The Hammers of decay are back again
To the bastards total death and endless pain
We reign - we reign in fire and there is a Hell to pay
No choice - the end is here for he who chose to stay

Hate within our eyes
Fire burns within our hearts
The flame that never dies
Ravaging your lies
For only havoc lefts behind
Above The Ruins We Ride

Blood - let the bloodshed rain in fields of carnage as we let it spread
While the battle rages on, our victory is at hand
I will have revenge and I will seal your fate
You cry, no bullshit will save you from my hate

Hate within our eyes
Fire burns within our hearts
The flame that never dies
Ravaging your lies
For only havoc lefts behind
Above The Ruins We Ride

This is the ending, nothing will be saved
United by bloodshed and pride
Lives are grinded to dust
Across the mountain side we ride to everlasting doom
Above The Ruins of the fallen the ashes forever remain

Spreading the fire as we charge back again
Bringers of violence, we're the bringers of pain
Bodies lay broken as they're grinded to dust
No mercy - we sing as we plunge into war
Flames and mass graves can be seen from ashore
By blood and by Hammers we rule this land

The Hammers of decay are back again
No bullshit will save you from my hate
We reign - we reign in fire and there is a Hell to pay
No choice - the end is here for he who chose to stay

Hate within our eyes
Fire burns within our hearts
The flame that never dies
Ravaging your lies
For only havoc lefts behind
Above The Ruins We Ride
