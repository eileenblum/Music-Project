Hail the sign, to him we rise
Mortifying through their lines
Pure destruction in our veins
In our heart the steel remains

No remorse and no regret
For the carnage will be great
Not by axe and not by sword 
Heavy-duty OVERLORD

We are the Hammer, sworn to the black
Pounding the metal attack

Let The Angels Burn, let the dead arise
Rotten to the core, they are bound to die
Feel the hatred burning, crawling down your spine
In this night of fire - we are metalized

Wielding death within my hand
To the slaughter I command
I have sworn the oath of blood
To the iron I am bound

For more blood and pain I pray 
Spreading havoc on my way
Bodies crushing on fate's wheel 
We unleash the storm of steel

We are the Hammer, pounding the slave
True Metal is back from the grave

Let The Angels Burn, let the dead arise
Rotten to the core, they refuse to die
Feel the hatred burning, crawling down your spine
In this night of fire - we are metalized

Let The Angels Burn, let the dead arise
Rotten to the core, they refuse to die
Feel the hatred burning, crawling down your spine
In this night of fire - we are metalized
