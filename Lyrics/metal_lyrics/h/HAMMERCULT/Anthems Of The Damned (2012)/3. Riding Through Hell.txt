Through Hell We Ride!

Acid running in our veins, poison in our eyes
We're the fucking war machine, we are your demise
Soldiers of the kill, masters of the gloom
From the depths of Hell we wield the hand of doom

Hordes of death
Spells and witchcraft
Bound by hate
As We're Riding Through Hell

Marching into war, drenched in holy blood
Purified by steel, slaughter is our God
Upon the fields of death, across the storm we ride
Let them taste the scorn, let them feel the grind

We raid the heaven skies, no mercy in our hands 
Now watch the Hammers rise - beginning of the end

Hordes of death
Angels screaming
Bound by hate
As We're Riding Through Hell

Upon the fields of death, across the storm we ride
Let them taste the scorn, let them feel the grind
Acid running in our veins, poison in our eyes
We're the fucking war machine, we are your demise
