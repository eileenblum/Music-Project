From the depths of Hell I rise into salvation
For years I've followed my own fate in isolation
Now the time has come to rise from our damnation
In quest for my revenge I long for devastation

Through the labyrinth
As I cry for vengeance
Life of pain and death
Set their worlds on fire

"Rule, must bend the wave my son, by concentration
Switch the path, align the worlds into rotation"
Out into the blackness hole, into the pyre
Down into the pit of doom, my heart's on fire

FALL, ARISE
Into the blackness I dive, ARISE
Shape of the wave I defy, ARISE
Into The Death Gate I Fall, ARISE
Path of the world I control

Worlds of water, fire, stone and air bonded together
Consumed themselves in their own hate they are lost forever

Frostbitten by hatred I lurk for the kill, my vengeance is taken beyond
I summon the powers inscribed in my skin, awaken the rage of the one

FALL, ARISE
Into the blackness I dive, ARISE
Shape of the wave I defy, ARISE
Into The Death Gate I Fall, ARISE
Path of the world I control

And as I'm swallowed into the eye of the blackness,
I can still hear the echoes of my fellow Patryns
calling me from the depths of the labyrinth. Their
voices of agony strike deep in the back of my mind,
as I can still feel the pain of their anguish.
Vengeance.

Betrayed by those, the so-called gods, the higher powers
They are left to rot and to decay as snakes devour
Now the time has come to rise from our damnation
In quest for my revenge I long for devastation
