Doomsday weapon rapes the land
Necromancers raise the dead
Apocalyptic total war
Modern day machines of gore

Led to the slaughter
Death is your savior
Down in the fire
Burning desire

Sacrifice on the altar
As we hammer down the crucified
The most unclean rules
This world once more
Worship him or die
Kill kill kill
Hell's unleashed

Humans burning into ash
Smell the putrid stench of flesh
Death squads march incinerates
Signs of life exterminate
Say your prayers - Fuck your fate

Nuclear hammer overdrive
Total chaos, none survives
Mass destruction is at hand
Armageddon - It's the end
