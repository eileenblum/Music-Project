No remorse or repent
We're the bastards, forever Hellbent
From the streets and the dust
To the roads, into freedom and lust

No time for mercy, no time to cry
In cold wind and weather it's do or die
Others can say that we fell astray
We'll never listen to what they say

NO FUCKING WAY!

Say I'm sick to the bone
I serve no one, a king of my own
Breaking the rules, making my own
Say what I feel, to no man I knell
No God can save me

Hellbent, Hellbent - For cold steel and leather
Hellbent, Hellbent - Feeding the fire
Hellbent, Hellbent - We show no remorse
Here we come

Burning idols to dust
We're the wretched, in no God we trust
No remorse or repent
We're the bastards, forever Hellbent

No time for mercy, no time to cry
In cold wind and weather it's do or die
We're on a mission, our own crusade
Join us or fuck off, out of our way

COMING TO GET YOU!

Hellbent, Hellbent - For cold steel and leather
Hellbent, Hellbent - Feeding the fire
Hellbent, Hellbent - We show no remorse
In your face

Here we come
Fuck off and die
