Follow the sign of the seventh
Storming the gates of the heavens
Shed the most innocent of blood
In the name of the one you call Satan

Thy kingdom fucked
Thy will be mocked
You're in for the kill
Your blood must be spilled
Diabolic overkill

Jesus entombed in facts
Smashing the cross into pieces
Angels gang - Raped in the mud
We cover the heavens with the blood

None shall survive, leave none alive
Beheading of the priest, usurpers of the beast
Diabolic overkill

The priest is gay, the nun is a bitch
Better practice wht you preach
He crossdressed, she sucks
We don't fall for those cheap tricks
You fear his name, you fear his hate
Or do you fear your stone cold fate?
Watch the heavens burn to dust
