Gleams that are truth, canât rot on my soul
As the dirtiness which poisons us that day
But when the pain embellishes our blackness holes
Doesn't stop sadness to continues on each dawns

Feebleness in mind, I'm searching voracious
Something wild to breath, an early eager to taste
As the girded wolf can cripple his selected prey
Spreading the anguish and grief on dejected mar

Stabbing you in the Night... Strangulation
Stabbing you in the Night... Your Crucifixion [2x]
Stabbing you in the Night... Splashing your blood
Stabbing you in the Night... Grimmer it shall be!

For the melted philanthropy annihilated memoirs
Expending the impious seeds on the unearthly glees
Shining rascals involving to righteous exalt collapse
Of anger, my wrath is warped...Grimmer than murder!

Stabbing you in the Night... Strangulation
Stabbing you in the Night... Your Crucifixion
Stabbing you in the Night... Splashing your blood
Stabbing you in the Night... Grimmer it shall be!

For the destruction of the Earth, I sacrifice my lusts
My pain is less than world's worsen treacheries
I cut the nerves of essenceless sorrow, in doubt!
The fear, the power, the sickness of wrath impiousness
