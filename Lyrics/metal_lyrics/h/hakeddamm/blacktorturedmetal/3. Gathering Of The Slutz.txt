Twelve liars sitting at the weak impotent's table
Genocide of truth, brutality of choking silence
Blood crowned with the petrified body of late disciple
Laugh seizes me, treachery invades by pure pestilence

Die! Angels Of Lightâthose who carry the Evil lies
Die! Angels of Graceâyour pastoral poetry is now menaced
Die! Angels Of Charityâraping your corpse in obscurity
Die! Angels of Desireânew sons of God are blazed by fire

A last meal of distortioned hate contradictions
Fucking dicks they tried to build me... to build me a path
Across the lines in the scariest churches corruptions
Pastor misanthropically transforming to blood-bath
But thorny devastations come forth with pure wrath
Yeah! They made well at the time of the crucifixion
The arrival of Supreme Being aimed thy legions
Sky breaks down the evolution unto damnation

Die! Angels Of Lightâthose who carry the Evil lies
Die! Angels of Graceâyour pastoral poetry is now menace
Die! Angels Of Charityâraping your corpse in obscurity
Die! Angels of Desireânew sons of God are blazed by fire

Dark beast that takes thee where invisible chaos reigns
The aggressor has murdered the alarming wicked holiness
Then, the delivery is it only the unholy blackness signs?
Isn't it the proof that God is leaving his slaves brave less?

Die! Angels Of Lightâthose who carry the Evil lies
Die! Angels of Graceâyour pastoral poetry is now menace
Die! Angels Of Charityâraping your corpse in obscurity
Die! Angels of Desireânew sons of God are blazed by fire

Bicornus comes forth to slay the silent sluts!
