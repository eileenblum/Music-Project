You are the Bastard who fucked off your Life
All on the Trust, we hope you die twice
Nailed and whipped, than your Silence is Light
We don't need your Sign, die forth in Twilight

Die In SilenceâSplatter!
Die In SilenceâRotter!
Die In SilenceâSucker!
Die In SilenceâFucker!

Youâdisposable corpse and useless Human
Your Presence here wasn't desired Saint
On the Wall, in engraving and your Skin is found
The Whip on your Flesh implies a marvellous Sound

Die In SilenceâSplatter!
Die In SilenceâRotter!
Die In SilenceâSucker!
Die In SilenceâFucker!

The Scent of your Corpse only releases old Sins
In your Spittle of Blood, then Hatred begins
Life is unfair, but when Mockery is liked
Claiming you God, will cease in Shrine gazed

Everything must come to an End
Your Hands are trans pierced with ill
To Preacher we're firing the Lord
With the Power of Hell

[2x]
Die In SilenceâSplatter!
Die In SilenceâRotter!
Die In SilenceâSucker!
Die In SilenceâFucker!
