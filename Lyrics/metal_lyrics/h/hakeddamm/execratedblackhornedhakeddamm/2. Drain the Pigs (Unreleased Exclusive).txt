[performed by Hak-Ed Damm]Enter my church of genocide
Here is your light, your flawless pride
Everlasting self-hatred haunts
Enfolds a tongue, be amputation

Umbilical to trachea, Slice it up!
Ultimate foetal pigs. Slice it up!

This flesh is old, this flesh is cold
Carcass of sins, as God unseen
Blurring out the faith of morons
Those pigs against my retribution

Umbilical to trachea, Drain it off! [2x]
Ultimate foetal pigs. Drain it off! [2x]

- I heard you bastards, you fucking scorn.
Praising the goodness of life.
Â«Je porte le sang, le mÃ©pris et la haine Ã©ternelle.
Sales porcs!Â»

Slaughtering the endless beauty
On blood red soil your fear up high
Deathâs slowly blowing to your slits
Increasing pain, minimal life

Umbilical to trachea, Blaze it up!
Ultimate foetal pigs. Blaze it up!
