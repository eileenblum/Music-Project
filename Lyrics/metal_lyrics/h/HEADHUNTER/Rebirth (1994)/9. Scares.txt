Since he was young he had this passion
Over the year as it turned into goal obsession
A little chance to escape the daily routine
Live for your music, only a dream?

Gullibility - in experience
That's what they take advantage of
In euphoria - disillusion
Before you realize it's too late!

There's no intention - you're just a spoke in their wheel
Scares of carelessness
They make you believe - you're just a blind man without feel!
Scares of carelessness

It was at high-school - he had his first band
They swore to each other they stand
Free from worries they get their first deal
Big business you couldn't believe that it was real

Gullibility - in experience
That's what they take advantage of
In euphoria - disillusion
Before you realize it's too late!

There's no intention - you're just a spoke in their wheel
Scares of carelessness
They make you believe - you're just a blind man without feel!
Scares of carelessness

If you're successful - they gonna kiss your ass!
But if you don't sell - they tell you, you ain't got class!
They use your confidence to break your neck - what a mess!

Business destroyed their friendship so quick
How should they know their dreams make them sick!

Gullibility - in experience
That's what they take advantage of
In euphoria - disillusion
Before you realize it's too late!

There's no intention - you're just a spoke in their wheel
Scares of carelessness
They make you believe - you're just a blind man without feel!
