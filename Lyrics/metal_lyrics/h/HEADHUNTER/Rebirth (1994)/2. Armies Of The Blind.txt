Once I believed in our future
There was a time when I had my dreams
All my hopes smashed to pieces
Daily misery shown on the screen

Devastating - lack of consideration
Suicidal instinct?
Rotten world - a tickin' time bomb?

Face what future will bring to our kids
Horror and havoc
The inheritance of progress won't be a gift!
Horror and havoc
Armies of the blind
Reflections of mankind!

As experience shows us
We never learn before it's too late...

Devastating - lack of consideration
Suicidal instinct?
Rotten world - a tickin' time bomb?

Face what future will bring to our kids
Horror and havoc
The inheritance of progress won't be a gift!
Horror and havoc
Armies of the blind
Reflections of mankind!

Excuse me, trust me
I'm going for my own rules
Believe me, no future
For this world of fools

Face what future will bring to our kids
Horror and havoc
The inheritance of progress won't be a gift!
Horror and havoc
Armies of the blind
Reflections of mankind!
