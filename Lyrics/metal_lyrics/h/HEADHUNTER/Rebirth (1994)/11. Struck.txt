Too many questions
For my twisted mind
Too many problems
Make me feel blind!

Total frustration
Surrounds my day
My aimless life
Needs a reason to stay

Exiting - real frightening
Future scares me like thunder and lightning
No perspective - not effective
My life need kicks, I gotta be active!

Beware of the search the endless journey
To find light in the dark
The will to live - struck by lightning

When will it break out
This deadly disease
Uncertainty causes suicide dreams!

Exiting - real frightening
Future scares me like thunder and lightning
No perspective - not effective
My life need kicks, I gotta be active!

Beware of the search the endless journey
To find light in the dark
The will to live - struck by lightning

Beware of the search the endless journey
To find light in the dark
The will to live - struck by lightning
