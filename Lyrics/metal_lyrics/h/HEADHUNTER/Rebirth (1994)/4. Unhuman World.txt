How could humanity so easy forget
The take and orders that Adam once had
Is there a chance to catch our fall
Still lookin' for someone who's guilty for it all!

Human race with a such massive progress
Is till not able to control it's own mess
Turnin' inncircles, like a cat bites it's tail
Millions of reasons why we will fail!

We defend, we pretend, we can't stand - this unhuman world
We decay, we disarray, doomed to stay - in this unhuman world

Dictators used violence to multiply might
But history told us that no one was right
Communist's tried the equalisation
Democrats voted for freedom of nations

We defend, we pretend, we can't stand - this unhuman world
We decay, we disarray, doomed to stay - in this unhuman world

Why is there hate
Between different races
If we rip their skin
They all got same faces!

We defend, we pretend, we can't stand - this unhuman world
We decay, we disarray, doomed to stay - in this unhuman world
Can we find the exit of the digital directed - multiple protected - unhuman world?
