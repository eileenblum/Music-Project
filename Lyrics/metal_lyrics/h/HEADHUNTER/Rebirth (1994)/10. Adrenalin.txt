They got their kicks from the death on the track
They got excited while others get wrecked
Keep on slow motion to see it again
Silent observer of media games

Feed on the table the first clenched to scream
Waitin' for tragedies exposed on the screen
Ain't got no emotions, thrill is their aim
They can't get enough of this deadly pain!

They execute without any sail
Human life by remore-control

Adrenalin - pulsating through a heart where pity is a sin
Adrenalin - they get their second wind - to see the reaper win
Adrenalin

They're amused by the misery of the world of today
Alternatives from their routine so grey
They surf through the channels to find suffer and pain
Even real horror can't drive them insane

Adrenalin - pulsating through a heart where pity is a sin
Adrenalin - they get their second wind - to see the reaper win
Adrenalin
