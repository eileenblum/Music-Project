Harmony - is what we fake
Confirmation - we're lookin' for
Family - is our priority
Reputation - the major disease!

Risk - no, no ever ever
Native - is our success
We don't like to attract attention
To be average is our rule!

Security - is what be build on
Suspense - if the time is right
But once a year we dress up
Dress up to wipe out!

Are we mindless - or why do we need this masquerade?
Are we mindless - or why I've hide behind this masks?
Are we mindless - is there a need to have systematized fun?
Are we mindless - now we're the jesters for anyone!

Smash - everything to pieces
Booze - till we throw up
Once a year my nasty habits take control!

Cheat - betray your partner
Scandals - now we don't care
Fools license for my body
For my body and for my sail!

Are we mindless - or why do we need this masquerade?
Are we mindless - or why I've hide behind this masks?
Are we mindless - is there a need to have systematized fun?
Are we mindless - now we're the jesters for anyone!

Tomorrow I wake up and I'll redress my deeds
Follow the masses - I've satisfied my needs

Are we mindless - or why do we need this masquerade?
Are we mindless - or why I've hide behind this masks?
Are we mindless - is there a need to have systematized fun?
Are we mindless - now we're the jesters for anyone!
