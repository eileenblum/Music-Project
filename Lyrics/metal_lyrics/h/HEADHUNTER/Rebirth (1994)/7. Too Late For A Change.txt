We grew up as friends, in the same neighbourhood
Shared the same interests for a long, long time!

Years passed by, one day his family moved away
I did lose my bud - but we were sure to meet again!

Destiny - wasn't on our side
No ask for help - destroying bride
The wheel of time - doesn't turn anymore
You've lost the game laying dead on the floor!

Was it too late for a change
The battle is lost no one knows
Was it too late for a change
You've executed yourself - overdose!

Once an example for me with such a strong mind
Hard to imagine you didn't have enough inner strength!

Destiny - wasn't on our side
No ask for help - destroying bride
The wheel of time - doesn't turn anymore
You've lost the game laying dead on the floor!

Was it too late for a change
The battle is lost no one knows
Was it too late for a change
You've executed yourself - overdose!

You've been walkin' the road, you never wanted to go
Is this the only way out, last exit death?

No idea - no clue
Why did this happen' to you?
Can't believe that it's true
You've taken the deadly brew!

It was too late for a change
The battle is lost no one knows
It was too late for a change
You've executed yourself - overdose!
