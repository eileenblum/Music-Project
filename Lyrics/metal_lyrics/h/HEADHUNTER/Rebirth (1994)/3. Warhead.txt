Millions of kids are high-score addicted
Cause it builds up their brutality
But who doesn't like to kill on the TV-screen?
Big thrills without a risk!

The high-score is close, he's fightin' for glory
Cyber-world nothin' is real
He builds up his ego with high-tech equipment
Forgotten is all your trouble and fear

Choose your battle - insert the coin
You're warbed and ready to strike
Right now you are the hero!

Warhead - push-button killer
Warhead - space dealer of pain
War - war - warhead
Warhead - just show off - no brain!

The looser becomes a dangerous winner
Daily violence - a matter of course
Is he still able to sort out the difference
Between game and reality

Choose your battle - insert the coin
You're warbed and ready to strike
Right now you are the hero!

Warhead - push-button killer
Warhead - space dealer of pain
War - war - warhead
Warhead - just show off - no brain!

Coloured screens - laser beams
Push - hit - pull - kick - you are sick
Button-killer - cyber thriller
Force - strength and might - you can win this fight!

Warhead - push-button killer
Warhead - space dealer of pain
War - war - warhead
Warhead - just show off - no brain!
