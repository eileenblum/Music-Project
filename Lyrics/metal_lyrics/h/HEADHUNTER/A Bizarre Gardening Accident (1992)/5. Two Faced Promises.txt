Now finally our country,
Is reunited history
Now east is released
No doubt for me
An upward trend for economy

But far from it, our unity
Gets financed from our charity
We got to bleed, get forced to pay
That's what we're doing anyway

Taxes up the malicious way,
Of getting asked to fuckin' pay
Call to mind, they fooled us all
Taxman's deception is our fall

Two faced promises
The swindle of our century
Two faced promises
It's backed up by the industry
Two faced promises
They take our money

But far from it, our unity
Gets financed from our charity
We got to bleed, get forced to pay
That's what we're doing anyway

Taxes up the malicious way,
Of getting asked to fuckin' pay
Call to mind, they fooled us all
Taxman's deception is our fall

Two faced promises
The swindle of our century
Two faced promises
It's backed up by the industry
Two faced promises
They take our money
Two faced
