The coldness of your lonely days
Is your curse in the moment of truth
Same mistake again, again
Twists your mind, you choose to lose

Regret your deeds
Rise once more
Twisted mind
Addicted to score

The mindless deed, scored on your soul
You've reached the point of no return
Stay faithful, keep your promises
All pretensions, you must burn!!

Regret your deeds,
Rise once more
Twisted mind
Addicted to score

Betrayer
Deny your mean conflict give up the risk
Betrayer
Deny your mean conflict give up the risk

A doubtful pleasure for a moment of joy,
Lust and desire senseless trust
The confirmed ego satisfies your lust
Pangs of remorse to your disgust

Regret your deeds
Rise once more
Twisted mind
Addicted to score

Betrayer
Deny your mean conflict give up the risk
Betrayer
Deny your mean conflict give up the risk

The coldness of your lonely days
Leaves scares on your soul
A doubtful pleasure for a moment of joy
It's faith that you destroy

Betrayer
Deny your mean conflict give up the risk
Betrayer
Deny your mean conflict give up the risk
Betrayer
Deny your mean conflict give up the risk
Betrayer
Deny your mean conflict give up the risk
