Call him deathbringin' toy
Of the rich and the mighty
Eliminator without any care,
Grim dealer of death

How sick you got to be
To kill people for money
Insane homicidal mind
Filled with spitefulness

Eye to eye ain't his deadly style
Why oh why, do they have to die?

Dare devil, deadly weapon
Hired for a murderous day
Under his spell, experience hell
Deliberate cruelty pays

Eye to eye ain't his deadly style
Why oh why, do they have to die?

Too much secrets, too much power
The game is twisted
Before you realize unhealthy business
Pay the price!

Deadly instinct
How much can you pay?
Deadly instinct
It could be you today

Eye to eye ain't his deadly style
Why oh why, do they have to die?

Deadly instinct
How much can you pay?
Deadly instinct
It could be you today
