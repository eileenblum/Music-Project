Did you ever feel empty, useless and alone?
No idea why're you frustrated to the bone

Take a look at the future, there's no light
Can you make a difference
Between wrong and right?

Who is to blame for the situation you're in?
Your parents tried hard, to give you a good start
Beyond any cure, your youth's destroyed
Your life's paranoid bad habits rise!

The government doesn't support the youth
Alcohol, drugs, suicide the fuckin' truth
Politicians don't give a damn
R U D E what a rude philosophy

This boredom dims you nuts
No acception in the crowd
'Cause all you people
Don't know what life's all about

Who is to blame for the situation you're in?
Your parents tried hard, to give you a good start
Beyond any cure, your youth's destroyed
Your life's paranoid bad habits rise!

The government doesn't support the youth
Alcohol, drugs, suicide the fuckin' truth
Politicians don't give a damn
R U D E what a rude philosophy

Well our country's future depends
On the youth of today
We give 'em everything we think they need
Because they will be running tomorrow's country
Thank you and don't forget to vote for us

Who is to blame for the situation you're in?
Your parents tried hard, to give you a good start
Beyond any cure, your youth's destroyed
Your life's paranoid bad habits rise!

The government doesn't support the youth
Alcohol, drugs, suicide the fuckin' truth
Politicians don't give a damn
R U D E rude philosophy
R U D E rude philosophy
R U D E rude philosophy
R U D E
