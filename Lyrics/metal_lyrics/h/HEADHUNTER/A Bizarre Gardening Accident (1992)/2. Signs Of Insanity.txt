Do you remember, that there was a time
We were laughing at conventional guise
Long time ago we thought we were so cool
Rebels who fight for their set own of rules

Once you had idols,
Once you had drive
Master of treason
But you didn't survive
Insanity

Once you had idols,
Once you had drive
Master of treason
But you didn't survive

Greed twists your personality
Inheritance of sick society
Signs of insanity!

You don't need your friends anymore
Selling yourself for a job like a whore
Following blindly the mindless numb masses
That swallow your own individual asses

Once you had idols,
Once you had drive
Master of treason
But you didn't survive

Greed twists your personality
Inheritance of sick society
Signs of insanity!

Your just a face in the crowd
That's what life's all about
How about your own believe?
Admit your own defeat

Your just a face in the crowd
That's what life's all about
How about your own believe?
Admit your own defeat

Do you remember, that there was a time
We were laughing at conventional guise
Long time ago we thought we were so cool
Rebels who fight for their set own of rules
Signs of insanity
Greed twists your personality
Inheritance of sick society
Signs of insanity!
