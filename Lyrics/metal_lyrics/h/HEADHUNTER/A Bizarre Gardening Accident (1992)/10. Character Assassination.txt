I can't believe, I could have been so blind,
I feel disgust 'cause you've misused my mind
I forget mankind is cunning and fake
Blown all my confidence give me a break!

This situation makes me feel so sick,
Once again I wade through all of this shit
All my best friends have tried to fuck my chick,
Here we go again, the usual trick

Guilty as one
Loyal to none
Hidin' behind lies
Like a coward breaks your back
Hidin' behind lies
Your reputation I'll attack

I got my own way to make you bleed
A cunning pay back for all of your cheek
Your reputation won't be that much
My heart won't freeze from your cold finger touch

Guilty as one
Loyal to none

Hidin' behind lies
Like a coward breaks your back
Hidin' behind lies
Your reputation I'll attack
Character assassination
Your sentence of death
Character assassination
Take your final breath

Guilty as one
Loyal to none

Hidin' behind lies
Like a coward breaks your back
Hidin' behind lies
Your reputation I'll attack
Character assassination
Your sentence of death
Character assassination
Take your final breath
