Another senseless wasted day
The hangover doesn't seem to go away
Flashing lights kick back
Your mind seems to lose control

To the best of your recollection
The trail to resist was in vain
Your confliction you could make it
All gone, alcohol feeds your brain

Bottoms up, bottoms up
Your daily wake up turn
Bottoms up, bottoms up
You will never learn

Declare yourself for addiction
The first step of your way out
Stop to defend your bad habit
Life is too short, to stay proud

Bottoms up, bottoms up
Your daily wake up turn
Bottoms up, bottoms up
You will never learn

Boozer
Did you get anywhere?
Delusion
Face the truth and you will see
Your life is pain and misery
Boozer
Did you get anywhere?
Delusion
Face the truth and you will see
Your life is pain and misery

Don't expect help
Don't give up,
Just resist
Be of good cheer
Clench your fist
Fight your addiction with deprivation
Only solution in an alcoholic nation

Boozer
Did you get anywhere?
Delusion
Face the truth and you will see
Your life is pain and misery
Boozer
Did you get anywhere?
Delusion
Face the truth and you will see
Your life is pain and misery
