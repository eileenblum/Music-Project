They're trivial and narrow
Deep inside their minds
Their vanity
Seems to make then blind
Those others, people
Base their life on rules
Hypocrites
Just a hast of fools

They think they're so high class
They'll leave... in time
But independence
Ain't a crime
Tense files the scenery
Of routine day by day
Takes hopes and dreams
Fling them far away

We don't live in paradise
But we shouldn't compromise
So don't look down at me
Any your...

Parody of life
Jealousy and different lies
Parody of life
Jealousy and different cries

I never hear them
Talking back behind my back
One day hypocrisy
Will break your necks
The usual game
From the cradle to the grave
Race all the time
You're like just another slave
