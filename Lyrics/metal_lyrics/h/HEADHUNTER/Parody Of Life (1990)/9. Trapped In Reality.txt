You've realized your dream
Life's fairy tale
You've almost reached your end
No, you can't complain
You've got so many friends
You bet they stand by you
Course you've got some faith
...and hope
Constitute your backbone

Base life on solid ground
Trust in your future
By just a simple count

You thought you're footloose
And fancy free
Enjoy your freedom
Nothing lasts forever
You should have known
Just dreams stick for a lifetime

Envy and jealousy
Rips your destiny
Who you believe a word
And... of life
Cause you've no ideas
How mean this world could be

As long as you're respected
People kissing your feet
But faster that you expected
They'll make you bleed
Trapped in reality
They'll lead you from your destiny
Trapped in a tragedy
Trapped in reality
They'll lead you from your destiny
Trapped in a tragedy
Trapped in reality
Trapped in a tragedy
Trapped in reality
Trapped in a tragedy

Watch the signals behind your back
Cut them with your knife
Everything will fade away
They melt into the void

The unions... you made
You have done your job
They will throw you away
They'll go to their decline
