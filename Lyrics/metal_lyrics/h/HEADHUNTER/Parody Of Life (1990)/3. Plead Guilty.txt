I drunk and told to leave
By dark we were creeping down the street
Just looking for a good time
Promise with nothing there in our minds
Your mind out of control

You have killed without hesitation
I carry the gun for self defense
I remember the shout
And the jungle screams
Felt like just being in a bad dream
I ain't the killer and believe me
Your mind out of control

Pleased guilty, plead guilty
Plead guilty, you will never see
The light of the day again
Plead guilty...
Of intention was no excuse
Plead guilty, you will never see
The light of the day again

Your life is over, your life is done
Accused of murder, where to run
Where to hide, cause deep inside
Your guilt cats you alive

I carry the gun for self defense
I remember the shout
And the judge screams

Plead guilty
