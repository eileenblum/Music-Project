I wasn't born to follow
I wanna go my own way
I better stick to my decisions
Even if it's painful today

Look at them, they're all fakin'
Winding road I ain't takin'
Try to keep your own faith
Then you will find your trace

Force of habit
Society is petrified
Can't live relying in their eyes
Force of habit
Society is petrified
Can't live relying in their eyes

I am strong 'cause I believe
But to them I look like a thief
Better count on yourself
Than on someone else

Force of habit
