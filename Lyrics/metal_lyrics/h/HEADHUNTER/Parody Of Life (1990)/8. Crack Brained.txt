Sinful are the faithful
In a world of fantasy
It's decency and charity
Against this cruel reality

You shall not kill
You shall not hate
Principles of... cries
Looking for the human greed

Crack brained
Believer, sinner, who's the winner
Crack brained
Believer, winner, they are sinners
Crack brained
Believer, sinner, who's the winner
Crack brained
Believer, winner, they are sinners

Now it's time to realize
Got to open our eyes
Do we invent all those lies
Are we masters of disguise

...year old, prepare to die
Sacrifice for life
It's just like suicide
You'll soon soothe your pride

Crack brained
