You have wasted my life
And you have grabbed my youth
I've lost too much time
Caught and blinded by your female crime
...and hide at the same time

Never I dream my life
You know I live my dream
Caught in a spider's web
Misery, suffer, pain, injustice
Caught in a spider's web
Misery, suffer, pain, injustice

Darkness has grasped my skin
Scars will heal but the pain will last
Promise me you'll pay your toll
You will suffer, lose your soul

You have missed your chance
You've had it all in your hands
Brought to blame another's back
Let them gag in your suffering track

Caught in a spider's web
Misery, suffer, pain, injustice
Caught in a spider's web
Misery, suffer, pain, injustice

Caught in a spider's web
