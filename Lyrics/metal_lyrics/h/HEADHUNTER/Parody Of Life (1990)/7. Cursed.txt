They're injecting the crime
With their innocent eyes
And they believe what they see
All those tales ain't lies

And suppose we progress
What our children can get
By laws and through chains
If affects their brains

...enough their human...
Works out their just to kill
If you used to see dying bodies
You never wanna miss the thrill
Cursed
...a bed of pleasure
Cursed
...with their youth
Cursed
...a bed of pleasure
Cursed
...with their youth

They will lose their respect
For the values we have
They're integrated in a crowd
Don't know what life's all about

Cursed
