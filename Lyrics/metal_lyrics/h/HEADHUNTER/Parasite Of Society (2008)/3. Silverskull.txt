Feel, feel the pain, got to be insane
Art, art of darkness -- express your lost hardness

Blood and pain, the needle will free your mind
Sweat and tears express yourself -- one of a kind

Silverskull -- Taj Mahal
A place of art and honour
Silverskull -- Taj Mahal
A place for you my brother

Freak, freak of misery you know this world is too ugly
Express your inner soul be yourself out of control

Blood and pain, the needle will free your mind
Sweat and tears express yourself -- one of a kind

Silverskull -- Taj Mahal
A place of art and honour
Silverskull -- Taj Mahal
A place for you my brother

Fight your demons -- your disagreements -- provocation for this rotten nation
Feel the pain take the challenge don't hide -- stigmatized

Silverskull -- Taj Mahal
A place of art and honour
Silverskull -- Taj Mahal
A place for you my brother
