Curse the day that you were born
Fight the lonely fight like you have sworn
Twist of fate that I do hate
An evil mind you do create
The days of sin will now begin
No chance to step back. Slaughter within
I count the days I'm lost in haze
Possession like a deadly disease

Seven bridges of hell
Seven wishes to tell
Seven lives it will take
To realize it's all a fake

The day will come and you will pay
Doomsday for the prayer
Your believe won't save your decay
Doomsday for the prayer
Your sinful life will recall
Doomsday for the prayer
Take your last breath, backs to the wall
Doomsday for the prayer

Curse the day that you were born
Fight the lonely fight like you have sworn
Twist of fate that I do hate
An evil mind you do create

Seven bridges of hell
Seven wishes to tell
Seven lives it will take
To realize it's all a fake

The day will come and you will pay
Doomsday for the prayer
Your believe won't save your decay
Doomsday for the prayer
Your sinful life will recall
Doomsday for the prayer
Take your last breath, backs to the wall
Doomsday for the prayer
