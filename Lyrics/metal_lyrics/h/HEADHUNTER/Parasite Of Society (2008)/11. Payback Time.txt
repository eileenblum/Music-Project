Moral, religion, sex and outrage can be twisted to your need
Craving for recognition, casting your dirty seed
A goddamned damned constructional fault this body that you are in
Looking for dedication with a sleazy ending

Pretend to believe in perfection, the opposite you will get
Why do your mistakes end up in your bed
Wild lifestyle makes your heart beat? So why don't you fuckin' die!
I'd forget your filthy ass within the blink of an eye

All those rules -- right or wrong
None but fools -- gone is gone

Can't reverse your life
Payback
Regret your style
Payback
It's payback time
Can't reverse your life
Payback
Confess your sins
Payback
It's payback time

Salvation is a frame of mind and as fake as your look
Behind all those compulsions hides a base crock
The pressure of this system dictates moral and fuckin' lies
Cowards hide behind fateful fatal ties

All those rules -- right or wrong
None but fools -- gone is gone

Can't reverse your life
Payback
Regret your style
Payback
It's payback time
Can't reverse your life
Payback
Confess your sins
Payback
It's payback time

Sinner or saint
Harlot or friar
I beg to differ
So who's the liar

Can't reverse your life
Payback
Regret your style
Payback
It's payback time
Can't reverse your life
Payback
Confess your sins
Payback
It's payback time
