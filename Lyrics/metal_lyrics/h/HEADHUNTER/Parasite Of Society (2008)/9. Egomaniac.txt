Egomaniac, fake identity
I ain't the man I thought I would be
Killing illusion, lost in confusion
Not sure what's real or my fantasy

Havoc desolation immortal fear
Can't I expect more dedication here?
Depending on others, can't accept their point of views
Personal opinions are bad news

Will the daily grey turn into sun
Out of the fire -- now on the run

Honour and pride -- scream to get it -- cheat get it
Skills to get it right...
Eternal fight -- scream to get it -- cheat get it
Skills to get it right...

Egomaniac, declining confidence
I'm not really looking for your tolerance
My way or the highway -- a control freak
Get out of my way if you are to weak

Will the daily grey turn into sun
Out of the fire -- now on the run

Honour and pride -- scream to get it -- cheat get it
Skills to get it right...
Eternal fight -- scream to get it -- cheat get it
Skills to get it right...
