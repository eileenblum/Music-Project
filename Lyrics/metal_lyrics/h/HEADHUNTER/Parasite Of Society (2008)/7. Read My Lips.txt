Read my lips and wonder those words I dare to say
They'll hit you like a thunder you'll throw your life away
Red my libs and learn truth killed your illusion
The flame of hatred burns you won't find your conclusion

Read my lips and swallow the fact you've lost your mate
Love to distraction converts to an empty phrase: hate
You've never caught my mind not even in the best days
Ruled by jealousy -- wonder is the dearest child of faith

Twisted skunk -- there is something wrong in you head
