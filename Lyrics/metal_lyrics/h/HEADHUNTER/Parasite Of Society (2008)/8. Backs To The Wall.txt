Waiting for the saviour turning water into wine
daily news sending shivers down my spine
A man in black with mystical vibes
Is preaching peace but missuses our lives

Evil behaviour but praying to some god
Waiting for an alibi can not hear the shot
Skull and crossbones -- the flag of the free
Backs to the wall -- see the signs -- you will fall
Days of justice -- will come for all

Fear the days -- were our minds are lost in haze
Fear the days -- downside trend a slap in the face
Backs to the wall -- see the signs -- you will fall
Days of justice -- will come for all

History proves the scum will stand tall
Pride becomes before fall
If the breed wallows in greed
Backs to the wall -- see the signs -- you will fall
Days of justice -- will come for all

Fear the days -- were our minds are lost in haze
Fear the days -- downside trend a slap in the face
Backs to the wall -- see the signs -- you will fall
Days of justice -- will come for all
