Hear my calling!

You have lost your luck, now it's too late to cry
Time to accept it -- today is a good day to die
Push it to the limit, warnings been ignored
Here my last advice now you better feed the lord

Hear my calling can you resist -- hear my warning
Sacrificed and stigmatized
Hear my calling can you resist -- hear my warning

One more face of death you will be forgotten before dawn
One more on the list, on the left behind
Puppet of the filthy rich -- cannon fodder
Leaving families behind -- the real victims of war

Hear my calling can you resist -- hear my warning
Sacrificed and stigmatized
Hear my calling can you resist -- hear my warning

Your starving kids and your crying kinship
Will suffer from your deadly hit
Your suicide fight change the face of misery
Fast glory won't pay off the agony

They promised you glory and eternal life
Heroism shall leave a proud wife
They use your rage missue your flesh
Greed for power creates human trash!

Hear my calling can you resist -- hear my warning
Sacrificed and stigmatized
Hear my calling can you resist -- hear my warning
