Hey you look in the mirror! See your life any clearer?
What the hell do you see?
The ugly face of truth made you waste your youth
Your life goes down the drain

Success -- based on vengeance and fear
Dark -- will be your future dear

Parasite of society, a victim of anxiety
Parasite of society, life without variety

Hey you cheater and liar, you have set your future on fire!
Based your carrier on deceits
Lies don't travel far the unvarnished truth -- you star
Hits harder than Muhammad Ali

Success -- based on vengeance and fear
Dark -- will be your future dear

Parasite of society, a victim of anxiety
Parasite of society, life without variety

Think twice before you take the wrong turn
Take a stand: decline or learn

Parasite of society, a victim of anxiety
Parasite of society, life without variety
