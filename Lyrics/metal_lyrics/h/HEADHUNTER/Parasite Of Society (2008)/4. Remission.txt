Welcome to the world of lies, welcome to your death
You are the chosen one my friend just take a deep breath
Your eyes will see things beyond your trustful believe
I wrote those lines as a secret warning and to retrieve

Can you see the light, it leads you to the endless road of cries

Remission -- stillborn creature paying off the sins
Dark visions -- stillborn creature pass the buck and grins
Remission -- stillborn creature paying off the sins
Dark visions -- stillborn creature pass the buck and grins

If you think this pain will last forever I will give you relieve
Your soul will pay off all your sins -- no need to grief

Can you see the light, it leads you to the endless road of cries

Remission -- stillborn creature paying off the sins
Dark visions -- stillborn creature pass the buck and grins
Remission -- stillborn creature paying off the sins
Dark visions -- stillborn creature pass the buck and grins

Welcome to our world of affluence welcome to our lying
Take a seat, enjoy to see how this world is fuckin' dying
Now you'll have your access to all top-notch deniers
What money can't buy will be razed by uniformed high-flyers

Remission -- stillborn creature paying off the sins
Dark visions -- stillborn creature pass the buck and grins
Remission -- stillborn creature paying off the sins
Dark visions -- stillborn creature pass the buck and grins
