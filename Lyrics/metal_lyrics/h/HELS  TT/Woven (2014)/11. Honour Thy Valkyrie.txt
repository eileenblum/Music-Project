Battle become man-hunter
Christians invaded a seed of treachery
And when you die honour thy Valkyrie

Thank you for your faith in me father
I must try and keep it together
Hoed my head up high for the Gods of war to seal my fate within our folklore

A sword is held up high it slashes through the sky
A warrior near by connects with meat warrior is dead
Was hit in the head look at the bloodshed he falls to his feet
He swings his sword once more through armored
Flesh it tore deep in his heart
He swore he would survive the attack
As he looks at the downed a taste for blood has been found
Then without a sound an arrow pierces his back

The boy stood no chance and as he fell the two men
That he cut down went straight to hell

They went straight to hell... in to the underworld

Father I understand what you had to do
Send me to fight when I had no clue
Odin I shed their blood for thee
Feed my heartbeat my pride and my destiny

As he lay in the field his fate is suddenly sealed
He clinched the sword that he wields while gasping for air
As the blood fills his lung the bell of death has been rung
His swan song has been sung by a voice so fair
Its a girl that he hears who fells him not to have fear
He will be feasting with beer the afterlife is great
Gold light in the sky so bright it blinds his eyes
The moment that he dies he is free of hate

The morning sun shines on the field and brightens up the dead
The Christians and the Norsemen fought for Valhalla they bled
A Valkyrie rides fast to him picks him up off the sand
He honoured her with two he killed and died with word in hand.
