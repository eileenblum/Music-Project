Oh Agamemnon you're the son of the great Atreus
And the ruler over all who dwell in Greece
All your power made you victor in the Trojan war
But your steadfast return won't be glorious

Back at home stabbed in the bath by his wifely whore
Aegisthus claiming revenge now rules your kingdom

All your life you lived with might sights set high on a godly throne
But the pitiful end of the king of all men sent him to the dark unknown

Oh your wife's jealous for the motives of your war bringing Priam's Cassandra
To your bed and despite all of the pleasure that you gainedâ¦ you're dead

All your life you lived with might sights set high on a godly throne
But the pitiful end of the king of all men sent him to the dark unknownâ¦ libation

Oh Agamemnon you're the son of the great Atreus
Brother to the spartan's leader Menelaus
Your bloodlines actions have increasingly angered the gods
They were forced to lay plagued curses on your house

Underworld drink of the blood from Odysseus
Sacrifice his attention gained you can say your piece

My bitch wife
Slayed me in my own tub
Aegisthus
Then took my home
Treachery
Orestes
My son avenged my death
Killed them both
I hate her more
She's a whore
