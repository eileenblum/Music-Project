I will lay my head down at night
And dream of the place I will go when I die
It helps me clear my mind to rest
Gets me thru the day it's the knot that I tie
Others would want me to believe
Odin is the way but I would disagree
Freyja is laced in all my dreams
Tells me that FÃ³lkvangr is the home for me

An open field, a golden shield, a horn of mead
Ancient markings surrounded by maple trees
Plenty of men to fight endless to eat
Falcon goddess is the one I get to meet

I want to go to my meadow my meadow
I will go to FÃ³lkvangr - FÃ³lkvangr

I read the stars for signs to show me who I am
And where I am supposed to be

Night - I'm asleep until its light - I awaken to a fight -
Win the battle then we move the camp
West - and continue on our quest - and then we get to rest -
Welcome slumber dream of FÃ³lkvangr

Field of the host, I dream of most, to go inside
Freyja's tower SessrÃºmnir hall of my pride
Walk through the door a bright silver light
There she is on her throne a perfect sight a perfect sight

I will lay my head down at night
And dream of the place I will go when I die
It helps me clear my mind to rest
Gets me thru the day it's the knot that I tie
Others would want me to believe
Odin is the way but I would disagree
Freyja is laced in all my dreams
Tells me that FÃ³lkvangr is the home for me

Night - I'm asleep until its light - I awaken to a fight -
Win the battle then we move the camp
West - and continue on our quest-and then we get to rest -
Welcome slumber dream of FÃ³lkvangr

The secret lore of the Gods I am GudrÃºn
I will die in vicious war and then I'll kneel before the Goddess Freyja.
