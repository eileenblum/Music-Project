The traveler arrived at the tribe of the brute siblings
A hidden camp near the cliffs of the vandal mountains
A beautiful maiden of the cloth cloaked in pagan norm
She told of a plan to unite three tribes
As her words were soft and warm

The chief is old and tired puts trust to his son
The future lies with him cause he's his only one
She gets close and trusted and tells him of her kind
Temptress of seduction she poisons his mind

With her words she poisons his mind
I will love and care for you until my dying breath
I am scared and troubled I fear for your death
If you remain a heathen a dark place you will go
And we won't be together I feel that you know

We will run away together thru the fog thru the trees
We will leave our pasts behind never to be spoken
They must know we are gone headed for the sea
They will try to find us and bring us back again

The tribe cannot believe that they would run away
What were they thinking she will die this day
The chief wants his son back spreads word thru the land
He wants him safe and well but kill her where she stands

Backed by the void of reasoning
Brutal times rot to the core
But the vibrance of the tyrants brought forth faith
And they started a war

We will run away together thru the fog thru the trees
We will leave our pasts behind never to be spoken
They must know we are gone headed for the sea
They will try to find us and bring us back again

They ran into asking the word has been spread
And without warning they lopped off her head
He drew his blade in anger he was told to yield
He did not they broke his neck they hit him with a shield
They hit him with a shield the vandals divide
His son is dead.
