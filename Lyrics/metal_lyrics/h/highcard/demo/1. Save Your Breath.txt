Donât talk to me about your glory days. You donât lift a finger to make a change. I donât understand what you do but thatâs the difference between me and you. Youâre in one day then you were out the next. Who the fuck did you want to impress? No one cares so save your
breath. Grasp at straws until thereâs nothing left. You cut your ties so long ago, so hereâs something you donât know. We donât miss you and we donât fucking care, a face long forgotten thatâs met with a blank stare. Say what you want if itâll help you, but deep down we
know that weâre better than you. You couldnât cut it, your heart wasnât there. We donât miss you and we donât fucking care. It doesnât matter what you say or do, no one gives a fucking shit about you. Washed up. Dropped out. Fucking disgrace. And itâs been years since
weâve seen your face.
