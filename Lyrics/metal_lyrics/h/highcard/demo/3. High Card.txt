Iâm down to the felt and thereâs nowhere to go. Going all in is my only hope. Every time you beat me you put me through hell. I gotta come up this time because Iâm down to the felt. Lifeâs a game and Iâve been dealt a raw hand. Thereâs an ace up my sleeve so now Iâm
taking a stand. High Card. Donât cry to me because I know that itâs hard. A constant battle and I carry the scars. You thought you were safe so you let down your guard. Donât try to call me, I have the high card.
