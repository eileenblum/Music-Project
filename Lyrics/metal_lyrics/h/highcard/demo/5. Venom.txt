Spit venom, you fucking snake. No respect for the friends you make. You donât give, you just take. Weâre fucking through. Nothing of worth comes out of your head and no one would care if you were dead. When you speak all I see is red. You look at me like everythingâs
fine but youâre a cancer on all of our lives. Iâll cut you off in a matter of time. Weâre fucking through and weâre over you. Spreading lies and everyone knows. Youâre constantly putting on a show. No one believes a thing you say, so itâs about time for you to go away.
