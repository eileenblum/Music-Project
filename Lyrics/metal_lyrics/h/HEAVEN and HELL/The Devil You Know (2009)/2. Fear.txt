If you've never heard before
There was once a time
When only God had fire
The moon and stars and nothing more
To lead you through the night

If there's a Hell and Satan had a daughter
He must have sent her here to hide the flame
We're still afraid
Must be he taught her so well
We've seen some light
So why's it all the same

[Chorus:]
Superstition - go away
We wear the mark
Fear

There's a corner of the mind
With a door that always
Opens up at sundown
And what's inside is to remind you
To hide from eyes that shine

We ran until we found we had the power
Illuminate the world and make it burn
We're still afraid
Must be that door in your brain
You've seen some light
And you pray it will return

[Chorus]

If there's a Hell and Satan sent his daughter
She must have gotten lost
And can't go home
We're still afraid
And he can't find her again
We've seen some light
But it will always be the same

[Chorus:]
Evilution go away
We still share the mark
Fear
