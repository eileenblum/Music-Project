Blue skies - Once upon a dream
All highs - never in-between
Then Into the Garden came the spider

I'm here for you
Said the spider to the fly
And when I'm through
You can open up your eyes to see
Your world's on fire
And the liar won't let go
Atom and evil

One more promise
We can tame the sun
And then we'll shine forever

Someday you can cry for everyone
who burned when you were clever

Expand your mind
We've got a place for you
Just make believe
That one and one are always two
When into the parlour
Comes the slider
Say no
Atom and evil

Falling's easy
Rising will never be
So we must rise together

Here are the changes
Power for harmony
But then there's no forever
Atom and evil

Maybe if we cry together
Maybe if we cry as one
The tears that fall can kill the fire
And keep everyone from
Atom and evil
Atom and evil
Atom and evil
Atom and evil
