Just close your eyes
You're on a caravan to Superman
Sweet home infection
He can kill you with a smile

He'll come to you
But like the wind
He's here today then gone away
Be born again
Come taste the exhibition

[Chorus:]
Take a number
Come and join the line
Here's where you will find your
Rock &amp; Roll Angel
Don't close your mind
Just bring insanity and you'll see it all
His lie can blind you
He's now, he's revelation

You've been wishing for the magic sign
Here's where you will find your
Rock and Roll Angel

Perfect strangers in the dark
Waiting for their lives to start
Then behold your shining star
I wonder who you are

Perfect strangers in the dark
Waiting for their lives to start
But just before the dream begins
You must confess your sins

Soon to see the holy one
Can he really block the sun
Then at last our shining star
Make me who you are
