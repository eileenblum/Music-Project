Come lie on a bed of nails and slumber
Rise up but the hands all pull you down
My sunshine is wind and rain and thunder
I sing but I can't make a song

So if you want o know where
I've been
Hiding all these years
Follow the tears
Follow the tears

Don't drink from the cup of human kindness
It's a strange brew and poison to the touch
Don't think that they're saving you the finest for last
Or that you wanted too much

So if you want o know where
I've been
Hiding all these years
Follow the tears
Follow the tears
Follow the tears
Follow the tears

We'll be there for you
I believed and I can tell you it's not true
Run away before they find you again
The consequence of the conscience
Is that you'll be left somewhere
Swinging in the air

So if you want to know why
I've been
Hiding all these years
You might just find the way
Before the signs all disappear
Follow the tears
Follow the tears

If you want to find me
If you really care
Follow the tears
They're everywhere no no
