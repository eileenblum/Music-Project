At last alone
His fire's dying
Burned another day

Now to pretend
And make up an ending
Somewhere far away

He reached for a book all bound in leather
Something that he knows he's never read
And the first page says beware you've found the answer
The next one says I wish that you were dead

Don't go on
Put it back
You're reading from the Bible Black

What's this world I see
Who are you and who are me
Maybe I just stumbled in the dark

I must have been out cold
But the way the story's told
They found me lying naked in the rain

Let me go
I've seen religion
But the light has left me blind
Take me back
I must have the Bible Black

Well here I go again
From the start and to the end
I wish I could remember what I've done

Now here's another spell
It can take me straight to Hell
And I feel I'm getting closer to my home

Let me go I've found addiction
And it makes me feel alive
Take me back
I must have the Bible Black

He locks himself away and tastes the silence
Hungry for another bite of wrong
And just the words o Lord please take me with you
Took him to a place we don't belong

Let him go
He can't come back
He's reading from the Bible Black

So if your fire's dying
And what's the use of trying
I may know another place that you can go
It's hiding in the pages
But you may not come back
You're reading from the Bible Black
