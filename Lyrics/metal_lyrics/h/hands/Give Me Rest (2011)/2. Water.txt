[feat. Nathan Winchell of A Hope For Home]Forgive me for falling out. It's just not the way I see You.
Take me to the water.
Let there be light to reveal everything we've become.
Take me to the water.
I'm losing my faith, at the hands of the dynasty.
Take me to the water.

I just want something real.

From the shore. With the waves to my back, I can see.
A wasteland of blasphemy. Spolied fruit reaped from crooked trees.
God, are these your seeds? Are these your branches?
I'm so disgusted with all of this.
I want to recover.

Be still my brother. Be still so we may hear His voice.

Let there be light. Take me to the water.
