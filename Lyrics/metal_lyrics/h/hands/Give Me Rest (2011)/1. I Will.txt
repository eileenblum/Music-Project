Can you feel the anger in my heart?
I can't believe this is me.
I built my house on shaking ground, and lit a match to watch it burn.
Set me free.
Rest my soul in you alone.
Rise, from the quiet I will rise.
Take my hand. Give me the faith to move mountains.
Give me the strength to rebuild.
Help me become a better man.
Help me to understand your will.
Let it rain. To remind me that there is something more.
