Tonight has reason, a chance to celebrate your life and all your blessings, My body's shaking, at the sound of your voice. You call me out, now wake me up. Burn me down God, take my heart. I am yours. And I'll keep on singing. I am yours. You give me reason to live. I give you reasons to bury me. We come in numbers, not one stands better than the rest. Our time is running out. My father you are dear to me. and I'll keep singing. My redeemer, you are everything. Well let's get this moving. I know, there's so much more. Right beneath our surface. Search me out man, and I'll give you all that I am. Tear my heart out, if that's what it takes for me to see. You oh my God, well I know you're there. I will come running. Well I know you're there, so speak to me cause it's you that makes us, all that we are.
