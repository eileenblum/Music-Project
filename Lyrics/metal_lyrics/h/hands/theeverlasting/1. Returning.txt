Aging anger, brings me to my knees. My heart still hurts. And I need forgiveness, and is this all your plan. Answer me. My heart still hurts. And I give you control. This sleeper, has lost way. And I know that I'm wrong. But I'll see this through. Like the rain, I'll fall. And I give you control. As I look to the horizon with open arms. I can hear your words. I'll stay by your side. Answer me break me down, bring me to my knees. I wanna be nothing. I'll sing if you want me to sing. Sing praises you my king. Glory. And I'll sing you a song. And we'll walk together, hand in hand.
