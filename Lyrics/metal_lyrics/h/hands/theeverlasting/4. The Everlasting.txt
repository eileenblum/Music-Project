I see the sun rising up again. And it carries so many questions what do you mean. as my body is growing older. And your plans are undefined my god., what do you mean. I'll always be searching, to the end of my days. The mercy you tell of, keeps these arms from hanging on. When you tear it down, are we worth saving. When I let you down, am I worth saving. Save me, o God. For the waters have come up to my neck. I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold I have come into the deep waters, the floods engulf me. I am worn out calling for help, my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my god. I will live forever by your hands I rise, up against the storm. Oh glory. By your love we rise, we will face the world. So many bodies, reaching for the truth. We were never beautiful on our own, but you cleaned us. We were never graceful, but you still loved us save me, o god. Protect me. Surround me. While I hold onto you. We can't live, we can't breathe without you. We need you.
