Lets take this on. Open our arms. And we'll set fires. To burn down our walls. Let's take this on. This choice is ours. Lets move this forward and we'll never be the same. Hold our hands while we fight to make it back. Failing is progression. If I pursue you, would you say it's ok if I steal your heart for now. Is it ok if I steal your voice for now, so I can speak of how you love. We close our eyes, wit hope and conviction. Forgive me god, give me the strength to move on. Jesus carry us on. Father, sing us your songs. And as long as my heart is beating, and for every breath I take Lord remind me. Jesus, carry us on. Sing us your songs.
