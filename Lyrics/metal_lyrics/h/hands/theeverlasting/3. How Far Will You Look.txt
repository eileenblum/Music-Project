We're reaching for this with ambition. More than anything else, and I think it shows. We're skipping pages for the ending. And we've missed so much. and I think it shows. So many times, we fail to learn from mistakes. So many times, we wrap ourselves in defeat. But if I had never fallen down, how strong would I be. Rebuilding follows, a collapse. His eyes are watching, his hands are teaching. And there's no better time. So show your progress. And the promise made. Is one love, hope and grace. Are we too blind to see, are we too smart to learn. Open our eyes. Your image is seen within the stars. When we feel our hearts, wanting more. Your mercy is found within us all. No man can prove you wrong. Open up our minds. Reach into the dark, show me light. Your beauty has captured me. When I feel my heart wanting more of you. Ready for change, take me home. Your beauty has captured me.
