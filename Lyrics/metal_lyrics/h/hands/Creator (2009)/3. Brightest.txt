I will find, the brightest love.
And truth will sleep, on this sinnerâs tongue.
Change my life, and paint the stars with me.
I know weâre capable of so much more, in
You these colors show life.
Change my life, oh and let the angels sing.
Cause I know that weâre capable of so much more, in
You these colors show life.
Burn down the walls, break all these chains.
Jesus show your works in all of this.
All of my wants, all of my needs.
May they be broken down, to only You sovereign God
Re-arrange all the stars, show us life as it is.
We can be so much more...oh, we can be so much more.
And Iâll find the brightest love.
And Iâll think about it, and read about it,
And write about it, and sing about it.
Let the angels sing...
Jesus paint the stars with me.
Jesus paint the stars with me.
