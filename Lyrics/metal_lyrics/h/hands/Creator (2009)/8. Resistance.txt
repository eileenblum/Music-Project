I have failed to recover.
I am shamed with deceit.
My hands are shaking with anguish.
Trying to tear out my eyes, trying to rip out my tongue.
Redeemer, meet me here.
I need an answer.
Redeemer, meet me here.
I need an answer.
In this place of decision I thought of you,
But turned away.
My bodyâs aching with terror.
Will you still love me now, will you forgive my mistakes.
Redeemer, meet me here.
I need an answer.
Redeemer, meet me here.
I need an answer.
And in my darkest time You were watching,
Trying to call my name.
And though I let you down,
You were waiting for me to come back home.
Iâm ready.
In my darkest time... in my darkest time...
You were always waiting... for me to come back home.
Though I let you down... cause
You were always just watching...
I can hear you calling.
Redeemer, meet me here.
In my darkest time, You were always waiting.
Though I let you down, I can hear you calling.
