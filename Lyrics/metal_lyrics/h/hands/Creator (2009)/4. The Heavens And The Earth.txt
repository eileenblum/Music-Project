God, let all creation sing.
Let the mountains rise.
Let the oceans breathe.
God, let all creation sing.
From the dust we rise, from Your breath we breathe.
In the beginning, when You set the night from the day.
Or when you shaped the earth and the sky was formed,
As the seas obeyed.
But when You came to rest,
In the quiet whispers of the trees.
And in the midst of all this perfection
Did you think of me. Did you think of me
From the dust we rise, from Your breath we breathe
By Your design, we are conceived.
From the dust we rise, from Your breath we breathe.
By Your design, we are conceived. Creator...Creator...Creator...
From the dust we rise, from Your breath we breathe.
