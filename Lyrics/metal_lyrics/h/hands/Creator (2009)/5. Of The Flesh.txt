All desires of the world will fade...
Of the world will fade.
All desires of the world will fade...
Of the world will fade.
Come shake us all.
Bury everything.
Open the skies
Let it all fall down.
Let it all fall down.
We need to look outside, our possessions.
Thereâs so much more, than what this world can give
What seems important now,
Will seem empty when we have reached the end.
Thereâs so much more, than what this world can give.
Let it all fall down. Let it all fall down.
Let it all fall down. Let it all fall down.
Let it all fall down. Let it all fall down.
We need to search our hearts, to find a love everlasting.
We need to search our hearts, to find a love everlasting.
Come shake us all. Come shake us all.
Bring the end of the world. Bring the end of the world.
Bring the end of the world. Let it all fall down.
