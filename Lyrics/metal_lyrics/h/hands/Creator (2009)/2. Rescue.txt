Iâm reaching out, with everything that I have left.
Can You see my heart,
Can You hear it pounding in my chest...
Can you hear it pounding in my chest.
Iâm reaching out, with the serpent resting at my feet.
Will You hold my hands,
âCause I can feel my body growing weak.
Deliver me from the fire.
Rescue me from the mouth of lions.
Oh God Iâm calling You now.
Will you hear my voice, or will I be consumed.
My eyes trying to search for Yours,
Grow weak with sorrow father, I wonât give up on you now
Oh...will You release me.
I wonât give up on You now.
My eyes trying to search for Yours.
I wonât give up on You now.
Will You... will You release me.
I wonât give up on You now.
My eyes trying to search for Yours.
I wonât give up on You now.
Will You release me.
Will You release me.
