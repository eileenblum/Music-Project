Aging anger brings me to my knees.
My heart still hurts and I need forgiveness.
And is this all your plan? Answer me.
My heart still hurts.
And I give You control.
And I give You control.
Ouh...oh yeah... Ahh...oh...Ahh...
This sleeper has lost his way, and I know that Iâm wrong.
But Iâll see this through, like the rain Iâll fall...
Like the rain Iâll... like the rain Iâll fall...
As I look to the horizon with open arms,
I can hear Your words.
Iâll stay by Your side.
Iâll stay by Your side.
Iâll stay by Your side.
Answer me, break me down, bring me to my knees.
And I want to be nothing.
Iâll sing if You want me to sing, sing praises before
You my King.
We sing... glory... glory. Glory... glory... glory.
Glory... Iâll sing you a song... Glory...
And weâll walk together... Glory... ...hand in hand.
Glory...
