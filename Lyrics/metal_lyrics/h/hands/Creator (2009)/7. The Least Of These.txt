Iâll set my heart on love,
And let the world know why I sing.
Iâll shake the liarâs hand, because
I know that weâre the same.
Iâll let the Godless know, that I will stand at their side
Iâll let forgiveness show, throughout the rest of my life.
I have been a hypocrite,
And Iâve been all the dirty things that would disgust you.
But in this I have seen compassion, when it was undeserved.
Oh...I will never claim perfection,
So Iâll stand at the bottom to lift them up.
We need to make a change,
If we could all look outside our boxes.
If we could learn to love, no matter what we believe.
Can we all come together.
We need to make a change.
Iâll shake the liarâs hand,
Because I know that weâre the same.
Oh how can I condemn,
When Iâve been delivered from the flame.
Iâll shake the liarâs hand,
Because I know that weâre the same.
Yeah...Oh how can I condemn, when
Iâve been delivered from the flame...the flame.
Iâll set my heart on love.
Iâll set my heart on love.
