[Hidden Track]I have seen Your love and Iâm infected. On this day of truth, I will open my eyes... I will open my eyes. I will clean my hands, they are filthy. To the light of truth, I will open my eyes... I will open my eyes. To the sounds of earth, Iâve adjusted. In the name of truth, I will open my eyes. To the God Almighty, I surrender it all. Oh... To the God Almighty, I surrender it all. To the God Almighty, I surrender it all... it all. I surrender it all.... Hear oh earth, the Lord our God is one. Hear oh earth, the Lord our God is one.... Hear oh earth, the Lord our God is one. Hear oh earth, the Lord our God is one. Hear oh earth, the Lord our God is one. Hear oh earth, the Lord our God is one.
