In this broken place, where everything can be explained,
As we watch the earth move, but weâve never seen your face
In this broken place, will we recognize your voice,
As we watch the earth move.
The way the sun shines, the way our hearts beat.
And how the stars fill out the sky, for all of us to see.
Open our eyes, to how we became.
Open our eyes, to how we became.
All Your beauty shows, in all of our lives.
In every living thing, within the patterns of my skin.
In every miracle, you can be found.
And in this broken place,
I will choose to believe in Christ...
Oh... We sing praises to the King, âcause Heâs listening.
We sing praise to the King, âcause Heâs listening...âcause
Heâs listening.
We sing praises to the King, âcause Heâs listening.
We sing praises to the King, âcause Heâs listening.
