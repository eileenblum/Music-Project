Oh my God.
What have I become.
Tear me down.
Bring the storm, bring the storm.
Oh... And I felt the waves as they come crashing down on me
And as my chest caves in I will come trembling...trembling
Hold me down.
Reveal my faith.
Oh... Reveal my faith...
And you changed the air as the blood leaves my veins.
And you changed the air as the blood leaves my veins...
My veins.
Now... Now that itâs over, bring me to life.
Iâm holding onto you, bring me to life.
Now... And by your graceful presence, I am changed.
Now that itâs over, bring me to life.
With your unending love, pouring down on me.
Iâm holding onto you, bring me to life.
May the waters calm by your unending love.
Bring me to life.
