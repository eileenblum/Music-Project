I don't know anything about the fire, but it's coming anyway
And it's going to burn, burn, burn
I see the smoke on the horizon
But there's peace in this place
Though it's going to burn, burn, burn
I feel the weight of my sorrows
I feel it lifted away, as they burn, burn, burn
I gave everything I had to give, and I'd do it all again
I'm going to burn, burn, burn
