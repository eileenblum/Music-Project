Breathe new life
Kill the line
Exist in the moment
Rebuild, rejoice
Bury all of your pride
Set it on fire
Can you feel the moment?
Rebuild, rejoice
Slow down
We're all chasing the same old ghosts
Heaven is open wide
Slow down enough to see a rising sun
Heaven is open wide
Live and die chasing the wind
As one we are broken
Rebuild, rejoice
Love is all that binds
Burning bright, this is the moment.
In failure we learn that mercy will throw us to the light.
Slow down
It's all of us
