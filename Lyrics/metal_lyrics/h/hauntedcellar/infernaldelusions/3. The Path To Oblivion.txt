Behold, as I stand before you in pain
Trapped in my mind, I fall again
Drenched in your blood
Pleading for mercy, you fall and you
Die.

Onto the path to oblivion we march
No light at the end of the tunnel and we
Fall.
Into the depth of our own hell we crawl
I am your death, your fear and demise

[Solo 1]
[Solo 2]

I slice you open, I tear you limb from limb
I bathe in your blood, I rejoice in your pain
You lie before me on the ground in vain
I gaze upon you, I stab you again
Die.

Onto the path to oblivion we march
No light at the end of the tunnel and we
Fall.
I am your death, your fear and demise
I am your death, your fear and demise
