We raise our hell
We release our demons
By the greed that we have
In the name of evolution

Drowning in a sea of rage
I taste the embrace
Helpless as I steal my soul
I've lost all control

I see myself standing, in the ring of fire
Crawling and trying to reach the end
Trapped in the haunted cellar
Something I've had given away
I had to admit that I knew
It was somewhere, in the depth of my twisted mind
Most frightening, haunting me till the end of time

I'll never leave this path
I have to stay, 'cause I have to make this feeling last

"Screams"

I came alone, and I'll die alone
Surreal vision captures my soul
Welcome to the dark side of reality
When nothing seems real
The path of doom I walk
Without knowing how it can end

The seeds of evil growing in the damned
No one can save me from myself now

[Solo]

The poison in your words clears my path of annihilation
The time is passing through your hands
Do we live for a reason,
We are born to die
Death collects our souls,
Death is the treasure of life

Screaming through the soul
The darkness has arrived
I am running out of time, I start to die
In here, your soul will be dead
In the haunted cellar
