Moments imprinted upon a clay wall
Labyrinth of thoughts, shattered when death calls

Crimson illusion, transpires through your vision
Unholy thoughts, death becomes your mission
Embracing what you have become, merciless
It's time to face the eternal darkness

The divinity of loneliness

Inside this cosmic dream, at the edge of insanity
A war is raging, sweeping the plain, behold its infernal calamity
Shadows, are reaping, and reaping, with an endless rage
Gazing upon the eternal one, now he's free from his cage

Emerging like the moon at night, hear his haunting cry
Swearing an oath to tear up the earth, and an oath to bring down the sky
Embracing what you have become, merciless
It's time to face the eternal darkness

The divinity of loneliness

Through the fathomless, everlasting abyss
Shadows dwell beneath the dying sun
Chanting the name of the falling one
Pacing to join him in the endless
Fire!

Embracing what you have become, merciless
It's time to face the eternal darkness
