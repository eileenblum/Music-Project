Weak, and born to seek
The wonders of the world
The knowledge has been told

Searching for the answer
It must be the silence
When you're gazing at the truth

Run form what you hide
Is that fear you feel inside?
What pollutes my mind?
What is right?
What is wrong?

Hate
Slaughtering
Tearing me apart

Fall
Into the depth
All will be lost

Layers of fear, built the walls of pain
The way of the swarm, I leave with no trace

I fly, with no wisdom to give
All I know is that I fly over

The time of commandments, is done!

Run form what you hide
Is that fear you feel inside?
What pollutes my mind?
What is right?
What is wrong?

What if everything you know is wrong
What if. What if. What if. What if
