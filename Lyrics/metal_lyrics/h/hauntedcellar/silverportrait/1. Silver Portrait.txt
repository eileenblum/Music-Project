The sands of time remains as they never was
Flames of perdition light up the sky
Shades of grey descend upon me
A silent breath takes me away

Visions of the past
Memories long forgotten
Forever enshrouded
In this silver portrait

Visions of the past
Memories long forgotten
Forever enshrouded
In this silver portrait

A symphony of the damned
A portrait painted silver
So pale and pure
I begin to shiver

Visions of the past
Memories long forgotten
Forever enshrouded
In this silver portrait

Visions of the past
Memories long forgotten
Forever enshrouded
In this silver portrait

As whispers fill the air
You are gone, never to return
Afraid of my voice
I build my funeral pyre
I am doomed, by the sparks of this silvery fire

Through the forest of dreams
From the depth of night

Reveries form within
From the moment in which you die
The wrath of ages
The silver portrait of light

Suffocating, helpless as I fall again
Behold as they vanish in front of your eyes
United in blood
Now worlds apart

Like angels you appear
Shattered by the shadows of fear
Forever eternal, forever ephemeral

Fly away into realms unknown
Unveil what was forbidden and never shown
Take your leave from reality
And claim the land of the dead

For you are my guide
Among the brightest of stars
Through the endless river
Towards the moonlit sky!
