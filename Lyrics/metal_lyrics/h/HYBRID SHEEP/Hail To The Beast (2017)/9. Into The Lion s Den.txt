Follow me my dear,

The night has just begun, the time has come for me to play.  
Letâs spill a little of your blood.

One last drink at my place, to the sanctum of the beast.  
Poor little sheep, walking into the lionâs den.

Into the Lionâs Den.

Submissive dog.  Bitches have to learn.

Lovely doll, full of self-pity, the pale color of your skin turns to vermillion.
Dazzled by the glint of the candle in the scalpel:  The show begins.  

Itâs thee and me.

Taking pleasure from your torments, torture is my favorite entertainment.   
I am the master of murder and you will discover my skills.

Broken little thing.  Submissive dog.  Tiny little pieces.  Bitches have to learn.

Broken little thing, itâs thee and me.
Tiny little pieces , itâs thee and me.
