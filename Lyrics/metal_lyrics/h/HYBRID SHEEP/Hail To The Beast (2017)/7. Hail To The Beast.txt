Pray poor miserable sheep, if god is your shepherd, then I am the wolf.  
Fear the raid of the horde, my hunger is endless in the middle of the herd.

I can see so many horrible things, committed by believers through the dark age of man.  An era of war and bloodshed.  Burn in the flames of the holocaust.

Look at this sad old world:  It seems that your god has left his dominion.  
I donât want you to fear me, I want you to embrace me of your own volition.

Hail to the Beast.

I am the death knell, I am the end of days.

Feed on dust and superstitions, prophecies I shall unveil.  
And then all light will end and the world will leave in the darkness.  

Since the dawn of time, you still learn the language, I write the bloody book.
The air will be pestilence and our brethren, the night creatures will 
emerge and feed.

Hail to the Beast.

I am the death knell, I am the end of days.

Pray poor miserable sheep, if god is your shepherd, then I am the wolf.  
Fear the raid of the horde, my hunger is endless in the middle of the herd.
