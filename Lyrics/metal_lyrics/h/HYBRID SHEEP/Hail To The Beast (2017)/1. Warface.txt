King of lies, lord of misery.  Under the flag of ignorance and hate. 
Creating another nightmare to bring us down.

Shall we let cities burn? Become the oppressor, the enemy at the gates.  
Are we to blind to learn?  In the name of god, in the name of gold.

This is the true face of war.

Feeding a machine that brings us death, humanity at its best.
No apathy for the human race, the greediness shows itâs face.

Eye for an eye and the world will be blind.  This is the true face of war  Annihilation of populations.  This is the true face of war.

The behind the scenes machinations of big money and politics are so well hidden from most of the population.  

They will tell you any shit you want to hear.  They will lie like hell.  
Playing with your doubts and your fears.  They will lie like hell.

Eye for an eye and the world will be blind.  This is the true face of war.  Annihilation of populations.  This is the true face of war.

They will lie like hell.  
Playing with your doubts and your fears.  They will lie like hell.
