Begging for your life, you are dealing with the wrong man
Iâve searched for the most appropriate sentence, my hate was so elevated, I never wished this on my worst enemy before you.

Dig your own tomb. Dig deeper. 
You know youâll soon be buried alive.

As the time passes you realize the gravity of the situation youâre in. 
The last hours you are breathing.

Dig your own tomb.  Dig deeper. 
You know youâll soon be buried alive.

No need to apologize, to try to buy me, to implore or cry.
No need to apologize, your reckoning was a matter of time.

You have been buried alive. 
Six feet under, you beg for your life.

All your screams wonât be heard, no need to bleed to suffer.

I am judge, jury and executioner.

Purging the earth of a parasite, putting the garbage in the trash.
You are punching the top of the box youâre trapped in.  
Crying, imploring a god whoâll never come.

Stuck in a sarcophagus, psychological torments.  
Beat the lid, try to open up the coffin:  
In vain.  Exhausted.  Extreme panic.  Premature burial.

You have been buried alive. 
Six feet under, you beg for your life.

You have been buried alive.

Stuck in a sarcophagus, psychological torments.  
Beat the lid, try to open up the coffin: 
In vain.  Exhausted.  Extreme panic.  Premature burial.
