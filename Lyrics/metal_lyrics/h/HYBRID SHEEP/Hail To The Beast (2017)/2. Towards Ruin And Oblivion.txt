Human beings are a repellent creation.  Convinced that weâre a superior species.  An endless appetite for death and destruction, leading this world  towards ruin and oblivion.  Programmed to ravage and defile, to betray and kill.
Like a virus or infection, we spread ourselves on this earth, devouring everything in our path.  As technology advances, the more we lose ourselves. Hidden behind our masks, a disgraceful masquerade.

We should not exist.  Weâre such a shame to the gift of life.  
We are malicious creatures.  Our mouth is full of lies.

Marking this world with our cloven hooves, good and evil braided be.

The sacred books are so well written that some of us still believe in a god.  
They still believe that once the end will come, heaven will open up its gates.

Obsessed by the goals weâll never reach, we are barely living.
A fascination for the morbid, living this life like an eternal mourning.

We should not exist.  Weâre such a shame to the gift of life.  
We are malicious creatures.  Our mouth is full of lies.

The sacred books are so well written that some of us still believe in a god.  
They still believe that once the end will come, heaven will open up its gates.
