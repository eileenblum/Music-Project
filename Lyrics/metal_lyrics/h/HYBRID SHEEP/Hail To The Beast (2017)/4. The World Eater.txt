There was a great earthquake.  
The sun turned black, like sackcloth made of goat hair.

Call me world eater or bringer of death, I am the man your god did not create. I am the beast rising out of the sea, with blasphemous names on itâs head. Human beings owe me their allegiance and should kneel upon my will.  
Sit on my throne I shall rule this world.

Can you hear the cries of humanity broken into pieces?  
This beautiful choir of agony, pain and fear.

Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains as the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind.

Can you hear the cries of humanity broken into pieces? 
This beautiful choir of agony, pain and fear.

Call me world eater or bringer of death, I am the man your god did not create. I am the beast rising out of the sea, with blasphemous names on itâs head.
Human beings owe me their allegiance and should kneel upon my will.  
Sit on my throne I shall rule this world.
