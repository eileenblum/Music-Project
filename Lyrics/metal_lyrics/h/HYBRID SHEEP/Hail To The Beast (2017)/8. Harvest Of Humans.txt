A fleet of starships has entered our atmosphere, full of a breed descending to earth to eradicate humanity.
We were far from imagining that our civilization would disappear like this.

Unprepared, our weapons are ineffective.

They poisoned the earth to suffocate us, waiting to see us slowly die;  they will win this invasion without a fight killing from their ship with mysterious lights

Let the harvest begin!  Forget the belief, theyâre the only thing above.

This planet has become a slaughterhouse to these malignant creatures.
We can only watch them burn this world, killing anything alive.

Lacerating the sky, vessels with malevolent designs.
Full of a breed descending to earth to eradicate mankind.
Lacerating the sky, vessels with malevolent designs.
Hypnotic lights through the night.

Unprepared, our weapons are ineffective.

They poisoned the earth to suffocate us, waiting to see us slowly die;  they will win this invasion without a fight killing from their ship with mysterious lights.

Let the harvest begin!  Forget the belief, theyâre the only thing above.
