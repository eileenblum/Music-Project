[lyrics: Syndel]

Please...
I really want some more
You promised me...
I took a little gore
And you left me
The more you want it
The more obsessed you end up being
(The more obsessed you will be)
Run into my veins
Share this flesh with me
In my blood you can sail
Scare me
You hurt me, I love you
(This shade redraws your lust)
You hit me, I heat you
(Shows this heart I've just rust)
You leave me, I live in you
So I'll let the serpent free
And let temptation be
Face you holy fucking sins
Preach and leave all your creeds
Preach and leave all your creeds
It's not time to make it
Dozens of lives are with me
The more you want it
(the more obsessed you'll be)
Run into my veins
Share this flesh with me
Despite your good behavior
I ain't give you a chance
Things like this are so hard
You leave me, I live in you

You kill me, I need you more...
