[lyrics: D.V.]

Your pride paint the sky with a bitter emptiness
Enter my cold world of desire
Close the embrace with my heart
Whispering the infinite
My children spread my shadow
When they awake
Look into my powerful eyes
It hurts you
You need me like I almost need you
Turn off the light and I grow more
I made your beauty with my own hands
My voice only guides them to you
So you master of reborn
Forgot I am I since the beginning of times
I made you to walk with me
In the corner of the minds
Together we could kill the king
And we could be one forever
My divided
Look at yourself and see me
Flying through your wishes and desires
Crying too when they awake
And I never sleep...

The Brazilian dark metal band HERMIT AGE is releasing their first full length, titled Sinnocence, after eight years of activities.
Sinnocence brings some experiments in dark metal, embedded in a gothic atmosphere, but heavy songs, and also an industrial reference.
It sounds exactly like nothing you have heard before.
The one man's band created by Diego Voges after a little time on hold, is back now with Syndel (which stamps the album cover) on vocals too.
