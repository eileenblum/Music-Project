[lyrics: D.V.]

Do we come from where those dreams come?
Do we come from here? Yeah

Innocence bleed innocence

So can't you see the fear? Yes you can see the way....
A voice to forgive.... to forgive...

Oh immortality

Servants of the shining king are keeping the reflex of lake
A light that can rape all my pure vortex of sin

Into this winter shining they are so unreal on me
Attractive Phobia to embrace

The immortality

The queen reality is trying to betray the king...
She is taking all the pleasure of moonlight
And recreating to our side.... all the colors of the night

On immortality
