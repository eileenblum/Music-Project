Waking up from a dream
This is not what it seemed
Can you tell me the state that Iâm in?
Is it all in my head?
Am I alive, am I dead?
I am caught here somewhere in between

All my life Iâve wondered
Where do we go?
Maybe thereâs more to this life?

Lead me into the light
Be my guide
Through the passage to the other side
Whatâs behind?
May I find peace of mind?
Lost and alone
On my own
As I enter the gates where Iâll go
Into the unknown
Earthbound spirit

Suddenly I was gone
I had so much left undone
Few are fortunate enough to bid farewell
Always afraid our lives would part
All my life it hurt inside my heart
What the future holds we never can tell

All my life Iâve wondered
Where do we go?
Maybe thereâs more to this life?

Lead me into the light
Be my guide
Through the passage to the other side
Whatâs behind?
May I find peace of mind?
Lost and alone
On my own
As I enter the gates where Iâll go
Into the unknown
Earthbound spirit

"I can see you, I can hear you
Can you feel my presence here?
I try to reach you, try to get through
Need to tell you how I feel..."

All my life Iâve wondered
Where do we go?
Maybe thereâs more to this life?

Lead me into the light
Be my guide
Through the passage to the other side
Whatâs behind?
May I find peace of mind?
Lost and alone
On my own
As I enter the gates where Iâll go
Into the unknown
Earthbound spirit

Earthbound spirit
Earthbound spirit...
