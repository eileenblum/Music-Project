The dark truth unknown to the innocent child
Without any worries to trouble the mind
We live for the moment when we are young
Without any thoughts for the days to come
The immortal illusion withers and dies
With the awareness of this mortal life

Donât want to leave with deeds undone
Donât want to go with words unspoken
Donât wanna be a memory
Donât want to live to see my line broken

Ghosts of night come crawling
From the dark side of your mind
"Iâll be gone forever"
A cold chill creeping from behind
That makes you realize
The limitation of life

Time flows like a river to the sea
Nothing can ever last eternally
Thatâs the beauty and sadness of life
When you discover, it cuts you like a knife
The part we all play will be over one day
All those whoâd love to live fade away

Donât want to leave with deeds undone
Donât want to go with words unspoken
Donât wanna be a memory
Donât want to live to see my line broken

Ghosts of night come crawling
From the dark side of your mind
"Iâll be gone forever"
A cold chill creeping from behind
That makes you realize
The limitation of life

If we could live forever and a day
Would we appreciate life the same way?
If future was past
What would you do if today was your last?

Donât want to leave with deeds undone
Donât want to go with words unspoken
Donât wanna be a memory
Donât want to live to see my line broken

Ghosts of night come crawling
From the dark side of your mind
"Iâll be gone forever"
A cold chill creeping from behind
That makes you realize
The limitation of life

Ghosts of night come crawling
From the dark side of your mind
"Iâll be gone forever"
A cold chill creeping from behind
That makes you realize
The limitation of life
