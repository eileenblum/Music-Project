Come on down to fairground zero
Holy coward - you  ainât no hero
All aboard the holocauster ride
This ainât no amusement attraction
Itâs your dead-end destination
Better be blessed, no God will be your guide

A one-way ticket to hell
You wonât live to tell
Kamikaze carousel

Get ready to die for
Your sins of holy terror
No God can save your souls
On the holocauster ride
By suicide or sacrifice
Escape to fools paradise
No honour to die for
The promised land lie

Blind faith - the spell youâre under
No will - I have no wonder
You never question why you pray with fire
Satan is your host for the evening
A warm welcome is what youâre receiving
Youâre all invited to your funeral pyre

Iâll read you fairytales
Of war alibis
From your book of lies

Get ready to die for
Your sins of holy terror
No God can save your souls
On the holocauster ride
By suicide or sacrifice
Escape to fools paradise
No honour to die for
The promised land lie

A one-way ticket to hell
You wonât live to tell
Kamikaze carousel

Get ready to die for
Your sins of holy terror
No God can save your souls
On the holocauster ride
By suicide or sacrifice
Escape to fools paradise
No honour to die for
The promised land lie

No choice of hell or paradise
The promised landâs a lie
There is no honour to die
On the holocauster ride
