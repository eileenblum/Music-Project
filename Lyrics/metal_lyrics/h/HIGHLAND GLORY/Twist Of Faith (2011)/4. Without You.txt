A new sunrise
Through babyâs eyes
The innocence of a newborn child

We finally see
Itâs all so clear
Reveal the reason to be

I wish I could be there
Every step of the way
My dear

Without love there to guide me
And to follow me through
Without you there beside me

And to follow me through
Iâd be lost in this world
Without you
Iâd be lost in this world
Without you

Someone to care
Iâm always there
To shelter you from the storm

To watch you grow
A lifetime to love
But someday Iâll have to let go

I wish I could be there
Every step of the way
My dear

Without love there to guide me
And to follow me through
Without you there beside me

Without love there to guide me
And to follow me through
Without you there beside me

Without love there to guide me
And to follow me through
Without you there beside me
