How heavy the burden
The weight of the cross that you bear
How much pain and misfortune
Must be thrown your way?

What may raise the question?
A shadow of doubt in your mind
Upon your faith and beliefs
Turn the truth into lie

Sometimes you may wonder
If things were meant to be
Surely something
More than we can see
I believe our choices
Forge our path by weight of will
A ghost of chances
More than design of destiny

There is a thin line
Between love and hate
Belief and twist of faith
Garden of heathen
When love turns to hate
Thereâs a twist of faith

(A thin line between true love and hate)
(Between belief and a twist of faith)

(A thin line between true love and hate)
(Between belief and a twist of faith)

(A thin line between true love and hate)
(Between belief and a twist of faith)

(A thin line between true love and hate)
(Between belief and a twist of faith)

No futureâs decided
No path that was chosen for you
No faith undivided
Or a tide that canât turn

I donât believe thereâs a reason
No tragedies were meant to be
Just luck out of season
No guiding hand of destiny

Sometimes you may wonder
If things were meant to be
Surely something
More than we can see
I believe our choices
Forge our path by weight of will
A ghost of chances
More than design of destiny

There is a thin line
Between love and hate
Belief and twist of faith
Garden of heathen
When love turns to hate
Thereâs a twist of faith

(A thin line between true love and hate)
(Between belief and a twist of faith)

(A thin line between true love and hate)
(Between belief and a twist of faith)

(A thin line between true love and hate)
(Between belief and a twist of faith)

(A thin line between true love and hate)
(Between belief and a twist of faith)

(A thin line between true love and hate)
(Between belief and a twist of faith)

(A thin line between true love and hate)
(Between belief and a twist of faith)

(A thin line between true love and hate)
(Between belief and a twist of faith)

(A thin line between true love and hate)
