So many dangers and threats in this world
No one can ever feel safe and secure
Heaven and hell is right here on earth
Thereâs so much pain man must endure

One life - one shot
One chance to live out your dreams
Death comes to knock at your door
While weâre sleepwalking down dead-end streets

As long as our childrenâs not safe in these streets
Paradise is a dying illusion
As long as innocent people are killed

Earth is a long way from Eden
When religion, the power and fortune you gain
Is worth more than the lives that we made
More than the sacrificed victims you slain
Weâre still a far cry from freedom

Nothing is sacred and never will be
There are no tears to wash away all our sins
All the injustice throughout history
Who can replace all their wasted years

One life - one shot
One chance to live out your dreams
Death comes to knock at your door
While weâre sleepwalking down dead-end streets

As long as our childrenâs not safe in these streets
Paradise is a dying illusion
As long as innocent people are killed

One life - one shot
One chance to live out your dreams
Death comes to knock at your door
While weâre sleepwalking down dead-end streets

As long as our childrenâs not safe in these streets
Paradise is a dying illusion
As long as innocent people are killed
