Iâll lead you into temptation
Like sirens call your name
Drawn towards this new sensation
Once more you play the game

Give in to satisfaction
This new attraction
Youâll never be the same
Youâll never wanna miss
You canât resist
Youâll be cominâ back again

Iâm gonna take you higher
Iâm gonna make you scream
Your dark dreams of desire
Surrender to your wildest dreams
Donât try to stop this feeling
The passion in your heart
Iâll make you start believing
Weâll never be apart

Iâve been waiting forever for someone like you
Iâve been waiting forever for my dreams to come true
Iâve been waiting forever for someone like you
Iâve been waiting forever for my dreams to come true

In the temple of temptation
The island of your dreams
Mesmerized by seduction
Under my spell of sin

Tonight I own your soul
You lose control
Youâre ready to release
The urge you feel inside
It canât be denied
Youâll do just as I please

Iâm gonna take you higher
Iâm gonna make you scream
Your dark dreams of desire
Surrender to your wildest dreams
Donât try to stop this feeling
The passion in your heart
Iâll make you start believing
Weâll never be apart

Iâve been waiting forever for someone like you
Iâve been waiting forever for my dreams to come true
Iâve been waiting forever for someone like you
Iâve been waiting forever for my dreams to come true

Iâm gonna take you higher
Iâm gonna make you scream
Your dark dreams of desire
Surrender to your wildest dreams
Donât try to stop this feeling
The passion in your heart
Iâll make you start believing
Weâll never be apart

Iâve been waiting forever for someone like you
Iâve been waiting forever for my dreams to come true
Iâve been waiting forever for someone like you
Iâve been waiting forever for my dreams to come true
