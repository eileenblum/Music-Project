I was sent here all alone
To defend my masters throne
To fight evil and to clear my name
In a distant past
I was framed by my friends
And sentenced to a life in hell

So now I am here
I will fight for king and freedom
Join me or fear me
The choice is yours to see

Now I got one last chance to be free
Oh forever in this kingdom
I will clear my past to reveal
Oh the enemys treason

I got one last chance
To have all my dreams
Of peace come to real
Release all my wrath
All my pain I no longer feel

So now I am here
I will fight for king and freedom
Join me or fear me
The choice is yours to see

Now I got one last chance to be free
Oh forever in this kingdom
I will clear my past to reveal
Oh the enemys treason

Always fear me?
You can`t hear me?

Always fear me, you can`t hear me, don`t stay in my way
Look behind you, I will find you, time to face the truth

So now I am here
I will fight for king and freedom
Join me or fear me
The choice is yours to see

Now I got one last chance to be free
Oh forever in this kingdom
I will clear my past to reveal
Oh the enemys treason.
