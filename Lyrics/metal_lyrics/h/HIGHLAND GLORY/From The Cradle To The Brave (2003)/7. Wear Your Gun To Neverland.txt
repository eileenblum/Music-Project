There`s terror in the middle east
A mighty beast has been unleashed
Doomsday has arrived for the deceivers
In timebomb-temples; loaded prayers
Religions clash - jihad`s declared
That`s the duty call for all believers

[Bridge:]
Like father, son and the holy ghost
Tell me the one you hate the most
Where do you hide when the walls cave in
Pray to forgive your mortal sin

[Chorus:]
Wear your gun to neverland
Another soldier, another man
Victim of religions killing hand
Led into the promised land

Like father, son and brother
Dying for the honour
Hate burns in their hearts, their lives are torn apart
Peace is nowhere to be found
No freedom on this sacred ground
Rage runs through their veins, observing family remains

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
Wear your gun to neverland
Another soldier, another man
Victim of religions killing hand
Led into the promised land
Wear your gun to neverland
Another soldier, another man
Victim of religions killing hand
Buried in the desert sand

Minds are brainwashed from their birth
To serve Gods will down here on earth
Follow the book by every lie
True believers are born to die
Minds are brainwashed from their birth
To serve Gods will down here on earth
Follow the book by every lie
True believers are gonna die

And the heavens cried a crimson rain
In neverland you`ll feel no pain
This war of faith no one will win
Wounds cut deep beyond the skin
Tattoo of terror, scars that never heal
Minds are brainwashed from their birth

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
