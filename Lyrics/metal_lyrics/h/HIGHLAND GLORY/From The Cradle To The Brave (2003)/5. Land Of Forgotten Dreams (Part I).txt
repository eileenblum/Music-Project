Welcome take a hold of my hand
I`ll take you to a far away land
Inside your fantasies
Places beyond reality

Just leave your life behind
And follow the wizards sign
You can see it flashing over the skies
In a place where you will never die

[Bridge:]
So come follow me
And I`ll let you see
There are things in our dreams
That with faith become real

[Chorus:]
There is magic in our hearts
There is magic in our dreams
Just let yourself go
Let your powers flow
In the land of forgotten dreams
There are darkness in our hearts
There are darkness in our dreams
Just let yourself go
Let your powers flow
In the land of forgotten dreams

Don`t be afraid to show your fear
Some frightening voices you will hear
But you never again will see
What you call reality

To this dreamland we have come
To make all darkness be undone
Pain and suffering will all end
We are forever here

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

On the wings of fantasy we will ride
To a land of faith and a land of light
To the land of darkness and hate we have come
We will never go home
You know this place
You`ve seen it before
Take your step and enter the door
To the land of forgotten dreams we have come
We will never go home

[Chorus]

Don`t be afraid to go
Into the land of forgotten dreams
Don`t be afraid to go
Into the land of forgotten dreams
Oh, don`t be afraid to go
Into the land of forgotten dreams
Don`be afraid to go
Into the land of forgotten dreams
