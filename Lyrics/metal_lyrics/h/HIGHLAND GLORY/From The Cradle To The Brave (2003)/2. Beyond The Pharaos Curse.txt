Out in the desert many years ago
Two lovers were living in sin
Worst of all curses the pharaos gift
To be living as dead for eternity

Beware of the magic that dwells in dimensions
Beware of the curses that rules in this world
Beware of the magic that spells in the ancient
Beware of the curses that rules in this world

Lifetimes after the curse is awakened
There is no life to be spared
His only wish is to unite to his true love
Rule the world by her side

Beware of the magic that dwells in dimensions
Beware of the curses that rules in this world
Beware of the magic that spells in the ancient
Beware of the curses that rules in this world

The warriors were battling for evil to vanish
To the realms of death
Slaughter of innocence claiming their souls
The curse begins to fall

Beware of the magic that dwells in dimensions
Beware of the curses that rules in this world
Beware of the magic that spells in the ancient
Beware of the curses that rules in this world

That rules in this world
In this world
And the curse, the curse begins to fall
It falls, and the curse begins to fall
To fall, and the curse begins to fall
