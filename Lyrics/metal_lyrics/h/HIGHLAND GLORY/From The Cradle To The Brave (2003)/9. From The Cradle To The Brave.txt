Born in a land of corruption and war
Sworn to give peace and a justice for all
Without a fear in his heart he will fight
Memories of slaughter and screams in the night

[Bridge:]
He gave us hope that we once again will be free
Fight for us all

[Chorus:]
It is the hero in his heart that will lead us the way
His land he will defend, from eternity `til end
With his sword in hand, he`ll ride across the land
As he rise from the cradle to the brave

Tales of the chosen one that will arive
Born to be leader, he must stay alive
He gathered an army to ride into battle
Out on the highlands, they are the masters

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

The battle is over, this round is won
Brave man returns to his home, all alone
His wife has been killed and his house burned down
His anger and rage has no end

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
