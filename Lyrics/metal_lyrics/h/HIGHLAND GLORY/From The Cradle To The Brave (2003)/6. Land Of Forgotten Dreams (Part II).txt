In this land something dark begins to rise
The evil brings desperation
A quest for our freedom, a quest for our dreams
Fighting for eternity we will win

[Bridge:]
Glory forever, surrender we`ll never
In this hour for our power

[Chorus:]
Fight for the power of fantasy
In your heart that will bring dark to fall
It`s the strength of your soul
It`s your destiny`s call
This night decides it all

Open your minds
Open your eyes
Behind the wall of death
There are secrets and lies
We have come to fight
We`ll take it back
In this land of forgotten dreams
We will attack

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
