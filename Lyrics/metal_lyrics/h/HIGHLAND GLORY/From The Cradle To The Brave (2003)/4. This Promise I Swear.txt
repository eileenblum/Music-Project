You cast a spell on me
The first time I ever felt your caress
I turned around to see
Love at first sight my princess
I stood there paralyzed
You appeared like a vision divine to me
My heart had realized
I had to make you mine

You, you left a mark
Too deep in my heart
How could I forget you
You disappeared
I shouldn't have feared
If our paths would be crossing again
You`re mine 'till the end

All my dreams became true
Can't believe that I've finally found you
Without you by my side
Wouldn`t know how to ever get by
All my life I'll be true
There`s no question my faith is in you
I'll be there by your side
'cos in me you can truly confide

I had everything I could ask
Except who I really needed
When I laid my eyes on you
The path of my future revealed
Through all our days of sunshine and rain
I'll be your guide through the joy and pain
I swear this sacred vow
A promise to love you forever

You, you hold the key
You make me see
You`re my hearts desire
Angel of delight
Love of my life
You`re the answer to all of my prayers
This promise I swear

All my dreams became true
Can't believe that I've finally found you
Without you by my side
Wouldn`t know how to ever get by
All my life I'll be true
There`s no question my faith is in you
I'll be there by your side
'cos in me you can truly confide

My dark princess of light
I`ll be your knight
Proudly I`ll stand by your side
Shining so bright
Holding you tight
Close `till the day when we die
`till death us unite

All my dreams became true
Can't believe that I've finally found you
Without you by my side
Wouldn`t know how to ever get by
All my life I'll be true
There`s no question my faith is in you
I'll be there by your side
'cos in me you can truly confide
