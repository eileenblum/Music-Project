Leaning back to hear your voice
IÂ´m changing personality
CanÂ´t close my eyes again
IÂ´m scared of what that I might be

Stand up to finish my job
And what they donÂ´t know
I am immortal this time

I canÂ´t believe that youÂ´ve fallen for my lie
This time IÂ´m alive, and you wonÂ´t even sense me
You are afraid that you wonÂ´t make it through
This time IÂ´m alive, and forever endeavour this time

Come closer now, donÂ´t be afraid
Maybe youÂ´ll see the wair inside my head
You see the demons in my eyes
Little child donÂ´t try to hide

This time, forever this time
Oh, forever endeavour this time
