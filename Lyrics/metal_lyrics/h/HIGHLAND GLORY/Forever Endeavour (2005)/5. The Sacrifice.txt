I can see the wrongs that I have done
In this life or the next
My demons will be gone
Thinking through the crimes of my past life
The people that's been hurt
Wrong thinks that can be right

You can be good, free your soul, let it go...

In my dreams I have seen
The damnation become real
Without love or a heart
No life could ever start
Emptiness is what you'd find in me

If I stop and listen for awhile
The words may sound so right
My soul might sill be saved
I can hear she's talking to me now
Her voice is far away
Her warmth is always near

You can be good... I can be good
Free your soul... Can't free my soul
Let it go... Can't let it go

I can hear she's talking to me now
Her voice is far away
Her warmth is always near
I can see the wrongs that I have done
In this life or the next, my demons will be gone
