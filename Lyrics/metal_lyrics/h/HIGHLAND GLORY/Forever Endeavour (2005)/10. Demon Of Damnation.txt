"Have I lost my mind... Why I am here?"

Born as a man, resurrected as a God
Born as a man, resurrected as a God

"As IÂ´m writing this... This might be my last words"

Cazing at the ground, left here all alone
My spiritÂ´s leaving me
I cry for help out here, no one will ever hear
My familyÂ´s grieving over me

I fall to the ground as I pray for silence
For this peace IÂ´ve found, I can never regain trust again
Can I be that man that you all obey
Have I lost my mind?

"Come to me and give to me your soul"
I heard him say
"Fall down to your knees and forever be my slave"
I will be your servant

Obey me servant
Born as a man, resurrected as a God
Heaven or beyond
Damnation is here between spacer and time
Beginning of the end
DonÂ´t fear now my friend
