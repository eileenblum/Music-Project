Falling into the greatest temptation of me
Oh no I never invited them in
To take a hold of my soul, oh no
When I am waiting for me to be mortal
I have a lot of sins to repent

I can't wait for the afterlife to take me by the neck
And into the forsaken places I have never been
As I float into the underworld, my face must not be seen
As I'm living this mindgame masquerade
As I'm living this mindgame masquerade

Spitting me in the face, you bastards!
You will regret if I never provoked you to
Be anything that you are, oh no
Oh no, I'm laughing but inside I'm crying
Is this the truth of my life, oh no?

I can't wait for this day
To end the things wont ever be the same
Got my may into real life
Behind my mask lies fear

I am living this mindgame masquerade
