Breathe - as I find myself in deep despair
Only trying to stand up from the ground
Fear - is taking a hold on me
Bring me to my suppressed and locked up dreams

Stand up - I mut convince that IÂ´m not insane
That this world on the other side is real
Pain - I iwll tolerate and not give up
When my challenge is over I am God

He has been poisoned with nothing but lies
And one day it may be too late

Break the silence
Wake from the illusion
That you will be greater than God
Find the reason of life
Or else you may find the way
That will lead you to nothing but death

IÂ´m king - you will see that I am not insane
I will prove to the world, one day youÂ´ll see
Believe - in the kingdom that is soon to come
All believers will live the rest must die

I tried to talk to him, he wouldnÂ´t listen
Is there a chance for this soul?
