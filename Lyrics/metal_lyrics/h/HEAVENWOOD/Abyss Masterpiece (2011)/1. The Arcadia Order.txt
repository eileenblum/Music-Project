Embrace me and read them the words that I can't spell
Seduce me, abuse me with the love I never felt
As I ask for more

As I ask for more

The Arcadia Order
Once a fairytale
Where words and love duel
The Arcadia Order
Breaking the shell
Where words and love duel

As I ask for more

The Arcadia Order
Once a fairytale
Where words and love duel
The Arcadia Order
Breaking the shell
Where words and love duel
