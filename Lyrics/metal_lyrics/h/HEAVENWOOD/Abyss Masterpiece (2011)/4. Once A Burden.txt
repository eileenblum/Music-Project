You... You fall asleep, laying down she...
Anxious dream for a burden relief

Seal the world with a word that's not yours
Heal the future with the past undone

What is left for me?
Just a burden from your false words
What is left for me?
Just a burden from your false words

I... I'll set you free, drink bumblebee
Honey from me for a burden relief

Seal the world with a word that's not yours
Heal the future with the past undone

Burden

What is left for me?
Just a burden from your false words
What is left for me?
Just a burden from your false words

What is left for me?
Just a burden from your false words
What is left for me?
Just a burden from your false words
