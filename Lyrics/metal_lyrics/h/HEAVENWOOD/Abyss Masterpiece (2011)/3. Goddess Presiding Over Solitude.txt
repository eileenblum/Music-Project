Kind shade, o' melancholy deity,
Draw near, and take this joy away from me,
For it perturbs my heart's soft quietude

Goddess...

Do not deprive, o' Nymph, my inward mood
Of the sweet sadness of your company,

For she must sigh for you unceasingly
Whose only solace in your love's imbued

Goddess presiding over solitude
Goddess...
Goddess presiding over solitude
Goddess...

Without her sorrow piercing deeper still
Pay heed, o' Nymph, to what I beg you

For she must sigh for you unceasingly
Whose only solace in your love's imbued
Delay the moment not a moment more,
The sweet sad days that I so sadly fill

Goddess presiding over solitude
Goddess...
