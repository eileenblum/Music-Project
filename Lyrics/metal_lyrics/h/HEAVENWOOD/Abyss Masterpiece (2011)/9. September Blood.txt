You didn't know that dreams are real
The miracle never yet done
And when all rules are breaking up
You find all strength when you stop

You could have been so unreal
Because all your dreams would help you
You should have hope in what you feel
Not coming...

They can't bring you down
While you dream September Blood
When all things erase the truth... Brings you youth

They can't bring you down
While you dream September Blood
When all things erase the truth... Brings you youth

September Blood... Your Eyes... They shed September Blood

You didn't know how to cast a dream
The thoughts and promises we've shared
When veils of silence lay you down
You ask yourself who you are

You could have been so unreal
Because all your dreams would help you
You should had hope in what you feel
Not coming...

They can't bring you down
While you dream September Blood
When all things erase the truth... Brings you youth

They can't bring you down
While you dream September Blood
When all things erase the truth... Brings you youth
