Blessed and divine, my world your eyes
I'm distinguished
I'll never let you down

Your hand in mine, will rule the time
Autumn or Winter
I'll never let you down

They are servants at your feet
Last words from your belief
With justice by your side
False king masquerade

We touch the sky... Just for a while
I'll give you wisdom
I'll never let you down

My words will rise 'till the end of time
Always forgiving
I'll never let you down

They are servants at your feet
Last words from your belief
With justice by your side
False king masquerade
