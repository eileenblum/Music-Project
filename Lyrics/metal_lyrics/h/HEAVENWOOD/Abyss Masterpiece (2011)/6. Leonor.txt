I'll sing a day of sadness
In terms so tender and wistful
Demanding the delighted envious
Stop lamenting the moans of sorrow

I will relent my inner strength on the mountains
Exhaling sighs so complainants
That neither the cavernous rocks
Would repeat the same

And then she smiles again... Dream Leonor

Her world she hides again... Dream Leonor
Her world collides
Dream Leonor

Hills, cliffs, logs, trees,
Bird, bridge, mountains and flowers, chain,
Weeping love plots with me

And I adore a soul that doesn't feel
Keep your treacherous secrets my love
As I pour my woes to no avail

And then she smiles again... Dream Leonor
Her world she hides again... Dream Leonor
Her world collides
Dream Leonor
