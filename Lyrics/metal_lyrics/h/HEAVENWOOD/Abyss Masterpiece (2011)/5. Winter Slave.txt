Silence feeds this broken heart
Corrosive days and dead beliefs
Nature followed... A hidden sight
Singing words that belong to me

Feathers on fire
Inspiring desire
These words are from the same
Love is indeed insane

Slow down, emotions slaying me
Sundown, breathless horizon  Ocean's grave
I throw a kiss, my fate
Winter Slave

Feathers on fire
Inspiring desire
These words are from the same
Love is indeed...

Cryptic gestures on a tree
A tender hug would set me free

Sadness forgives the madness
Father I'm restless
Upon the hunter chase in my believes
Caress, my words are deathless
Father I'm helpless
Only your letters bring a deep relief

Sadness forgives the madness
Father I'm restless
Upon the hunter chase in my believes
Caress, my words are deathless
Father I'm helpless
Only your letters bring a deep relief

Slow down, emotions slaying me
Sundown, breathless horizon  Ocean's grave
I throw a kiss, my fate

Slow down, emotions slaying me
Sundown, breathless horizon  Ocean's grave
I throw a kiss, my fate
Winter Slave
