My heart is redeemed, once summer defeated,
By the flowers laid to rest until it last

Fall, fall into pieces now
Collecting my emotions as I bury them 'till dawn

Falling
Fading Sun
Falling
Fading Sun

Autumn inspiring my deepest desires
To fall as flowers do from this room without a view

Fall, fall into pieces now
Collecting my emotions as I bury them 'till dawn

Falling
Fading Sun
Falling
Fading Sun
