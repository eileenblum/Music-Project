In silence I delight you
Smooth wind as we carry on
Once brightness, I caress you
Turn loose as we...

Shine or reflection
A kiss from a silk morning star
Sign of perfection
Her sweetness unleash sudden scars

Sunflower I forgive you
Wild winds as we gather on
Once frighten, I protect you
And dance as we...

Shine or reflection
A kiss from a silk morning star
Sign of perfection
Her sweetness unleash sudden scars

Shine or reflection
A kiss from a silk morning star
Sign of perfection
Her sweetness unleash sudden scars
