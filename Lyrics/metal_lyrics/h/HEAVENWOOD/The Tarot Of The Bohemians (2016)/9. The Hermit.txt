Protection, 
A place of safety 
Even when true wisdom reigns some conspiracies 

Old Man, 
The bringer of light 
Half Hidden by a majestic mantle 
In the name of humanity 

The Labour of life, 
Demanding the right way path beliefs 
Prudence and Wisdom are the fate for harmony 

The Arrow was shot 
Becoming your guidance 
Aureole imprisoned in your Lamp 
Guiding the Initiate long path 

The Hermit 

Fulfilling the function of God 
As human creative force 
Preserver and recipient 
Father and Mother 

[Lead guitar]

The Hermit 
Bringer of Light 
The Hermit
