The same old story, truth and lies. 
Someone's ambition, failed this night. 
Those backward words still in my head, 
I scream in silence, tears I shed. 

I loved you, I praised you... 
once goddess by moonlight, 
I hate you, reject you, 
I'll spit your taste tonight. 

[Lead guitar]

My name is disaster, love can be so cruel 
To sell my soul for a reason once
"I'll be there waiting for you". 
There's no more attraction, only gaps and rules, 
to sell my soul for a reason once was a lie I lived through you. 

Corageous, Outrageous... 
My kingdom now divide, 
Emotion, Corrosion 
no plans for suicide 

[Lead guitar]

My name is disaster, love can be so cruel 
To sell my soul for a reason once
" I'll be there waiting for you". 
There's no more attraction, only gaps and rules, 
to sell my soul for a reason once was a lie I lived through you 

[Lead guitar]

My name is disaster, love can be so cruel 
To sell my soul for a reason once
"I'll be there waiting for you". 

My Name is Disaster
