The hand of man in the act of Prehension, 
Grasping strongly the ideas of strength 
The first after the decade 

From the sign of life 
On one side allied 
Without a visible effort 
Closing the lion's mouth 

Strength, Intelligence and Liberty 
Courage and Authority with Strength 

[Lead guitar]

To designate 
A transitory life 
A kind of mould receiving and restoring 
every variety of form 

The Vital sign 
Upon a girl's head 
A peaceful strength using both hands 
The Lion is asleep 

From the sign of life 
On one side allied 
Without a visible effort 
Closing the lion's mouth 

Strength, Intelligence and Liberty 
Courage and Authority with Strength 
Lead Guitar 

Strength... From the sign of life 
On one side allied 
Without a visible effort 
Closing the lion's mouth 

Strength, Intelligence and Liberty 
Courage and Authority with Strength
