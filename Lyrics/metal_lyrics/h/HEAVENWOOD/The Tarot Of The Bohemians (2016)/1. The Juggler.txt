Spellbound, 
With the world once we create 
Everyday we dominate 
Unleashing Love or Hate 

Eon, 
Architects dividing faith 
Miser souls deviated 
Constellations reign 

Welcome the Future 
The Past was Present for all 
Sealing the Illusion 
Tarot of the Bohemians 

[Lead guitar]

Unity, 
The sum of every fear 
The answer always near 
The Gods have lost their gears 

Principle, 
Immorality undone 
Every man has his own throne 
But a kingdom is to come 

Welcome the Future 
The Past was Present for all 
Sealing the Illusion 
Tarot of the Bohemians 

Souls 
Answers from the odd 
laying down what is right or wrong 
life is full of comedians 
Dull, 
Is sad when you canÂ´t see 
far behind the mistakes you've done 
The Tarot of the Bohemians 

Once in a while 
Forget to be sane 
Upon the words of man's disgrace 
Every time 
Remember the day 
When you breathe for the very first time 
Souls 
Answers from the odd 
Laying down what is right or wrong 
Life is full of comedians 
Dull, 
Is sad when you canÂ´t see 
Far behind the mistakes you've done 
The Tarot of the Bohemians
