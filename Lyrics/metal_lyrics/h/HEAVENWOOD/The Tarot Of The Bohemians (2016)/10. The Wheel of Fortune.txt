The Sign of Command 
The Fore finger extended for eternity 
The Letter as manifestation 
Lastly the eternity of time 

Supremacy under the Virgo facts 
The Wheel of Fortune 
A Symbol of eternity 

Anubis to the right 
The genius of ascending will 
Thyphon to the left 
The genius of descending evil 
A line without beginning or end 
Incessant Equilibrium 
Destruction by Death 
Three Arcana with the Hindu trinity 

Supremacy under the Virgo facts 
The Wheel of Fortune 
A Symbol of eternity 

"The wheel is balanced by the Sphinx, 
Holding a sword in it's Lion Claws"
Lead guitar 
Supremacy under the Virgo facts 
The Wheel of Fortune 
A Symbol of eternity
