Three shinning Pentagrams of Gold 
Onward the Conqueror runs 
Surrounded by an Azure and Light 

Upon his shoulders the URIM 
And the THUMMIM of the sovereign 
Sacrificant with three Angles, bound 

One crescent of the moon on the right 
One crescent of the moon on the left 
In his hand a sceptre 
Surrounded by a Globe 

We crown the initiate 
With words to dominate 
Two sphinxes will collide 
The tarot will survive 
Two principles divided 
The conqueror's sword will rise 
The sacred name 
Yod of the seventh son 

Upon the Square which forms 
The front of the Chariot throne 
Surrounded by the flying Sphere 

[Lead guitar]

We crown the initiate 
With words to dominate 
Two sphinxes will collide 
The tarot will survive 
Two principles divided 
The conqueror's sword will rise 
The sacred name 
Yod of the seventh son
