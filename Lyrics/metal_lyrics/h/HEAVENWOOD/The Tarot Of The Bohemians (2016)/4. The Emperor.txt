The sceptre in the right hand 
The Helmet for the divine will 
Twelve points to Illustrate 
Creation to Re-Create 

Life will be Illustrated 
Death will be Demonstrated 
The sign of the goodmen Will 
The Helmet for the true belief 
Follow The Emperor 

Wombs of desire, birthplace for the liars, 
As the sin brigade assume the loss 
For the Predilect and Consumed 
Cradle of Fears, desires and tears 
The womb brings man a new dawn 
It limits the soul against The Law 

I, I will breed 
And bring the seed to some 
Or eternal glory to none 
I, I will love 
And give a seed to the One 
Against the Ones with a loneliness Heart 
Follow the Emperor 

[Lead guitar]

I, I will breed 
And bring the seed to some 
Or eternal glory to none 
I, I will love 
And give a seed to the One 
Against the Ones with a loneliness Heart 
Follow the Emperor
