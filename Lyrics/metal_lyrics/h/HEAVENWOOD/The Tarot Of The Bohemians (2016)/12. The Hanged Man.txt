Unfolding like the arm I am 
Connected to anything that stretches 
Once sign of expansive movement will, 
Possession is my way toâ¦ 

Dream on and Carry on 
The world is mine 
Divine 

The Hanged Man truth 
You must believe 
The wounds wonÂ´t heel 
While you donÂ´t elevate under itÂ´s will 

Prophets and Revelation 
Inspired by the revealed law 
Deceivers will be punished 
The Juggler placed like the Sun once more 

Dream on and Carry on 
The world is mine 
Divine 

The Hanged Man truth 
You must believe 
The wounds wonÂ´t heel 
While you donÂ´t elevate under itÂ´s will 

[Lead guitar]

Presumptuous faith with discipline 
The absolute submission 
Owning life to the Divine 
The sign of personality survives 
Survives...
