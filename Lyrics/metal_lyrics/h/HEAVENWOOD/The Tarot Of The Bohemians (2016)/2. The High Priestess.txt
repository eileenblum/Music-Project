Father upon the sky 
Erudition through my eyes 
A Blaze gave birth and dies 
When man became God 

You hold the truth beneath 
The realms upon my feet 
For man the midst of Nature 
Women authorities 

Her breast with the Sun 
Her eyes on the moon,
Rebirth to be soon 
Three worlds to elude, 
Nature and Love to everyone 
Sieze the day, everyday 
The law is on its way 

Father once, a law to hold 
From his mouth a flying dove 
You will find me everywhere 
Morning sun, Moon grandiose 
In her mouth, the scent of rose 
The High Priestess everywhere

Father once, a law to hold 
From his mouth a flying dove 
You will find me everywhere 
Morning sun, Moon grandiose 
In her mouth, the scent of rose 
The High Priestess everywhere

Three worlds to elude, 
Nature and Love to everyone 
Sieze the day, everyday 
The law is on its way 

Father once, a law to hold 
From his mouth a flying dove 
You will find me everywhere 
Morning sun, Moon grandiose 
In her mouth, the scent of rose 
The High Priestess everywhere 

You will find me everywhere
