Old desires, no sense for truth 
She forgot everything has a root 
One more word till the rollercoaster start 
You will find thousand ways to live without me... dead rose... and my thorns... will bleed you now 

She brings me storms 
Without me, Pain is her last resort 
Love, rise and fall 
Without me, Pain is her last resort 

Like a sharpen knife on your skin 
My last touch brings you an inner feed 
If I would ever bring you down 
You wouldn't find a god named the Sun 

She brings me storms 
Without me, Pain is her last resort 
Love, rise and fall 
Without me, Pain is her last resort 

She brings me storms 
Without me, Pain is her last resort 
Love, rise and fall 
Without me, Pain is her last resort 

When the freedom of speech falls 
And the trust is remorse 
The cult of the "Non" rises 
When the priest becomes dust 
And the rose falling down 
Pain is her last resort 

[Lead guitar]

She brings me storms 
Without me, Pain is her last resort 
Love, rise and fall 
Without me, Pain is her last resort
