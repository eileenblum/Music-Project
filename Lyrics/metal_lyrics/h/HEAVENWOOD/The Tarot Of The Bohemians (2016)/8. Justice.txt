Temple, 
A woman seen fullface 
Seated upon a throne and wearing an iron coronet 
Solar Cross, 
Divided in heartless shapes 
You are the centre between what we think that is right or wrong 

Hold your sword 
Pointing upwards 
Raising the balance with your mortal left-hand 

[Lead guitars]

Justice, 
A tribute for Man fate 
Justice, 
The Liars desperate 

Justice, 
A tribute for Man fate 
Holding the blinded truth even if 
The Liars desperate 
Sentenced words, 
Divided in heartless shapes 
Passive emotions leading all those 
Living under the Law 

Hold your sword 
Pointing upwards 
Raising the balance with your mortal left-hand
