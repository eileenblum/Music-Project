Say the same thing, 
The same you always wanted 
Hiding feelings or painting dreams in black 

Show me mercy 
Everything is forgiven 
On prehension 
Inclosing hollow minds 

Cross the ember of the dusk 
Once we were here 
Riding clouds, forbidden sights 
And disappear 
Then we look into the mind 
The answers you will find 

I'm still waiting for divine news, atheistic score 
The Empress living truth under rules from the ancient words 

I'll do everything wrong again 
And learn the abstract answers 
The Empress told me so 
I'll do everything wrong again 
And teach those who defy me 
The soulless play alone.
I am still The Empress 

Hold out to the stars 
Reveal the maps, Astrology 
From Sirius to Mars 
Fulfilling acts, atrocities 

Cross the ember of the dusk 
Once we were here 
Riding clouds, forbidden sights 
And disappear 
Then we look into the mind 
The answers you will find 

I'm still waiting for divine news, atheistic score 
The Empress living truth under rules from the ancient words 

I'll do everything wrong again 
And learn the abstract answers 
The Empress told me so 
I'll do everything wrong again 
And teach those who defy me 
The soulless play alone.
I am still The Empress 

[Lead guitar]

I'll do everything wrong again 
And learn the abstract answers 
The Empress told me so 
I'll do everything wrong again 
And teach those who defy me 
The soulless play alone.
I am still The Empress
