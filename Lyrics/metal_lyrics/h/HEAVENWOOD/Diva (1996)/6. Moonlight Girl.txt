Hey, hey, hey... now, now
Where your shadow walk alone
Hey, hey, hey... now, now
Where your heart heats no more
Hey, hey, hey... now, now
Where your soul fly away
Hey, hey, hey... now, now
Where your lips kissed the grave
But you still cry in vain
Remembering life again
You have sold your soul
To the mystic, frightning night
Girl of the unknown
I desire you now... tonight
You keep on walking alone
Through the moorish valley of dreams
You have sold your soul
To the mystic, frightning night
Girl of the unknown
I desire you now... tonight
