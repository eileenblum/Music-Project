Walking so lost
In the cold and dark forest
I gazed upon light
Shimmering in the horizont
Beyond the trees
I felt compeled
To walk into this light
Hidden beneath the bushes
I gaspes as I saw
What was creating
This gloomy sight
A woman, so fragile
And perfect lines had she
So beauty and white
Was her pretty face
She gazed upon my eyes
and called me next to her
Without thinking I obeyed
Come, come to me
Don't be afraid
With such a voice
So pure and soft
I felt so weak
Listening to her
Naked before me
Lying in the leaves so pure
She invited me to lay down
With her and touch her body
So warm and soft were her breasts
So hot was she within her legs
I sink my body within hers
I touched heaven and paradise
Her moan brought me such delight
As I never felt before
When the peak was reached
I rested beside her
So calm and happy were we
That we felt asleep
When I woke up
All alone and weary
I noticed I was in a
Clearing outside the forest
Then appeared a young girl
And she said to me:
'Beware the ghost of lady
Judith Heaven Wood
Wandering in the forest of
Heaven Wood'
Then I saw a scarf wrapped in my hand
With the inscriptions J.H.
