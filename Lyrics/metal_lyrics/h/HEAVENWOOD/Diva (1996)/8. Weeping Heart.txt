Under Doleful Skies
She was gone forever and ever
Gone without a heartful farewell
Erased for all eternity
Who blame you now?
Memories was my only joy
For a moment I feared myself
As my strength is falling down
Lost, condemned, eternally
Who blame you now?
No more tears of blood
From my mystic Queen
The one I enthroned
Goddess of my destiny
Who blame you now?
A weeping heart!
