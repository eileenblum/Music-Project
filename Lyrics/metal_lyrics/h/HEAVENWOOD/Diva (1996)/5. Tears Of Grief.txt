Hiding my feelings
So deep inside
Taking to the Outside
Cause Within I mourn
Pictures of what I used to be
Invading my thoughts
Silent whispers of past moanings
(Are) All I hear within my dreams
Now all is gone...
Embraced in solitude I am
No one to Caress my Wounds
And cherish my pain
Like a candle burning within the night
You were my light within the darkness
That surrounded my soul
In this reality you vanished
Leaving me with sorrow
Now all is gone...
