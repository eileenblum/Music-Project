The wrath of your demon
Embrace your fear and conquer my heart
The await for silence
Thy peaceful heart it's turn so dark...
You choose to walk that way
Although my deepest tear
I asked for you to stay
Twin soul is not so near
Face the day
And swallow your pride
Words to say
And to forget
The wisdom...
Was sold for free
Innocence
Maybe is lost
Innocence is lost
Torn my soul apart
Feed your freedom with scars
Let the day begin
Since the bright of your love stoped to shine
...with scars
To worship your tongue
In our fullmoon nights
The dreams of a lovelorn
Hidden under my vanity
