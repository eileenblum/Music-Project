The days are passing by
Lost time so cruel
My heart is fall apart
Every time I see you
Hard words I cannot speak
No tongue to spell it
I gazed in your smile
Since the first you did
The time is running out
I've waited so long
As the walls are falling down
(to make) her smile again
That certain way you stood
Apart from all the rest
Won't you come and show to me
Your precious smile again
The days are passing by
Time so cruel
My heart is fall apart
Every time I worship you
You are the air to me
But (without you) I can't breath
Sometimes I wonder Why
(oh why) I'm still loving you...
