Questions invading our mind
Searching for the answer to our existence
Deep in our emotional inconscience
So that we could find and could accept it
No matter what we try
No matter how we cry
It's always the end
Of our mortal life
Empty is the soul of trues
Full is our mind of lies
The answer of that it's in
The decadence of the human kind
Unquestionable expression of brutality
A reflected extortion of morality
Self destruction of humanity
Masterpiece of insanity
No matter what we try
No matter how we cry
It's always the end
Of our mortal life

[Lead: Ricardo]

Infinitive cycle
Of human remains
In silence we rest
Awaiting for the sentence
The sign of Jesus Christ
In the neverland
The ultimate word
No matter what we try
No matter how we cry
It's always the end
Of our mortal life
Empty is our soul of trues
Full is our mind of lies
The answer of that it's in
The decadence of the human kind
Unquestionable expression of brutality
A reflected extortion of morality
Self destruction of humanity
Masterpiece of insanity
