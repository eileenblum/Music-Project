This weakness I fell
It's a cause of
The human relationship
When evil prevails
I will for all eternity
Disallow life
I create the pain
I rule the anger
I ascend the sin
With the weakness of my opponent
I can feel the opulence
War, death, hunger
They conquer the mind of the human kind

[Lead: Ricardo]

Forces that I create
Illusions that I promise
I am evil
My spirit prevails on you
Resting in pure silence
I await for my recall
Reborn in a new world
Where the sin is more than you
Sentences of death
For those that fall
In my temptation nightmares
It's only what they see
Sacred religions will be banished
No one will oppose my speech
Damnation of all those kinds
A answer to the self destruction

"As Illusive As A Dream"
Promises are all they give us
Each one more rewarding than the other
Isn't it so wonderful as they tell us
Exactly what we want to hear
It's our misfortune to be
So always blind to things that
We deep inside know can't be true
That's why we're just a miserable bunch
We imagine how it would be
To live in their angelical world now
And forget the bad things in our own

[Lead: Ricardo]

Why can't people see that
their words are hollow
We are simply following
Something illusive as a dream
Why can't people stop searching
For a way of reaching the
So called "EDEN" that rents
In the other side of life
The things that they say are all
Mere ways of making them profit
From the desires they know
We've got unconsciously inside
