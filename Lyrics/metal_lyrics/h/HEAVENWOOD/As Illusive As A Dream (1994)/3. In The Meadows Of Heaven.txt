See the light and follow it
That was what they told me
Isn't it so sad
That all was a rotten lie
I have not seen any light
All that surrounded me was
A frightening cold blackness
And that something seemed a womb
I reborn out of nowhere
I can't remember a thing of what I was
All I know is that I came from the meadows
Of what people call heaven
I lived after death
I could fell as if I was one
With the universe and as if I
Could sense all the innermost
Thoughts of everyone

So I say to you
Don't believe in this shit
They often tell to you
The only certain thing
You know is that
You must take as much as
You can from this life
Cause it won't last forever
