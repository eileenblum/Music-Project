"The past is for the vessel's way my star
And we as one will heal our deepest scar"

Can you feel my tongue... Painting love in you
Can you hear my song... driving you now
Can you take my hand and ride to the neverland
Can you sing with me words no one will feel

Cause we are made from the same star

This song the road for my get away

Can you take my hand and ride to the neverland
Can you sing with me words no one will feel

Don't tell me how it's far (between) you and me
Made from the same star... Me and you

Sorrow...
A path for words escape
My senses are oppressed
So I'll write them until the dawn
Silence...
My frame for vessels
As words will conquer man's faith
I'm suspicious, the silence is all

Don't tell me how it's far (between) me and you
Made from the same star... me and you

Cause we are made from the same star
