Our wasted battle
Under the deepest softly shell
Our wicked fortune
The horizon seems despair

Arise

Six steps into the grave
Our life in exodus
A quest for mortals
A taste for all

Once was precious
As the serpent's crawl

Now suspicious
She will hang them all

Irreligious
You will feel her tongue

Stay with me in this hidden place
Where the sea was my disgrace
It's a secret that I can't find without you

Crawl
Our wasted battle
As the union falls
Our ashes are glory
For the future... To come
