Anxious to dismiss hate
Hideous rage within your fate

Sown in you

Your somewhat wits conceive
A fancy world to see

Sown in you

One step to devotion

Empires fall as flowers in autumn breeze
Deceased... Your mind bleed

Spread the seed and hang the wisdom's past
And swear... revelations when the sun burns red

One step to devotion
