Overshadowed, the moon is mine
Disconnection
Send me angels for this night
The wit and wisdom shines

They'll set you free
That blush and flourish
On was yours now's mine

Reconnection
Their inner most is hide

They'll set you free
That blush and flourish
Once was yours now's mine

Freezing moon
13th moon

On though bright, shall frown this night
Disconnection
Their souls shall find themselves alone
The wit and wisdom shine

They'll set you free
That blush and flourish
Once was yours now's mine

Reconnection
13th moon
