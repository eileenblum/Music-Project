Her scent divine against my expectations
The words she spells are fortune and disgrace
Her silence... One step into the grave
She feeds in me what others can't see
Spiral I'm now the soul I used not to be
As we are one, when flesh's hunger stroke
With her sent... one the step into the spiral

She feeds in me what others can't see
Spiral and my soul wings will now...
Foreverlaid to rest with her scent in the spiral
No more words
Just my affection
In your world I seek redemption

Ne parles pas... ressent
N'Ã©coutes pas... ressent
Ne penses pas... ressent
Ã peine... ressent
Mon amour viens ici
Je t'aime (mais) Je dois partir
