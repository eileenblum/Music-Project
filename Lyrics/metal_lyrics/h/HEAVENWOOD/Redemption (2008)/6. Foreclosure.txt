Unleash your words
Where's the promise once you believed
We walked through fire
I supposed we were one just side by side

Your skin no more
All I have the sense you died
You hanged my soul
In the same tree once we have seed

Forsaken in you
Demanding

Foreclosure (my sun stopped to shine)

No more seasons in me
