Shine on slumber
Her silky moon
Too cold to leave behind
Wretched heart unbelievable
Without exactly knowing why
She touches the sky

Delirious sweet queen of heavens
Spread its scent through the night
She fears the dark right now
Exalted murmur in the shell
A tale for the future to tell
A spell within each heart

She'll rise in every man
To bound the soul with ropes of flesh
She'll rise in every man
A spell within every human heart

Slumber

Shine on slumber

All lyrics by Ernesto Guerra and Ricardo Dias
