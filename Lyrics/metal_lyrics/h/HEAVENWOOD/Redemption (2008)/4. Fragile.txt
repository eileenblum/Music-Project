Hold me strong
Time to nail me deep down
My world so wrong
I feel my world collapsing through

You're an anchor for my dreams
Road of senses, the last for this breed
Good old efforts would be alive
Someone else has to be nailed or hide

You got to live by your own now
You got to deal and celebrate

The need for faith
