When...
When is tomorrow?
As the day seems night and the mask still in my hand
Words...
Where was your guidance
In the night, the wounds I bleed for the sins you need

Meet me through the hollow

Remember yesterday
As I'm painted in black
The wounds I bleed for the sins you need

Obsolete

Today I forgive you... But tomorrow no
The pain I'm living now
As I faint in the snow

The pain is haunting me as the wishes come
The name of the Nazarene... obsolete

Meet me through the hollow

Today I forgive you... But tomorrow no
The pain I'm living now
As I faint in the snow

Obsolete
