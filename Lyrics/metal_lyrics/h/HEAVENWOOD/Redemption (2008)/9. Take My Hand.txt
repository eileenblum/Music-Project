Opened eyes as morning fades
My vision seems like a bird's decay
River flowing dark as my steps erase
Her steps in the night she left me alone

Pathways of light adore
Diffusing radiance
Like twinkling stars she died far away
In the evening blue I remember her shine

Take my hand
Haunted sleep... she will shriek forever
Take my hand
She'll pay the price like melting ice
Take my hand
Take my hand

Sorrow walks hand in hand
(It's) like building castles in the sand
She had won the prize for ignorance
She's nailed in my heart just as a remembrance

Pathways of light adore
Diffusing radiance

Take my hand
Haunted sleep... She will shriek forever
Take my hand
She'll pay the price like melting ice
Take my hand
Take my hand

Sorrow walking hand in hand
(It's) like building castles in the sand
She had won the prize for ignorance
She's nailed in my heart as a remembrance
