Bloody tongue... so cold
She dances around my neck
Swallow me
Swallow me
Tasting poisenous rain
But blood is what she claims
Swallow me
Swallow me
Witched by her craft
I scream from painful pleasure
Swallow me
Swallow me
Tasting poisenous rain
But blood is what she claims
Swallow me
Swallow me
Swallow me deep into your heart
Spit all your anger all apart

"I'm still waiting for
Your blood... Your life..."
