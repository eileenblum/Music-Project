In the silent views of the night
When souls are filled with sorrow
I thought that day had been a dream
A dream within a nightmare
To keep an eye on the flowers
Over their magical presence
A voice from the past cries now
And all its days are trances

I felt her once..., once only
I must not say how much it was
Beneath the silvery moonlight
Gave out in return for the love light
The pearly lustre of the moon went down
Smelled no more her rose scent,
It smiled and died since she departed
The heart of the shadowflower...
Slided away Shadowflower

In the silent views of the night
When souls are filled with sorrow
I thought that day had been a dream
A dream within a nightmare
To keep an eye on the flowers
Over their magical presence
A voice from the past cries now
And all its days are trances

Her shadow gave me sigh for sigh
When deep black clouds are forming
Less bright are the stars in the moonlight
Which I worship in the sky
The pearly lustre of the moon went down
Smelled no more her rose scent
It smiled and died since she departed
The heart of the shadowflower...
Slided away Shadowflower
