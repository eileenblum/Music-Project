Only with you (only for you)...

However far it seems
I'm hanging on your words
You'll find it again someday
It's the dawning of our love

I have already told you once
Loneliness seems just a question of time
I can't stand feeling love again
Once again my kingdom's gone away

(Only with you)  All this pain for you...
(Only for you)  All this pain for you...

When looking behind every door for you
Because of the things I saw for you
See the tears in my eyes
There's no pride in the things I do

I have already told you once
Loneliness seems just a question of time
I can't stand feeling love again
Once again my kingdom's gone away
