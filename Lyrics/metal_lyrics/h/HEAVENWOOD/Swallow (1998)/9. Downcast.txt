Everytime I get into the night...
Your night
Searching for some dreams
Into my heart...
Your heart
Everytime I hold you for a while
Your time
So I guess what else
You got in your mind...
My mind

I can feel this pain
Collide within you
When you say to me goodbye...
I will too

I travel back... into old times
To make things shine...
Upon my throne
So I believe in you
And I lived it through
Your sins and lies
You've tried to hide
