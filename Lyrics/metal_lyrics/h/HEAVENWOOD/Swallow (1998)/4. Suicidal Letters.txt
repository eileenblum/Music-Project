Petrified
Heart beats quicker as it starts to fall
Intensely
Why did she let all the flower die
Spirit of fire
Eternal flame that burns in desire's name
All the dreams
Driven away, far away among the hills

She got suicidal letters...

False romance
Nothing but a game to her again
Contradictions
Like the good and bad and the worst and best
All her scriptions
Where there was anything just to deceive
Book of lies
Every kind of love has it's sacrifice

She got suicidal letters
In her pocket full of lies

Step aside
Impossible for those who can't resist
The missing link
For lack of honesty
Among herself
Out of reality
Virtual behaviour
She learned to fake
Mercy killing
Peculiar way
To put an end to life
