Close your eyes
With me into the night
You'll see the moon
With whitefull skin like yours

Touch my soul
And read what I forgot
Remembering things
That I never regret

And when our pride
Is pierced from within
Luna will cry
Now I do know why
And when our love
Is pierced from within...

Moon rising, you're shining
