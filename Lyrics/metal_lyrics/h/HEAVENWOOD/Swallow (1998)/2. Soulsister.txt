Whenever your soul is frozen
Cold by no means so intense
Suddenly converted to stone
As if exhausted from emotions

Drag you down
To a place
Where the sun doesn't shine
False tomorrow
Nothing but a lie to you
Lie in the deep embrace of shadows
Where soulsister dreams
Her black soul rejoices me
Unable to forgive

hey, hey, forgive me soulsister

Walking throughout
Your empty roads
Cold and frosty,
There's no way back

Forever...
