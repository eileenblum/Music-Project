I can't understand
Why you turn around
I can't understand
Why you bring me down
Perhaps another day
You'll ask me to stay
Perhaps another day
I'll be the last to stay

I can't understand
Why you bring me down
I can't understand
Why you turn around
Perhaps another day
You'll ask me to stay
Perhaps another day
I'll be the last to stay

My hearts beats for your soul
It'll just stop when you'll get old
