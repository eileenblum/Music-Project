I wanna tear them apart
Drown them to blood
Nail them to walls
Slaughter is my cause

Clean the pure burn their lies
The moon shall show the path
I'll use your eyes act for demise
Poison your life and prepare to attack

Vanish the reigning force of light
I shall stand and fight

Carved in flesh is my map and quest
Insanity keeps me sane
It's time to end this anguished play
Surrender and die your soul is mine

Worthless efforts
Building barriers
Angels griefy sons of whores
Creating imminence

Filthy winged creatures of heaven
Shall be perished
