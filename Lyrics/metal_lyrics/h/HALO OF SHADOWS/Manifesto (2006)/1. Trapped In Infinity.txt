It's a cold Autumn night, Moon shines so bright
This frozen dream like nightmare
Lips so red, like wine so sweet
Her eyes cold, timeless and deep

She swept down by bow of moon
Her hair glittered like a flame of doom
Sins of mine she shall carry away
She binds me with one kiss and I sway

Her soul rests in its lair, in the sea of eternity
Her heart in my hand
Bleeding drops of divinity
Trapped in infinity
