Lover her empty shell
Cover the wounds
Heal the cage of soul
Body so doomed
Wipe all the sins away
Dress her ready
For the ball, in the night sky

Pain in my heart
Ripping me apart
Murderous and dark
Lust in my heart

Lovers pain... nothing to gain
Lost everything.. to master of lust and grief
A puppet with a crippled heart
Falling down
In the dark

Pain in my heart
Ripping me apart
Murderous and dark
Lust in my heart

Pain in my heart
Through my veins crawl
Thirst to fill
This ravenous heart
