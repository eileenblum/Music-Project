I curse the day I was born
Numb feeling and sounds of echo
I'm bearing the mark of blessed
Like doomed I am possessed
I now speak my last words
Embodiment of death on my door
And the choirs of hell
Beneath the judgement day bell

Sacrifice yes sacrifice your flesh
Spill oh yes spill the blood
Cut your wrists in the name of hatred
The wrath of Satan is unleashed

You shall burn in depths
You shall burn in the depths of hell

Feel the power in my veins
Dive in to my world of hate
See the meaning of death
Now open your eyes before the end
Twitching corpses of angels
On my hands their blood lives
Their souls are many and eternal

Sacrifice yes sacrifice your flesh
Spill oh yes spill the blood
Cut your wrists in the name of hatred
The wrath of Satan is unleashed

Burn in the flames of eternal fire
