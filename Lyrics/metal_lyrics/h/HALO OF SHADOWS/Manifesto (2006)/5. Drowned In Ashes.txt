From the tunnel of pain
Birth for a sick child
Unknown leaf
Of burned tree

Salt filled wounds
Orgasmic pain
Unknown narcotic
Crawling in my veins

Like burned portrate
Drowned in the ashes
Dominated violated suffocated
Illuminated flame
Making a change
By mankind I am judged

Ashes fills my grave
Coffin shining silver
Ornamental crafts
Seals my unspeakable wrath
