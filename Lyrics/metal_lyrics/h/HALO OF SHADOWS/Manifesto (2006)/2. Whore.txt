She loves her demons, whores of Lilith
Pale faced beauty floating in lust
She eats your flesh and makes you mourn
Afterwards you feel like newborn

Aura of erotic sickness... and her seductive scent
A flower colourless grey skinned
Damned spirit with evil filled
Her destiny will be fulfilled

You filthy whore

Come and bleed with me... my power shall be with thee
Lusty whore calling my name
Tempting me into her game
Come now the future is ours to rule
Into her twisted dark sins
The death himself beside me grins

You naughty whore!
