Anger... inside me keeps fighting
Fire... inside me burns harder than ever before
I scream... my pain gets stronger
I try to flee... I'm unconscious

Darkness... is what I can't resist
With its beauty it has captured me

I withdraw from light of the sun
I escape into darkness
In there I'll get my peace
Bells are calling me to death
That sound so beautiful
In there I'll get my peace

I bleed... razor blade shines like my thoughts so clear
Pleasure... pain is my pleasure in this heavenly hell
Sky is darkening... I awake
Hell screams... my name
