The sky grew darker
As the battle drew near
On that desolate island
Warriors would face their final doom

Angantyr had been given Tyrfing
And with this mighty blade
He took on Hjalmar the bold one
And fought as a true berserk

Od crossed blades with the remaining eleven
And one after one he slew the mighty berserks
There they lay bleeding and he stood victorious

There on the hill, Angantyr fought Hjalmar
And thus, they dedicated each other to Valhal

As Hjalmar lay bleeding he spoke these words to Od:
âSixteen wounds I have suffered
Now I go to Alfaderâs hallâ

One great warrior and twelve berserks
Met on this island their demise
Now they feast in Odinâs hall
Drink up my brothers!
