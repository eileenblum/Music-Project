Twelve were the berserks
Sons of Arngrim
Born in the northlands
Where wolves roam
Great fear they spread
Where they came
Strongest of them
Was mighty Angantyr

Hjorvard was one of twelve
He swore that he would have
The daughter of king Ingjald
For her beauty and skill she was renowned

Twelve were the berserks
Sons of Arngrim
Born in the northlands
Where wolves roam
Great fear they spread
Where they came

To the realm of king Ingjald
The twelve brothers went
And before the kingâs table
Hjorvard spoke these words:
âFar I have come, lord Ingjald
An oath I have sworn
That I will have your daughter
Or no other womanâ

Two men were there with Ingjald
Hjalmar and his companion Od
Hjalmar had heard Hjorvardâs speech
And these words he spoke to the king:
âDo you remember, my lord
How I have served you all these years?
The battles I have won for you?
I deserve your daughter!â

Hjorvard was immensely angered by these words
He stood up and challenged Hjalmar to holmgang

Hjalmar accepted the challenge
They agreed to meet on a far-away island
This duel would decide
Who was to have the kingâs daughter

Twelve were the berserks
Sons of Arngrim
Born in the northlands
Where wolves roam
Great fear they spread
Where they came
