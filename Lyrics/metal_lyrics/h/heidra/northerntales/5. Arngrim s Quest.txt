From the deep northern forests where vikings ruled
Hailed a man named Arngrim
Famous he was and in him the gods had much faith
He was in search of greater glory

Far eastwards he travelled
Crossed vast plains and long rivers
He wanted to reach the realm of Gardariki
Where the great chief Sigrlami ruled

Fought many battles with gods on his side
Shedding the blood of every foe
The golden blade cleaved many shields
Pierced the hearts of many men

Word had reached Sigrlami
That a war chief to his realm would come
And when Arngrim finally arrived
A great feast was held in his honour

Arngrim fought many battles
And when he had proved his worth
He was made general
And trusted with the sword Tyrfing

Fought many battles with gods on his side
Shedding the blood of every foe
The golden blade cleaved many shields
Pierced the hearts of many men

Fought and conquered
Favoured by the gods
He was given Eyfura as his wife
For she was fair and wise
Together they travelled
back to the northlands
Where the ravens soar
And the wolves howl

Fought many battles with gods on his side
Shedding the blood of every foe
The golden blade cleaved many shields
Pierced the hearts of many men
