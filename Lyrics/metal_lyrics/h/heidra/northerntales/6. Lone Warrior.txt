Legend tells of a man
A warrior without a name
On the path that he walked
There was no beauty to behold

On a cold and starry night
Amidst trees in an old forest he stood
Crying out his longing to the winds
Cursing the gods up high

A lone warrior he was
His heart destined to break
Memories of gruesome deeds
Embedded into his mind

Longing for the infinite sea
He would rush to the shores
But nothing could satisfy
The desire deep in his soul

His sword cut down many men
No living foe was beyond his skill
Yet mighty though he was
He could not quell the conflict within

A lone warrior he was
His faith bound to falter
Memories of gruesome deeds
Embedded into his mind

Longing for the infinite sea
He would rush to the shores
But nothing could satisfy
The desire deep in his soul

Days turned into months
As he waited for salvation
Though it would never come
Months turned into years
No one could save
His poor lonely soul

Legend tells of a man
A warrior without a name
Who led a life of the sword
And left behind him a bloody trail

Standing now a faithless man
He had invoked the wrath of the gods
He recklessly went to fight a losing battle
The battle that would finally claim his life

A lone warrior he was
His heart destined to break
Memories of gruesome deeds
Embedded into his mind

He lived a life of the sword
And as a warrior he would die
Slain on the field of battle
That was his sad fate
