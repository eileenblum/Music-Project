From the north they came with metal and fire
A host of more than a thousand men
An oath of blood they had sworn
That they would slay those who had wronged them

Clear it was that blessed they were
By the mighty gods themselves
For fear they had not in their hearts
And their heads they proudly held high

Through the power bestowed upon them
They struck down their enemies
Lightning from a sky dark as night
Cleared their path to victory

Their eyes flamed with a thirst for vengeance
As they approached their wretched foes
Those who had burned down their villages
And slain the ones they held dear

Dusk was not yet upon them
When in spite a warrior threw the first spear
Yelling out a fierce cry of battle
Dedicating the enemy to the one-eyed god

Arrows and spears rained down
Upon their powerless foes
And the screams of the fallen
Echoed throughout the valley

The two sides clashed in fierce battle
And only one could be victorious
The fields were drowned in crimson
As the blood of noble warriors was shed

Through the power bestowed upon them
They struck down their enemies
Lightning from a sky dark as night
Cleared their path to victory

On this day of vengeance
Many lives were put to an end
And when finally the battle was over
The banner of the righteous was raised for all to see

Through the power bestowed upon them
They struck down their enemies
Lightning from a sky dark as night
Cleared their path to victory
