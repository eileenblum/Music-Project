Darkness descends upon Midgard
Fog creeps in from the sea
Torches are lit and iron forged
A march once more into the unknown

In a land torn apart
Ruled by the endless night
A lonely fire still burns bright

Many long years have passed
Since man came upon these lands
Ships torn apart by waves
And countless kin lost to the sea
An ancient darkness dwells
In the forest so deep
A place no sunlight can reach

Plague-ridden beggars
The eyes of the night
The wrath of a tyrant
The enemy's might

Kings of the weak
Slaves to the strong
Pointless kingdoms
Came to an end

Darkness descends upon Midgard
Who will fight to restore the lands?
Undone by centuries past
And endless wars gone by

In a land torn apart
Ruled by the endless night
A lonely fire still burns bright

Against the fury of time
No swordsman can win
There can be no triumph
Nor victory

A warrior stands alone
Gazing upon this ravaged land
His burning soul alight
With furious passion
His desperate fight
To redeem himself
And restore peace unto the land

Plague-ridden beggars
The eyes of the night
The wrath of a tyrant
The enemy's might

Kings of the weak
Slaves to the strong
Pointless kingdoms
Came to an end

In the shadows, dark figures lurk
Here no songs shall be heard
Heroes came and went
But none stood the test of time

There's a fire burning in the dark
As a lonely star shines in the night
There's a fire burning in the dark
Who will rise to fight for these lands?

In a world torn apart
Facing the endless night
A lonely fire still burns
A mere candle in the wind

Yet if kindled it may spread
To once more cast light
Upon field and forest
City and village alike
