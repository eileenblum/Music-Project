A ship arrived this morning
A messenger clad in black
Bearing tidings oh so grave
Of my brother's untimely demise

I stand at the bow of my ship
I must set things right
My men are all behind me
Honour-bound to fight

I feel a great rage within
This is no time to mourn
Blood is surging through me
To vengeance I am sworn

We have left shallow waters
The open sea lies ahead
When we reach the southern coast
We stare into the face of death

And though some may crumble
As death stares right back
My determination cannot falter
I will sound the final attack

A crimson sun on the horizon
The air is freezing cold
My heart is pounding
And in anger I clench my fists

We take to the oars to make it in time
Before the enemy has moved on
The shadow of grief weighs me down
But I will forever push on

We've picked up a fresh trail
They cannot be far ahead
When we find those wretched knaves
Our swords will taste their blood

My men follow me without hesitation
Into the lands of the enemy
Out of the ashes, into the fire
We shall end their sorry lives

The enemy approaches from the south
It's time to meet them head on
And as we make our way into a clearing
Arrows soar and battle is joined

[Solo: Carlos G.R.]

The enemy is upon us
Ferociously they fight
Flailing swords and axes
We defend against their might

I feel a great rage within
This is no time to mourn
Blood is surging through me
To vengeance I am sworn

We must hold on
We can't fall back
Fighting to gain the upper hand
We strike them hard
We fight with skill
Slaying our way to victory

We must hold on
We can't fall back
No swordsman unchallenged
We strike them hard
We fight with skill
Slaying our way to victory

I fight my way to their leader
His blood will be mine
I raise my sword for the final strike
My hand guided by the divines

I feel a great rage within
This is no time to mourn
Blood is surging through me
To vengeance I am sworn
