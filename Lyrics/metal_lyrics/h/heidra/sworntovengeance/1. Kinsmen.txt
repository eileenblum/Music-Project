In the sky a jet-black raven flies
And deep below you can hear the cries
Of ancient warriors locked in battle
Swords strike hard and armours rattle

The old gods watch from mountains high
As brothers draw their last breath and die
They were too bold, they did not know
The dangers their final battle would hold

So ride, now proudly into battle my friend
The time has come to die for your kinsmen

Kneeling down, their brothers pray
That from their chosen path they will not stray
To the golden halls, their final resting place
They ride to fulfil their destiny

Armies are sent into battle
Endless wars for gold and glory
Thousands sacrifice their lives
At the behest of their kings

Silhouettes of ghostly warriors
Wander forever on a road to nowhere
They did not find their way
To the ancestral halls

Kneeling down, their brothers pray
That from their chosen path they will not stray
To the golden halls, their final resting place
They ride to fulfil their destiny

Silhouettes of ghostly warriors
They died for a cause not their own
Corrupted, abandoned, defeated
No skalds shall tell their tales

In the sky a jet-black raven flies
And deep below you can hear the cries
No fires illuminate the endless night
Death is theirs, unless they fight

The old gods watch from mountains high
As brothers draw their last breath and die
To fight for the king is their only life
To battle, to battle, this could be the last stride

[Solo: M. W. Jensen]

Death is like an infinite dream
So embrace the final sleep
Fight at your kinsmanâs side
The time has come to die
