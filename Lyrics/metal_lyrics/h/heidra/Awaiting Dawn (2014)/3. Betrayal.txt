Once I sat upon the throne
A king of men was I
In the halls of my father
I ruled the land

Many a year ago now
The Lord of the North was I
I believed I would show
The kingdom its way to glory

Yet a darkness ever lurking
Soon I would know the truth
The cold embrace of winter
A harbinger of doom

The darkness came not from within
Treacherous eyes ever watching
Staring with great envy and yearning
The eyes of the betrayer

Selfishly he craved the throne
Wanted it for his own
Though not of my motherâs blood
The usurper was my brother

Betrayal - stabbed in the back
Deception - through dark sorcery
Bloodshed - a fight for our lives
Destruction - the only end

A battle for the throne began
In a fight for my life
Just a few faithful warriors
To fight by my side

Dark sorcery in the night
Enchanted the minds of men
Against overwhelming power
We fought in vain
