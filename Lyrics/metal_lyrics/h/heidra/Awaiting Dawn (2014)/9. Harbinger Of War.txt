From all over the lands
You flocked to my banner
Faithful and courageous
To see justice be done

Come dawn we go to war
Against my tyrant brother
Long has he held the throne
The wretched betrayer

Awaiting dawn â tomorrow we ride
It will not be long â the blood will flow
Awaiting dawn â we will take their heads
It will not be long â justice will be done

I see before me
True warriors
If we should fall
Our spirits fight on

Sing for the fallen
They shall be victorious
They live on forever
Among the gods
Tomorrow we honour their sacrifice
With sword and shield
We will fight for our lives
Come dawn we ride out to war

We have seen many things
Fought against the dark
The undead in the marsh
And the titans of ice

Yet still we need to face
The greatest trial of all
Reclaim the throne
And see darkness expelled

There will be blood at dawn
For it is the harbinger of war

We will hang him high
A feast for the crows
Time for him to die
He will pay at all costs

The blessing of the gods
Was bestowed upon us
They will be on our side
Tomorrow and henceforth

Awaiting dawn â tomorrow we ride
It will not be long â the blood will flow
Awaiting dawn â we will fight with pride
It will not be long â we will take their heads
