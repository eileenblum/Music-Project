To the outskirts of my kingdom
We had fled in shame
My throne now lost to me
This treachery would not stand

I was the chosen
And I was the king
I had to find a way
To rise again

Dethroned and beaten
I stood on my own
Only reprisal
In my mind was strong

I had heard telling of a witch
Who could foresee the fates of men
If we were to break the spell
Divine power we would need

Witch of Prophecy!

Far north we had to sail
To find this mystery woman
Forests unknown to us
She was rumored to roam

Up river we sailed
To find the way to her
Our destination
To us still unknown

We came across
A great forest so dark
No doubt in our minds
We had found the right path

A great raven we saw flying in the sky
To guide our way to the witchâs grove
We travelled long for many days
Till finally we found our destination
