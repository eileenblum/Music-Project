A ritual to gain the favour of gods
In the dead of night under moonlit skies
An offering to the almighty ones
A pact to be signed in blood

A storm was brewing
The thunder of the gods
Roaring in the distance
Like primordial echoes

On the open plains in a circle of stones
Carved in ages past old as time itself
Only the fire to keep us warm
As heavy rain started to fall

We gazed into the abyss
Visions from beyond the mortal world
Saw the realm of the divine
Touched by the power of gods

Paying tribute to the ancient ones
With the blood of seven animals
A ritual from times of yore
Passed down by our ancestors

A voice spoke to us from the beyond
About an age of great prosperity
An age of stone, an age of iron
Tales from times long gone by
