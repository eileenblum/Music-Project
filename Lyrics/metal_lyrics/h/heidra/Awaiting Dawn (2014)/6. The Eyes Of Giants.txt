On the great frozen plains lie ruins of a keep
Destroyed in ages past by the giants of ice
After the costly battle in the marshlands
Our ships lead us to this northern place

We stared into the eyes of wicked giants
Nothing but pure and utter hatred we saw

Frostbitten and cold yet on into the storm
What we saw in these desolate lands I shall not soon forget
Awaking from a thousand years of sleep
Giants like statues reaching for the skies

A battle broke out between giants and men
Furious and raging they attacked with a vengeance

Our destiny lay in the hands of gods
We had not come so far to surrender
Refused to succumb to the mighty storm
We would stand and fight till our last breath

The battle raged on and on
We fought hard and well
Despite our foeâs determination
We stood firm and strong

Seven spears to slay one fierce colossus
Yet one and all they fell before us
