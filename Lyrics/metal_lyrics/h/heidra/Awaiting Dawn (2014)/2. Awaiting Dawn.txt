Friends and brothers in arms
This I tell you on the eve of battle
A long way we have come
Many trials we have endured

Upon our enemies I wish only death
Their deeds cannot be undone
But they shall not go unpunished
We will be the ones to end this war

The endless tragedy
Threatens to consume me
Will the darkened world
Expel us into oblivion?

We are the exiles
We carry the fire
We are the banished
We are the dead

And though some may perish
As tomorrow we face our foes
Their hatred only matched
By our unbreakable will to triumph

Feel the raging fire
Burning bright under the starlight
The path we choose tomorrow
Could lead us straight to hell

You all sit here this dreary night
Each for reasons of your own
You are all sworn to this cause
Yet you know not half the story

Bound by a sacred oath
A covenant signed in blood
By the will of the gods
Victorious we shall stand


Trust that I do not deceive
All shall be revealed this night
My fate is sealed
Yet yours remain your own

Tomorrow is the final fight
Yet this story cannot wait
So I plead listen to me
And know the truth about the betrayal
