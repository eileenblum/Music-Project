We came into the woods of the wolves
Seeking allies for the war
Renowned were the proud warriors
Of the seven forest tribes

We went deep into the woods
The trees now blocking out the light
A man clad in gray approached
And spoke these words unto us

âI am the son of wolves
Mother Nature is my mistress
I am the king of the wilds
The Wolfborn am Iâ

âFight for meâ I said to him
âAnd I shall reward you and all your kindâ
âWe need neither riches nor gloryâ he said
âWe serve only the gods and the forestâ

âFeast with me in my halls tonight
And I shall hear you outâ
We then followed him to his grove
As he sang this song

It was truly a great feast to behold
Meat and drink to our hearts desire
And as day turned into night
Drinking songs echoed in the hall
Until the lord of the woods rose to speak
And silence again fell on the gathering

âThis world faces dark times
I feel it like a whisper on the wind
I am a creature of the light
And in this quest I shall aid youâ

âI am the son of wolves
Mother Nature is my mistress
I am the king of the wilds
The Wolfborn am Iâ
