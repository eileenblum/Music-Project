And now I'm looking at myself!
Damn it! I look just like them!
I'm here thanks to myself!
Nobody, nobody will observe!

I am the ancient archangel,
My name was Adoriel!
Now I'm the angry archdevil,
I am Hteththemeth!

I'm burning now from inside,
Flames leaving their bodies dried!
They now fear the old words,
Destroying all of their worlds!

I am the son of my father,
No connection to human kind,
On Earth there is no other,
To be so good, to be so kind! 
Ha ha ha ha ha!

All minions on my side,
Let's kill the humans' last Ï¸ride!
Cannot run, die or hide!
Get ready for the Great Ride!

I came into their world!
Yet, I brought my universe also!
The Universe is inside... me!
