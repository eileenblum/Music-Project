I really admire you,
I really adore you,
You succeeded to make me... sad.

I really like you,
I really want you,
You make me feel very bad.

I want to hug you,
I want to kiss you,
Even a pillow has more life in it.

I don't want to lie to you,
I don't want to leave you,
I want to live in this agony one more bit. 

You are my last Godsend!
You are my life's last amend!
You are my last girlfriend!
