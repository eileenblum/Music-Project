Shadows, my only friends,
Where are you, to give me strength?
Shadows, brothers or sisters,
Give me tears to resist Her!

Every day I walk alone.
Every day the same sad song.
All I want is just one day
To find out which was my way!

Everything is lost or wrong,
What was fine didn't last too long!
Who I am I still don't know,
Even among others I still glow!

The Life is she and She is life!
Am I wrong or am I right?!
Life goes on, that's the way it is,
I don't argue, I only hate this!

Weeping, crying, tears,
The same stuff,
And the quietude,
Are for me enough!

This is not a story,
Even it is written,
It's the best worst case scenario
Of my life, forbidden!
