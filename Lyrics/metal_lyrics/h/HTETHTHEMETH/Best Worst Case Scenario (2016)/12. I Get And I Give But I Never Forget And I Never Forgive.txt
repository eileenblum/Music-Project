I get and I give, but I never forget and I never forgive!

Constantly others I have helped,
Devoting my entire self
To the so-called different,
The false kindness, that fake good cause.

But now I'm turning the page!
It's time to feel my wrath!
Emptying my love tank,
Nobody will save you this time!

They will get what they deserve!
I am cleaning through friends!

Get! Give!
Never forget! Never forgive!

Isn't it that you suffer now?
You cannot live without me!

Isn't it that you fear now?
You cannot live in me!

It is great without your whims.
Solitude is beautiful!
