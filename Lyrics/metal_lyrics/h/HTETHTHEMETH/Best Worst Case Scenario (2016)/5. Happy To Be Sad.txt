Soâ¦ through this morning I awake,
Oh, this morning is so fine!
Soâ¦ through the morning I awake,
I am so far away... in night!

Soâ¦ through this morning I awake,
Oh, this morning is so bright!
I am now happy to be sad,
I am in the endâ¦ all right!

So, through this morning I awake,
Now, even my death is mine!
And with my dreams I will defeat
My so-called life!

I live the morning of my life,
Oh, this morning I feel fine!
And Loneliness is now my friend,
My only friend, mine!

And through this morning I'll awake
With my tear transformed in smile
And all my sadness will prevail
Against your world, against your lie!

Soâ¦ through this morning I awake
In a morning so bright!
And I am happy to be sad
In my so-called life!
I am awake!
