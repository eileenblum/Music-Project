[Act II Bad Feelings]

In a cold world,
I'm in a calm city.
This one is too big even for me!

Searching a caress
I have a bad feeling,
Something that will change what will never be!

Time has no limits,
Time in fact is a limit.
Places are not spots,
They are historical ruins.

Life's river is too dirty,
Sky's clouds are too grey,
But these are not disturbing
Because I'm OK.

I'm happy in my sadness,
I'm walking in Paris!
I feel so romantic,
I feel that I failed!
