[Act III Evil Feelings]

I'm in hate

I'm in love
with desperation.
with separation.

I hate
my oscillation.
your congregation.

I love
my education.
Self-adoration!

I'm in hate
with retardation.
with exoneration.

I'm in hate with your love.
I'm in love with my hate.

*

I've gotten fat!
Indeed, I've been eating a lot!
I feast with a lot of... hate!

*

After all, I am not the man! I am not even human!

*

I am not a girl! I am a goddess!
