"As I laid bare on the burning ash, I watched Xeron unlock the gates of Eeofol. The ground under my feet had turned to rust, bloodied with the hearts of saints. The ambiance was overwhelmed by mechanized soundsâ¦ screeching metal and bone chilling screams. The sky became an infinite darkness and its black hole sun was a terrifying sight. 
The faceless man kneeled before the Snake. 
The serpent whispered:
- Thou shalt do my bidding without question!
The faceless man bent in approbation, as if he did not possess a spine.
- Thine new born children shalt be bathed in my blood and pledge allegiance to me. And the sanctity of marriage will be cast from the hearts of humans, for love is but a mere tale or fable. Thine illusions are finished!"
