I remember when
We met for the first time,
Strangers on their way,
We combined the light.

Now we are again
Strangers in the dark,
We combine the hate,
By kissing we lie!

Lies! I don't believe her!
Lies! Did she believe me?
Lies! I don't believe her!
Lies! I don't believe her!

There are so many smiles,
Sometimes they keep us calm.
We know the real lies...
They sing a holy psalm.

Shadows in the night
Bleeding for some truth,
Thoughts in my mind,
An old dÃ©jÃ  vu...

Lies! I don't believe her!
Lies! Did she believe me?
Lies! I don't believe her!
Lies! I don't believe her!

Light lies!
Light's lies!
