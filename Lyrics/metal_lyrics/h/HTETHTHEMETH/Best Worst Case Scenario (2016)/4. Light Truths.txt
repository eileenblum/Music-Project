Words after words,
Broken roads.
Lies after lies,
Fake smiles.

Stupidity floods,
Life filled with drugs.
Too many fake gods,
Meaningless hugs.

Too much for me,
I'm searching the Exit.
Expensive the entrance fee,
I'm walking through the desert.

Walking and searching the door
Outside I want to live,
It's colder once more,
I have nothing to give.

I know you like it!
I now you crave for it!

I know!
