Let them talk about Armageddon!
I still believe in that glorious battle!
Although, you know, 
I realize that it will be great to have my own Armageddon!

Love? Just an empty word!
You think that's your salvation?
Your purpose on these worlds?
You poor deluded sheep!

I bring with me the end of your lies,
Of your pathetic attempts to regain Paradise!
There is no love, no perfection, no soul mates!
There is only... Hate!

De fiecare datÄ cÃ¢nd vreau sÄ mÄ gÃ¢ndesc la ea,
mÄ duc la fereastrÄ Èi privesc Marea!
