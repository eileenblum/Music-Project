Don't tell me your name
I know it ain't gonna change
Anyway that I think
(You motherfucker)
It's not as if you're to blame
If we're one and the same
We're on the edge, on the brink
(You motherfucker)

Come take control
Won't be the soul
Just do as you're told
Come burn a hole
In what they know
Get up and go

Throw matches to see, what you can ignite
Fire fire, fire fire
Throw matches to see, what stays out of sight
Fire fire, fire fire
'Cause when the clouds come down on this town estate
We'll make our way to a great escape
Throw matches to see, what you can ignite

No time to spare
No truth or dare
Give them something to hide
(You motherfucker)
Go with the time
Step on the mines
Our time to shine
(You motherfucker)

Come steal the wind
Come throw the earth
Come bring the storm
Come seize the day
Come make the change
Give them something to mourn

Throw matches to see, what you can ignite
Fire fire, fire fire
Throw matches to see, what stays out of sight
Fire fire, fire fire
'Cause when the clouds come down on this town estate
We'll make our way to a great escape
Throw matches to see, what you can ignite

We're all bought down in desperation
By this dirty town and aggravation
It's time to leave and find another new home

We've had our day our day is done so
In this weird landscape let's do it over
There's no time to waste to find another new home

Throw matches to see, what you can ignite
Fire fire, fire fire
Throw matches to see, what stays out of sight
Fire fire, fire fire
'Cause when the clouds come down on this town estate
We'll make our way to a great escape
Throw matches to see, what you can ignite
