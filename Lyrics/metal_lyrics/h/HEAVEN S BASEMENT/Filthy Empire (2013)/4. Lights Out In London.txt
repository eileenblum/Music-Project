Paint black, sunset, left marks on this town so you won't forget
Gypsy, vagabond, baby you're coming down but I haven't yet
Old shoes, old news, take a picture of the filth that I got to lose
Cracked teeth, blitzkrieg, and I'm stuck underneath say goodbye c'est la vie

I'll be gone, when the lights go out in London
Carry on, by the morning you'll forget
All the wasted I left behind a broken memory
Yeah it all went wrong so when the lights go out in London I'll be gone

Salt lick, get your kicks, I'll kick the bucket before a walk back through this shit
Black lung, black hole, motherfucker shut your mouth before I lose control
Hip shake, heartbreak, I'm sick of sleeping in the dirt with the fucking dregs
Seeing red, I hit my head, tell the devil that I'm dead, yeah, won't you tell him what I said

I'll be gone, when the lights go out in London
Carry on, by the morning you'll forget
All the wasted I left behind a broken memory
Yeah it all went wrong so when the lights go out in London I'll be gone

'Cause I got this feeling
Nothing to believe in
I'm just crashing down, yeah
And it's two in the morning
You don't get no warning
Ha, I'm leaving now

I'll be gone, when the lights go out in London
Carry on, by the morning you'll forget
I'll be gone, when the lights go out in London
Carry on, by the morning you'll forget
All the wasted I left behind a broken memory
Yeah it all went wrong so when the lights go out in London I'll be gone
I'll be gone
