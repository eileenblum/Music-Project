Don't speak, just listen
You don't know what ya been missing
Don't cry, stop running
Don't move, 'cause I'm coming

You don't hear what I hear when you talk to me
Don't feel what I feel when you touch me
You don't see what I see when you look at me
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one for me

Can't let go
Would you run, run, if I let you go
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh
Am I crazy, crazy, let me know
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
Can't let go

Lay back, no hurry
It's all fine, don't you worry
I see you, you're so pretty
I always knew that you'd wait for me

Well I know how you feel 'cause I feel for you
I know by your tears that you want me to
I know that you know that I'd kill for you
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man for you

Can't let go
Would you run, run, if I let you go
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh
Am I crazy, crazy, let me know
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
Oh

You've seen a side of me that I don't ever show
And now you know me I can't let you go
Let you go

Can't let go
Would you run, run, if I let you go
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh
Am I crazy, crazy, let me know
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
Let you go

Let, let, let you go
Let, let, let you go
Let, let, let you go
Let, let, let you go
