I've heard of all the same old stories
And I've walked along the same old avenues
I know the pavement doesn't move
So if we leave here, then what we got to lose?

I wanna be somebody
I wanna leave this town
I wanna be somebody
Forever
I wanna be somebody
I wanna find what's ours
I wanna be somebody
Forever
I wanna be someone
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

It's time for us to choose a new direction
But I know it's more difficult for you
For the record you've been the best thing that could happen
If you can't decide then I know the reason why

I wanna be somebody
I wanna leave this town
I wanna be somebody
Forever
I wanna be somebody
I wanna find what's ours
I wanna be somebody
Forever
I wanna be someone
I wanna be someone

I wanna be somebody
I wanna leave this town
I wanna be somebody
Forever
I wanna be somebody
I wanna find what's ours
I wanna be somebody
Forever
I wanna be someone
I wanna be someone

I wanna be somebody
I wanna find what's ours
I wanna be somebody
Forever
I wanna be someone
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
