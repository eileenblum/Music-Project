You think you know me but you don't know shit
I'm gonna show you that I will never quit
I'm gonna own you make you my bitch
You can't control me, you just make me sick

I ain't Jumpin' Jack Flash
I'm no Telegram Sam
I ain't Ziggy Stardust
I'm just a heartbreaking son of a bitch

Shit talk, non-stop
Gimme everything you got
Everybody here is insane
Oh, shit talk, non-stop
Gimme everything you got
Everybody knows I'm a heartbreaking son of a bitch
Oh yeah

I've seen you tripping off the tip of your toes
I've seen you flipping out at people you don't know
You think it's easy 'cause you're on a high
I kinda think you're overdosing on a lie

I ain't Jumpin' Jack Flash
I'm no Telegram Sam
I ain't Ziggy Stardust
I'm just a heartbreaking son of a bitch

Shit talk, non-stop
Gimme everything you got
Everybody here is insane
Oh, shit talk, non-stop
Gimme everything you got
Everybody knows I'm a heartbreaking son of a bitch

What you get is what you see
Standing right in front of me
Step right up and take a shot
Say your piece or... fuck off

Shit talk, non-stop
Gimme everything you got
Everybody here is insane
Oh, shit talk, non-stop
Gimme everything you got
Everybody knows I'm a heartbreaking son of a bitch
Everybody knows I'm a heartbreaking son of a bitch
Oh, yeah, everybody knows I'm a heartbreaking son of a bitch

Hahahahahahaha
Uh
C-c-c-c-c-c-c-come on
Alright
Yeah yeah
