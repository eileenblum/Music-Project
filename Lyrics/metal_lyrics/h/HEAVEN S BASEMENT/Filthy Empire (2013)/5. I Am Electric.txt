I am the new-born, I'm the creator
I am velocity, I am the rapture
I'm the destroyer, I am the cavalry
I am the poison, I am the powder
I am the fighter, I'm the protector
I am the AC, I am the DC
I am electric, I am electric
I am electric, I am electric

Watch me burn, till the future is no more
Watch me burn, I'm the killer and the cure
So hate me, I killed your God
So watch me burn

I'm the destroyer, I am the power
I am the torment, I am the cancer
I am velocity, I am the horror
I am the finger, I am the fuck you
I am electric, I am electric
I am electric, I am electric
I am electric, I am electric
I am electric, I am electric

Watch me burn, till the future is no more
Watch me burn, I am the killer and the cure
So hate me, I killed your God
So watch me burn
Watch me burn
Watch me burn
Watch me burn

I am the new-born, I'm the creator
I am velocity, I am the rapture
I'm the destroyer, I am the cavalry
I am the poison, I am the KISS OF FIRE

Watch me burn, till the future is no more
Watch me burn, I'm the killer and the cure
So hate me, I killed your God
Watch me burn

I am electric, I am electric
I am electric, I am electric
