Welcome home

Come in, you've sinned
Motherfucker it's a new beginning
You lose, I win
Now you're stuck and it's too late for running
Dancing in the river on the bed of an angel
Drinking dirty water from the fountain of hell yeah
Sleeping with the enemy but don't ever tell
I can hear you ringing the bell

Welcome home
The Devil's own
If you're dying in the fire, it's better if you're not alone
Welcome home

Woah, yeah, lord

No shame, this game
Once you come inside you know you're never the same yeah
No one, to blame
Welcome to the family with no last name
Dancing in the river on the bed of an angel
Drinking dirty water from the fountain of hell yeah
Sleeping with the enemy but don't ever tell
I can hear you ringing the bell

Welcome home
The Devil's own
If you're dying in the fire, it's better if you're not alone
Welcome home

Come in, you've sinned
Motherfucker it's a new beginning
You lose, I win
Now you're stuck and it's too late for running
Dancing in the river on the bed of an angel
Drinking dirty water from the fountain of hell yeah
Sleeping with the enemy but don't ever tell
I can hear you ringing the bell

Welcome home
The Devil's own
If you're dying in the fire, it's better if you're not alone
Welcome home

Welcome home
The Devil's own
If you're dying in the fire, it's better if you're not alone
Welcome home

Welcome home
