A smile could crack this angry face
The endless days, the endless wait
As tension fills up the empty space
I wait in vain and fade away, away, away
Fade away, away, away
I fade away, away, away

No you never know what you got until it's gone
(It's wasted, it's wasted)
And when it's gone then you know it's gone forever
When you take the long goodbye
No-one here ever stays they all move on
(It's wasted, it's wasted)
And when we're gone then you know we're gone forever
When you take the long goodbye

And as the flowers slowly die
We find new ways of wasting time
The question is what's left to try
I watch the rain and fade away, away, away
Fade away, away, away
I fade away, away, away

No you never know what you got until it's gone
(It's wasted, it's wasted)
And when it's gone then you know it's gone forever
When you take the long goodbye
No-one here ever stays they all move on
(It's wasted, it's wasted)
And when we're gone then you know we're gone forever
When you take the long goodbye

No you never know what you got until it's gone
(It's wasted, it's wasted)
And when it's gone then you know it's gone forever
When you take the long goodbye
No-one here ever stays they all move on
(It's wasted, it's wasted)
And when we're gone then you know we're gone forever
When you take the long goodbye
