Waiting for the day
Blue eyes change their shade
Walking in step just to buy back the life that I sold
Stuck in the middle I don't know which way I should go

Show me the way, show me the way from here
Tell me the truth, tell me your hopes and fears
Give me a sign, give me a sign to stay
Is this how it ends? (Is this how it ends?)
I'm just waiting for the Executioner's Day
Yeah

Praying for a change
New skies are here to stay
Building you up just to have something new I can break
Pushing you down just to see how much more you can take

Show me the way, show me the way from here
Tell me the truth, tell me your hopes and fears
Give me a sign, give me a sign to stay
Is this how it ends? (Is this how it ends?)
Woah, I'm just waiting for the Executioner's Day
Yeah, oh

Waiting for the day

Show me the way, show me the way from here
Tell me the truth, tell me your hopes and fears
Give me a sign, give me a sign to stay
Is this how it ends? (Is this how it ends?)
No, I'm just waiting for the Executioner's Day
Yeah
The Executioner's Day
