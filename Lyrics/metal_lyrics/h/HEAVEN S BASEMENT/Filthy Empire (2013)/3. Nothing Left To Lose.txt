Oh
Yeah

Cover your eyes you're not ready to see this
Better to be blind than to try and resist
Say your prayers and cease and desist
We all have secrets

Everyone dies so what's the meaning in all this
But we have a choice to live on to exist
If you want more, go take it and get pissed
We don't have regrets

I know how it feels, to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone with silence
How it feels, with the anger and the rage (and the rage)
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

Pushed to the edge I can't go any further
Tear me apart with mechanical murder
Ignorant bliss in a time of disorder
God save the bastards

Nightmares come when I can't open my eyes
Running from the past I know that I can't hide
I get knocked down shout up to the sky
I got no regrets

I know how it feels, to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone with silence
How it feels, with the anger and the rage (and the rage)
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

We don't belong here
The sound of a thousand vultures
Will drown us out and confiscate our bones
We stand alone

We don't belong here
The sound of a thousand vultures
Will drown us out and confiscate our bones
We stand alone
We stand alone
We stand alone

I know how it feels, to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone with silence
How it feels, with the anger and the rage (and the rage)
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

I know how it feels, to have nothing left to lose
To burn it all, and be left alone with silence
How it feels, with the anger and the rage (and the rage)
Get out, get out, get out, we are defiance

Say goodbye to the world that we once knew
