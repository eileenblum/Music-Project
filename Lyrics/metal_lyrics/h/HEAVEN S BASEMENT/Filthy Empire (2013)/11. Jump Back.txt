Oh
Yeah yeah
Mmm
Woah

My little England went to London in the summer time
With a painted up guitar and a new disguise
Why'd you look at me like that, and as a matter of fact
We're on the same damn train but on two different tracks

I'd keep on going if you asked me to stop

Jump back, baby's in black
Cleaning up the mess with the Union Jack
Don't stop, do it again
All the dirty money that a man can spend
Jump back, yeah
Jump back, yeahyeah
Jump back, woah
Jump back, jump back

I spun a penny on the table just to kill the time
She gave me one hard look with suspicious eyes
It was already over, she was already mine
I'm not a gentleman baby at the best of times

I'll keep on going if you asked me to stop

Jump back, baby's in black
Cleaning up the mess with the Union Jack
Don't stop, do it again
All the dirty money that a man can spend
Jump back, woah
Jump back, yeahyeahyeah
Jump back
Jump back, jump back

Head shrink don't think mama drive
We're outcast at last and feel alive
In a situation that'll never change
Well I know that you'll be sorry when you see me again

Jump back, baby's in black
Cleaning up the mess with the Union Jack
Don't stop, do it again
All the dirty money that a man can spend
Jump back, woah
Jump back, yeah
Jump back, jump back
Jump back, jump back
