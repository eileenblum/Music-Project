I've been thinking of what could have been
I've been thinking of the life that we're living now
I've been waiting for the sign to go away
I've been holding back the moment that I leave this place

We're up on a roll and it's taking its toll but it's too late to stop now

Again, here comes the rain
I say, it's the price that we pay for us
So tick with the times I'll keep writing these rhymes in the hope that I'll see you back home
I say, it's the price that we pay for us

Hoping that you'll be around when I get home
Hoping that you'll see the reason that I'm gone
Holding down this thing ain't easy at the best of times
Time is just like string 'cause when it's here it's just passing by

It's taking its toll but we're both in control so just keep by my side

Again, here comes the rain
I say, it's the price that we pay for us
So tick with the times I'll keep writing these rhymes in the hope that I'll see you back home
I say, it's the price that we pay for us

So forgive me when I leave once again
We'll get through this somehow in the end, in the end, in the end

Again, here comes the rain
Again, here comes the rain
I say, it's the price that we pay for us
So tick with the times I'll keep writing these rhymes in the hope that I'll see you back home
I say, it's the price that we pay for us
For us
