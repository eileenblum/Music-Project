Trans-Atlantic airliners, groundbreaking design
Diverse heavy duty taskmachine
Aerial Reconnaissance, maritime patrol
Detecting and attacking submarines

Troops or cargo transport, delivering the fuel
Main Virtue: Long operating range
New high-tech equipment, destructive deathbird
Liberator B-24J

Conglomerated squadrons
Motioned by the alarm
Rotating propellers
Airborne of the swarm

A high altitude mission
Above enemy ground
Messerschmidts approaching
Turrets firing rounds
Acknowledging all targets
The industrial heart
Gunners fighting bandits
As the bombings start

Cities cracking in tornadic fires
Installations bursting in the blaze
Burning asphalt, huge raging inferno
Salute the fallen, then return to base
