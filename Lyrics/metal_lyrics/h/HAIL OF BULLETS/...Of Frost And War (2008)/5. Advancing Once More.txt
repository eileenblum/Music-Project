Surviving the winter
Gathering some strength
The madman is determined
To shorten the war's length
Overestimated
Troops capacity
Send them back to hell again
At Satan's mercy

A movement to the South
Different strategy
The centre of hostilities
To destroy industry
Mobilise the legions
Unleash the dogs of war
Ride the beast of death again
Advancing once more

Penetrating panzers
Drive their armoured wedge
Zealots incite infantry
Over the edge
Rumbling through the steppe
In clouds of dust and sand
Soviet troops seem scattered
In abandoned land

The gates of Hades open
Marching through hell's door
The fiendish hordes are
advancing once more

Storming with full throttle
The plains of the Kaukasus
Leave their banner waving
On Mount Elbrus
The oilfields are burning
There's no turning back
Russian self-destruction
Horizon's coloured black

The gates of Hades open
Marching through hell's door
The fiendish hordes are
advancing once more

Ride the beast of death again
Unleash the dogs of war
The fiendish hordes are
Advancing once more
