[Bonus track]

An absurd order given
Sheer astonishment
Organize new defense lines
With shattered regiments
Fight to the last bullet
Never to withdraw
Approval of the death sentence
Berlin's will is law

Rejecting the final ultimatum
All forbidden to negotiate
A threatening liquidation of an army
Still refusing to capitulate
Leading their men to contine the fight
Comfortable generals in warm barracks
In the open fields their soldiers die

Blood on filthy hands
Insanity commands

Recruiting the starving and the crippled
Crimping the wounded and the diseased
Executing the looting amputated
Closing cruel eyes for their infamy
Praising the emaciated faces
Lots of decorations but no bread
Frozen human flesh amongst the ruins
Cannibals consume the burning dead

A pathos of treason
Blood on filthy hands
Till the last convulsion
Insanity commands
