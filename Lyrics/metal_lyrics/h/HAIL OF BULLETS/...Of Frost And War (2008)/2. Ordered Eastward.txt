Hear the engines roaring
Hear the grinding steel
Advancing divisions
Behind armored wheels
They're driving through the clouds
They're staggering through the mud
Panic, fear and terror
An enemy on the run

Artillery is ploughing
The earth of foreign land
Screaming stukas drop
their deadly load
Einsatzgruppen murdering
On the FÃ¼hrer's command
Heavy calibre mortars explode

Seven armies marching
About 3 million man
Operation Barbarossa
Sealing Russia's end
Nebelwerfer launching
Granates scourge the ground
Heralds of the Blitzkrieg
Hell can't bear their sound

Iron wall of fire
Glowing melting sand
60 centimetre railwayguns
An earthquaking thunder
From the hinterland
Forged in flames this pandemonium

We were ordered eastward
Hate is on our side
Born and raised to fight
Global domination
Stalwart to the core
The mother of all wars
Brainwashed for destruction
Tools for the third Reich
Breed of indoctrination
All of you must die

Annihilate resistance
None of them were warned
Suffering from starvation
Insufficiently armed
Decapitated soldiers
Rattling torsos cry
Horses mutilated
Neighing agonized

Facing Armageddon
Total war is here
Superior material and men
Tiretracks approaching
Gruesome death is near
Another comrade's life
comes to an end
