Plundering SS-units
Prisoners rot in camps
The old and weak were shot
Defeatist got hanged
Nationwide extortion
No one can survive
A starving population
Miserably dies

Silently they disappeared
at night
Joined the other hungry
wolves to fight
To slay and maim and kill
the fascist beast
The cutthroat invaders
of their East

Blowing up the bridges
Undermine the streets
Attacking the convoys
Leave cold dead German meat
Sabotage the railways
Behind enemy lines
Bombing army transports
Destroy telephone wires

A merciless strike
from out of the dark
Witness the Russian Partisan's
trademark
All they have
is their hate to feed on
Ambush another enemy patrol

Hiding in the forest
Or villages nearby
Like the pack they are prowling
And only hunt at night
Lying in the slush
Buried deep in snow
Always facing death
Ready for the blow

Marching, creeping, waiting,
Snipers in the trees
Aiming, shooting, killing
These wolves will have their feast
