Last nest of resistance
In which children fight
Old and young mobilized

The city burning
Buildings collide
A treacherous suicide

Between the ruins
Where ravens fed
On the bodies of the dead

Just one more battle
And one more storm
The war is over
It is done
Delirious the rapings
The men have died
A Soviet victor
Germany cries
