[performed by Hail of Bullets]Trapped between two despots the cry for battle calls
Soviets at the Vistula the Hun inside the walls
Resistance a tradition Poland to be free
Finishing oppression regaining liberty
Claiming back their territory bloodshed for such precious land
Withdrawing hated enemy the final struggle is at hand

Armia Krajowa Patriots mobilised
Many unarmed soldiers weapons improvised
National rebellion expect to last one week
Primitive devices guerrilla techniques
Bravery pride and heroism honour and determination
Against tanks and artillery dying hard battalions

The Soviets massacred thousands in Katyn so they know precisely what to expect
Decades more of brutal submission tyrant Stalin stabs them in the back
Abandoned by the feeble western allies responsible for all the brave who died
Whilst their brothers freed Monte Cassino they surrendered with their heads up high
