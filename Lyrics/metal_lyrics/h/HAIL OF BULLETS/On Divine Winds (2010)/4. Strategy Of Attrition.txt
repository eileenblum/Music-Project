Crossing frontiers
From the peninsula
The horde advancing
Into China
On the rampage
Insubordination
Cabal of generals
Rebellion

Operate without approval
Divisions run amok
Mobilizing border troops
Piling up their stocks

Conducting manoeuvres
Harsh arrogance
Swallow the giant
With malevolence
Increase aggression
Sweep into Chapel
Rotation bombings
Burning Shanghai

Open game for victors
As they mow civilians down
Public decapitation
But still they did not bow
Imprisonment meant slavery
Mass-rapes day and night
Use of chemical weapons
No surrender insight

Strategy of attrition
Lure intruders far inland
Retreat, harass, attack
Penetrating fragile flanks
Devouring juggernaut
A tactic to repeat
Impossible conquest
Never complete
