From the Kuriles
Steaming south
To ride the tiger
Climb the mount
Undiscovered
In misty cold
High stake gamble
The crippling blow

Nakajimas
Screeching dives
Eager bandits
Do or die
Pearl Harbour
Paralyzed
Steel downpoor
On Hawaii

Hammering guns
Armour piercing bombs
Aiming at the battleships
Ground facilities
Carriers not at anchorage
Safe on open sea

CAPSIZED
Capsized, sunken vessels
DEFENCELESS
Defenceless casualties
MASSACRED
Massacred by treason
A date witch will live in infamy
