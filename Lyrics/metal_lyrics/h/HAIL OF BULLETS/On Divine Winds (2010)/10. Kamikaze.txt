Out of the rising sun
Into their death they fly
Messengers of destruction
Glorious suicide
Sacrificing squadrons
One cannot shoot them all
AA gunners blasting
Deafening fireballs

Following the first wave
The next scourging swarm
Watch the carriers sinking
Hellish blazing storms
Drilling deep in floating steel
Ammo detonators
Annihilate the enemies
Destroy, retaliate

Forever in remembrance
The honour is to dive
Direction eternity
Eternal afterlife
Fearless goes the samurai
With godspeed from the skies
Servants of the emperor
On divine winds they die

Bound by the oath of Bushido
The blessed warrior's way
Holy end in battle
That long awaited day

Utmost sacred mission
Never to return
Pride vanishes in the flames
As homeland waters burn
