Transferred to the South East, Gebirgsbatallion.
Promoted Oberleutnant, wearing high decorations.
Threatened Austria requests, German reinforcements.
Deployment of the 14th Army, Rommel's Detachment.

To capture Mount Matajur,
this mission's last objective.
Savage close quarter fights,
prove past drills effective.
Pressing on, climbing steep,
Reaching the points marked.
No other alternative, go forward and go hard!

Causing heavy casualties, clear opposing nests.
Overpower outposts, seizing the crest.
Rushing on to Longarone, speed means surprise.
Whole brigades surrender, vanquished at sunrise.

As the battlefields go silent,
and troops leave their frontiers.
Not to command in combat, for over 20 years.

Loyalty, bravery, at last bring his reward.
To gain this palm for gallantry, the highest award.
Join those in remembrance, valorous elite.
For fatherland and emperor, Pour Le Merite!
