Clashes in the badlands, ever raging on.
Tenacious fighting, to hold the cauldron.
Maintain possession of the vital fort.
Regain initiative, capture the port.

Inaction on both sides, time to re-organize.
Initial Axis motion, after restoring supplies.

Advancing spearhead, pillars of dust.
Blackened horizon, decisive thrust.
Fierce resistance, pouring shells.
Murderous heat, combat in hell.

Imposing stronghold, a hard nut to crack.
Phalanx configuration, concentrated attack.

[guitar lead: Paul]

Piercing through minefields, bold enterprise.
Gazala taken, Tobruk the price.
