Theatre World War II, not an exercise.
Inferior in numbers, secrecy assured surprise.

At concentration area, all units mobilized,
the code word fell at 13:45.
Veritable fortresses, riding out at dusk.
On the road to victory they drive.

Concealed thoroughfare, elusive ghosts.
Route DG-7, to the Channel coast.

Avoid traffic congestion, removing barricades.
Rarely stopped for any length of time
The day goes to the side that is the first
to plaster its opponent with fire.

Sections blazing, at breakneck speed.
Shock to confound, mauling metal steeds.

Concealed thoroughfare, elusive ghosts.
Route DG-7, to the Channel coast.

[guitar lead: Stephan]

Tough resistance whilst crossing the Meuse
Murderous shelling from the river banks
Providing smoke to obscure observation
Building large pontoons to ferry tanks.

Directing the panzers, turrets traversed left.
Confused withdrawal, spreading collapse.
Smashing inferno, a foe in decline.
Roaring tracks and engines, crack the Maginot line.

[guitar harmony: Ed]
