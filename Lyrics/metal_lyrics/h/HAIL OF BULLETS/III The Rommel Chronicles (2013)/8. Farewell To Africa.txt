Brilliantly performed escape.
Divisions in dramatic shape.
Rearguard hostilities, anti-tank lines.
High speed withdrawal, secured by mines.

Demand for replenishments,
gasoline and nourishment.
Yet guns rapid firing, the dreadful 88.
Inflicting damage, ravage armored plates.

Trying to rescue what's left of his troops,
save them from imprisonment.
No further glory in future offensives.
Evacuate this continent,
tormented by malady and foul intrigue.
The genius forced to depart,
guiding his army till the very end,
fighting bold and hard.

[guitar lead: Paul]

One last blow at Kasserine, then vanish from the scene.
GI's fleeing in panic, Tigers on their heels.
One more courageous triumph, chaos; creation of steel.

Trying to rescue what's left of his troops,
save them from imprisonment.
No further glory in future offensives.
Evacuate this continent,
tormented by malady and foul intrigue.
The genius forced to depart,
leaving his valiant and tough 'Afrikaner',
with pain in his heart.
