1891
Year of a legend
Habitat the Corps
Battle his element

Into the Great War
Keep the Right Wing strong
First encounter
Reported, killed at Dun

To live as a hero
One must survive
In a Hail of Bullets
Worn out but alive

Stalemate in the West
Damp entrenchments
Austere conditions
Wire entanglements

Wounded whilst charging
Fixed on bayonet
Storming earthworks
MG's and Hand Grenades

To live as a hero
One must survive
Devoted to his men
Brings them out alive

Quality of decision
His was indeed
Like the swoop of the falcon
Of pure warrior's breed
