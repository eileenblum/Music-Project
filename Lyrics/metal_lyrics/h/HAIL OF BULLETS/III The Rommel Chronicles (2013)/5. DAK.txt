A grave calamity, one Axis power retreats.
Near annihilation, impending defeat.
Coalition warfare, appealing support.
Vanguard's arrival, impressive cohort.

Despite risk of air-raids, unload at floodlight.
Between dusk and dawn, all onto the dockside.
Supervising general, in personal command.
Preceding skirmishes, as more contingents land.

Instant operations, formations explore.
Promulgated title, Deutsches Afrika Korps.
