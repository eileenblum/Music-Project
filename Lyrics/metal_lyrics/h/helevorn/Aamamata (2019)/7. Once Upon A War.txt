A woman taken from home
To appease the warlords' thirst
The children give themselves up
What must be done to save their own innocence?
Innocents!

Why do we fight, no one wins
So sad now, I see you go
An eye for an eye, kith for kin
What must be done to forgive and to forget

I loved you as if you were my own
A bloodstained prize
A gallon per ounce

You think you are never wrong
Human error and pride,
One another, grieved in hate, our sons will feel our sins
Nothing changes on earth's sodden ground

I loved you as if you were my own
No one knows you as I, having seen you at your worst
An inner coward and thief
You'd snatch a purse to drink to your neighbor in the dirt

You think you are never wrong
Human error and pride,
One another, grieved in pain, our sons will feel our sins
Nothing changes on earth's sodden ground

You think you are never wrong
Human error and pride,
One another, meant to suffer, our sons will feel our sins
Nothing changes on earth's sodden ground
As we lived we will meet our end
