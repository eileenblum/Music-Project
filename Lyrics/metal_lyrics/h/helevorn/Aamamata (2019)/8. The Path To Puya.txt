To the southwest land deep under the earth
There lies the way

I no longer breathe, but I'm not dead
I rest on your lap, I cannot move around

Sharpen your knife, sharpen it quick
Those large black eyes fill with blood for my long trip
Take the meat from the beast before the fifth day
Remember me and toast before the end of time

Watch me arise, I can see my path before me
They call me sick, but death embraced me long ago

May you judge over me
I'll scale the mountain to arrive in heaven, trust in me
This old body will rest in a stone cave
To the north of this boat are lying all my ancestors

I am going to escape from this world of lions
Now open all the gates, I can hear them call

I will never die alone, I'll stay until you get here
Don't use my name again, Puya awaits your arrival

Hold me and take me to a bed now it's the time to say goodbye
Say goodbye and pray

Lives and time, moments passed waiting to be taken
To deny my ascension will be my worst failure

[The afterworld is Puya, "the land of souls," which is to the southwest under the earth. By a lavish death feast the deceased will reach Puya. He is judged by Pong Lalondong and then climbs a mountain to reach heaven, where he joins the deified ancestors as a constellation which guards mankind and the rice.]
