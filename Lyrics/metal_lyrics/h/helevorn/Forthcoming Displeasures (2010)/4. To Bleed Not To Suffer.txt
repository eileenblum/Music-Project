I was cleaning and burning my wounds
While you've failed to turn the sun into this cold winter
Just bleeding from my rotten sores
'Cause the blood is feeding me, I bleed the suffering

Turn my soul into scars
Turning every artery into dust
Turn to bitterness our way of life

Oh, I just breathe the air you are
Breathing from these tired lungs
You should taste my blood,
Through my infection, you will return and die

Die with me, you will know the meaning of it
Die with me again, you fed my scabs and my waste
To bleed not to suffer, to bleed not to die!

Turn my soul into scars
Turning every artery into dust

Can you destroy emotions with only a knife?
Feed my blood to the hungry flies, will I really survive?

Oh, I just breathe the air you're
Breathing from these tired lungs
You should taste my blood,
Through my infection, you'll return to die
To die, to die again!
