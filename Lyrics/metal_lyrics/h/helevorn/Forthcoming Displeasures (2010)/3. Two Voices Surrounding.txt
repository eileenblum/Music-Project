I walked around this great village
Where the eyes of man could see the joy
Desire luck where life is pretty
But I could feel the horror in your face

Down around the ground
Can you really feel why I turned into this man?
When you look at my eyes you will understand it
I've found millions of lies in
All the words you have pronounced
We were walking towards the sound that we made

The voices that I heard are resounding in the horizon
But I didn't feel you,
When I was looking around to find your welcome

I walked around this great village
But I could feel the horror in your face

Down around the ground,
Can you really feel why I turned into this man?
When you look at my eyes you will understand it
I've found millions of lies in
All the words you have pronounced
We were walking towards the sound that we made

The voices that I heard are resounding in the horizon
But I didn't feel you,
When I was looking around to find your welcome
