I came alone in this morning
But the affliction stays away
Can you see, through this window,
All the misery that remains the same?
How could you cross the line?
Don't carry on every illusion you found in me

'Til the rain has fallen,
I won't go anywhere
Don't carry on
'Til the end of hopelessness,
This joy is untrue

The mother of our lies is
Praying for the longing days to come
We all continue alive as
She doesn't enjoy enough
How can I avoid all these
Forthcoming lies that you're waiting for?

'Til the rain has fallen,
I won't go anywhere
'Til the end of hopelessness,
This joy is untrue

Disarmed by ineptitude
I'm not going to beat you now

No, the lies aren't what keep us alive
Will you trust me?
And recognize the sacrifice I did for the truth
The truth we'll never know,
Forgotten for centuries

Devoured by ineptitude
I'm not going to beat you
I'm not going to rape you
It reflects our disgrace
