In the yellow shining of your eyes
There's a desert waiting inside you

Evil is growing in your thorns
You're still alive to your never-ending scorn
The aroma that you emitted has died

Cursed dunes are sleeping in your mind
And desert's souls are praying and crying
Your lament will last for a very long time
And never we will see your hateful smile

Your smile is dying...
Your joy is now fading away...

The aroma that you emitted has
Died like the light at nightfall
And the sorrow you've found is
Growing while you're dying

Evil is growing in your thorns
You're still alive to your never-ending scorn
The aroma that you emitted has
Died like the light at nightfall
And the sorrow you've found is dying with it

Your smile is dying...
Your joy is fading...

Fade away, your smile is fading away...
