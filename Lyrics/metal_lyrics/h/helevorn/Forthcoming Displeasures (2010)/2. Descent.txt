Descent... of misery
Decay of humans
Defective in spirit
Fail of mankind

In this decadence I'll stay here infinitively,
Waiting for the dying of the glory
I touch the sides of the sky with my freezing hands
Dancing with lifeless clouds of doom

I renounced to every raining day, to every moment alone

In this decadence I'll stay here infinitively,
Waiting for the cure for the ruin
And I touch the sides of the sky with my freezing hands
Dancing with lifeless clouds of doom

I renounced to every raining day, to every moment alone
And I'm crying and praying to the light
I never forgot I'll never betray

I believe in someone who carries the
Weight of the world upon his feet,
In someone who takes the reins without fear,
Without compassion
I can't do anything for you, not even for myself
In these descending cities there isn't a true humanity
In which to believe in, in which to trust in
Don't mourn for your family but for the air you're breathing,
For the blood it's flowing inside you,
You're the only important one

I forgot this decadence infinitively,
Waiting for the cure for the ruin
And I touch the sides of the sky with my freezing hands
Dancing with lifeless clouds of doom
