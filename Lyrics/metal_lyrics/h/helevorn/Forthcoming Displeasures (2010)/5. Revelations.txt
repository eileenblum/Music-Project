Where I was burning cold

Where the anger grows in me
We have found desolation
In the barren land of misery
Our revelation!

Ruin and drugs injected into
The blood of those who have ignored
The wisdom of the gods, liars!
Seeking for the truth, can you reveal how life is so far?
And reveal where will I be reborn? So on...
Where will I find the cause of my apathy,
Reality is not for me, please tell me why!

Could you take me out of there?
I am blind and paralyzed
Why the raven is calling me again?
It's not the way I want to die

Cold as the blackest eyes I've ever seen
Visions which are proving there is life around me

Where the anger grows
We haven't found the answer
In the barren land of misery,
We have found the revelations

The ruin and the drugs injected into
The blood of those who have ignored
The wisdom of the gods, liars!
Seeking for the truth, can you reveal how life is so far?
And reveal me where will I be reborn? So on...
Where will I find the cause of my apathy,
Reality is not for me, please tell me why!

Cold as the blackest eyes I've ever seen
Visions are proving there is
Life around me, the existence of life
My revelation!
