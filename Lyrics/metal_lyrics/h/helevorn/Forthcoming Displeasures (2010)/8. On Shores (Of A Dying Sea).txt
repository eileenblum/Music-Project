Silent water doesn't breathe even
If the rain has fallen down
In our days we were floating over the greatest seas

Death inside the oceans,
Inside the depth everything is grey
The light which fed the seas is fading down
Despite our faith in its returning

On shores of a dying sea
On shores of an abyss

Waters remain despite the light,
Even if the sound of revers died
Every life was drained, every moment consumed
By the ocean that torn us apart

'Til the day I turned into a thousand worms
Condemned to wait the highest tide to swim to nowhere,
But I will have to wait on the shores of this
Rotten place where everything is fading
