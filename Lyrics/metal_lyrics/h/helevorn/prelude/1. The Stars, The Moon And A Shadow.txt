Beyond the seas of eternal silence
We fly away from the night
The stars will show us the way, immortal promises
Falling down, like tears of sorrow

This is our farewell song
The Stars, the Moon and a Shadow, are our witness
Come to me my dark princess

From time to time my memories, make me leave heaven to search,
The Stars, the Moon and a Shadow.
This cold winter my dear leave my heart, like the snow as the river flows,
As a waterfall.
Do we have to mourn this silence?

Oh! My dark princess, I suffer thy fullmoon nights
I've been enchanted... your green eyes
For your innocence I've lost my cruelty
For your heart I've lost my condition

I bewail my bitter promises, but my ambition my dear,
Are beyond this silence, listen to the wind,
Who shows you the way beyond, the grace of God?
