I was seeking in your landscapes
Remains of my past days, as they've gone far
I've come to gratify you
But now I'm blind when the sun rises

Falling down my hundred reasons
Under your cup of paper and glass
In this heaven, full of soft black frames
Near of every candle
I'm observing when it's being corroded by the flame
I think I see a weeping rain

The dark side of the moon in my full face
Full of mistakes, swords in my conscience
Everyday my grief is my reason
For a last moment in which we needed to escape

Light catch me all inside
Behind the scene where we fly
To flee in this hideaway, we're allied

Crawling in this dirty ground
Perhaps with only two thousand wars to begin
I hope one day there will be no one to say to me to stay
I can perceive than ten thousand wars will start here

I should keep my devotion clear
With fear you use my name
Silence becomes my ruin, my timeless sorrowfullness
