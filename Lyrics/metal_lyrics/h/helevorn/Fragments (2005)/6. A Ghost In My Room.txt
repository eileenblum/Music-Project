You've survived more than thousand debts
Going down from your desert lands
You're the cause of this conflict

Eyes, I've seen it in my eyes
Smile, I've forgotten your smile

A ghost in my room
You can touch it, you can breathe for it
How could I believe in what you're saying?
You're the last that have seen us here
Come on my friend, come with me
