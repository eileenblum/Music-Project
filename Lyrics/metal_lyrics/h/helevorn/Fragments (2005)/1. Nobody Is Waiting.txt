You're arriving, feeling so strong
Living into the cross, how did I become this?
You're teaching me and to some other folk, so alone
Can I believe in what you give me?

Lady, you're running fast but nobody is waiting
Lady, don't run away, you won't forgive

Looking when you're falling down
At the same time that you lose the way to the last train
Everyday you tell me about your presence in this netherworld
And you can buy it by the date of your birth
Sing inside the sphere where notes emerge
Your past is now, it will always be

The real past is only one hundred photographs
To see all the future, maybe we're not competent
I'll try to find a way to collide against you
