Burned around angels, between queen's distress
In the eyes of men you're the mist of their insane
All is secure in what they say
Rising the seas and flashes in their belief
Sweet is abusive to describe your full beauty

Only hate the unknowing, don't be discovered
Oh, I can feel your ideas flowing in your mind

From the throne of the pure instinct
nothing can be in view of the deaf
The cause of all the whispers and verses

Enchanted by your face
nobody had listened to you
nor met you, nor evaluated from your caves

Replace your blanket, feelings are covering me
Infect your skin, weakness of men is deceived
That's the way I'm coming, you'll be humbles turned to stone
You're all void, appearance is all your soul
