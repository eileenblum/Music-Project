In silence, I fear, about angels and demons
I search, tonight, a sharp blade...

...Has cut across myself among those feelings
The theatre of life's nothing but pain
And between this river the water flows
The water flows and life go

And between us, together
I see your face in another dimension

My remembrances like tears falling down
White wings of a celestial figure
I reveal my secrets to the sign of eons
White wings of a celestial figure

Who have awake those, from confusion
And my angel has safe me from demons and remembrances
