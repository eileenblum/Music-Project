Landscapes all around invade my haunt
Like water overflowing inside my mouth
I know these pictures but I can't remember
Where the start is?
Where I could find you?

Calling me in your life
Can I take faster your own way?
Can you provoke my own collapse?
Switching off the old lights
then I will become insane
Did you ever see your smile in the other face?

You've left helpless my only recollection
of your existence in this lonely world

Yes, I want to go to this path with you
Yes, I want and I'll crawl for the truth
Follow me and I'll stand here for all time
It's what I told you when you were leaving far
