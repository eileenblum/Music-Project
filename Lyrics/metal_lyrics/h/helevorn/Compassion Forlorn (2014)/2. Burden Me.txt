Hey, why do you care, fool?
Returned to you, is nothing but dust

Imagine he is kind, the man who carries light
Believes in filthy mortals, all these things pass him by
Remembering what it means to wholly sacrifice
Is there day or only night?

Now fall to your face itâs your damnation
Taking all you have, demanding more
Insatiable, you shall reap what you sow
Itâs all your fault

Imagine he is kind, the man who carries light
Believes in filthy mortals, all these things pass him by
Remembering what it means to wholly sacrifice
Is there day or only night?

No one makes me calm
Please, Iâd throw my life away
Swallowed tears, Iâm on my own

Itâs your fault!

Now fall to your face itâs your damnation
Taking all you have, demanding more
Insatiable, you shall reap what you sow
Itâs all your fault

No one makes me calm
Iâd throw my life away
