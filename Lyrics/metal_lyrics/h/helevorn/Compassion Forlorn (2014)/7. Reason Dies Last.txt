Far away from what I know
I am trading a life for a life
Every day Iâm looking down

How long does it take to get there?
I will just rest for a while
Every day Iâm dying

Rise completely
And I will help you to understand
I am trying to rescue everything
And my life falls from my hands
Yourâs just beginning

For though my belief in humanity fails,
Amidst a darkening field of blueing hues,
My body dies calmly; my skin turns yet pale,
I know I will live on through memories true

Quod Fuerim Ultimum

For all that I feel will live on!

Far away from what I know
I am trading a life for a life
Every day Iâm looking down

Take me away from what I know
I am trading a life for a life
Every day Iâm dying

Rise completely
And I will help you to understand
I am trying to rescue you everything
And my life falls from my hands

I donât trust the wind or rain
To carry my message away
My heart is written in stone
I am sorry I could not stay

Now I am fading
My spirit arise
