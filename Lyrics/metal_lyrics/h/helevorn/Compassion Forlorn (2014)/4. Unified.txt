Poisoned flowers, broken vows, glowered stares
Injected madness taking over, now dead to the world

You see me as someone else
A mere shadow of former self
And now niceties fade away
No excuses, I am to blame

I am empty deep inside
Hesitation made me unified

I now bleed as someone else,
A mere shadow of former self, no excuses

It now reaches the very depth of me
Complete loss of sanctity
The sickness for eternity

From where I am, from where I stand
I am now not the one in command
Rights are thine, with closed eyes Iâm unified
Rights are thine, I am unified!

I am empty deep inside
Hesitation made me unified
All I can see are just simple minds
None are caring we are blind
