Tear my flesh out, rip it from my bones
In rage my blood burns red
Iâll die a savage death
Beat in my head with heavy stones

Regret and pain, my head in shame
I watched him die and did nothing
To live while he just passed away

Break my bones give me the blade
Slash my throat and seal my fate
Throw me in a hollow grave

Vida que Ã©s meva, que Ã©s com un raig dins de la mar

Take me!
Take me now!
