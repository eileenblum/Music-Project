You canât carry on your smile

One fist breaks the window
So scared nowâ¦

I canât find, find the truth about you
Your soul is full, full of ambition
I must escape to survive in this life
But now it's the time to implore redemption

You canât carry on your smile
How long will you stay in my land?

Hatred is becoming my last way of restitution
The looters are stealing our illusions, all our miracles
The looters are all coming to dominate our lives
And to depreciate all that weâve yearned for

Inside my body, I feel sparks
Meanwhile Iâll never accept decline

I couldnât find, find the truth about you
I was that man, now Iâm feeling internal rage
Should I run or should I stand, stand and fight?
I cannot leave your fate to chance
