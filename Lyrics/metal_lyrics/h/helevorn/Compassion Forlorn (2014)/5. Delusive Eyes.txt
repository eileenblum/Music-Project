Way back when I could see
A burning brush inflamed a tree
But I'm running from the fire
Now the flame encircles me
This scene scathes into memory
Now it's all coming back

Run, run away from delusive eyes
But I face now flame and cries
Run, run away from delusive eyes
Hide your face from fire's lies

Run, run away from delusive eyes
But I face now flame and cries
Run away!
I'm trying to rise again

Those around me, those before me
I cannot now trust anyone
My face now falls back to the mud

As far back as I can see
My broken legs buckle under me
But I'm running from the fire
Now the flames encircle me
I try, but fall again down to my knees
Now it's all coming back...

Run! Now I relive my horrid sorrow
Run! There will be no more tomorrow

Run, run away from delusive eyes
But I face now flame and cries
Run away!
I'm trying to rise again!
