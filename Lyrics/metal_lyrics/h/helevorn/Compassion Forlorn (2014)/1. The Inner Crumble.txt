Watching smothered souls through my eyes
From within my pain wonât leave
Singeing way deep down, far inside
Nothing reaches, nothing helps

My eyes cannot see
No regret inside me
Is there anyone who can cause the pain to flee?

Hearing my silence become my inner crumble
Now I watch innate compassion furnish primal hate

Watching searing souls through my eyes
From within my pain wonât leave
Singeing way deep down, far inside
Nothing reaches, nothing helps
I now live out my deepest hell

How far have you gone?
Find me, I am lost
Is there anyone who can cause a change in me?
