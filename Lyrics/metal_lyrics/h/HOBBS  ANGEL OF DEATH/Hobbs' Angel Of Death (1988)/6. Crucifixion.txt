First he lived then he died
To the cross he was crucified
Crown of thorns upon his head
Satan laughed as the blood ran red
Beneath the earth the demons fled
To drink the tears that flowed from his head

Crucifixion death to Christ
Crucifixion

Crucified death to Christ the price you paid
Extinction of your life
There you hang in total pain
No escape the demons sang

Crucifixion death to Christ
Crucifixion

First he lived then he died
To the cross he was crucified
Crown of thorns upon his head
Satan laughed as the blood ran red
Beneath the earth the demons fled
To drink the tears that flowed from his head

Crucifixion death to Christ
Crucifixion

Open the gates of hell giving life to Lucifer
Let the witches cast their spells
Sacrifice young virgin souls
Giving life to the dead
blood will fill their graves
The children must wear the mark of an inverted crucifix
