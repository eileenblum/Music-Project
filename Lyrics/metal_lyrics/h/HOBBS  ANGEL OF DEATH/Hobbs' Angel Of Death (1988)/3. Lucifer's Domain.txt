Lust to rise from the demented grave and walk the again
Thy body rots, my mind deranged in the pits of this domain
Doomed in hell, no escape death in this internal hole
Death upon death, scum upon scum, tormented tortured souls

Gasping for air, cannot breath the price that I must pay
To serve the lord
For eternal life - Lucifer's domain

Burning bodies cram the walls, living dead they roam
Distorted limbs every desire that Satan himself controls
Lust to rise from this grave and set my soul free
Judgement between life and death in this inferno it can be seen

Gasping for air, cannot breath the price that I must pay
To serve the lord
For eternal life - Lucifer's domain

Doomed in hell, no escape the living dead
They roam, thy body rots, thy mind deranged in the pits of this domain

Burning bodies cram the walls
Deaths in this eternal hole
Death upon death only dormant life
Thy body rots in this dormant grave
Doomed in hell, no escape
Death upon death only dormant life
