Hidden amongst the darkest shadows
The ladies of Whitechapel
Mist surrounds cobble stone paths
The ripper is well disguised
Panting like a hungry dog
Eyes peeled wide
Razor sharp instruments preparing for attack

Beware ladies of the night
Your life is within his hands
Insert a scalpel into your abdomen
Perform a living autopsy

Disembowelment and butchery
Killing on the brain
Lunatic of the night awaits for his victim
Dwelling for the taste of blood
Act of the macabre
Internal organs he will feast upon

Sluts and harlots of the night
Now your gonna die
Lurking with a demented mind
Is your anser to death

Anni Chapman you tempted fate
He waits in mist for you
To slice your throat and remove your breasts
Lays you down to die
Unconvicted maniac he fled into the night

Sluts and harlots of the night
Now your gonna die
Insert a scalpel into your abdomen
And perform a living autopsy
