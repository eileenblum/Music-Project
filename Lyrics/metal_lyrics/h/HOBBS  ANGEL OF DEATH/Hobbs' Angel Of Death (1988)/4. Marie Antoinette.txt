Remanded to the callous
Condemned to death
Your life is now in my hands
When dawn breaks the blade
Will fall to decapitate your head
No one will sigh for not a virgin
Will die but a decrepit wife of a king

(Six o'clock your time has come
my guillotine will fall
Another severed head to hang
On my guillotine wall
Hear them sigh let her die
The choice is one for all
Tears are shed from her son
His blood begins to boil)

Six o'clock your time has come
my guillotine will fall
No one will sigh for not a virgin
Will die but a decrepit wife of a king

Remanded to the callous Marie Antoinette
Your life in now in my hands
When dawn breaks the blade will fall down to decapitate your head
No one will sigh for not a virgin will die
But a decrepit wife of a king
