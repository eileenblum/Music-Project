Enter the centre of the sacred star
Demons clutch the reins
A Journey to the pits of hell, the antichristation world
Furness burns, bodies si, free us from this pain
A place of death lies beneath
Awaiting our descent
In the distance I see the throne
Lord Satan takes command
Impaled corpses around the crypt
Millions of the Christians damned
I take my vows
I sell my soul, I sit in your left hand
I lust to have the powers and the pleasures beyond the grave

Journey to the depths of hell

Jesus Christ is not in heaven
But down here where he belongs
Crucified in the name of death
His own father cannot release his soul

I'll crucify disbelievers of the blackest arts
I'll rip the tongues from their throats
The world must learn that the church of Christ must die
Fuck to all Christian faith

I take the vows, I sit in your left hand
Lucifer the prince of darkness
The church must die in evil faith
Raise, hail Satan
