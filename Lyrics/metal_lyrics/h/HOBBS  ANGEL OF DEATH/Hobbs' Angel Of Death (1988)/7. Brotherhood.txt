Lucifer lord of darkness
I summon the almighty
Virgins purity sacrificed
In your name the covents
Pure of spring
The blood that we drink
Will flourish in your veins
And enter the pits of hell
I hail to you
Oh prince of the black
I await your final command
The gates of hell lie awaiting
For us to turn the key come forth
Possess our souls I serve for eternity

I saw the life demonic
Power that trust beneath the earth
Thunder starts to crack
Lightning lights the sky I hail to thee
Of majesty come forth possess our souls
Lucifer prince of hell
Now I summon thee
