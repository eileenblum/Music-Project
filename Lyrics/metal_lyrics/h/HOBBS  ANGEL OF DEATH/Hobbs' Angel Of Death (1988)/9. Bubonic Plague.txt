Lightning speeds across the sky
Torment your body and your mind
This is it your time has come
Now you bow your head
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust disease will be spread

Now, now, its time for you to die
Breathe, feel it in the air

Across the streets of London
Nothing else but death
Rats will have their feast before
The fire burns them to death

Now, now, its time for you to die
Breathe, feel it in the air
