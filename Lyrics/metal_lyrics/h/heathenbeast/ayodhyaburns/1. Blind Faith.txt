The story starts far back in time
When blind faith did perceive
The birth of Ram

The twisted truth from scriptures told
A lie upon a lie that built
The cornerstone

The lies!
The lies they feed us.

A king did build this city
From bricks and stones
A kingdom that was born
For a war not fought, unconquerable he rose.

Ignorance, Hate &amp; Violence
The contempt we breed
These are the roads
To which blind faith leads

Why do we never question
The words a preacher speaks
Why do we never question
What we believe

But as the legend goes
The king he was dethroned
The eyes now uncovered
And the blind did see once more

Ignorance, Hate &amp; Violence
The contempt we breed
These are the roads
To which blind faith leads

Upon the pedestal he stands
A voice so loud and deep
Hear his words and believe the lie
You weak pathetic being

Repent not for your sins
A slave to religion you are
Blinded by the many lies
You, yourself has been lost

They divide and they rule
Youâre just a pawn in the game
And when the castle comes crumbling down
Only they remain.
