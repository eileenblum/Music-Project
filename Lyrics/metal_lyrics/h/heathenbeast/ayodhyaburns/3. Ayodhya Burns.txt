They came, they conquered
A myth beneath the sand
A holy structure built
Over beliefs it stands

One day they razed, set ablaze
The walls did not withstand
A broken faith above
A myth beneath the sand
A nation was plagued
A riot ravaged the land
While the pyres burned
No resolution at hand

Loss of life and livelihood
Damage to public property
Not one who is accountable
For the suffering and misery

Ayodhya Burns

Divided by faith, Torn by violence
Nothing holy, nothing sacred
Ayodhya Desecrated

Holy wars once waged
Return to haunt the grave
Empty promises, betrayed
Religious honour at stake

The cries, the screams
Of women and children slain
No mercy. No compassion
Redemption for the years of pain.

Ayodhya Burns

Divided by faith, Torn by violence
Nothing holy, nothing sacred
Ayodhya Desecrated

And it burns.

And it has been settled
Or so that is what they say
Still dividing by religion
And to which god we pray

At the end of it all
There is no god
And that is the only true belief.
Forsake the plastic demon
And see what the book really means.
No religion ever did preach
The roads they all lead to the same
We must be divided no more and
Put religion into the grave.
