Blood was spilled
Invoked religious ire
Armed, they took the streets
On a killing spree

The holy shrine - An empty space within four walls
The holy shrine - A man made god that rules us all

No God would ever warrant
No God would justify
The most heinous crime
Religious Genocide

No God would ever warrant
No religion did indite
The Slaying of the innocent
Religious Genocide

The one who wields the power
His lust, his greed that grows
Exploiting blind faith
To watch his empire grow

His minions lead the slaughter
The blinded fools donât know
While they all die in battle
The leaderâs safe at home.

Suffocate their beliefs
Ours is the one true god
Words that ring through
âHunt them down and kill, kill, kill them allâ



The holy land was proclaimed
They conquered it by force
Tearing down the structure
A blasphemous religious horde

And so the disease spread
Religions went to war
Ignorant, pathetic mortals
Killing for their god.

No God would ever warrant
No God would justify
The most heinous crime
Religious Genocide

No God would ever warrant
No religion did indite
The Slaying of the innocent
Religious Genocide

The scars that never heal
These scars will never heal.

Death breeds, hate
Death breeds, contempt
Death breeds, malice
Death breeds, Revenge I seek, I will avenge

Donât believe the empty space
Donât believe the lies theyâve spoke
Donât believe the preachers words
Donât forsake yourself to a counterfeit god
