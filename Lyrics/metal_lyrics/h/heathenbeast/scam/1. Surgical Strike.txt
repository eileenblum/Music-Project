Welcome to this grand circus of a scheme
I take your money and leave you to bleed
Come this night your tender is illegal
Please bear with me the pain will just bite a little

Your old damn notes can go to hell
See the black money hoarders cower in their cells
I'll rid this country of illegal currency
But my friends rich and powerful will go scot free

I'll ensure that no harm
Comes to me and my friends
I'm just here to laugh
As I fuck the opposition in the end.
