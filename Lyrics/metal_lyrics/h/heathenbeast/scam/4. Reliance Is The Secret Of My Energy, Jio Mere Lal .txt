Digital India is my dream
Come on girl I'll make you scream
A net connection in every house
Free Internet for you and your spouse

My sexy smile and my best suit
With my well-combed hair and polished boot
On the front page my mug you see
On every paper in the fucking street

Reliance is the secret of my energy
Internet phone and cable TV
Everything will fucking free
Jio Mere Lal

My master plan was fucking smart
Told you first and saved your arse
Had it foretold in a gujju paper
I knew you would thank me later

My sexy smile and my best suit
With my well-combed hair and polished boot
On the front page my mug you see
On every paper in the fucking street

Hand in hand we walk together
You have more money but my dick is bigger
Like lost lovers we adore
Mutual benefits but you are my whore.
