On the first day of demonetization we saw
On the front page of the paper was a whore
Being felicitated for his unplanned pile of shit
By a private limited company that benefits from it

The digital age is our priority among other things
More than food, water, electricity and housing
Famine, suicide, hunger and drought.
It's more important to learn to use PayTm now.

We get really great network inside and out
Cashless transactions will be a breeze now
Doesn't matter if I don't have a smartphone
Or if my grandparents are 90 years old

Force feed us you likes and bullshit
Make us use these stupid money portals
Run like a headless goat for my own money
Of course, you laugh at it in Japan because it's funny

In some of the cities, people don't have a place to shit
And of course, in full public view, the government takes a piss.
