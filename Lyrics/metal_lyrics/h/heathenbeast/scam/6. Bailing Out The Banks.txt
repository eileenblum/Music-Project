The story you were told
Is that your notes are fucking old
They are used in many bad ways
Funding terrorism, drugs and counterfeiting
Black fucking money!

Six hundred thousand rupees in bad loans
That what all the fucking banks are owed
Where did all that cash go?
Where did all that cash go?
Does anybody know?

It's a great big master plan,
For bailing out the banks
At the cost of the common man
Are we just writing off bad loans?

To save the banks from a virtual collapse
Bring your money and deposit it fast
A price you must pay as a common man
A price you must pay for this masterplan

Kill two birds with one stone
Under the guise of black money
The machinery will roll
The veil of black covers, they don't know.
