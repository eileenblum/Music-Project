Oh you fucking incompetent shmucks
You were going to hit a 6 but got out on duck
You thought this was a nice little game to play
You didn't give a fuck if people died on the way

It's only a minor inconvenience

She couldn't feed her family, it's only a minor inconvenience
She watched her helpless hungry child
The old man died waiting in line, it's only a minor inconvenience
He died for the refusal of his old bills, it's only a minor inconvenience
A baby died as her mother did wait, it's only a minor inconvenience

A rising death toll, this blood is on your hands
The whole nation is down to their knees just because you failed
Because of your stupid arrogance, and all your lies.
But it's only a minor inconvenience
