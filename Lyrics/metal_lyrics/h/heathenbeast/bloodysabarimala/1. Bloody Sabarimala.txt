There is a shrine deep in the hills
That's causing a lot of turmoil
Let's get the facts right once and for all
Before blood is shed, not menstrual

Ayyappa, are women so impure?
Or is it the minds of your irrational horde

Named after Sabari, she prayed to Ram
A temple was built, by tribals of the land
Ayyappa, a Prince who did penance at the site
Legend has it, he dissolved into light

This 15th century shrine was just visited in Jan
Annually by tribal groups and some Tams
1810: Laxmibai formed Devaswom
A brahmin priest for rituals, revenue was awesome

1950: poachers desecrated the shrine
In ruins for a decade, pilgrims didn't mind
As visitors grew, rituals did too
It was all Sanskritised

1970: women of menstrual age were banned
It was OK earlier but not
Since the '91 courting ruling

Ayyappa, are women so impure?
Or is it the minds of your irrational horde

21st century India began to modernise
The court ruled in favour of equal rights
An atheist authority tried to implement
Right wing saw opportunity
Trouble began to ferment

Kerala, you want another Godhra?
Is your God worth dying for?
Have you no respect for women?
You heard BJP party President
Stop playing into their hands
Show them you're literate
You eat beef, don't give a damn
