The system is failing
A crumbling structure
Religion, the down fall 
Of human beings

Spreading hatred through religion
Infecting like a disease.

The forces of Hindutva
The vehicle of propaganda 
Self proclaimed guardians of Bharat Mata

The cleansing of Bharat
The cultural purification
Realizing their dreams of a Hindu nation

The saffron brigade
Those who are not of us will perish
We will assassinate, annihilate and eradicate

For any Hindu who truly understands
Who follows and believes, He can see
The complete destruction of the values and core beliefs,
The un-washable stain on Hinduism, we bleed.
