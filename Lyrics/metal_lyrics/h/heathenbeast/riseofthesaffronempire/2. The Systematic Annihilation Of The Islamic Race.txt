They believe in Bharat Ma
the one true Hindu nation
Saffron will unite.

They believe themselves
to be the keepers, the upholders,
guardians of the Hindu faith.

We are not secular, we are not Tricolour,
ours is a saffron flag.
Hindu blood will reign.

Our ultimate goal is to annihilate,
to burn, diminish and to erase
all trace of the Islamic race.

Spark the flames of communal fires.
Deceive the gullible, hatred you inspire.
Interpret the holy book to suit your desires.

You brainwash the youth, create hatred.
Follow Hinduism or die, the ultimatum.
Systematically annihilate the Islamic race.

Feed them lies, you twist the scriptures.
If you are not with us, you are a traitor. 
Why did you murder? The Cow is my mother.

You lead the angry mob, because he did eat.
No proof or evidence, just because of his belief.
Your propaganda worked, but the truth was not seen.

Let us not forget that Islam is not innocent either.
The books have all been raped by extremists' carnal desires.

Wars are being waged across the world,
no religions of peace, only breeding fear.
The Christians were no better, remember the crusades.
In this world, religion has no place. 

Every religion preaches the same.
Every story, every teaching, a common thread prevails.
Can you not open your eyes and see it is fake?
A tool to divide and control, enslave the human race.

Brush the dirt under the rug.
Distract the masses from the truth.
The fear of god is the leash 
and ignorance breeds the fool.

Hinduism would not be proud
of what you have done in her name. 
You kill, rape, lie and cheat.
Swachh Bharat is your aim.

In your vision of India
no other religion has a place.
But more than Christians, Jews, or Buddhists,
it's the Muslims that you hate.
