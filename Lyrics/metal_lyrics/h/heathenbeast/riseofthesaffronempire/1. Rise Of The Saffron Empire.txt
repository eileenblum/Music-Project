when the barrel is rotten
you salvage the rot
paint a perfect picture
and deceive them all

deceive them all

silence the voices,
silence the thoughts
distract and deviate the masses
their attention is bought

victory is ours,
they believed the lies
A Hindu nation reborn,
the Saffron Empire will rise

he is our hero, the shining beacon
he is our savior, take us to glory

silence the voices,
silence the thoughts
distract and deviate the masses
their attention is bought

victory is ours,
they believed the lies
A Hindu nation reborn,
the Saffron Empire will rise

blood can be washed
even scars can heal
but the truth of your crimes
will come to be revealed

for now they are blinded
by deceit and their own greed
they put him on a pedestal
he made them believe

words of the ancient texts 
you manipulate to your ways
misguiding the young
sowing the seeds of hate

the hypocrisy lies in the belief itself
that a way of life will indoctrinate
bastardized and blasphemed
the Hindu religion will be your fate

harness the power of the ultimate weapon (it is religion)
to create disharmony and destruction (it is religion)
breed a hatred to make men kill (it is religion)
create a god to justify your sin (it is religion)
