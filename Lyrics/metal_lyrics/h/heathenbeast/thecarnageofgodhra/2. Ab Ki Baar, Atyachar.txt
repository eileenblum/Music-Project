A mountain of bodies, in four trucks disposed
In an empty well, dozens more found a home.
Women and children, no one was spared.
Even the police, did not seem to care.

We begged the gun-toting police,
Sir, let our innocent children go
He questioned their innocence and said
Aaj marna hai tum ko!

They surrounded us and doused us with petrol and kerosene
They burned us alive; I screamed I cried, at the bottom of the human pile, still alive
Six of my family, none have survived, my baby boys I watched them die
The government can give us money but will it really suffice?
Cash cannot replace justice, how do you put a price on their lives?

The women who tried to escape, they were molested
Their mouths were clamped, their clothes were torn
Kausar she stood beside me, with a child, unborn
Her womb was slit open, the foetus impaled on a sword.

At the graveyard he sits, counting the dead bodies
Not a sight for human eyes, hamari bhi himat tuti

Wherever there was an attack, women were raped
Their bodies still scarred, each mark tells the tale.
Another family of seven, hid in a field for two days
Found by the mob who stole their money and killed them anyway.

Jafri was dragged into the street and forced to parade naked
Refusing to say "Jai Shri Ram" they beheaded and burnt his remains

Think of the hate they create
Of all the lies they spread
Hindu or Muslim, it doesnât matter
Religion should be dead.

Motherfucking religious leaders
Brainwashing the gullible fools
Creating an army of religious warriors
To fight a war that can bear no fruit.

Mandir bhi le lo, masjid bhi le lo
Magar tum hamare lahu se na khelo
