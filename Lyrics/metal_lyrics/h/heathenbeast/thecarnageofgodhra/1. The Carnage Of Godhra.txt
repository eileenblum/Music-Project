It all goes back to Ayodhya, a holy land claimed so,
Wretched human religious beliefs, seeds of hate they sow.

The train it chugs along the rail she goes,
Somewhere along the way an evil it did grow.

The returning pilgrims with a religious blindfold,
Then came the attack for reasons unknown.

Godhra it was named, humanity shamed,
There is no fire without a spark.

Trapped. Stoned. Burnt Alive.
Were they Hindu, Muslim or Humans in the fire?

What reason could there be to spark such horrific ire ?
The tales are a plenty, who speaks the truth? Who is the liar?
The provocation was there and the reaction was strong
And this you believe is a service to your god?

Do you realize it begins at the divide?
Do you realize you are blinded by lies?
Take away your religion and see what you find.
Take away your god and do you still see eye for an eye?

How can you sleep with the blood that youâve seen?
Live each day, is there no guilt you feel?
Do visions of those charred bodies not haunt your sleep?
How can you still justify your religious beliefs?

The truth is still buried and justice is not served
Conspiracies are a plenty, 59 people burned,
So many different stories, which one is the word?
Who was the real demon leading the violent herd?

This was just the beginning
Of a genocide that was brewing
The swords they were sharpening
For the mass revenge killing

In the name of a god.
Your best imaginary friend
In the name of a god.
Itâs just good business in the end.
