Seven Ninety Muslims and Two Fifty Four Hindus died
The religion doesnât matter that is over a 1000 human lives
The fires died down and the smoke did clear
A blood stained ground, people living in fear

Widespread destruction, a system that failed
So many arrested, murderers let out on bail
Homeless, penniless, wandering in pain,
Still waiting for justice and relief that never came.

We are still missing answers, to what started the fire
What was the incident to spark the ire?
What was the reason? Have people conspired?
Is this all part of some political game?
They say in a game of Chess, the pawns die first.
Does the butchering of innocent really quench the blood thirst?
If you both had the same god, who would draw their blade first?

In the wake of this tragedy some prominent leaders did speak
Their speeches filled with hate, more evil they did breed
Bal Thackeray spewed venom and so did the VHP
Evil did show many shames, behold the Indian Mujahedeen

Violence will only breed more violence
When will the killing of the innocent stop
We must educated the youth of our nation
Empower them to not be brainwashed, by religion.

Can you imagine watching your family killed before your own eyes?
Do you think you will ever sleep peacefully after watching such horrific crimes?
How can anyone even live a normal life after hearing those helpless cries?
Will you still find a reason to live after everyone you love has died?
Even though 10 years have passed, the ghosts still haunt my life
There has been no justice, no relief, a nightmare with no respite.
