Fuck all your gods, equally.

Your man made myths
Your man made gods
These are the lies
That you have fallen for

My god is right
Your god is wrong
Mine is the one true god
All the others begone!

My religion is right
Your religion is wrong
You call that a god?
I call that a fraud!

Die for my religion
Just to make you believe
You blood I will spill
For my religious disease

If you don't believe
I will make you
If you don't believe
I will kill you

Fuck Hinduism
Fuck Islam
Fuck Christianity
Fuck every religion

Fuck all religions, equally

When people lose their minds
We call them crazy
Talk to invisible men in the sky
This is religion, it earns money

All the religious books are same
Because they were written by men
The mind of man can only go so far
God is just his vision of the same.

First you worshiped the sun,
Then the stars,
You worshiped the places afar
Then when you reached
You found no god
But you had no choice
By the lies you were marred.

Did you ever stop to think
That if when you were born
That no one told you there was god
Would you still believe in Santa Claus?
