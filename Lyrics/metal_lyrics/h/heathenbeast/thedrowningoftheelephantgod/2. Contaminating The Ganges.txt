God did tell you, the water is holy.
God did tell you, I'll wash away your sins
When you bathe your rotten self in the holy Ganges.

Once a symbol of divine purity
Bathe in it for the river cleans all
A thousand years have passed
The stench of your sins still remain

I come as a child, murdered my mother
I come with purity, bathed in sin
I seek refuge, in palaces I live
I am no sinner, unholy in wealth
I come undone, a disease I am
Do with me, whatever you will.
For I remain, your symbol of ignorance
For I remain, stain of your sin

Destroy, Violate, Raping Unholy
Bastards, Sinners,
Contaminating the Ganges
Defecate, Suffocate, Blessed Unholy
Liars, Preachers,
Contaminating the Ganges

An effort to restore what once was
A thousand walls do block the path
Religion, corruption
The mass of humans that bathe in their own faeces

A lifetime of sins cannot be washed
Away by just a belief and a river
Justify your crimes before a false lord
Justify that you are free from sin
