Ganapati Bappa Morya

Dirt and oil created form
Infused with life; he was born to guard the gate.

Dutiful son, a God made from clay
Did stand guard as his mother bathed

A warrior returns, a war did wage
Dead he lay, the song of Shiva

In a pool of blood he lay, the son of Shiva
In a pool of blood he lay, beheaded Ganapati Bappa

Parvathi wept, the promise of wrath
The world will face her fury
Till he was reborn
Resurrecting the dead Son of God

Shiva, he sent his army forth
That fetched him an elephant head

Fused together man and beast
So he was born, Ganapati bapa, the Elephant God!

And so the story goes, over a 1000 years old
And so the story goes, the myth becomes a lie

Today they celebrate his birth
With great pomp and fanfare
Disregarding mother earth
While she cries, bleeds, despairs!

Thousands of believers flock to the streets
Hundreds of idols they carry to the seas
Drown their God, satisfy their belief
Destroying Mother Nature

Thousands of heads adorn the beach
For days after and after
Dead flowers and empty prayers
Mother did weep, she did despair

The deafening sound of a thousand drums
Heard in the distance the low rumbling hum
Blocking the road, the infinite hordes
Dancing they take to the streets

The colours, they stain the streets
Marching forward millions of feet
The mass of humanity moves to the sea
For the drowning of the Elephant God.

The pretext of religion
A bottle of booze
Gang raped in the corner
The screams are mute
Is a God really watching?
