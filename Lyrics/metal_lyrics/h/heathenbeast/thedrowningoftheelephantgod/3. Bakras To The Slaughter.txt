Eat not the swine they do believe
For it is Haraam and he commanded it
Bleed the rest to death by their neck
Justify the killing, justify Halal.

The cost of the sacrifice remains the same
The veil of ignorance that covers your eyes

Sacrifice the son to a fictitious lord
I promise you no lamb shall be slaughtered
The Lord is but a wolf in sheep's clothing
And you are nothing but the sacrificial lamb

Benevolent, kind and all power a God we did devise
What kind of cruel, sadist being demands a sacrifice
What kind of black hearted God, takes a human life
The sheep is just deceit, a story, a lie

A thousand lambs to the slaughter
And a thousand more to go
The blood has soaked the ground
Because your God told you so.

The age old chapters of deceit, your God is a lie
Lift the veil of hypocrisy and open your eyes

Silence breaks the dawn
The bleating of the bakra
Sharpening the blade
All in the name of Allah

The innocence in their eyes
Tied down for the sacrifice
Swing the blade from up high
Spill the blood for a lie.
