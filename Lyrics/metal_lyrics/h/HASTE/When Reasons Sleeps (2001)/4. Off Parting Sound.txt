Farther off the course, 
it seems we are drifting 
grab at anything just 
to call ourselves back home
This sea is furious

She has lost patience and thus
we will sip now from our early graves 
We built the craft and chose 
the course farthest from suffering 

Sleep now with proud hearts 
and with dreams to wake
should we weather this day

Shall we brave against 
the unknown obstacles set on our way
or give her up to where the winds may lead? 
It seems the easy way 

Moments from sinking
monument gray faces 
are the weary from the strain
our wills give way to hunger
is the sacrifice too great? 

As men do tired minds wander
Can our course now be changed? 
My captain, we are taking on water

This ship has run aground 
We have risked this shallow channel...
drowning off parting sound  

The breath of Christ in me
with every toss of the waves
I've found that there is so much more to this 
Comfort still gets in the way 
Somehow, at the end of this
with every wind at my sail I'll touch ground
When my comes in..

"If only tired bones were made of wood" 
we could say
"we could give up this endless task" 

Despite the rising tide 
the weather-worn ship 
remains steady and upright

Set out in search of greater things 
and we nearly lost our way

The breath of Christ in me 
with every toss of the waves
I've found that there is so much more to this
Comfort still gets in the way
Somehow, at the end of this
with every wind at my sail I'll touch ground
When my comes in...
