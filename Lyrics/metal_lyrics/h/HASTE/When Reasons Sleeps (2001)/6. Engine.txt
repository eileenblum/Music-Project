Still sufficient in depending on you 
depending on each other.
Engine noise whispering 
through half asleep startled by 
startled by headlights and loose 
startled by loss pavement

As Illinois goes rushing by 
I'm too tired to even try
Where will the sun come up
where will the sun come up for us today? 
Turning bad days into better nights 
Waving smoke out the window
catch my hand against the background of night 
Dragging fingertips through constellations 
When we make the last turn 
when we make the last turn for home 
we know half the battle is through

Still sufficient in depending on you 
depending on each other
Engine noise whispering through
