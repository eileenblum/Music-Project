Bite my lip for asking the question
"Which one of you will take up our cause?" 
Selfishness bonds us like blood
Now suffer through arrows and slings. 
My success is measured 
by how much you and yours will gain
My pleasure, your pleasure 
Rewards seem that they are yours to take

Can't you see this part of me 
is something that I share with you 
but this greed for what I love... 
This is nothing if it's not for you 

Promise me, don't fail me
When hands are tied and my eyes are closed 
your faith is my resource
Does being brainwashed make it true? 
What changes have you made 
to show me that you know how I feel? 
I'm not asking for thank you's 
just asking for civility

Can't you see this part of me 
is something that I share with you
but this greed for what I love... 
This is nothing if it's not for you

Don't fail me when hands are tied and eyes are closed
Your faith can steady my stride when weak legs fail
You say this all comes in time but this time is wrong
If all of this is nothing then I'm content with
nothing
