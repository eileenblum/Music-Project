Remember our worlds much younger 
focused on the goal and not the risks 
More years go by and the less we notice 
living in fear of any consequence
What is compromised? 
Settling for security
"It could be worse" as life's philosophy means 
that nothing will be any better 
Trading ambition and our own confidence 

I will not be measured by days
Bound for nothing
I will decide my own fate
Our expectations match the sky
but our reservations block the light 
Here it comes again

First to the punch 
they will decide limitations by which to abide
Define achievements by whose standards 
No fear of living beyond the lines
A revolution against apathy
I will decide what progress means to me 
These rules that bind me 
I will change...ignite this spark into a flame 

I will not be measured by days
Bound for nothing 
I will decide my own fate 
Our expectations match the sky
but our reservations block the light 
These days excitement comes in turns
when apprehension lets me slide 
Here it comes again....
