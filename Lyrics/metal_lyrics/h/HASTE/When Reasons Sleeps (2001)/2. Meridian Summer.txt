Saved by reputation of a boyhood 
spent with something missing inside
Deny this as a reason, 
a liberation and the ill effects 

Write it down in a book of lost hopes
but on this page is me
running through setting fire to everything 

Passed on a set of values 
bastardized by anger 
repressed and pushed aside
Pushed aside a generation
This demon seed has become a family trait

Write it down in a book of lost hopes
but on this page is me
running through setting fire to everything

It has been said before
face the cold that times your pulse 
North, directionally outright
straightforward
Restitution passing through once more
Hope your new life is what you wished for

Victimized with restraint
passive is bitter to the taste 

It has been said before
face the cold that times your pulse
North, directionally outright
straightforward
Restitution passing through once more 
Hope your new life is what you wished for
