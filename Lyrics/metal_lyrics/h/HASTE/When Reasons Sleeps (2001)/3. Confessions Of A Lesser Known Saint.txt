Down the path of resistance 
I find myself stumbling 
Through my wants and my failures 
Weaker than the thrill
Temptations attack our loyalty 
Both the idea and institution 
An equation of emotion 
Too thick for calculation 
But in the solution 1 and 1 are 3 

So when you see me pass me by 
(crossed my fingers 
wish that you won't notice)
Even red letter days still end with night 
In sleep we remain hopeful

Pay back to February 
And heavy eyelids see plots unfold 
To movie endings 
Searching a bed room ceiling
Finding subtleties, finding flaws 
But never answers 
For what you did or what you do 
I know the past still stings 
But deafened ears waste apologies 

So when you see me pass me by 
(crossed my fingers 
wish that you won't notice) 
Even red letter days still end 
With night and dreams 
To wake and find another 
So go to sleep 
Turn off your ringer 
(just close your eyes) 
Afraid of what is left to find out
Until the daylight drips 
In our eyes in sleep 
we'll remain hopeful

There is nothing left to say!!!
