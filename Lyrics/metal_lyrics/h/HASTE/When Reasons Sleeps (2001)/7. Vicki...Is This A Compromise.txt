It begins with a process of denying anything 
that happens to you is your fault
Place blame, blame on anyone but you 
Turn a blind eye as if consequence 
somehow escapes you 

Let your guard down for just one time in your life 
would you let sincerity move you? 
How does it feel trying not to drown 
swimming a sea of regret 
with your past bearing down upon you? 

Selfish in nature, given into impulse
I've lost so much from hurting others for my gain 
No way to justify, no more excuse 
Begging forgiveness is a custom 
I've embraced for too long

Let your guard down for just one time in your life 
would you let sincerity move you? 
How does it feel trying not to drown 
swimming a sea of regret 
with your past bearing down upon you? 

Begging forgiveness from lips 
that hold hatred for me
Slip a small blade between tissue and frame 
Keep this as my first souvenir of your trust 
Shameless damage of the skin and bone
No recourse
Wounds of character are what is killing me

Let your guard down for just one time in your life 
would you let sincerity move you? 
How does it feel trying not to drown 
swimming a sea of regret 
with your past bearing down upon you?
