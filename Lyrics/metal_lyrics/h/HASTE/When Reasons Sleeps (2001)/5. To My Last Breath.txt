Summer with the lights out finds me 
in my parent's basement
watching bedroom movies
Pictures and holidays hang in the hall 
Guided by memory

Where we stand is where we'll jump from 
It doesn't seem so far from finding common surface 
and to still retreating hearts

Once choice turns two aside
A direction thought in common
A passing glance serving as a makeshift alter 
Whispering, we confess

Where we stand is where we'll jump from 
It doesn't seem so far from finding common surface 
and to still retreating hearts 
From the playground to my last breath 
doesn't seem so far from finding common surface 
and to still retreating hearts

Keep hoping for movie miracles 
The windows are frames 
and the scenes can change 
I would have had to kiss you 
at the drive-thru window 
if they had their way

Where we stand is where we'll jump from 
It doesn't seem so far from finding common surface 
and to still retreating hearts 
From the playground to my last breath 
doesn't seem so far from finding common surface 
and to still retreating hearts
