marks that they have set before me
stones lain to show the paths for me to take 
they have no foundation to hold me 
hold me under falling 
I slip through these cracks 
forget me, dance on me 
bruises turn to wounds
I tried, never good enough 
with my eyes wide open
to follow you down 
follow you inside 
watching you 
watching you drag me down 
hold me under my failure
I drown, who are you to tell me that im less? 
I drown, open my eyes to see
I see you are scared 
I'll make it on my own it brings you down 
that I find life everyone suffers for you 
you look inside 
inside you are drowing yourself. 
inside the fear
burns feeling is lost grab 
anything as the light fades away 
hold me under my failure I drown 
allow me to hold on or to reach 
I've reached myself you kick 
I bleed, you kick, I bleed for you
