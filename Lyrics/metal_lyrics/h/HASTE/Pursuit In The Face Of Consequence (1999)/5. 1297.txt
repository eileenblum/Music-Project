how can I begin? 
to tell you how I see this 
just a name, a list
that has a greater meaning and it cries out 
from a heart thats still beating 
I can't change that now 
God's hand, stealing 
it cries out 
a heart not beating its done
with now
and all for what reasons 
I cannot imagine how 
it must have hit you 
can you hear my voice 
or what im saying to you? 
now your hands feel so cold 
do you even know 
how close you are to leaving? 
I stand with this knot in throat 
and you lay barely breathing 
now your hands feel so cold 
and it cries out....still crying out
