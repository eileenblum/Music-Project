sells me a way to give away 
a way to be improved
I need more for my own thoughts
tear apart, the outside cultures in me 
its what I need 
ideas sucked away from me 
its killing you
it what you need 
see me, I need more of your empty lies 
don't try to sell me? 
I don't need this
don't try to sell me? 
I won't be bought...
for less than nothing

twist perceptions for your use
your words hide intent with lies 
I fall, fall back to the outside 
my eyes see through these lies 
don't try to sell me, reaching in...
I try to retain myself
feel myself losing, losing 

don't tell me how 
selling my thoughts 
slaves for your use 
feelings become the fuel to burn
