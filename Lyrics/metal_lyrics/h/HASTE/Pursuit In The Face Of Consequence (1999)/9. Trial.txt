eyes strain, my eyes 
life spent, lost
you set yourself above 
holding all in with fear
in time you'll see what you set above 
on your tower on high 
always standing,  
laughing, pointing fingers at me
I cant feel I can't hold 
I am not alive 

I'm trying, trying 
and I see its all the same 
I look into you
nothing holds this fear
fear grips tight, tight in my mind 
standards set by those
I don't know...still respect is due

I cant live by your selfish set of rules 
I crawl to reach, to reach into 
these words I've said 

these words I've said leaves life so cold 
so incomplete, so void leave life so cold
