its the same story
the unhappy ending
I play the loser 
that seems to be winning 
I seem to be winning in your eyes

by my action I expose myself 
I open to weakness
I fall to my own choices 
feelings so far gone so...

here I am
opened for you to see
what you know

I'll determine I have tied my own hands 
hands that hold these walls around 

I've risked everything 
now I feel myself breaking 
you think I never needed 
to hold anyone else? 
I'm scared of losing more
you think you know me? 
you think that I don't feel? 
you think you what you mean to me? 
you think I don't hope
