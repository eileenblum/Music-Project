And its felt like lead 
To think to let anything else in 
It is too heavy to stand 
I won't push out 

Please God this tears me apart
On the inside
You quit and you suck 
And you are still the same
...As far as I can see 

I wish to breathe 
I can't take this change 
I would rather stay here 
With my hands gripping my throat 

What now? 
You find yourself on the outside? 
What about them? 
What about her? 
What about all of your responsibility? 

I find this in blood 
For some...easy to walk away 
I find that I can never break 

God! This hurts 
It tears me apart on the inside 
I've quit, we are done
It seems that now youre the absentee 

I still feel so much for you
