I, I just..this will be the last time 
if you leave I just want to fall...
this will be the last time
if you leave, I want to close my eyes 
and imagine what is going on around me 
as I fall through the sky...

this will come back to me a thousand times 
the sound of the wind would cripple 
the hearing of any other noise 
violently I would reach the thick, gray clouds 
and take a deep breath
if you leave I, ive washed away sins 
from my mind 

time, this all will be just wasted time 
the cool air would fill my lungs 
you says its hardly bleeding 
I would feel the water droplets 
form on my face 
as I raced downward toward earth 
but you can't see as closely as I can 
feel faster and faster
we have all bled before 
I would plummet toward the ground 
we all know 
it heals and goes away 
it would be so cold 
you can't understand why 
I want it to stay chill 
bumps would cover my ice cold body 
thoughts of how great things change 
are at the moment
and if your promise not to try 
would dominate my mind thoughts 
of the future gone forever...

I promise worries of what has happened 
will be left in the clouds 
the clouds would rain those worries 
somewhere else 
this time strange though 
I think I hear traffic 
I won't hurt you
