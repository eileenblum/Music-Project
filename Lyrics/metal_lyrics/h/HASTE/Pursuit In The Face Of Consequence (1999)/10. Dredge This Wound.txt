I've been down, helpless, still 
I come here once again 
feelings lost
extinction of what used to be 
dwelling keeps me 
from standing on my own 

selfless dissection of emotion
emotion I have left inside 
dredge this wound 
salt of tears, then I fade away 
slips away and fades 

raising eyes to see you
anger is all I feel, 
missed your forgiveness 
just a witness of my own demise 
searching these pieces
they cut me, you laugh as I bleed 
swallow contradiction
just a victim of all I have inside 

this pain just deepens 
I can never let go
feel it numbing me 
exist around you 
everything I know
I've held myself down to
held myself down 
so that I will never fall
all of this I feel I pour out for you 
salvation, in the release of all that I feel
