Paint this picture
Color it with casualties of hope and sorrow 
Frame it with apathy
I find it hanging on a wall 
that you disguise as faith and trusting 
Intent is realized morning moves my head 
My hands reach to feel your face 
My hands fall empty 
These memories can't fill their grasps 

I begin to focus on 
What I always thought i knew 
Vomit my feelings 
and spit them back at you 
Indifference fails me 
From the smile behind your eyes 
In effect a failure
It seems just my size 

fill me inside
how I need this 
feel the inside
I can't take this 
I open my arms just to miss you 
only you can fill this hole 

so full...sick of life 
I feel so old I can't change this now 
please show me how
