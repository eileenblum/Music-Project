watching my friends make 
(2) all the things I've done 
(3) you make the same...mistakes...
(1) how they make things change 
(2) thought I wouldnt make 
(3) that you watched me make regret...
(1) I hope I won't feel
(2) can't remove this pain
(3) the same things I do

learning...(1) from their mistakes 
(2) things the hardest way
(3) things taught too late

wisdom...(1) I learn from watching 
(2) that I've gained too late
(3) gained from someone else

feeling...(1) for the strength to make 
(2) smarter by the day
(3) that I recognize

decisions...(1) that would seem smarter 
(2) that I failed to make
(3) that I once had faced

integrity...(1) is what I strive for 
(2) that I can't obtain

...if you could see how
though time I've wasted on
I'll give you everything in time 
I will, hold myself down
I will ive wasted on a chance for you to prove

watching...mistakes...regret...learning...
wisdom...feeling...decisions...integrity... 

everytime I feel I'm bigger 
realize I am the same
and you're knowing what im feeling
but I think I should escape myself 
and watch it all slip by 
and you're knowing what I'm feeling
situations I fall short in 
where I thought that i would gain 
and you're knowing what I'm feeling
but I think you should escape yourself 
and watch it all slip by

watching...mistakes...regret...learning...
wisdom...feeling...decisions...integrity...

...if you could see how
though time I've wasted on
I'll give you everything in time 
I will, hold myself down, I will 
I've wasted on a chance for you to prove
