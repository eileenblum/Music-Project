Dissamble me, examine every piece and then tear it apart again.  My progress doesn't meet your standards, crucified a martyr. You talk so much I can't understand how those shots from your mouth can even sound fair.  It happens time and time again is this all you do?  So we listen to you, "It's softer, they've sold out."  The judge's wait... here's to you.  "It's over, they're played out."  Do we listen to you because you're asking the question?  You talk so much I can't understand how these shots from your mouth can even sound fair.  It happens time and time again is this all you do?
