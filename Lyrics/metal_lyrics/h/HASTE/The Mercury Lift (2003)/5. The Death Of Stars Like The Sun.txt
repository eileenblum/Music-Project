The chain of events, leading up to this, has come from some unseen direction.  When all that you have is what you shared, then at once you find it is gone.  Go back and forth between two lines and don't leave a square inch of soil unturned.  Laws of motion will kick in and my heart will leave my throat.  Turn backwards, but it feels just like progress as I bear my namesake to the ground once agian.  Forced to live with this.  Split seconds are still moments.  A daily poison that you survive on.  The warm breath of life escapes us all in time but there is "always" and "still holding on."  Go back and forth between two lines and don't leave a square inch of soil unturned.  Laws of motion will kick in and my heart will leave my throat.  Turn backwards, but it feels just like progress as I bear my namesake to the ground.  Each story has two sides, here is how the victim's ends.  Your parting, not how you had planned.  A legacy handed down and a lifetime brought to an end.  Every split  second is still a moment. Our last meeting playing out...the end. Time heals all wounds except this one.
