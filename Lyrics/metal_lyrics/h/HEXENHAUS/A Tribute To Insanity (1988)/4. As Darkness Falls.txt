[solo - Meister]

Dark well of fate, concealed
Unknown force, within
Peace of mind is gone, it's lost
Master of lies, you heed

The thrills that you sought, they might just be real
Emotions growing numb, dying from the inside

Chosen one, chill of death, masterplan, chosen fate

As darkness falls, a war within
As darkness falls, all turns to black

[acoustic - Wead / solo - Meister]
[solo Wead / Meister]

Master of a darker light
Presides on your throne
Visions from a hidden space
A region of your mind
The threshold of reality
A frontier not precise
Dim your lights one by one
Hypnosis has arrived

I called a demon from the darkest depths of hell
An evil spirit that should never been set free
A beast from hell inside of my mind
There's no light on my sky how could I go so far

Dawn of life is dark and dead
Cold and strange I'm possessed by hate
Rise
As darkness falls

I wrote a circle of pacts
Although I knew they should never return back

All turns to black am I going insane
Prince of darkness rises before my eyes
Dawn of life is dark and dead
Cold and strange I'm possessed by hate
Rise
As darkness falls
