[solo - Wead / Meister]

Praise this sacred night
Witness our ordeal
God of magic force
Feel his presence here
Legions, the inner sect
Gather on holy ground chanting secret rhymes
Death is why we live

When darkness arrives, the end is here
Descend into chaos, demise of the gods
Summon the faithful, sharpen the sword
Up from the ashes, a new world will rise

Death walks among us
Death walks among us

Fate has been foretold
A vision very clear
Deceit the reason why
Giants sleep no more
Awaken for this fight
A serpent malicious beast
The hour is near
Time for judgement day

The king of the kings, lord of the wise
We stand by your side, the strong and the brave
The purpose of death, revealed this day
Let the killing begin, though the outcome is clear

Death walks among us
Death walks among us

Nine are those who must die, a sacrifice
Twelve are those who avenge them, of their blood

Your sacral rage thrives among us, feed our hate
From the sky came the raven, a holy sign

Valkyries march to battle, goddess of war
Creatures of the underworld, rule here

A heroes end is our blessing, our destiny
As wolves tear your mortal body, your soul are free
