[solo - Meister]

Seeds of hate, a mind deranged, blind obedience
You must follow
Cult of death, join the damned, believe and kill
Here's the orders

Epitome of insanity, the captor of a hellish fate
Sick, depraved but you will burn, punishment from
A world below

[solo - Wead]

The dead are restless, the dead are restless

[solo - Meister]

Meet the dead, their revenge, deadly worship,
Prime evil
Your master heard, a voice inside, followed blind
Twisted crimes

Manson's children born to die, the stillborn child
Waits to seal your fate
Sinister children of a man insane, you took your
Lives but more is yet to come

[solo - Wead]

The dead are restless, the dead are restless

[solo - Meister]
