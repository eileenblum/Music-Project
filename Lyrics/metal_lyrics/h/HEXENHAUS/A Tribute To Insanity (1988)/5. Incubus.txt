Father forgive me for I have sinned
Evil called my name
An ancient demon invoked in me and
Evil called my name
Cast from heaven the angel of light
A legend yet alive
Scorn and malice was born in me
How pale was not life

I fell from grace war in my mind
No love no light just pain and hate

Incubus, Incubus

[solo - Meister]

Demonic possession drained of life
Empty staring eyes
A promise of fortune eternal youth
A spiderâs web of lies
A deadly bargain what did I get
Cold caress of death
I cry for mercy who owns my soul
But silent is my call

[solo - Wead]

I fell from grace war in my mind
No love no light just pain and hate

Incubus, Incubus
