[solo - Wead]

Oppressed the earth is chained
Politics and lies
The plague

Cold corruption

Money is power it kills
Faceless the masses are blind

Where's your justice?

Do you ever think for yourself
Believing all you see
Are you real?

Brain death

TV eats your mind to the core
Why can't you be who you are?

Brain death

Eaten alive, eaten alive

[solo - Meister]

Never will I be like you
Freedom is my way my god

Success is all you crave
A freak is what you are

Take my vengeance

Eaten alive like a pig
Conform to the norm of decay

Brainwashed

Greed is your game, there's no shame
Hunger in your wake but you don't care

Eaten alive, eaten alive

[solo - Wead]
