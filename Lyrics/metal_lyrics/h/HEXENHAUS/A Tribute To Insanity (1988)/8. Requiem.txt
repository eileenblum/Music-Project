A day will come, when all is lost
You join the dead in a realm beyond
Charon waits, to take you across
The river is deep to the kingdom of Hades

Join those who burn below
The sinful souls tortured in the fire
There's no repent it's the sinister truth
Pay in death for sins in life

Requiem, Requiem

[solo - Wead / Meister]

There's no escape a hellish fate
Walk the road of desecration
A massive void you're all alone
Still you cry for salvation

Forever damned eternal sleep
A bed of thorns unholy tomb
You praised the beast now pay the price
Cast in flames a deadly ban

Requiem, requiem

[solo - Wead]

A day will come, when all is lost
You join the dead in a realm beyond
Charon waits, to take you across
The river is deep to the kingdom of Hades

Requiem, requiem

[solo - Meister]
