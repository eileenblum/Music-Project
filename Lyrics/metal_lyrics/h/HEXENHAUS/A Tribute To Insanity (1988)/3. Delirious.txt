Trembling apart in a state of terror
Sour taste of the grapes of madness
Signed the deal, death in the bottle
Ten miles high I saw the snowman

A humble servant to my chemical master
Seeking salvation with a needle and spoon
Threading the path of self-destruction
Unwield the gates to my private hell

[solo - Meister]

I'm delirious

Unseen vision of a living dead
Insomniac with a bloodshot eye
Captured in addiction, brings crucifixion

My eyes see where yours are blind
Demented reflexions of my inner soul
Icy fingers crawls inside
Screaming for mercy, they have returned

[solo - Wead]

I'm delirious

[solo - Wead]
