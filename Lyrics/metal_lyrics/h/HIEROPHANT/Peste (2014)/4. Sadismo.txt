Feeding the death
Feeding the blood
Feeding the sickness
I feel my own ego

I canât live without blood
Knives in my hands
I write your epilogue

I am reality
My shadow swallows everything it feels
I am reality
I will be the demiurge
And you will be my victim
You maggot

My cage will be destroyed
But the beast will be eternal

I am reality
My shadow swallows everything it feels
I am reality

Erection
Death smell

Erection
Death smell

There is no forgiveness of sins without shredding blood
Forget the passion
Forget the passion
Forget the passion
Itâs the only way to survive.
