No compromise
No compromise

Itâs time to choose the victim to be sacrificed
It will die for my church
I will have its soul and playing with its arts
It should not enjoy
Its veins will be my wires

No compromise
No

The scapegoat to get rid of the quicksand of failure
I will turn into executioner

This is our iron maiden but I will throw my replacement

No compromise
No compromise.
