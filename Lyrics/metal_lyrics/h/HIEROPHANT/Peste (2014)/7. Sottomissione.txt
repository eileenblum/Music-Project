No eye for an eye
Chickpeas under my knees
Lay me a crown of thorns
Your cross on my back
Your cross on my back

Pleasure
Pleasure
Suffering
Suffering

Waiting the disaster
You will smile

Tomorrow Iâll be like you
Tomorrow Iâll be like you

I wonât pass the borders of your land anymore

Every gesture of yours will be mine
Every gesture of mine will be yours
Will be yours

Iâm the dog of the owner with the whip
