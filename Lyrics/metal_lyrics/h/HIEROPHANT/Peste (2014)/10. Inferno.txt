This is your own hell
This is your own inferno
This is your own retribution
This is your own castigation

We are nobody in an unknownâs society
We are, we are nobody
We are nobody in an unknownâs society
We are nobody

This is your own hell
This is your own inferno
This is your own retribution
This is your own castigation

We are nobody in an unknownâs society
We are, we are nobody

Who ever heard about a painless inferno
Who ever heard about a painless hell

Weâre like butterflies hitting the glass.
