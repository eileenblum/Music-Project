Itâs Monday morning and Iâm suffering

I do not blame the deafs
They live an isolation deeper than mine

The hour of the wolf is closer
I will be devoured

Darkest night
Longest night
More real nightmares
More violent nightmares

Chained to the void that surrounds me
Chained to the bottomless pit

Freedom is drug for those who are humiliated
Freedom is venom.

Darkest night
Longest night
More real nightmares
More violent nightmares
