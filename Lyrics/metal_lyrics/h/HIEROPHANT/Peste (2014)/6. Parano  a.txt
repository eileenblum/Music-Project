My skin is sick
My mind is deviated
My end is closer
Love wonât save me

There is no cure
There is no disintoxication
Iâll drown into insecurities of my I

Paranoia

Every time I will think I will be breathing
An anvil of loneliness will drag me even deeper

I feel rotten inside me
I feel rotten inside me

By my actions thousand would die
By my actions thousand would die

I donât deserve to stay here
