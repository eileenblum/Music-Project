I donât feel anything
I do not want to walk alone
Itâs too tiring

Hit me
Kill me
Love me
No emotions

Hit me
Kill me
Love me

I donât want to lay down
Should I stay in that position
And I do not want to

Should I get up again
And I do not want to
I do not feel anything
I do not feel anything

No emotions
No emotions
No emotions
No emotions
