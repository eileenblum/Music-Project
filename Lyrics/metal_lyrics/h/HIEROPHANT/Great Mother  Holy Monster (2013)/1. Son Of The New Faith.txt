Is this the reflection of myself ?
Suffering from little unsatisfied desires
If your mind makes ugliness of the past
Does she consider me a means to her end ?
Or does she not do that at all ?
I'm losing faith,
Her tentacles drag me down
Into the depths / abyss,
Resigned, I don't do nothing to stop it
The poison of her suckers comfort me,
Nobody can imagine what I can feel
Disappointment, love, fear, catharsis
Loss, indeed everyone who might try it
No one will burn the veil of Maya
Impossible to turn back.
I would rather live a lie.
I have lost faith, I found a new religion
My suffering body will not suffer anymore
My mouth in the mirror says :
Amen,
Amen,
Amen.
