Her body shattered,
Thousands and more gears recompose
Her new flesh.
More and more perfect,
Less and less human scared.
Her black mirror obsessed me,
Her fnord commands me.
Pull the plug, disconnect the connection.
All the emotions are gone,
Only fear remains.
Waitin' detoxication.
I feel like a driver stuck in traffic,
Waiting for the final destination.
Waiting for death I'm totally addicted,
I'd like to defend myself,
For the siege of the machine,
The touch of her cold flesh
Onjects in me hallucinations.
She controls me with her frequencies.
This is a slave-existance.
We are all puppets of the black mirror.
Isn't it horrible ?
