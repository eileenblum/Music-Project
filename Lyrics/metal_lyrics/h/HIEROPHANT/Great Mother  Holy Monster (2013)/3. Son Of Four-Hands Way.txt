Lack of knowledge, sacrifice, passion,
Ordinary days turn into famished hyenas
And I'm their meal.
Do you will surrender to destiny ?
The black one descends from the abyss.
Possessed, entranced, controlled ?
No ! It's her ! A hand covering my face,
A hand holding destruction,
A hand purifies,
A hand prays the transformation.
Nudity removes any illusion.
Yelps come to my ears but other complaints,
Other carcasses. Each new victim,
A new head from her necklace.
She has no intention of ending the carnage
She wants to recreate.
Death becomes for a better dimension.
How to get rid from these cursed hands ?
Her fury silent, it was anything.
All that remains is despair.
