My mind full of selfishness,
If I cut my body I'd not feel anything.
Falling into his body and dressing up of his skin.
A slimy insect into a decadent pantry,
Looking for expired food and a warm place.
Dark this is not real,
Dark I am not fucking real.

Hear me mother,
Hear me fetus' owner,
Hear me mother,
Hear me holy monster.

I need a new mind.
I need to purify it.
I need to not think.
I don't need to be afraid.
Prisoner of my larynx,
Prisoner of my gestures,
Prisoner of my symbols.
Now god is mine.
Save your soul.

Amputate, annihilate.
No tongue. No hands,
No thoughts, no god.
No goddess.
