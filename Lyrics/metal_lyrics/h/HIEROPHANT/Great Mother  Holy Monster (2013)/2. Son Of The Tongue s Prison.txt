"Il faut tuer les passions"
please take me with you in your lap
I need to lost sight,
I'm not a saint but I need to castrate myself
Eyes create illusions, genitals create false idols.
Knives in the hands, no stitches, no tears-eating face.
You've got to kill passions.
Sorrow and joy.
Blood and milk.
Tired of chasing your shadows,
Please admit me into your womb again,
Pulled in front of our audience
"Bisogna Uccidere Le Passioni"
Curtain's closing, lights off
Applause.
