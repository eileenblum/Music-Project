She will come out like a cancer.
Sitting in the tub, drunk
Bathed into puke 'n' cock hairs.
Eating rotten meat, imagining it was your mother.
I wanna raise you inside my stomach.
As I've done.
I'll be your womb/ utero.
We'll be a single thing again,
Whore I'll be your owner, your possessor,
Now the cancer, you'll feed yourself by my acid
My waste and you will grow.
Finally you will reborn.
This is new flesh,
Sinking into a black hole of loneliness / desperation.
This is true love.
