She doesn't love me.
She possess me like a ring of fire,
Satisfy her possess desire.
She knows me.
Chained in her dark prison,
The key is hidden in her breast,
Impossible to move,
To get rid of,
Scared by the despot,
By the monarch.
I feel like a completed draw of a blind painter.
Same instinct, different name.
Being sons of avidity,
Sons of egoistic love,
The queen doesn't love her crowd,
But herself.
She demands the perfect crowd.
But a snake will swim in her tank,
Sooner or later, lover for my savior,
Devourer will go on, and on, and on,
No regrets.
