Accept your fate

This is a story about the lie
We're set to live in
Every day was the same
Ropes and chains held the shame
There's only vengeance
In my thoughts
No regrets no sorrow
I am the bringer of rain
The bringer of rain

We are the forsaken
We all stand as one

There's only vengeance
In my thoughts

All this pain
Gave me a reason to live; not fear
You're all gonna die
All this hate
Gave me a reason to live; not fear
You're all gonna die

[Chorus 2x:]
Give me the strength
To believe this is not over
It's written in the stars
Death comes to us all
It's just a matter of time
(It's just a matter of time)

Pride? I feel it
Fight if you believe
What you see is what you get
What you get is what you fucking see
My empty hand
Can still become a fist
No regrets, no sorrow
I am the bringer of rain
Step out of the shadow
Cause blood demands blood

[2x:]
Even the most damaged hearts
Can be saved
Even the saddest stories
Come to an end

[4x:]
We can't be saved
(Come to an end)

[Chorus:]
Give me the strength
To believe this is not over
It's written in the stars
Death comes to us all
It's just a matter of time
(It's just a matter of time)

All this pain
Gave me a reason to live
All this pain
Gave me a reason to live
All this pain
Gave me a reason to live
What you see is what you get
What you get is what you fucking see

Step out of the shadow
Blood demands blood
Blood demands blood
Blood demands blood
Blood demands blood
