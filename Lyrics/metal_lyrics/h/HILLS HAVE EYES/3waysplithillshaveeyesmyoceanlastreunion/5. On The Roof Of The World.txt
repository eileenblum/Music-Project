starts today a brand new sight,
in which the world always decides
filled with my dreams and my expectations
maybe tomorrow we can be more like you, as you say

with my eyes wide open I see you all from above

embrace yourself in your excuses
and inflict yourself some pain for all
those times that you took our words to death
maybe tomorrow we can be less like you, as I say

you took our words to death

dead, you feel so fucking dead to me
