[feat. Ricardo of For The Glory]You think you're all so cool - come on I'll show you the way out!
You're better than the rest - come on I'll show you the way out!
It seems to me you motherfuckers don't know how to act
I read in your eyes: "we drove all night just to see you fail"

Fifty miles of empty road - come on I'll show you the way out
Do your thing and feed your curse - come on I'll show you the way out
It seems to me you motherfuckers don't know how to react
I read in your eyes: "we drove all night just to see you fail"

It seems to me you motherfuckers don't know how to act
You drove all night just to see us fail
Seems to me that you can't see a bunch of good friends having a good time
That's the way we do it man

Just realize there's no one behind
You better run with your fingers crossed if you wanna live, come on
Just realize there's no one behind 'cause that's where your friends are
You think you got it all, you think you got it all
Run with your fingers crossed if you wanna live, come on
You think you got it all, you think you got it all

FRIENDSHIP THAT'S WHAT WE STAND FOR
