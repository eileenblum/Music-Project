I made a promise
I'll hold it until my last breath
So easy to begin
Elementary to cease
Think fast you're wasting time
This road ain't painless at all

What does your mind tell you?
What words does your heart scream?
If you feel this is right
Hold it until your last breath

Let's play this song for the broken
These words will make us take heart
Anyone can give up
It's the easiest thing to do
It's the easiest thing to do

This will feel real until the last night

[Chorus:]
Don't ask me what it takes
Don't ask me how it feels
I'm pretty sure you can make it
(Don't ask me what it takes)
Not all that shines is golden
Trying doesn't mean failing
You were born to live

I made a promise
To be true with what I feel
(With what I feel)
It's been a while since the last time
That I didn't feel this was real

Kind words mean the world
Poisoned words just pass by
Sorry fellow, sometime I will go down
But this is not the day
This is not the day

Can you hear the silence?
Can you hear the still?
Can you hear the quietness?
So beautiful at the start

It's been a while since the last time
That I didn't feel this was real
What does your mind tell you?
What words does your heart scream?

[Chorus:]
Don't ask me what it takes
Don't ask me how it feels
I'm pretty sure you can make it
(Don't ask me what it takes)
Not all that shines is golden
Trying doesn't mean failing
You were born to live

Let's play this song for the broken
These words will make us take heart

Let's play this song for the broken
These words will make us take heart

[Chorus:]
Don't ask me what it takes
Don't ask me how it feels
I'm pretty sure you can make it
(Don't ask me what it takes)
Not all that shines is golden
Trying doesn't mean failing
You were born to live
