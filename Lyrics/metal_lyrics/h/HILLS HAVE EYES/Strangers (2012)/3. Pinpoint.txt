If you're playing with fire you will get burned

So sick of liars
Sick of thieves
They all say we should get on our knees
All I breathe is hate
All I smell is fear

Dream as you'll live forever
Live as you'll die today

It takes a second of your time
(A second of your time)
It takes a moment of your life
So please don't turn away
It's the perfect scene
The perfect play

It takes a second of your time
(A second of your time)
It takes a moment of your life
So please don't turn away
It's the perfect scene
The perfect play

Let's have it all
Glitter and greed
All I need is the air that I breathe
You say that hate
Has no place in here
Let them hate so long as they fear

The world is screaming
All I breathe is hate
All I smell is fear

Dream as you'll live forever
Live as you'll die today

It takes a second of your time
(A second of your time)
It takes a moment of your life
So please don't turn away
It's the perfect scene
The perfect play

It takes a second of your time
(A second of your time)
It takes a moment of your life
So please don't turn away
It's the perfect scene
The perfect play

We are what we think
A change of thoughts can change the world

It takes a second of your time
(A second of your time)
It takes a moment of your life
So please don't turn away
It's the perfect scene
The perfect play

It takes a second of your time
(A second of your time)
It takes a moment of your life
So please don't turn away
It's the perfect scene
The perfect play

Let's have it all
Glitter and greed
All I need is the air that I breathe
You say that hate
Has no place in here
Let them hate so long as they fear

If you're playing with fire
You will get burned
If you're playing with fire
You will get burned
