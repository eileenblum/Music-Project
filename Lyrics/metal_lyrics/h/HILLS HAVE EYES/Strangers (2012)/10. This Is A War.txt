Let go like you did before
Living the lie you insist to believe
Twisted thoughts and broken memories
Your reality doesn't exist

This war is far from over
One more battle with your favorite enemy
Run for cover
Shoot from distance
The only way you can face me

You know I wouldn't stand a chance
You know I wouldn't make a sound
I never wanted to be like this
Take it or just go away

[Chorus:]
You fooled me once
You fooled me twice
I stood by you and you brought me nothing
I gave you life
I gave you my heart
All that you did was tear it apart

[?]
I speak my heart
The problem is that you
Don't fucking care
You don't fucking care

This war is far from over
Another note of your favorite melody
This isn't contemplative
Why the hell can't you see me?

You know I wouldn't stand a chance
You know I wouldn't make a sound
Out of light like any other star

I hate to say it
But my heart belongs to you

I hate to say it
But my heart belongs to you
Belongs to you

I hate to say it
But my heart belongs to you
Belongs to you

[Chorus:]
You fooled me once
You fooled me twice
I stood by you and you brought me nothing
I gave you life
I gave you my heart
All that you did was tear it apart

All that you did was tear it apart
All that you did was tear it apart
