[feat. Vasco Ramos of More Than a Thousand]I made some mistakes
No scars will tear us apart
Please just believe me
I should have known better
Should have known this right from the start

The truth fucking hurts
Young hearts are easily deceived
But it doesn't matter
Cause even if it hurts
Time will put your mind at ease

Will this ever feel sacred?
I will find you here with me
If it all comes crashing down
I don't mind, I don't mind at all
We've been dancing in the rain
Time has played us once again
All is good when it ends good

I made some mistakes
Didn't care what my heart said
You can't control the things you admire
You just have to stay true to yourself
I have two voices
I have two hearts
Will this feel sacred?
One is for the day
But the other one comes out at night

Will this ever feel sacred?
I will find you here with me
If it all comes crashing down
I don't mind, I don't mind at all
We've been dancing in the rain
Time has played us once again
All is good when it ends good

[Vasco Ramos:]
Give it up for the last time
(Last time)
I've grown old and tired
I just can't take it anymore
I swear to God it was my fucking last try
Oh
I won't be sleeping anymore
I should have known that the truth hurts
All together for the last time
In this together until we all die
Every motherfucking liar in the house scream
In this together until the day we die

[Solo]

Scars won't keep you apart
From the ones you love

[Solo continues]

Scars won't keep you apart
From the ones you love

Will this ever feel sacred?
I will find you here with me
If it all comes crashing down
I don't mind, I don't mind at all
We've been dancing in the rain
Time has played us once again
All is good when it ends good
