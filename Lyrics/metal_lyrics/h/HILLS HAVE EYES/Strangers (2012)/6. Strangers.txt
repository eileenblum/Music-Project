etÂ´s start a fire, put this city to flames
come on baby i know more than you think
so whatÂ´s the difference between you and me?
the difference is that i stand up for my beliefs

a liar, a victim, iÂ´m empty - a fake
come on baby i know iÂ´m everything that you hate
fuck it - who gives a damn anyway?
your empty eyes unveil the shape of your face

living in a ghost town (we live in a ghost town)

i just want to stay here in the dark
this way i wonÂ´t look at your face
yeah i heard that you got it all (strangers)
youÂ´re empty just like me
all the promises that you once made
were dead from the start

faces, all of them without expressions
words with no meaning - iÂ´m broken
esteem down the gutter, betrayal is too easy to feel
emptiness fills the wound

stranger, iÂ´ve seen a thousand places - iÂ´ve written on the walls
you should know that in the end scars donÂ´t mean anything
