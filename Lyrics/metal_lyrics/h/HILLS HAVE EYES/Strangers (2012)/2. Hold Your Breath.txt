I'll sink this fucking ship

We ain't stopping now
These chains will bring us close
Walking against the wind
Means that you'll value the simple things
No breaking away

This life I'm living
Is only the beginning of the end
Don't you know
How much can I stand and fight?
It's on my mind
I'll leave no friend behind
I'll leave no friend behind

These chains will bring us close
Until the end
So don't come asking for
Don't come asking for redemption
'Cause you know that will never come
Now point your fingers up to the sky
The sky

Out of sight is out of heart
Memories will stay
In the end of the day we all feel repent
We all feel repent

Do you feel loveless?
This ain't a life for fucking boy scouts
Fucking boy scouts
Forsaken words, forget this place
This ain't a life for fucking boy scouts
Fucking boy scouts

Do you feel loveless?
Yeah, I hope you fucking do

[Solo]

If it don't feel the same
The same
Maybe that's why you never felt it
Never felt it

If it don't feel the same
Maybe that's why you never felt it
Never felt it

These chains will bring us close
Until the end
So don't come asking for
Don't come asking for redemption
'Cause you know that will never come
Now point your fingers up to the sky
