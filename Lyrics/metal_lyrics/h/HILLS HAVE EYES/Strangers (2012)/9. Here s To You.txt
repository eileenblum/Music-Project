Mayday, the days are passing
You should never forget
The love from your friends
Only the real ones
Will tell you if your face is dirty

Look into my eyes
What do you see?
We often take our blessings for granted
Spare nothing, live your time
Because we all fall down

If I step into a fire
I know you would come along
Spare nothing, live your time

[Chorus:]
We made this happen
Please don't let it fall behind
We made this happen
We made it on our own
It's written in our hands
So we won't forget
We made this happen
Please don't let it fall behind

Mayday, the days are counting
We made these promises
I'm glad to have you here with me
Until this story ends

Look into my eyes
What do you see?
We often take our blessings for granted
Spare nothing, live your time
Because we all fall
We all fall
We all fall down
Yeah

We made these promises
You are our calling cards
So here's to you

[Chorus:]
We made this happen
Please don't let it fall behind
We made this happen
We made it on our own
It's written in our hands
So we won't forget
We made this happen
Please don't let it fall behind

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
We made this happen
Please don't let it fall behind
We made this happen
We made it on our own
It's written in our hands
So we won't forget
We made this happen
Please don't let it fall behind
