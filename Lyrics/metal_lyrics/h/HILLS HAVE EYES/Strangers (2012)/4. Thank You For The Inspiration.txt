[feat. Scott Kennedy of Bleed From Within]I am the hand that feeds you
Will put you down
I can, I will, I want
Everything will be according to plan
If it's me running this show

I see the world in black and white
I don't care
I won't give up this fight
I'm better than you
And I'll hate you if you don't agree
Oh

Don't you doubt that you're nothing
If you're alone
I'll tell all your friends
While I'm sitting in my throne

I am the hand that feeds you
Will put you down
I can, I will, I want
Everything will be according to plan
If it's me running this show

I see the world in black and white
Fuck you all
I won't give up this fight

I'm better than you
And I'll hate you if you don't agree
I'm better than you
Can't you see that this means nothing to me?

Yeah, things didn't had to be this way
Blood brothers 'til it all fades away?
You don't need to say nothing at all

How could you walk away from this?
We've spent the last few years
How could you turn your back on us?
We've been living in a dream

You see the world in black and white
You say you won't give up
You see the world in black and white
You say you won't give up
I won't give up this fight
You see the world in black and white
I won't give up this fight

I am the hand that feeds you
Will put you down
I can, I will, I want
Everything will be according to plan
If it's me running this show

I'm better than you
And I'll hate you if you don't agree
I'm better than you
Can't you see that this mean nothing to me?

Yeah, things didn't had to be this way
Blood brothers 'til it all fades away
You don't need to say nothing at all
(Nothing at all)

[Solo]

I am the hand that feeds you
Will put you down
