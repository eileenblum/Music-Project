Side, side, side, side by side
Fill it up
Let's have another one
You see it's early
I just want to have some fun
Life is hard
You play by the rules
I think tonight we can be unreasonable

10 PM where my buddies at?
I think tonight it's gonna be great
Drink it up, play it loud
Thought when sober
Said when drunk
Is this the place
Where we can have some fun?

Hey dude, can you buy me a beer?
I think tonight we can be unreasonable

[Chorus:]
I can read the message in your eyes
Come along have a good time, baby
You know how we're gonna end this night
You know where we're going

[Chorus:]
I can read the message in your eyes
Come along have a good time, baby
You know how we're gonna end this night
We're gonna end this night

3 AM dude, where did I park my car?
Sorry girl, I don't live too far
She doesn't look that good anymore

I don't know where my buddies at
I think tonight I'm gonna be sick

[Chorus:]
I can read the message in your eyes
Come along have a good time, baby
You know how we're gonna end this night
You know where we're going

[Chorus:]
I can read the message in your eyes
Come along have a good time, baby
You know how we're gonna end this night
We're gonna end this night
