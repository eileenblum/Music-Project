Time heals nothing at all
I swear I'm gonna break these fucking walls
Time heals nothing at all
I swear I'm gonna break these fucking walls

This bitter taste I feel
Another panic attack
It feels like all the walls
Are closing on me
Every path that I chose
I ended lost in a trap
That's why now I feel like I'm frozen

Shit, nothing feels real anymore
Every word spoken has no meaning
Wish I could feel just like before
Please take me back to the beginning

Hey man, can you feel this heartburn?
I'm the fucking enemy

Sorrow, it runs in my veins
Life is a valley of mistakes
Things never go as we plan
Why don't you forget it?
You better forget

Sorrow, it runs in my veins
Life is a valley of mistakes
Things never go as we plan
Why don't you forget it?
You better forget

[Chorus:]
Time heals nothing
You know this life can't be perfect
If it's going around
Will keep coming around

[Chorus:]
Time heals nothing
You know this life can't be perfect
If it's going around
Will keep coming around

I'm the fucking enemy

This bitter taste I feel
Another panic attack
It feels like all the walls
Are closing on me
Every path that I chose
I ended lost in a trap
That's why now I feel like I'm frozen

I can't pretend anymore
I ain't got nothing to fall for
I hear regret
It's calling my name
But I'm not coming
No, not today

[Chorus:]
Time heals nothing
You know this life can't be perfect
If it's going around
Will keep coming around

[Chorus:]
Time heals nothing
You know this life can't be perfect
If it's going around
Will keep coming around

Rrow

Time heals nothing at all
I swear I'm gonna break these fucking walls
Time heals nothing at all
I swear I'm gonna break these fucking walls

Time heals nothing at all
I swear I'm gonna break these fucking walls
Time heals nothing at all
I swear I'm gonna break these fucking walls
