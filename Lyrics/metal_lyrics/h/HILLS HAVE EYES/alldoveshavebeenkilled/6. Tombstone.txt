[feat. Vasco Ramos from More Than A Thousand]ItÂ´s cold and I am sitting here with this gun in my hands,
I donÂ´t understand what IÂ´ve done
I want to elucidate myself but my hands
Are all covered in blood and why is this man here?

It seems impossible, why does the sun shine for some
Why canÂ´t the sun shine for all?
Eleven hours now and I keep sitting here all alone,
Why canÂ´t the sun shine for me?

When my breathing failed I fell asleep on the floor
And I woke up with all this tombstones by my side and a gun in my hand

ItÂ´s cold and IÂ´m sitting here with my hands covered in blood,
Why am I here with this corpses so near?

When my breathing failed I fell asleep on the floor
And I woke up with all this tombstones by my side wondering is the blood here?
