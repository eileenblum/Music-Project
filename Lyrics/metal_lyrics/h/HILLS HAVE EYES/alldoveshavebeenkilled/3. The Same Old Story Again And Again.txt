Are we living a dream?
Are we living a lie?
And should i believe in the things that you say?

Are we living a dream?
Are we living a lie?
And should i believe in the things that you say?

Just hold my hand
and lets run somewhere far
to a place that doesnÂ´t matter what we have done before
So come on close your eyes
and imagine that we can reach the sky
I see you, youÂ´re falling down,
your hands are sweating, you feel worn
I wriggle and my heart bleeds for you

Are we living a dream?
Are we living a lie?
And should i believe in the things that you say?

Are we living a dream?
Are we living a lie?
And should i believe in the things that you say?

LetÂ´s put our faith in the hands of god
Â´cause time is running out
Yeah time is running,
but where is it running to?
Will the clock ever stop and freeze for us?

I see you, youÂ´re falling down,
your hands are sweating, you feel worn
I wriggle and my heart bleeds for you

Listen to the heartbeat, this road is way too long,
IÂ´ll keep inwards the emphasis
This is not rousing like it was,
the star isnÂ´t shining anymore
Forget the lies,
forget the hate,
forget this start,
forget this onset
ItÂ´s all over

Are we living a dream?
Are we living a lie?
And should i believe in the things that you say?

Are we living a dream?
Are we living a lie?
And should i believe in the things that you say?

Are we living a dream?
Are we living a lie?
And should i believe in the things that you say?

Are we living a dream?
Are we living a lie?
And should i believe in the things that you say?
