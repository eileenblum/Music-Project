You look around and they all
try to stab you in the back
The world is dying to
take a laugh at you

Smiles so cynic that they
just take your breath,
you feel their handshakes like
needles in your chest

(THEY!) They are just
waiting to
step on you
when you fall down

Thoughtless words trying to establish what
a slap in the face would do just right
Are those words for me? IÂ´m blushing now

They just fly in circles
waiting for the right time
and when youÂ´re down itÂ´s their time to shine

They just fly in circles
waiting for the right time
and when youÂ´re down itÂ´s their time to shine

IÂ´m sorry that you didnÂ´t
see that we donÂ´t care,
we walk our own line we know what we can bare

We can feel you breathing
in every step we take,
your life is made of smiling on others mistakes

(THEY!) They are just
waiting to
step on you
when you fall down

Thoughtless words trying to establish what
a slap in the face would do just right
Are those words for me? IÂ´m blushing now

They just fly in circles
waiting for the right time
and when youÂ´re down itÂ´s their time to shine

They just fly in circles
waiting for the right time
and when youÂ´re down itÂ´s their time to shine

So you can take
your knife out
and all those bullets you have sent

Now did you get the message?
This is what we meant

The one time you will open your eyes is when I cut your wrists wide open

They just fly in circles
waiting for the right time
and when youÂ´re down itÂ´s their time to shine

They just fly in circles
waiting for the right time
and when youÂ´re down itÂ´s their time to shine

They just fly in circles
waiting for the right time
and when youÂ´re down itÂ´s their time to shine

They just fly in circles (They just fly in circles)
waiting for the right time
and when youÂ´re down itÂ´s their time to shine

They just fly in circles
They just fly in circles
