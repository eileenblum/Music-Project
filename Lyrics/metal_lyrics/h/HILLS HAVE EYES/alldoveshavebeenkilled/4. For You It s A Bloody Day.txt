Our bond cannot be broken so easily,
don't worry now
true friendship lasts forever

A word donât mean a thing,
a stab means a lot
so you should know in who you can count on.

They laugh as we walk,
we will not fall.

As we walk, will not fall

As we walk, we will not fall

They laugh as we walk,
we will not fall

As we walk, will not fall

As we walk, we will not fall

So this meaningless words
that come out of your mouth,
who told you they mean anything to us?

Our bond cannot be broken so easily,
don't worry now
true friendship lasts forever

A word donât mean a thing,
a stab means a lot
so you should know in who you can count on

THEY LAUGH, AS WE, WALK, WE WILL NOT FALL

As we walk, we will not fall

They laugh as we walk,
we will not fall

As we walk, will not fall

As we walk, we will not fall

And so you can end your nightmare,
the dices show your end
Today for you is a bloody day

So this meaningless words
that come out of your mouth,
who told you they mean anything to us?

Youâd bleed until the end of the world but you wonât ask for help,
and Iâll miss you for that...[x4]
