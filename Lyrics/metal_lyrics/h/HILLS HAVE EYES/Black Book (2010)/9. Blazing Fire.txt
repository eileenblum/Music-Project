I'm the one who will lit this fire
I'm the one who will lit this fire
I'm the one who will, I'm the one who will, I'm the one who will

The stars glitter in the sky
But every word you say
Put our every light around me
And my life has a meaning

The stars glitter in the sky
But every word you say
Put our every light around me
And my life has a meaning

We're touching the sky
Wishing we would never grow old
Trembling thoughts are quickly wiped by what we still can do

If there's a lesson to be learned
Then here my mind is all yours
If there's a heart to be shred
Then here take my own

The stars glitter in the sky
But every word you say
Put our every light around me
And my life has a meaning

The stars glitter in the sky
But every word you say
Put our every light around me
And my life has a meaning

If there's a lesson to be learned
Then here my mind is all yours
If there's a heart to be shred
Then here take my own

Oh!

I'm the one who will lit this fire (fire!)
I'm the one who will lit this fire (fire!)
I am the one, I am the one

I'm the one who will lit this fire
I'm the one who will lit this fire
I'm the one who will, I'm the one who will, I'm the one who will

The stars glitter in the sky
But every word you say
Put our every light around me
And my life has a meaning
