You've been in love for the first time
Pink dreams and bloody sheets
You've been in love for the first time
Now you know that it hurts when it bleeds

Girl, tell me you are feeling like you never felt before
And you're wishing you would never wake up from this
You believe so strongly in what your heart tells you to believe
You're starting something that you'll never forget

You've been in love for the first time
Pink dreams and bloody sheets
You've been in love for the first time
Now you know that it hurts when it bleeds

I did it all for you, did it all to make it right
Did it all for you but now this don't feel safe
I whisper to your ears, this don't feel right
I did it all for you for a couple of nights

You took this for granted, placed it above everything
There's no need to worry, 'cause your secret is safe with me
These feelings are turning dead, so don't give me your hand
Someday you'll begin your life again

I did it all for you, did it all to make it right
Did it all for you but now this don't feel safe
I whisper to your ears, this don't feel right
I did it all for you for a couple of nights

You've been in love for the first time
Your secret is safe with me
You've been in love for the first time

You've been in love for the first time
Pink dreams and bloody sheets
You've been in love for the first time
Now you know that it hurts when it bleeds
