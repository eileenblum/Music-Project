The reason we feel, this is the reason we sing this song
We stand for nothing and no one
You stand for nothing at all
The reason we feel, this is the reason we sing this song
We stand for nothing and no one
You stand for nothing at all

We're victims of our innocence,
Another story told and the truth fades like sand
Take our eyes, our empty eyes because they keep on staring
Damn, I'm feeling down today,
Yes when we feel like giving up random thoughts will come crashing in
Will come crashing in

Raze our minds - I won't stand for nothing
I'm feeling a bit diseased by the words that come to me
I wish I was a believer, but you know I'm not
We both know the truth, lies are used as proof
We both know the truth, lies are used as proof

The reason we feel, this is the reason we sing this song
We stand for nothing and no one
You stand for nothing at all

We're victims of our innocence,
Another story told and the truth fades like sand
Take our eyes, our empty eyes because they keep on staring
Damn, I'm feeling down today,
Yes when we feel like giving up random thoughts will come crashing in

I can't stand this, I can't feel this, I can't stand you anymore
I despise each one of you motherfuckers, you better let me go!

The reason we feel, this is the reason we sing this song
We stand for nothing and no one
You stand for nothing at all

I'm feeling a bit diseased by the words that come to me
I wish I was a believer, but you know I'm not
