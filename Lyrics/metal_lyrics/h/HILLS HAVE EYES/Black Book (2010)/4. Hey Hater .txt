Imagine how sweet would be music without haters

Hater, we feel your breath at the back of our heads
We've been drifting for ages, but no one can decide what's best for us
We've been driving in circles
Liar, every word that comes from your mouth is as shittier as the next
So sad that for you all comes down to this, you're so sad

Imagine how sweet would be music without haters
Everybody else would be singing along

Lover, all we are we owe it to you
Even if we are nothing
In the end remember us with a smile

Shut up! Where will you be playing tomorrow?
Me and my friends marked your town with a bottle

Will you forget about me?
I will forget about you
Will you forget about me?
I will forget about you

Imagine how sweet would be music without haters
Everybody else would be singing along
Imagine how sweet would be music without haters
Everybody else would be singing along
