What else do you need?
So let's have fun tonight
I gave that up since the last time
We've been staring at each other for hours and I went home alone
Sorry babe, but I'm not the one
But I can make you feel special tonight

I swear that every word I say is true
Tonight is all about me and you

Hey! I'll tell what I need
A full glass and my mind at ease
Come on let's erase the word forever from our fucking hearts
Let's play this game tonight
But I can make you feel special tonight

I swear that every word I say is true
Tonight is all about me and you

Let's take each other to the edge until there's nothing left
I am here and so are you - that makes us two
I am here and so are you

I swear that every word I say is true
Tonight is all about me and you

I swear that, I swear that every word I say is true
I swear that, I swear is all about me and you
I swear that, I swear that every word I say is true
I swear that, I swear is all about me and you
