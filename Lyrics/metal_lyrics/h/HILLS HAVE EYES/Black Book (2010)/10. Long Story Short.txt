I lost my inspiration, madness fills our hearts and souls
I'm trying to find a way to understand why do we have to
Get trough all this to do something that we love
And I know you'll walk with me through this garden of stones

Hey bro, here we are
Give it a, give it a try one last time
Our mood will be much better tomorrow
Hey bro, here we are
Give it a, give it a try one last time
Our mood will be much better tomorrow even if it's fucking not

Let's put all this in a notebook so we can laugh about it later
Let's put all this in a notebook so we can laugh about it later

I'm getting tired, you should be too
And these suckers don't have a clue of what they preach, of what they say

Get trough all this to do something that we love
And I know you'll walk with me through this garden of stones

Hey bro, here we are
Give it a, give it a try one last time
Our mood will be much better tomorrow
Hey bro, here we are
Give it a, give it a try one last time
Our mood will be much better tomorrow even if it's fucking not

I wanna thank you
For baring with me on this days we looked out the window
Everything was grey
Everything was dark
And you know, and you know it was hard to get this done
But we love it so much that we'll even miss those days
We called each other motherfucker for the fun of it

Hey bro, here we are
Give it a, give it a try one last time
Our mood will be much better tomorrow
Hey bro, here we are
Give it a, give it a try one last time
Our mood will be much better tomorrow even if it's fucking...
