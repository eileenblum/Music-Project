Man sit and watch as life passes you by
Keep running from everything
'Cause you just can't take it

I don't believe we came here for nothing
Even though you still got it all, you still got it all
I do believe we came here for something
Even though you still got it all

You fight and scare the ones who give a damn about you
Deep inside you wonder how did we took so long to reply
We have put up with you way too many times,
And yes you know, oh you know, it was too good to be true

I don't believe we came here for nothing
Even though you still got it all, you still got it all
I do believe we came here for something
Even though you still got it all

We won't forget to mention your name
But there's a million other things I would like to say to you
We won't regret, we're still the same!
Guess you better change if you don't want to end up alone

You have fooled us for the last time
Did you thought we were blind?
Keep doing the same mistakes
We'll climb that hill and scream your name

I don't believe we came here for nothing
Even though you still got it all, you still got it all
I do believe we came here for something
Even though you still got it all

You thought we couldn't make it
Right now you must be shaking
You thought we couldn't make it
We wrote this one for you

You thought we couldn't make it
Right now you must be shaking
You thought we couldn't make it
We wrote this one for you

Fuck you!
