Everyone sworn they were satisfied
But each day they wanted more and more
I'll bring you hunger, fire and blood
Until your eyes get paralysed

Hey servant, put your hands at sight
This only ends when I close your eyes
Hey servant, put your hands at sight
This only ends when I close your eyes

Everybody tastes like self-destruction
So take a good look for this could be the day I'll make you pay

Hunger, fire and blood
Hunger, fire and blood

Tonight you will spit fire
I know you can see me
I know you can feel my love
You will spit fire
I know you can see me
I know you can feel my love

Hey servant, put your hands at sight
This only ends when I close your eyes
Hey servant, put your hands at sight
This only ends when I close your eyes

Everybody tastes like self-destruction
So take a good look for this could be the day I'll make you pay

Hunger, fire and blood
Hunger, fire and blood

Tonight you will spit fire
I know you can see me
I know you can feel my love
You will spit fire
I know you can see me
I know you can feel my love

I am your savior
Each one of you must die
I am your savior
All of you must die

They scream only to feel their lungs empty
They scream...
What a glorious day!

Tonight you will spit fire
I know you can see me
I know you can feel my love
You will spit fire
I know you can see me
I know you can feel my love

Hey servant, put your hands at sight
This only ends when I close your eyes
Hey servant, put your hands at sight
It ends when you all die
