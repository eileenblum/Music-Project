Hey bro hear me up
I feel a bit frustrated I'm stuck to the ground
I've heard this story so many times before
And no one can prove me wrong
Hey man, listen up
Our hands will stay together
We'll make it trough this night

Come on come on and take a walk with me
I'll take you, I'll take you to the other side
Come on come on and take a walk with me
I'll take you, I'll take you to the other side

Hey bro hear me up
I feel a bit frustrated I'm stuck to the ground
I told you many times that I don't give a fuck
No one can stop us, no one can bring us down

Come on come on and take a walk with me
I'll take you, I'll take you to the other side
Come on come on and take a walk with me
I'll take you, I'll take you to the other side

Sometimes I wonder why I'm so full of this
Will you take my hand?
Sometimes I wonder why I'm so full of these endless tries

Come on come on and take a walk with me
I'll take you, I'll take you to the other side
Come on come on and take a walk with me
I'll take you, I'll take you to the other side

Hey man, listen up
Our hands will stay together
We'll make it trough this night
Will you stay by my side in the end?
Will you stay by my side in the end?
