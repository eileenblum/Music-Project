I'm writing this song for you
So you know that I still care
For all we bared together
For what we still can bare

Even if this has ended
If this will never feel right
You're a part of me, I'm part of you
And that we can never hide

I want you to know that I miss you
But my heart feels so far away
I would give everything, I would give anything
To get on my feet again

Even if this has ended
If this will never feel right
You're a part of me, I'm part of you
And that we can never hide

Even if this has ended
If this will never feel right
You're a part of me, I'm part of you
And that we can never hide

And that we can never hide
