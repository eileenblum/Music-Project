A cult worshipping distant stars allineation...
Exagriomenos timorÃ²s, emÃ¬theos fidiÃ²n
(furious punisher, serpent demigod)
AtÃ natos kyklos tÃ¨s ekmedÃ¨nises
(Immortal cycle of annihilation)
Desolate bloodscapes, a tower in the grey distance..
loud blasphemous accents.
Of the Ones laughing at the ephemeral race..
breeding worms eating worms
of the human dead remains..
Weak is the multitude who struggle to die
Villains the ones who innovate the killing art
Scabbed beast whores feed the catalept's frenzy..
Mouthless orations..feasting nameless non idols 
MorfÃ¨ kai usiÃ , Ã²neiro kai pragmatikÃ²s pÃ²nos
Rust Upon The Thrones...Altars..
Victims..back in times before the sun..
Severed souls marked with the Guilty
Stain..severe sons of the headless rotten progenie..
The Young have never been so Old..
The Chaos has never spread so Cold..
