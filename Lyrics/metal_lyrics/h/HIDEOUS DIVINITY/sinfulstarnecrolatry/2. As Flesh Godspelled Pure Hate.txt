Eerie Choirs From A Starless
Septic Scismatic Slavery We Forgot..
Ruins Of  A Geometric Perfection
carved in mysterious times
The dissonance we hear in ultrasounds
is a message of death..
The ruins the symbols we cannot
translate are the funeral chants of humanity..
Kingdom Of Kingdoms Obscured,
involving history in his theories..
Tomorrow which we awakened
in is the died day we never praised to come..
Tomorrow which we awakened
in is the died day we never praised to come..
Summoned -ARTIFIXION- 
to save us from worst than death..
- ARTIFIXION - the deity
wishes human immolation -
ARTIFIXION - a thousand severed
throats  bloodbathing our non-redemption..
Pay the price as human mice..
As The Flesh Gospelled Pure Hate
We Fear To Be Heard By The Beast In Disguise
-DOMINVS NECANDUS EST - proclamation!
The black vexils of fast annihilation..
Engulf the roots of all family trees..
The future is no more! [x2]
Artifixion Sanctuary..sinful star necrolatry!
Crucifixion's obsolete..
We need some other  thousand J.C
to be ripped and torn
FLESH IS FOOD FOR THE
EXTERNAL..FLASH OV THE  LIGHT THAT
SHALT BLIND THEE ALL
BASTARD BREED OV GOD..
THOU IS THE ART
TO WRITE IN UNSPEAKABLE LETTERS
THE WORD "END"
