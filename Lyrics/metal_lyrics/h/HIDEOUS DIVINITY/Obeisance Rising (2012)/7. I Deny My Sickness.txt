Lying motionless, awake
-Unworthy of the gift of life and life
Code has come to procreate
-Impure connection between truth and lie
I stole the color and soul from the sun

Dark
We stand and watch the burial of the light
We stand and watch the burial of the light

Blind leading blind
I feel it runing in
What once was blood and now I deny
Torch the sky with a lie
Choose to dream
A coat of flesh is keeping me warm

Orphan of the blood, I dream of the void

Denial of the dream
Of soaring from ashes through a leak in the steel
Denial of the void
That swallows a distorted code

Obey to Gods

To the distant sky, obeisant
I turn my gaze of a faithful one

Feeding my faith with the dust of my life,
Enlightened by lies
I worship the light as I have to

Blinded by light 
Unconscious sleepwalk
Back to the screen
We are feeding on

I chose to dream
To sleep among silent cries

Blinded
Enlightened
I'm blinded
