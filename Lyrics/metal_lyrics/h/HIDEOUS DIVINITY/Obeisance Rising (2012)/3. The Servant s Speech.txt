Born of a drone
Of a million scattered ashes
A trembling hand, a veil of flesh
I can't help to feel relief
While I'm embracing you
Quietly wrapped in peacefulness

I move backwards with the tide
Pleasure in obscene conforming

Obscene, key word
Immolated
Decline the fault
Torch the conscience of the

God resembling â I
Spiritual womb â I
Away from guilt â I'm
Unveiled fever

Spirituality, liquid perfection
I'm now praying for advice
The voice now whispers in the niche

Hateful world of flesh is only a
Distant dream reloaded by
Receptors of sublime decomposition

Far from the sun
I question light and life
Crave for future
Accepting my warm burial ground
Confident in free will
Restoring what's not real

Organic slave
The most unclean, renamed
I will subscribe to the absence of belief
Drawing life from life
The choice made in front of my eyes

Obscene, key word
Lying, faded
Decline the fault
Torch the conscience, I'm the

Stillborn partner â I'm
Reigning chaos â Servant
Far beyond guilt â I'm
The new servant
