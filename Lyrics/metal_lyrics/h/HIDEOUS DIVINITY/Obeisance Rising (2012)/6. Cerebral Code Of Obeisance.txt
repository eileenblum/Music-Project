Tentacles of light spread the disease
The final conquest starts from here
Like fingernails carving the nothing out
Our minister is blind, in spinning webs of lies he cries

Solution leads to emptiness
Depths are forbidden while
Surface swallowed the world
-Procession of shame-

Obey to a world in pain
Obey to the new code
Obey to what's left to entertain

Flesh tunrs into dirt
God knows no other sacrament
Radioactive lashes to swallow the eyes
Free to conquer, free to use, we plead for more
Bludgeoned into addiction, reflecting nothing on the surface

A timeless
Anthem is our jingle
Marching in line, concrete boxes await
The code that shows a linear path

A timeless
Anthem is our jingle
The obeisance code
Banned be the wanderer, line of ghosts leading to nowhere

Curse our state of trance
Entrenched in our cult
Upon our frontal lobe
Transmission has no end

A ruthless monarchy
Their white impulse's too bright to see
The torn and the-sun-that-weep

Languages of the worms
Soon to come and conquer
Feasting on blood
Feasting on mankind
