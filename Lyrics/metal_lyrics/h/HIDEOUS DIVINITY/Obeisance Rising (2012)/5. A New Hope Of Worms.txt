An untroubled race image in the imprinting database
Blanket of the worms in the family fault
Meaining of serenity and bliss redefined and enhanced
Heaven is an insurance, I pay in advance
I awake to find myself asleep
Asleep in golden hope

Cold and pure believes
Fo the noble narcosis
Get down on knees and lick
Bright lies and hope
For a life to come
A deserved reward for this woe

Nailed asleep
Nailed to the mchine
Willing not to live, hoping never to die

Now, reflecting god, on my screen I want more
I want to become man again

Mankind still waits for a signal
From a twisted sky of prayers
For a signal that's
Never come

Genuflected effigy by starlight
Like barbed wire on the sun

Nailed asleep, nailed to the machine
Light shall come to burn our faithful eyes
Blinded by lies

New hope, a new hope for worms

Sense of relief
Slowing pouring like scent
Of flesh altered by bedsores
We sleep, they live
Eternal life will cure the wounds
Skip the soul and preserve the flesh
For the lie soon to come

The love for the neighbor is twisted into code
Body is now the temple of new lies
Hypnotic mass, I hear a drone
Someone changed the code
But never asked to us permission
â¨Lies
Our lives to bright lies
Parts of the machine, waiting for our relief
For a relief never to come
