Eerie choirs from a starless septic scismatic slavery
We forgot ruins of a geometric perfection carved in mysterious times
The dissonance we hear in ultrasounds is a message of death...
The ruins the symbols we cannot translate
Are the funeral chants of humanity...

Kingdom of,
Kingdoms obscured, involving history in his theories..
The tomorrow which we awakened in is
the died day we never praised to come.

summoned -ARTIFIXION-
to save us from worst than death.
- ARTIFIXION - the deity
wishes human immolation -

ARTIFIXION - a thousand severed
throats bloodbathing our
non-redemption.
pay the price as human mice.

As The Flesh
Gospelled Pure Hate We Fear To Be
Heard By The Beast In Disguise
-DOMINVS NECANDUS EST -
proclamation!
the black vexils of
fast annihilation engulf the roots of all family trees
the future is no more! [2x]

Artifixion Sanctuary
sinful star necrolatry
Crucifixion's obsolete
we need some other thousand J.C. to be ripped and torn

FLESH IS FOOD FOR THE EXTERNAL
FLASH OV THE LIGHT THAT SHALT BLIND THEE ALL

BASTARD
BREED OV GOD.

THOU IS THE ART
TO WRITE IN UNSPEAKABLE LETTERS
THE WORD "END".
