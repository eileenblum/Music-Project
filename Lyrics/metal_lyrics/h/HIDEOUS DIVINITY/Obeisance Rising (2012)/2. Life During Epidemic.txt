Marry and reproduce

Consciences go unheard
The ultimate epidemic of sleep
Now it's alive, its pulse
Magnified by the wrath
Follow the pale white line, at one with the light
Model citizens of despair, thru forsaken path

Blind me
Unconscious, I live in denial

They own us all
Eradicate from rotten soil, used to call it war

Ashes of history never told
Scattered by the pain
Scattered by the plague
Behind the flames 
The blackest of the days

Unaware

Submit to the mainstream
The snake crawls underneath
Fed on decency, poisoned eyes cannot see
Surface torn apart, in the dawn of epidemic

Their 3rd world, livestock
In developing plants
Make me blind
Give me relief, come and heal me
Numb, unaware, I deny

Purge is here

Wind breeds the epidemic of the new
For we sentenced to worship greed
Unanimated own the alive
Unanimated own the alive, we're purified

Blind me unconscious I sleep
Are you god ? Do I see you now ?
Celebrate repression
Unwitting accomplice
Purge is here
