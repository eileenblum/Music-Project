A new mistake

The coming of another hero has spread
Ilusion of hope, a new test for machines to come
Disconnect eyes from brain, remove, rewind
I can see now
Face the conflict and raise your fears

Cover the distance and
Break the pattern with a dissonance
Enhance the drone, aware of the flesh
And blood and soul

Awake â for truly you're divine flesh
The pride â a life enclosured
Reject â a snapshot of what's not real
The pain â of a life enclosured

And now reprisal act one
Intensify wellness â It starts to fade out
Exquisite smearing machine
Bendng the time, the weapon supreme

Dark light, the hero is aone
An healed scar, craving for death
He never will
Chemical joy corroding the bones
From inside I rot, I failed in the end
A tale of an untold disease
Of a permanent victory of anesthetized
Progeny of souls

This we've become, we've become with pride
A new breed of halfmen divine
This we've become with joy
Breathing what we won't destroy
This and we'll never die
Soaring high but we're nothing but flies
Soaring high but we're nothing but flies
Soaring high but we're nothing but flies
Soaring high but we're nothing but flies

Fly, reach out the light
