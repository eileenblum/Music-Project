Greed induced infection
Flesh â No more of this world
Sterile state of reproduction
I'm the one not asleep
I'm the one not asleep

Poison hits the surface, nfection
Blinded us, deep down to the roots of our eyes.

A population that worships greed;
Hungry anthill carrying the corpse
Of the baby god.
Son betrayed, new father has control
To lead the cattle
Bred for slavery

Poison hits the surface, assimilation
We learned to feed on the baby corpse
Swept away
By sleep consumed, corrupted spirit
Fear of God

Fear of God
Consume and sleep

In cages we procreate
We spread the disease

Our fate
We won't betray our sorrow and hate

Behold the legions of wired
Servant worms for the lords
Follow the rules, procreate asleep
Newborn acolyte of the light
Follow the rules and everything will work
My son

Awareness annihilated, the new form of slavery
Running in the circles of greed, selfish state of trance
Indifference is the plague
The mind is pierced, the thirst is pleased
Faith feeds the mouths submitted
We kiss and spread the disease, trembling lips of
Poison to procreate

From birth to death, their hand
It's warm, still on our shoulder
Impulse redirected, a growing wall separates us
A poisoned mind eroded, simulated grace
Fulfills emptiness
Consume and sleep, the circle is complete
Consume and sleep
