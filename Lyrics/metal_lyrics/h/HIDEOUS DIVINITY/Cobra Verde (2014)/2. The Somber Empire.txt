in the shadow of the dead giant tree
long after the escape
long after the thirst
a conscience reborn after the cold sleep
I rise in my name
slave! slave! slave!
to guide them through the dark
slave! slave! slave
a light for the horde
slithering emperor
west is dream of blood stained silk
I wrap myself into
the blankest throne on earth
I embrace the sea and sand
in my bloody hands, hands of king!
slave ! slave! slave!
to rule them through the dark
slave! slave! slave!
a uniform to drive the horde
slave! slave! slave!
a scepter to trample and pound
them all!
their eyes will look at east
and see their peer
as ten thousand miles of fleence
awe-struck you'll see
now fear the dark where I won't cast a glance
your eye is evil, I bludgeon
your shining skull will feed the dead
summoning the dogs who speak like men
for this is my will
purest gold that smells
my will
rule them by darkness
my will
against time and death

once again... in my name!
