free me
wanton savagery
a life on my knees
survived the mud
once
my mortal life
I shed my ties and found the cruel symmetry
that you call freedom
all hail greed
all hail the snake who tramples on man
all hail greed
all hail the snake
fear no end
fear no spirit
the living are dead
I am deaf to your silence
I am deaf to all of your dreams
I am deaf, a thorn deep in my thoughts
I am deaf to pain and screams
 unfold the secrets of the sea
in front of me
I am deaf
a blind heart with no more will
millennial puse beating loud its curse
they sing, but why?
while they're carried away
iron joke belongs to another
world in here the invisible rules
murderers and kings
the oceans will divide
and unite
fear no end
fear no spirit
the living are dead
