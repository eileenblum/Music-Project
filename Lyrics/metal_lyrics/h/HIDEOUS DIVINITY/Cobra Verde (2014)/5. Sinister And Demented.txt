if I tell the stars not to drop a tear
sky will never see the dawn again
and I came to purify
beast on my right side
father mother brother
if I stretch my arms I reach the moon
coming to life, once the coldest dream
a frozen ocean now is the demon I feed
searching for my silk
with my noise I'll make you deaf
the glittering light will make you all blind
skulls have known their defeat
their hands now make my carpet with silk
our wives and our stranglers will give voice to my pride
dance now!
it's time for a new war, the leopard said
in powder, in smoke the sound of drums erases time inside my mind
while I dance and gather greyhounds from the dead
where is my silk?
deception is complete, as my brother cries and then slowly drowns
the abysses lie to god
steal!
steal from me, breath from me, steal from me glorious king
salute the sovereign, the west will hail with fear
abekoute will ask for forgiveness then die
in front of these eyes
the sound of drums erases time inside my mind
while I dance and gather greyhounds from the dead
where is my silk
deception is complete, as my brother cries and then slowly drown
the abysses lie and hide my pride
steal from me, breath from me
steal from me, glorious king
shine! shine for my eyes! bring my own glory so far
steal from me, breath from me
steal from me, breath from me, stand for your glorious king
