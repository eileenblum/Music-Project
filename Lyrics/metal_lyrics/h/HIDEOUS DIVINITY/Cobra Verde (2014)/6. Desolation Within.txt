forth from here to aanother world of sand
I am a messenger of death
black, white
have no taste on rusted scythe's
blade the sickest horror known to mankind
testimony
just like a trail of fire ants feasting on ruins
once the storm has passed
only rooms left for laments and for jackals
no time to die
messenger to a foreign god
sacrifice is done and the ocean will mourn in pain
sacrifice done before manoel can touch the land
die! because the living, they're not from this world
suffocated with laments of war
I'm the one that carries cries
desolation in me
traitor
white man
your fat is black, now allowed I am 
you head will roll
he who dwells in solitude can see... it all!
only the man who loves nothing
and carries dry, sad land inside
trusting no one
will become king, second only to solitude eternal and thirst

trust no one
rise to the moon
to unite with snow eternal
the fathers born of ice
and snowflakes that melt with sand
oh, for my heart, for my heart's dried
I am imprisoned
trust no one
come to me, strangler
