here comes the one who'll pay for our sins
here comes the one who'll ascend to the moon
and be purified by the tide of a million dead dreams
an impious herd of souls lies
here below
relentless mind
a waterfall in an open sky mine
soaring high
leaving sorrow, cry and despair
in this land
the pure confession of a sollid guilty heart
feeds the fire that enlightens the shadow
the sun that melts our dreams
the seed of horror in my eyes
through these veins
like a fever
to a heart yet so cold
the price of one tear
is what I will pay
to soar the universe
a free flame unclenched
above men's screams
the crimes of kings and brothers
kissing shining cross of sin
men's life finally means nothing
the ultimate revelation
reward in sacrifice
salt in my tears of despair
kill! kill! kill! the chosen one
