[feat. Dallas Toler-Wade (NILE)]I feel no pity
For dead foredoomed mankind
No empathy for pain
Feel nothing for them all

For this hole in the sun
Tears me apart, yet spits me out

Off the king's road
I step on thorns aside
Where the plagues rise
From the dog's bite

Time doesn't flow
To remit my sin
Time doesn't flow
To occur to my plague

White line has been
Traced into the sand
Surrounded by my army
Blessing the war field with red

If no sound spreads the word
Of the silent raider
You will fear my cry
My eyes upon your reign

Fearing no thorns as i run free
Spreading my plague and my woe
A new kingdom will rise
Out of this world alone

See my spear
I laugh at you
I am alone
I laugh at you

Forgotten by fear
See my spear
I am alone

[Solo]

I'm the alonest of the alone

Now bow
and dig a hole in submission
Now bow
and praise the glorious despair

The goats accept
The body of the savior
Ashes on your head
So the rite is complete

Bow before me

Bow!

A trail of white flags
Carries my silent will
A trail of mothers
Carries the strangled spawn
Of my solitude

Melting the snow
Bleeds
I'm alone
