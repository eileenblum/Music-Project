a last look at the field of the dead
the last glance of deceit
sand whipe the white skin
now I feel her choking me and bring me back to life
Sertao - no living man shall see me mourn and weep
a distant god says I'm his will - scorching heat of my land
a place for my mind - such a drought for my soul
life is a dream, I stare at the sea, dreams of dahomey
I search for the land where snow grows - mother can you hear
barefoot and blistered white king of the dahomey
dahomey, the king of dahomey
searching, yearning for something more
something else than bones and flies
this is my fault
a kingdom kneeling on its chains
a drought for my soul
your eyes glint as you're threatening my life
but have you ever seen true death?
in my morbid boundless thirst
you sill stare at the void into my eyes
no life, no dreams, no past, no name
white demon will reign with rage
it's time for a mute deception
in my land I was a snake
dahomey, kneel before the ouster rage of dahomey
if you hide underground
the earth will speak
I command the ants who are no longer dreaming of sand
you'll see
earth snakes and stands in awe for I command
sand whips white skin of demons
I feel her choking me and
sand whips white skin of demons
and bringing back to life white skinned, sand demons
I feel her choking me and
sand whips white skin of demons still alive
dead kings will come to depose you
then I will go and sleep
so, now
wall up the doors to the women's quarter
as the mourn
