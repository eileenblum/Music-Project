Out of time, my glorious dance furious
in the eye of the storm, I see you crawling on its rhythm
Here on this rock, summoning my cabal
Future lies in pleasure tears to be poured
Redemption, my easiest sin to preach
Messianic power withering it all
Let me in
Desire burns
Contemplation
as I hold my breath,
my worn out cowl lights the blind sight of my will
As I bleed on my throne
as I watch the world
from my higher ground of hate and dreams.
Is my coming unforeseen?
Blood information storm, detached from reality,
spirit yet unbound
Needing for more, sadistic children crazy for the reek of burning wings
Like deranged Icarus in the reek of burning wings
Pleasure to burn
When the angel rises on this world
when his horror spreads the rotten wings of
infinity swallowing terror
Upon the illogical limitless cycles of blood
Digging forever more
What's left for me?
As eternity burns
future and past
Sin is cleansed and none is left to see
I see nothing more.
