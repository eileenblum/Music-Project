Terror induced pain
It's what remains, I'm the little deception that brings the obliteration
The light is gone, it's now through me
Permission to violate won't be denied this time. Not this time
A descent into total awareness, lustful eye pointing at me

My hand now into the flesh box, searching for a world below

When flesh unfolds - Poison light strikes behind
Breathe me in, This is gonna be the last thing that you see
Voices from the outworld, light beyond the horizon
Lead me to your war, not theirs to control
Flesh is dropping off, torn apart and exposed
The sight of the deceit I fear the screams
from the beast's mouth. Now I can see it's me!
When flesh unfolds - heat upon heat, fist against fist
Open my chest to the light
Kul Wahad!
I open my mouth and say "pass over me,"
Turning around to see a new path to lead
Kul Wahad!
Stone, blood, crystal, flesh, bones, inside
Infinity in a pit where to get lost
Behold me now!
Hiss my bones, I keep on crying.
Obey the voice, is it going to be a liar?

Pain
It's what remains, I'm the little deception that brings the obliteration
The light is gone
Kul Wahad!

Closing my eyes and pray, forget my name
open my mouth and lick the door of pain
When flesh unfolds - By will alone I chose to stare
I'm magnified by the terror eye
The word that thrills the word that kills to feed the Hand of God
When flesh unfolds
