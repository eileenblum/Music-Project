Two faces Janus' head, both present and past messiah
Incoherent perception of distance, sadness estranged
Burning your inner fire
A brutal embrace
Animal ecstasy intimate
Craving for blood

Feed me, quench my thirst!
Thirsty eye of the blind, a collective nervous system
Looking inside for the outside, hallucination is now a living ghost
Now a living ghost, haunting scenes.

Mesmerize, putrid dreams, vivid crimes inspire
I want to see!

Not a discordant sound in the most deafening sough
Human tide pours and casts away, dead calm, windless

Spaces unite in hysteria, spaces united in void
Spaces unite in hysteria, spaces united in cognizance

Craving for deeper comprehension, craving too deeply the void
Craving for deeper comprehension, the new addiction I have realized

Carry on - I walk on the path of the future
Carry on - disturbances cut out to be left behind
Carry on - a flaneur lost in his addiction
Carry on - in a sea of ruins

Teach me how to shine!

In your ruins I see your will, in your blood the Maker
In the sand I see progress, in your eyes hope and the waiting.

Down on his down on my knees!
Too much for the angel's eye, another vision left behind,
arrow points forward, a new corner, another blank slate
Live for the day that will not dawn
