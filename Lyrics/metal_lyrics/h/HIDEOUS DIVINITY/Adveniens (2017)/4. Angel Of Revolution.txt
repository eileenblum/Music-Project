Hail, oh dying race!
In the zoo, made of clay, highly favored
In the zoo, fear not the wind
cast upon thee 'cause you've overshadowed time
Leave your rubbles on the earth
There's no turning back to witness the fear
There's no way or will
Teach me to forget my days, my dreams, my past
There's no turning back to what you leave
your rubbles on the earth!
Spreading my wings, the storm won't let me fall
The distant cold illusion is spreading my wings
The great collapse, its aura
Feel the divine, burn your hands against lava
The storm won't let me fall!
Iâve lived the dream, Iâve seen uniqueness
Contemplate, no dance will take me home
Distant thunders and a trembling hand
Eternal mystery revealed never to the lambs
I sink in the vortex of sand
Am I here for the departure of grace?
Revolution time is now, is the latter day for living dead:
The distance, the light, the cold of the illusion of
The eye will see, my wings as they disgust me
There is no hope!
No lesson learned, the medium is the disease
Rebuilding time
Far from redemption, futile will
Obscure by clouds
I'm lost
