Now is the time of prophecies untold,
sublimation of blind restless pain
for this moment will eternally last
I'm the reek in the lust of new world
Indulge in the scent of blood,
of rotten flesh golden wings
In the lines between words
Preaching my will, your dreams, my void
Middle ground between naÃ¯ve dimensions
I preach violence
I recreate torture chambers
sealed from outside with godsâ
bronze.
Now, bleed
Watch me reborn!
How did we end here? It escapes my memory
How did we end here? Visions and medium are becoming flesh
How did we end here? Now heed the voice of your wounds
Call me, call me âNeverâ
Call me, call me âNowâ
Cry, as your ages are dying
Disease is flesh
This is fire
Cry!
I see your ages dying, as word become flesh
Invasive probe washing history with blood
Canvas for the crayons, for the children to come
Watch me paint and celebrate the suffering delight
I am the adveniens,
Future of the past
