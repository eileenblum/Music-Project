The air we breath, the words we spoke
The sorrow we cast upon
The envy of joy
The spoils to the victory
Our coming was unforeseen, as new gears in the machine
we dance together in something more

Now and forever, you're dust
We're dust, now and forever

Closing our eyes on remembrance vanishing away,
Purified redefined
We are mourning cold, our mourning call will gently sound
Forever more

Reborn in the name of the future to come

A claim was settled in fire and wind
Dices are cast for mankind
A claim was settled and marked in the flesh
Mankind will pay and, we all know, it won't come cheap

Jetzeit!
Seek for food and clothing first,
then the Kingdom of God shall be added unto you

Emerging victorious reign
Stepping over the angel lying prostrated
Last attempt to resuscitate
Tradition, oppression
Rise and shine, world of decline

My wings are ready for flight
I would like to turn back
If I stayed timeless time, I would have little luck.

I'll show you how, it's easy
I'll show you how, it's easy
I'll show you how, I'll show you how!
