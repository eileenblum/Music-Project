Against mechanical emptiness, a crystallized moment
Monadic dogma unveiled, forever still, perfect

Every dualism's solved, we're as one, we'll become one
Lost in the depth of the black of the angel's eye

Echoes of steps passed over past world
running cold and dustfall, scent of death and life

Eternal is flesh, eternal is alive, blessed he will come.

Paradox of hope in front of our eyes, the throne is built and awaits
The crown and the scepter here to redeem the past, the Messiah descends

The redeemer!

Time has come to light up the mind's eye to see the new truth

Hail the messiah!

To evolve from the dust of the old flesh, to be born

Hail the messiah!

Day of joy and destruction
Perennial threat of mankind exposed
Messiah takes his place, redemption flows through him in this place
Gather our weaknesses and give birth to history
Fight the vision of the angel of light

Hail the Messiah!
