Theyâre back in again
Five more years of shit
Tories back in power
But who voted âem in

The shit scared lambs
So afraid of change
Canât take the chance
To have something new

All they want is power
Look down on me and you
But governments all the same
Just pawns in their game

Government is so fucked
But what can we do
Nothing ever gonna change
When itâs left to you

Curry â Drums
Scotty â Guitars
Ali â Vocals
Andy â Bass
