These business men, taking the piss
Using us, to make their millions
They donât care, about the music
All they want, is big fat cheques

These cunts donât care about you or me
Rock stars, business men theyâre all the same
Making money out of people who care
The big wheel turns, and they dare

Top of the pops, itâs all the same
Same old faces, same old names
Same old songs same old shit
Say they care but they donât give a toss

These cunts donât care about you or me
Rock stars, business men theyâre all the same
Making money out of people who care
The big wheel turns, and they dare

[Solo]

These business men, taking the piss
Using us, to make their millions
They donât care, about the music
All they want, is big fat cheques

Top of the pops, itâs all the same
Same old faces, same old names
Same old songs same old shit
Say they care but they donât give a toss
