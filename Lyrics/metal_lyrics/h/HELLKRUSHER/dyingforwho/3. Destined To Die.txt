My life is a cage
Destined to die
Condemned to death
I ask myself why

Something is wrong
I shouldnât be here
Is this my purpose
To be treated this way

From birth to death
I live a life of doom
Subjected to horrific torture
And locked up in my tomb
The civilized creation
Called the master race
For scientific gain
Weâll cause such fucking pain

Animalsâ lives are theirs to live
Not end up in a cage
They have their thoughts of freedom
But to them itâs just a dream
