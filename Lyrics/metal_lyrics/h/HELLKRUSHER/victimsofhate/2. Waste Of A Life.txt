Donât care what life has done to me
I shut my eyes donât want to see
Turn my back on all Iâve known
Burning bridges as I go

This is no life, a wasted life
I need to numb the pain
So down I go again

Donât think about the consequences
The family and lifelong friends
The wasted time, forever lost
Unconcerned about the cost

This is no life, a wasted life
I need to numb the pain
So down I go again

[Solo]

This is no life, a wasted life
I need to numb the pain
So down I go again

Canât say if Iâll be coming back
Paying the price for the will I lack
Existing from day to day
Tomorrow could go either way

This is no life, a wasted life
I need to numb the pain
So down I go again

This is no life, a wasted life
This is no life, a wasted life
