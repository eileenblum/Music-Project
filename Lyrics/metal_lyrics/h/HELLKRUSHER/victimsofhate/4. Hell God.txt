Darkness from above
The so called heavens
Spreading death and disease
Famine, poverty, war

Poisoned mind, fucked up life
Brain-dead, twisted soul

This so called god
That you believe in
Praying and worshipping
You fucked up fuckers

Poisoned mind, fucked up life
Brain-dead, twisted soul

[Solo]

Children of god
Onward they go
Believing in shit
The god from hell
