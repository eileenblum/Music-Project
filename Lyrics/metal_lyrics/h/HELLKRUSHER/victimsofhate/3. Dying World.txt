Theyâre raping the land
Destroying the earth
Fucking up our world
Killing mankind

Rain forests destroyed
And our oceans polluted
Nuclear experiments
Environmental disaster

Theyâre making a killing at the expense of the world
No thoughts toward the future
The children who inherit the earth

[Solo]

Itâs a dying world
A cycle of destruction
Abusing the world resources
For power and money
