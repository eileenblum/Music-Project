A fascist regime in a modern world
Living in a police state, behind the doors of big brother

Who do you trust, who cares? Step out of life if you dare
Watch your step, another unsolved mystery death

Governments ruled by secret police, to keep the people down
Canât speak to tell the truth, cos youâre living life from the gun
