This year is 1996, but the killing still goes on
People dying children crying, life destroyed by war

Memories of past world wars, you think theyâd fucking learn
Sit back feel the pain and watch the bodies burn

[Solo]

Atrocities of days gone by, we thought weâd seen the last
Ethnic cleansing innocent starving, it all comes flooding back
