I woke up from a nightmare this is the end
A future of oppression enters my head

This is the end
This is the end

The end of our freedom weâll never see
Cos seeing is believing and Iâve never seen

This is the end
This is the end

People speak of freedom and work to stay alive
Born into a system of which we have no choice
[2x]

I woke up from a nightmare this is the end
A future of oppression enters my head

This is the end
This is the end
