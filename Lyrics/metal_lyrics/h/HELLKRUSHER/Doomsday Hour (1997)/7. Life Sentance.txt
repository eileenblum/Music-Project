Theyâve taken my rights and thrown them all away
In fear of the future, I live day by day

On the edge of a knife, they decide my life
I opened my eyes, but canât see the light

They brought me to my knees
Iâm living my life sentence
An everlasting dream
In this worthless existence

Canât see what lies ahead
Iâm hanging by a thread
Noose is getting tighter
I may as well be dead
