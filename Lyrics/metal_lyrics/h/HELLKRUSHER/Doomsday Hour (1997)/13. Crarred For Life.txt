Never ending darkness
Never ending pain
Never ending torment
Never ending nightmare

Scars of war, scarred for life
Scars of war, scarred for life
Scars of war, scarred for life
Scarred for life, scarred for life

The memories linger on, mentally and physically
Wake up screaming, the nightmare never ends

Scars of war, scarred for life
Scars of war, scarred for life
Scars of war, scarred for life
Scarred for life, scarred for life

[Solo]

Never ending darkness
Never ending pain
Never ending torment
Never ending nightmare

Scars of war, scarred for life
Scars of war, scarred for life
Scarred for life, scarred for life
