A nuclear reactor, an environment disaster
Radiation falls upon this our mother earth

A nuclear shower, the doomsday hour
Once fertile land is now a barren waste

A human error
Brings such terror
In the air we breath
The air we breath

A human error
Brings such terror
In the air we breath
The air we breath
