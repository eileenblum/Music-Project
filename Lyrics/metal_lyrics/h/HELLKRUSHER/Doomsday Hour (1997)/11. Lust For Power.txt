A system built on hate and greed
Fuelled by the lust for power
Like a disease corrupts mankind
Spread by a germ called money

Overdosed on a drug called wealth
Fed by the want for more
Fat cat bosses line their pockets
Upheld within the law

A system built on hate and greed
Fuelled by the lust for power
Like a disease corrupts mankind
Spread by a germ called money
