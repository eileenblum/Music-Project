Another war, another death
A trail of destruction, all thatâs left

The war machine marches on
Fed by the smell of death
Like a disease it kills mankind
Only the dead are left behind

Nothing survives in its path
The victim of the killing fields

The war machine marches on
Fed by the smell of death
Like a disease it kills mankind
Only the dead are left behind

[Solo]

The blood filled rivers are flowing
Fed by the smell of death

The war machine marches on
Fed by the smell of death
Like a disease it kills mankind
Only the dead are left behind
