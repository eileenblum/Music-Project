Bright lights fill the sky
The sound of bombers rumble by

Another night of terror
Another night of pain

People rush in search of safety
Leaving behind happy homes

Another night of terror
Another night of pain

Streets littered with burning corpses
But the sound of bombers rumble by

Another night of terror
Another night of pain
