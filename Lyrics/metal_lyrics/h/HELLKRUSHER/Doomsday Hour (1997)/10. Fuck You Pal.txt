Some people want it all
Using others to gain control
Power, money and then comes greed
They donât care who they blame

Fuck you, get out of my way
Youâre scum, fuck you pal

Pushing their way to the top
Stabbing friends in the back
Exploiting whatever they can
The quest for power never ends

Fuck you, get out of my way
Youâre scum, fuck you pal

At the top, donât give a fuck
Got what he wanted
A nice secure job, big fat pension
Fuck you pal, Iâm alright

Fuck you, get out of my way
Youâre scum, fuck you pal
