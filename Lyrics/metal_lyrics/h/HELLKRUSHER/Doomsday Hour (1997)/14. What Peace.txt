Living in a time of so called peace
But the race for arms still goes on

Living in a time, a time of peace
Living in a time, a time of fear

Big companies backed by the government
Producing weapons for massive profit

Living in a time, a time of peace
Living in a time, a time of fear

[Solo]

Turning death into profit no matter what the price
Their talks of peace are just a cover up

Living in a time, a time of peace
Living in a time, a time of fear
