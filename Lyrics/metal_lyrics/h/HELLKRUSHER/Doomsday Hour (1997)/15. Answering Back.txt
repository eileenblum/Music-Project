Keeping all inside, never dare to talk back
Burning anger inside, anger anger inside

Answering back, speak your mind
No one dares, donât talk back

A nation of puppets, do as weâre told
Pulling our strings to make us work

Answering back, speak your mind
No one dares, donât talk back

Itâs time to say enough is enough
To make a stand, to fight back

Answering back, speak your mind
No one dares, donât talk back

Keeping all inside, never dare to talk back
Burning anger inside, anger anger inside

Answering back, speak your mind
No one dares, donât talk back
