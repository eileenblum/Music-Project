[performed by Hellkrusher]The thunder of the engines
Gets closer and closer
The bomb doors open
To reveal their death

The bombs start dropping
People start running
Maimed bodies lie
Trampled under foot

The thunder of the engines 
Is now no more
Just shadows in the distance
But theyâll be back for more
