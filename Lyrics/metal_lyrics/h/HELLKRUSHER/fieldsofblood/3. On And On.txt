Strung up carcasses
Line the room
Blood drenched floor
Stench of death

On and on the murder goes
No one stops it and no one cares

Hacked up bodies
Stripped of skin
Insides gutted
To make them clean

On and on the murder goes
No one stops it and no one cares

[Solo]

Once living creature
Condemned to death
An innocent young animal
That once walked free

On and on the murder goes
No one stops it and no one cares
