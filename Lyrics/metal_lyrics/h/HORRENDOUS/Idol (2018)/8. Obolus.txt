You dig my grave
You run me through
Show me my demons
My angels, my muse
The frayed ends of a dream
Tied in a noose
Show me my saviors
My spectres, my devils, my dues

At the rainbow's end
What use are promises of Eden
To begin anew
When hope is just another poisoned fruit?

And can you bear to wear the death mask again?
Dry your eyes, Sisyphus, and shoulder your burden
And in the end, they'll measure your worth
By how much you've been broken
And give you the stone to roll again

And your final reward
An obolus upon your lips
For Charon's passage to the shore

Is it hubris to ask for more
When the feast is at its end
And the lights have dimmed?

In this miserable play
This grand mockery
Where all is illusory
In this absence pf light
I'll burn in effigy

I won't take another bow

To seek the face of life
To pull the veil away
To face annihilation
And tear the masters from their gilded gates
