Itâs a blinding, pervasive light
Today the sunrise is vermillion
I will drink the tears of the stars
Fill me with flames, shortcircuit my neurons

I probe the intangible spectra
Whisper truths to the ones who canât speak
Climb out from the stifling void
Emerge the rising sons of neptune

But the path is perilous
Beware the sirenâs call, it churns and swells
A respite to distract from the trail, but...

The nepenthe...it kills

Cast it aside
It allures, but the concoction is sinister
You shall not trespass at the gates of gods

Avert our wanton eyes, preclude our inquiries
With hollow stimulation and promises of eternity
Reject the nepenthe
Follow the serpentine vermillion to the brink of existence
