The sleeper awakens
To an estranged abode

Aeons ensconced in Cimmerian shade
A cherub defrocked unearths true grace

Shield my eyes from the light
Innocent retinas deserve no such torture
It derives from hominid hands
The greatest sin of all; a ruse for feeble minds

We are the Philosophers of Grime
Sovereigns of creation, 
Eternity ornate
Tending threads with the Fates

Fuck all the angels
Heaven torn down
By frail convictions 
Mercy begged through twisted benedictions

Not indiscriminate malevolence
But reasonâs new dawn
Stripped of ancient sins
We flirt with the shroud of infinity

Tempting utopia
We bend not but with the cosmic winds
We are sons of the stars

To each, divinity; unfathomable acuity
The only darkness, a freedom from malicious light
Oracles of the vermillion sunrise
