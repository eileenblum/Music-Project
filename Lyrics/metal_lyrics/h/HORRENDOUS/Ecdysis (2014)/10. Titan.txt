Ascending his tower
Adorned in terminal necklace
Tattered fibers
A most prized jewel

Dominion over my body
Sovereignty
Release me from this weary vessel
Carry me home

Lull me to sleep
Grant me reprieve 

As the sun sets
A tainted moon riseth
Gleaming on stone
Asphyxiated angel
Titanâs winds blow
Swept away...
