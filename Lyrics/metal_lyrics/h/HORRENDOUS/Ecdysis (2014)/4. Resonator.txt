I do not fear death
Inverted reality; backwards birth
A mirror world hidden from view
Antithesis of real

My body atrophies
Blood, broth of bone

Sadistic. Nihilistic. Euphoria.
Antitheist. Omnipotent. Intoxication. 

Sinew drips from foundation
Condensation into orbit

Distorted windows
Labyrinthine dreams
Swept by winds
Coagulations and collisions with stars
Passage of time
To dust; we are angels

Resonating exaltation of woe
Celestial sorrows obey
So amuses the great tyrant
Time laughs
