Mausoleum Mind
Fear Divine
Fatal dance with space and time
A Breeding ground
Where demons and deities multiply
Oppressed by hollow threats
That tongues of flame lick the jaws of death
A Judas Kiss
With fire and brimstone on its breath
Bow to the holy one
Benevolence bleeding from his eyes
Teach me how to suffer
Teach me how to die
Iâll slough off my skin
Let slavery absolve me of my sin
Relinquish my thoughts in the eyes of the night
Fill me with your burning light
Consume my mind
Cleanse me
Make me divine
I feel the devil inside
Immolate me
Iâm purified
Haunted by the holy ghost
Bastard son
Unholy host
Asphyxia in incense smoke
A feast for the damned
Feel the blood drip down your throat

Weeping Relic
Pleading Death
Father
Holy terror
Endless suffering
