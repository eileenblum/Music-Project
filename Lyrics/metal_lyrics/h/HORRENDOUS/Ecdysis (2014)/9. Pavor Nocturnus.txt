Starless void
Eternal night
Pierce the shroud of space and time

Voyagers
Oneiric lands
Tip the hourglass again

To be adrift in the astral sea
Sub-atomic dis-assembly
Scatter me
Consciousness evolved
Inter-stellar entity

Event Horizon
Re-absorbed into the black
Kaleidoscopic light
Universal collapse

A cosmic gestation
Ego disintegration
The senses awaken
Child of the stars

Astral projection
Synaptic connection
A state of perfection
Orgastic oblivion

Our universe, a grain of sand
A blood borne cell 
In capillarian networks
Feeding the all
We are conduits of experience
Extensions of thought 
From cosmic minds
Uncover the essence of life

We fade away
Dissolve into dust
Galactic detritus
Frozen in time

Ashes in the wind
A memory forgotten

Bursts of light
Blinded by sight 
We are nothing

We are Nothing
