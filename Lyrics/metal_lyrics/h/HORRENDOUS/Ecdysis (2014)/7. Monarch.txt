When the darkness has swallowed the light
And the hour of the witch is at hand
When my sigil streaks across the sky
By the light of the moon, I'll descend to the throne and take my command

Never deign to bow
Deities and decrees  
I Disavow
I lay down my soul at the altar of sin

I won't fail
I am my own God
Eternity prevailed

Disappear through the dark...

Monarch at the gates of hell
All hail the usurper

Demons greet me
A swirling cacophony
Beat infernal wings
Princess of hell
Obsequious offerings
Writhe in ecstasy

A choir of the damned
Chant my name
Hymns rise upon the flames
In ancient tongues
With strength I burn
Extinguish the sun

Awaken dormant seed
Prophetic mystery 
Summon powers unto me

The monarch
I rise
To shake the mantle of heaven
