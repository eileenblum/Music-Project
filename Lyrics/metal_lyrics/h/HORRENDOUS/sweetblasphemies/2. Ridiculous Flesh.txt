Bastardized by the flesh
Captive souls cannot transcend
The supremacy of instinct
Wallow in putridity
The infinite stretch of the mind
An essence encased in dust
Cannot sever but we must
This flesh is ridiculous
Carnality eviscerates
Plagues the soul with waste
This flesh is ridiculous
