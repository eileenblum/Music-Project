Dripping from a solar flare
Molten time lubricates existence
Clouds of neurons
Dendrites impregnate the earth
Flesh is spawned
Decrepit art of mutilation
A cyclic universe
Empties its bowels
Beyond endless seas of time
Lost in translation of being
The continuum weaves
With tentacles so pure
A wretched rebirth
Cloaked in pain
Limbs contorted with grotesque symmetry
Spiraling to their final form
Amidst eternity, fertility manifest
Putrid rebirth
