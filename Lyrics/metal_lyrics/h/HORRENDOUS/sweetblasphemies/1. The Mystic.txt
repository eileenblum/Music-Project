Merlin the Mystic, he guards ten thousands graves
Bribe him with a flask but don't give up your name
Sitting at the gates in the middle of the night
Witching hour, corpse arise, when the time is right
Scheming 'neath the moon
Casting wicked spells
Punish hearts so dark
Drag them into hell
Breathed its rancid stench
Reject humanity
Summon dead's return
Each day waits for
Zombies seeking out the flesh of humans
Zombies ripping up the flesh
Abandoned the world, a cemetery home
Solitude so pure, yet cold and so alone
Merlin weeps
