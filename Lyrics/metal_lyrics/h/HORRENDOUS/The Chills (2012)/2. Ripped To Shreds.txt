Corpses line the tomb yard in a fading sun's dying light
A bloody rain cleanses their innards, a feast upon the fruitful flesh of life

Ripped to shreds

A rotting hand emerges from the grave, bathed in dirt and sweet decay
To tear the limbs from the torso of all who pulse with the putrid form called life

Reality fragments, as the beginning becomes the end
And life, a festering memory, defeated by carnal appetite

Moonlight, bloody mist, descending fog, ensuing bliss

Ripped to shreds... ripped to shreds... ripped to shreds... shreds of flesh...
