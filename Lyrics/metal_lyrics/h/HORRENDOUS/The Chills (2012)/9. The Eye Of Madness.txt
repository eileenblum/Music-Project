An insane moon casts its
gaze upon a strange sea
I travel with the stars; I'm not alone
Led by dark winds, awakened after eons
Fucked by pestilence, my wings are forever
I reach the horizon

Reabsorbed into corridors
Staring into the eye of madness
A tortured blink aggravates my brainstem
Dreams of perversion, lost in the
corrdors of blasphemy
Seeping from the column cracks,
creatures from beyond
Arriving at a twisted cross

Baphomet
Vomiting
In Ecstasy

Anointed with bile,
the tortured scream in delight

Writhing in terror, a crucified
dove spills its entrails
Falling to the earth in a wet caress
on the backs of serpents
I am become death, purveyor of unholy sins
The door seals shut, forever locked 
in eternal slumber
I am the rotten surface, the decaying flesh
Lost in the halls, obscured by absurdity
Death is a warm embrace
