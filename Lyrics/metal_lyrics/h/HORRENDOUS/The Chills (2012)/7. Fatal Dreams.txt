In the breath of the night
Filled with the spirits of the dark
Come to me in a dreams
And unmask the putridities of being

Now I see across oblivion
I can read the frequencies

But can barely speak of the revelations
Grotesque beyond measure

Famines of reason and incongruent consequence
Plague the mockery of existence that is life
Dreams so fatal melt the psyche
As insanity takes its toll

Fatal dreams show me the way
I can barely escape the grip
Of reality's truth; treacherous, unspeakable
Puppets in the slaughter of logic

Fatal dreams, hold me close
Drag me from the light
Plunge me into the depths
Of truth and eternal night
