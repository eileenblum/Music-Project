In rapid decay
I revel in filth
Feeding on ruin
Flesh dictates my will

I worship rotting flesh
Desctruction of the corporeal

One foot in the grave
Euphoric I toil
Slandering the pristine
I'm sucked into soil

Sinister perversion
Taste my rancid flesh
Revile my name
So that you ma live again

Sinister perversion
Taste my rancid flesh
Feast upon my marrow

Gargle my sour blood
Revile my name
So that you may live again

When the winter comes
Nature revels in rot
And the chills dance upon my timid spine
I'll crawl into the ground
Like a worm lusting for decay
Iam one with the earth
In a bed of maggots I yearn
for slumber forlorn
