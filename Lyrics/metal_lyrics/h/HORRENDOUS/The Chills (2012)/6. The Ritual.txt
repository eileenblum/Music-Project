Incantations rise from shrouded 
faces in the night
As plumes of smoke dance
in candelabra's light
It is time

Beneath the mournful shadows of the trees
a haze of incense swirls
and casts its stench upon the breeze
Rising to the sky with chants
of praise and ecstasy
The Ritual has begun

Bring forth the cursed knife
and raise the ancient key on high 
Touch not its gilded surface
for it contains the blood of christ

Now spill the blood upon the earth
within the master's evil sign
and plunge the knife into the star of
diabolical design

Gaze in wonder as it drinks 
our sanguinary offering
Hear the infernal wail as
the master begins to rise
swelling up from festering slime,
sinews crack and snap together,
tendons entwine
a putrid rebirth of unholiest kind

Feel the blistering heat emitting
from the wretched flames
frothing forth the night
as the master usurps the ancient key
with a chilling shriek of pure delight

Bow your heads and praise his name
The master has returned again

Sanguinary ritual.
Sanguinary rites.
