The sky if falling, it's vomiting fire
over the mournful earth
Mekk scour the land in search of sanctuary
Seven decades of pestilence
haunt the living detrtus
Can no one escape the mark of the beast?

Rivers overflow with sorrow as
humanity drowns in war
Man feasts upon his brother's demise
All monuments to triumph 
have been destroyed
Have we all paid tribute to the beast?

"Surely this is the end"
Cried the confessor
"Perhaps the seals have been broken,
I can hear the horns of the angels blaze" 
They streak across the deepest sunset

He cradled his holy book
His last breath exhausted in despair
Under the poisonous embers
of the final sun
And darkness descended

Eons haven't witnessed a night so cold
Pierces the skin, chills the veins
Hearts of the believers are frozen
Under a frigid, limitless darkness

Survivors emerged from hiding
to find a black earth
Trembling with betrayal, they indict, 
"He never came!"
Weary bodies huddle in futility
Clinging to life (like decaying parasites)
As death walks the land
Victim to...

The frigid silence of eternity
Disturbed by moans of despair
If you listen close
You can almost hear the
cackling of the beast
On the cusp of desolate winds
