Know thyself
Mirror's gaze
Deceiver, beguiler
Hypnotic haze

I'm called by many names
Personality oscillates
A tired masquerade
Decay, renew, derange

Eyes alien
Shedding skin
Self-constructing edifice
Imprisonment
Twist me into form
I'm your fantasy unfurled
Trapped in parallel worlds

Am I essence or a shallow sum of actions?
Spirit or form?
As memory recedes, I am unborn

A Hollow husk
Clothed in strange attire
A Projection of need, a projection of desire

The mirror's gaze
Reflect on me

Escape
In solitude
Blossom into worlds unknown
Beyond the mirror's gaze
Communion with the soul
I am blissfully alone
