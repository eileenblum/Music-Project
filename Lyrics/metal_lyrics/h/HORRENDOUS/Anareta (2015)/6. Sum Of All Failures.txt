Ossified
A message scrawled in stone
Paths etched into the earth
We tread as ghosts

Awakened only by desire
A fleeting flame that flickers to nothing

Stagnation is happiness
Putrefaction is bliss
I open not my soul
Inertia claims my bones

In false content we're borne in painless sleep
Decaying dreams beget deranged realities

Take your place as trestles in your earthen tombs
Follow false prophets to sate your spiritual wounds
Deceive and delude your material shell
Chase desire into the void, into hell

I'll choose to be a destroyer of worlds
A flesh-bound deity

Burn across the sky
Triumphant trumpets resound
Ascend in hideous light
Magnificent
Onward to eternity
