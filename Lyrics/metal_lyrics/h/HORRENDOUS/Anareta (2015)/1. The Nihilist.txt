I am every man
Torn from the womb
Bathed in copious light
Marched to the staccato beat
Reared artificially
Yet a wolf lies beneath this gown
If you peer down
Corners of the heart conspire
Instinctual, cryptic desires

Swallowed by institution
Preempt our inheritance
While watchful eyes record each footstep
Confer benevolent bondage

But I dare not cede
I will curse the sun
I am one
Curse the sun

I am ancient dust
I am cerebral lust

Condense me
Compress me into solid matter
Molecules harbor
Obscured histories

I am every man
I am everything
I am nothing
I am
I am not
