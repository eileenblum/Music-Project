Tympanic resonations
Aural incantations
We are acolytes
With seductive cacophony we proselytize
And converge on this eve

A feast for kindred souls
Earthly burdens denied
A brotherhood to cultivate the coming light

Subterranean chamber
Tones reverberate
Eyes open wide
Anointing of the stranger
Receive the sick communion

Congealing chaos
Condense miasmic mist
Alchemical reconstruction
Become leviathan
In a sea of churning flesh
The vermillion oscillates

Conjoined, we are strong
We are become one
The derelict, sons of death
Arise to claim the dawn

The conqueror worm consuming all
Destroy pantheons
Crushing pillars of civility
All powerful, almighty
Primordial seed
Forging a new reality
Embrace the burning dawn in me
