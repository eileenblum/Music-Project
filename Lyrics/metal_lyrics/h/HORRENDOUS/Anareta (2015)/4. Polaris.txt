Burning star haunts the night
No respite in darkness
Recurring dreams never subside
Night after night

Nocturnal apparitions
Buried dreams
Obfuscation or reality?
Unveil yourself to me

I plunge into velvet night
Polaris beckons
Sidereal guide
What schemes are borne
Upon your fleeting dreams?
In your labyrinthine designs?

Awaken dormant entity
Tap the wellspring of memory
Unlived aeons spiral into me

A suzerain in realms alien
Colors unseen, cascading light blossoming through decay
Deep peace, steeped in worlds profound
But as the sun descends, in whispered tongue my name resounds

Polaris calls me home again
Corporeal imprisonment
Damned in flesh, the nightmare never ends

Polaris lead me from despair
Release this earthly prisoner
Bound by bone in somnolent reverie

Each night I scan the bleak horizon
A silent star never seen again
And in my dreams Polaris gleams
But I wake in oblivion
