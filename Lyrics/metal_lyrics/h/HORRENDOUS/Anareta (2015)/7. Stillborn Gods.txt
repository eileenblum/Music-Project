In the mist, moon-drenched
Time ticks with stillness
Languid ether

Steel and sinew, cartilage and chrome
An entity with endless gaze
Cold, vermillion eyes infinite stare
Materialized in shadow and torn from the veil

Emerge the thorned tree of suffering
His celestial burden
Screams echo off the solid forms that once flowed as fluid time
Abomination

Rivers of epoch, entire eras carved into inanimate flesh
Streaks of blood-red veins etched on a cruel landscape
Thrown into the throes of cosmic cessation

Steel and sinew, cartilage and chrome
An entity with endless gaze
Cold, vermillion eyes infinite stare
Materialized in shadow and torn from the veil

Our vermillion dream once breathed essence
We crafted the sun with an aura of hate
Setting the dunes ablaze
Moon-frosted by night

A stillborn god presides on an empty throne
Orchestrating jaws of nihilism

Teeth rip us from reality
Clamping, suffocating

Meaning projected onto a fabric of nothingness
Lost, our fragile dreaming of existence
