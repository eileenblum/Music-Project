it's getting colder inside
afraid I'm losing my sight
why am I tying this strap 
stuck it the same old trap

it's like a loop on my neck
can't keep the course on my track 
just stinging bite on my flesh 
the final glimpse before crash

it's overwhelming me
the voices from below
you cannot set me free
you cannot drain this flow

relapse into this routine
it's killing me from within
like all my nightmares came true 
I'm on my knees just like you

for sweet nothing I crave
all these years same old story 
just straight way to the grave 
on my paths of glory

it's overwhelming me
voice rises from below
you cannot set me free
you cannot drain this flow
