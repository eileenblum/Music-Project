the glass of mirror knows the truth 
don't hide emotions, keep them loose 
she's got the bomb with sparking fuse 
she needs a weapon she can use

she tries to spread through the universe 
that it's enough for her because
she knows that it will just get worse 
but her words coming out reversed

like a thousand of fireflies
can't bear the cold and turned to ice

she thinks it might be hard to show 
dissolved past screams in undertow
it filled her head, it's fading slowly 
her thoughts disarm her in this glow

a thousand of fireflies
they celebrate within her eyes

it lies inside her sacred shed
a memory she can't erase
I see a halo 'round her head
when tears are shining on her face

your cult is just a fallacy
above my head â an empty space
my nimbus shattered and debris
are leaving scratches on my face
