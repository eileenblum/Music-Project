behind the smoke that's rising from the ashes
I see explosions in the sky
inside the fog that trails with the distant flashes
behold the glittering of light

and it's so green
the shade I never knew
so warm between
the place is where I am
and place I'm going to

and it's so green, I've never seen a color such a bright 
I've never plunged into the depths like these
it feels so right, this moment of the night
that every human knows that it is really his

my thumb is scooping dark materia
and I don't know exactly where I am
I'm mesmerized, my wounds are slowly healing
I've overcome the mortal carcass of a man

I open up my eyes, I'm filling up my body with the fresh air 
it's hell or heaven or maybe even something in between 
but I no longer have to use my wheelchair
it's green outside, so green

âââ

remorseless weapon's aiming to my frail chest
but you will never ever see the hole it leaves
like stitches cover line from stomach to the breast 
it's glued with stardust I've collected from my knees

the sweet delirium that's reached its pinnacle in mind 
caressed my fingertips with such poetic bliss
with disillusionment of those who once were blind 
it's slipping into blackness of the hole it leaves

but every night each quite and peaceful sound -
familiar whisper in the radiance of tears
and drops that flood the bare surface of the ground 
surround the fragile edges of the hole it leaves
