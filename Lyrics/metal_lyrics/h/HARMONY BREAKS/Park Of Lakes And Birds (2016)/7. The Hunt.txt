charge your rifle, aim it higher 
we both hear the steps outside 
the air is filled with their desire 
to prevent what is not right
(as they think)

look at me and just be still 
you're one flash away from grace 
don't you worry, you won't feel 
drippings on your lovely lace
(caress your dress)

do as they say
don't hesitate
no time to wait

not an option to go back 
please retain this moment
life is yours and as I said -
execute my orders
(this time it's straight)

tiny cracks attract to sap 
mosquitoes made of metal
send them straight into my web 
like queen sends bees to petal 
(we're all food for powder)
