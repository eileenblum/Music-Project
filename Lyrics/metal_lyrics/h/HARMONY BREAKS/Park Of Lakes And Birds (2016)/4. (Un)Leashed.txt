a mouse in a maze 
crawling through days 
a spell of disease 
is shattering peace 

accept your fate 
it's not too late 
take off blindfold 
and reach for gold 

this labyrinth 
designed and built 
right in your head 
rams are forced-fed 

"So, for the second time, the Pharisees summoned the man who had been blind and said:
- Speak the truth before god. We know this fellow is a sinner.
- Whether or not he is a sinner, I do not know,- the man replied. - All I know is this: once I was blind and now I can see." *

once I was blind now I can see 
once I was blind now I can see 

infinite sleep 
the leash leads the sheep 
to the promised land 
while nailing your hand 

this labyrinth 
designed and built 
right in your head 
heart's filled with lead

[* taken from the new English Bible, John IX, 24-26]
