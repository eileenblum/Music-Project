my hands are shaking in this cold
I realize I'm growing older
I reach for something warm to hold
but arms are distant from your shoulders

I know that I might be so wrong
carrying the burden through this river
my past is blazing in this storm
the flash of lightnings gives me shivers

the breeze has brought me leaves of flowers 
the wind is raising them above
it's circling endlessly for hours
keeps fanning almost faded love
