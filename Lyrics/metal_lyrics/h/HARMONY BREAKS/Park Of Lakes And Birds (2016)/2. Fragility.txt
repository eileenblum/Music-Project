skies are burning in my eyes
a hundred reasons to stop these tries
there's no way, there's no chance
a hundred reasons to stop this dance

we're alone and no one's here
we've lost our trust and found a fear
in this world so full of lies
no one will believe your cries

the strings that attached to the muscles of face 
are stinging your eyes to knock out emotion 
capacity's holding a boundless ocean
sharp splinters erupt when the harmony breaks

it's as fragile as the light of a candle
as baby's dream collapsed in the cradle

no more lies and no more pain
I can not live my life this way
in your eyes I see black hole
countless times you've sold your soul

endless tries like an endless dance
still we have no fucking chance
in this world so full of hate
we can't escape this bitter fate

time has come and now I'm free
seems that's all so let it be
I've never been where I belong
it seems I ran too far from home

don't call my name I will not come
you know the damage has been done
in your world so full of shame
I know it always ends the same

the strings that attached to the muscles of face 
are stinging your eyes to knock out emotion 
capacity's holding a boundless ocean
sharp splinters erupt when the harmony breaks

it's as fragile as the light of a candle
as baby's dream collapsed in the cradle

sharp splinters erupt when the harmony breaks 
rise as the harmony breaks
rise as the harmony breaks
