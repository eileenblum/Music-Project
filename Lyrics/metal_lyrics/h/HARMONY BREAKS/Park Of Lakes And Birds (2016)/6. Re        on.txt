a venomous needle goes straight through your vein 
the barrier to never-ending pain
eternal inward struggle
you've failed this time and lost the battle

bleak pictures in your damaged brain
inside intoxicated mind it always rains
a sound of drops like whisper to your ears
close your eyes â unleash your fears

I'm the religion you've created
I'm the gasoline in you for hatred
I hide inside, I plant a seed
you will obey, I'm all you need

there is no hope inside this hell
can't break the chains and crash the cell
a journey through your fragmented sanity
bow to the god of your reality

the countdown has started and the collapse is set 
your sense of fake safety will turn to regret 
harmful games affect the core
you've failed again and lost the war

I'm the religion, I am hatred
empire disintegrated
I'm the religion, I am hated

I am your master and you're my slave
feed me and I'll go away
