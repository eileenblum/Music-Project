fascinated by this silence
echo's leading me astray
I am waiting for your guidance
here in limbo where I lay

filling up my lungs with smoke
I reach the void through cancer
it seems to me that I will choke 
before I find an answer

I've seen this stupid dream before 
an oasis in the desert
the park of lakes with golden shores 
and birds with rainbow feathers

you may find me slowly kneeling 
here in limbo where I hide
one idea that appeals to me
is the way that leads to light

my fireflies have gone astray 
they've reached the level of decay 
illuminating this abyss
they faded as forbidden bliss

but their tracks had left the mark 
obscurity gave birth to spark
and now it is a quenchless flame
it can't be banished, can't be tamed

it takes more time to realize
your mask betrayed by your own eyes 
the fear had dug a hole within
it can't be covered with the skin

inside I see the monolith
it's melting in my desert heat 
with every second of heartbeat
I am embracing this deceit

my fireflies have gone astray 
they've reached the level of decay 
illuminating this abyss
they faded as forbidden bliss

but their tracks had left the mark 
obscurity gave birth to spark
and now it is a quenchless flame 
it can't be banished, can't be tamed
