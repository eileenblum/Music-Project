the last piece of jigsaw is taking its place
with furious power it's smashing the canvas
the clarity shines through the seams on your face 
as rays of the light are suppressing the sadness

the beckoning tunes you are willingly follow
as bulky spindle begins gently reeling the tape 
the magnetic flux is encoded to sound
of creatures from heaven chanting psalm of escape

assemblage of feelings obtained in turmoil
is teasing your flesh with illusive foreplay
and beautiful flowers will ascend through soil 
embellishing place you were standing that day
