countless christian prayers etched in reverse
mask the stone walls of this decrepit church
in hooded black vestments the cult stands in rows
as goats blood is drunk from a large human skull
under an altar of naked dead bodies
a newly-born girl now is crucified
then strangled and offered as a sacrifice
with a sacramental oath to the dark lord
a pathway to the altar is
trodden through shattered stained glass
a young child's throat is cut to
provide blood for the black chalice
dilapidated missals bound in human skin
locking their most blessed gospel within
eaten are consecrated wafers of
menstrual blood and semen
buried in sin an eternal damnation
a pathway to the altar is
trodden through shattered stained glass
yet another throat is cut to
provide blood for the black chalice
scarred by an iron brand a sequence of six
while they are all feasting on raw human flesh
a sea of black candles burning surround
a pentagram circle chalked onto the ground
overcome with a possessed gaze from their eyes
pure evil emerges, rise
the king of hell takes human form
again in this mortal realm reborn
