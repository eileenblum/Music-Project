deep-seeded hatred
toward what is a mockery of a god
compels the blackest souls
to assure his demise
the purest vengeance swelling
from the deepest depths of hell
enshrouds this fetid earth
just as the moon shall blot out the sun
an infernal reverence
is the only option for mankind
now feast your mortal eyes
upon the devastation
what was will be
and what is will be no more
an infernal reverence
is the only option for mankind
now feast your mortal eyes
upon the devastation
justice shall reign
through the might of fang and claw
as it was in the beginning
it shall be once again
on a mountain of bones
you sit on a throne of blood
in the castle of suffering
hear me, o god of the abyss
your power is needed now
on this day of consummate darkness
now is the era of evil
dominate enslave and punish them
we summon thee forth
to fulfill the prophecy
of the age of fire
with the very fabric
of existence at your fingertips
impose your will
constrain the tools
which do yield defense for mortality
and empower me
only with the blackest of the black
lessons not learned in human blood
by man are soon forgotten
this is a day of reckoning
we summon thee forth
to fulfill the prophecy
of the age of fire
with the very fabric
of existence at your fingertips
impose your will
