insidious display of wrathfulness
that the dark one shall give
to the feeble parasitic human kind
an earthly genocide
merciless unending torturous
his power limitless
and without hesitation he will have
our souls within his grasp
a blinding flash shall illuminate the sky
unfurling a tidalwave of flames
consuming everything in sight
with synchronous destruction
of buildings man and wildlife
a sick manifestation of his might
human flesh disintegrates
an unequivocal suffering
presenting skeletal remains
of another soul which shall be claimed
you have become a servant of my legion
you will bow before me or face the highest
of torment this foul realm can offer
your nightmare will never end
vengeful father unhallowed be thy name
unto you i will bow in service for eternity
dark desires up from the depths you bring
now this human world is doomed once again
exalted one i feel you
flowing through me with hate
compelled with your intention
sedulous immortality
oh the horror
unknowing world
theres no escaping your extinction
a blinding flash shall illuminate the sky
unfurling a tidalwave of flames
consuming everything in sight
with synchronous destruction
of buildings man and wildlife
a sick manifestation of his might
