black torches fading
against the dead skies
shadows gather around
the black asylum of lies

midnight scenes shelter
abominations of light
obscure artifacts
produced by human fright

the freezing breath
on you neck whispers
of wolves gathering
around your flesh

swords fighting shadows
of time and dust assembled
in the void of night
brought to life

invisible vipers gather
in the durance of night
see their breath
hear their touch

lost in deep void
conjure your lurking fear
human mind summon as
distant voices near

arrow clad of night
piercing timid flesh
produced by mind
thrust into human mesh

beneath the gallows
we linger alone
and behind it all
dark silence roam
