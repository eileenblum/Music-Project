In an era of sickening good
He saw the future misfortune
For all he decieved their
Hypocratic saviour

But yet he failed to kill
The father of human sheep
With thorns and torture
Upon the cross a martyr awoke

Petty human conflict
Cant you see 
We all stand beside him
In his misery

The feeble minded followed
Kept sacred in weak mind
The time has come to
Decapitate their kind

As their dead shepard led
In the end none shall follow
None shall serve
Nor obey their commands hollow

Judas your time is yet again
To decieve and lie resurrected
You will stand before the dead
As his disciples lie corrected

Words will not suffice this
Time to redeem and preserve
Blood must be shed and his
Sheep from their folly led

This failiure of thousand years
Will never repeat
Human mind confirm your fears
See and feel the bitter defeat

Hail Judas
