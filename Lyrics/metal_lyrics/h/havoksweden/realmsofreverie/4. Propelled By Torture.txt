In censorship born
With pride and predjudice
Towards the unknown
And the forlorn

Raised and scorned became
A collector of bones
A soul attracted by the torn
Flesh mangled with stones

A ravenous hunger for impressions
Put in violent bloody expressions
Predatory hunger instinct
... until all humanâs extinct

What you have obscured
Has become real
Your feeble protection
Inflicting wounds beyond heal

Fascination obsession brutality
Skulls cracked open
Sexual tyranny satisfaction
Moral restraints broken

A ravenous hunger for impressions
Put in violent bloody expressions
Predatory hunger instinct
... until all humanâs extinct

Educated with hypocrisy
Infected from nurture
Grown up to become...
Propelled by Tortureeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
