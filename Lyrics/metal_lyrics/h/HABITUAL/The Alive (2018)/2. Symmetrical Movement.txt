I can see you're terrified in your eyes
You'll never make it out alive
In this endeavor
This is what it's all about
Make no exceptions
To enhance yourself

What is preventing you
From reaching the stars
And showing what you are
Just show
Me what living life is like
I'd never know
I'll never know
What is preventing you
From reaching the stars
And showing what you are
Just show
Me what living life is like
I'd never know
I'll never know

This makes no sense
This world makes no sense
And there's nothing you can do

Except wait
But not me

Contort reality
Gravity won't be my boundary
Face first into everything
Become what you want

What is said
It can't be taken back
So make your words count
In this context
What is said
It can't be taken back
So make your words count
In this context

What is preventing you
From reaching the stars
And showing what you are
Just show
Me what living life is like
I'd never know
I'll never know
What is preventing you
From reaching the stars
And showing what you are
Just show
Me what living life is like
I'd never know
I'll never know
