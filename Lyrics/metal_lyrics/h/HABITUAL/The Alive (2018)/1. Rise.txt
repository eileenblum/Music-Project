Rise
Above the ones who are doubting you
Rise
When everybody is counting on you
Rise
And seize the moment when your time arises
Rise
Above the ones who are doubting you
Rise
When everybody is counting on you

And seize the moment when your time arises
And seize the moment when your time arises

Keep feeling the pressure on top of me
Can't push this weight off top of me
Set to venture for the answers
Within this world

Go on with hope and faith alone
To discover the feeling of home

And seize the moment when your time arises
And seize the moment when your time arises
And seize the moment when your time arises

Rip the frustration out from under my skin
And it feels so good (I feel this way)
You're on top of the world
You can't stand the sight of me being happy(I feel this way)
Rip the frustration out from under my skin
And it feels so good (I feel this way)
You're on top of the world
You can't stand the sight of me being happy
