I've lost myself
And I plan to find my way back
All the distance climbed
Looking down on what is left

Trapped inside
I'm alive

These shattered pieces are glistening
I'll fix this mess that I feel within
I'll just keep trying and push through it all
No weary head but just keep standing tall

Putting forth the effort
Striving to the next obstacle
You can find the light
In this tunnel
That seems impossible to leave
Just lend me your hand
Lend me your hand

These shattered pieces are glistening
I'll fix this mess that I feel within
I'll just keep trying and push through it all
No weary head but just keep standing tall
Standing tall

Breathe it in, take it in
There's no going back
We are at the point of
No return

Breathe it in
Take it in
No return
