I've seen the heavens as they truly are
Wretched dishonesty forced through the handbook of abominations.

Several thousand years of perjury unveiled as cacophonous vomit spilling from erroneous mouths torn open by the conjurers
Lying naked in front of my eyes

How could this be, I've devoted my life to thee

Why can't I wake up from this preposterous dream

Paralysis begins to life, and as I open my eyes

The sirens begin to call my name

Come closer carnal one
Taste of this apple or we promise a life of pain
Become the squalid, disgusting pawn that you were born to be.

Rejoice in eternity!
Accept the offering of immortality
Accept the offering of immortality

Conjuring of Impurity

I'll slay the heavens and ensure their fall
Radiant butchery.
Disposed by the vessel of abominations
Single handedly slaughtered by the pawn of rapture
Broken necks, shattered bones used for adornment

Paraded through the fires of hell, hung high.
Entrails spilling down to the floor

As promised, the end of days befalls us

I've slain the heavens, I've answered the calls smothered in victory
Bow to the emperor of the broken existence
Conjuring of Impurity

Accept the offering of immortality
