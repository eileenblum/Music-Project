I sought evolution as I danced within the skin of anthropoid mortals,
collecting their exhausted souls.
Free from the chamber of skin I'd been imprisoned within.

Hell torn asunder!

I cannot bear to witness another moment of this wretched existence.
So by the power vested in the realm; damned to writhe in lashing fire.

I sought supremacy through a harvest of lustful creatures.
Implanting a sorrow seed in the populous ova.
Free from the chamber of skin I'd been imprisoned within.
An offering of light in exchange for a life of sin.

Granting damnation through carnage.
Composed into metaphysical form.
Reaping the simpleminded, miserable spawns.

I cannot bear to witness another moment of this wretched existence.
So by the power vested in the realm; damned to writhe in lashing fire.

Eternity with a purpose, the vital last soul obtained.
Great me majesty.
Psalms from angels of debauchery.

In death, granted majesty.
Mortality peeled from my cells.
Disconnected.
I've seen the great beyond.
Misconceiving.
Empty bleeding.
Soulless, seething.
Raped of life.
