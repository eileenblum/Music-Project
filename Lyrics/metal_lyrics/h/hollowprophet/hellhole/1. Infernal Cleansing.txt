Fissuring the encrustation of the sublunary world.
Malignant spirits come to life encrusted with the assignment of dragging man to its shallow grave.
Birthed with intentions to eradicate the waste that feeds off the Earth.
Shadowed land against blackened skies.
Blinded by the reflections of the embers of HELL.

The world's turning at the pace of death.
Shattered lives, pain for the rest.
Taken in by the hate for man, I am the end. The unholy plan.

Confiding in the darkness below.
Birthing the rapture.
Perpetual Infernal Cleansing.

I repent to thee, father please make them set me free.
How could you allow this blasphemy?
Thousands of innocents, mountains sculpted of demise.
Children begging for their lives.

The world's turning at the pace of death.
Shattered lives, pain for the rest.
Taken in by the hate for man, I am the end. The unholy plan.
The expurgation of creation.
Thy will be done.
The last words to a dying age of man.

I shall reach into the gaping chest of God's creation.

Collectively their hearts stop.

The last words to a dying age of man.

Atrocious. Maleficent. Nefarious. Repulsive.
Shattered lives, pain for the rest.
Humanity swallowed, alas.

Drag me down and let me burn forever.
Drag me down and let me burn forever.

Devoid of life, inhabitants swallowed by the bottomless pit of Hell.
Atrocious ones, malevolent human beings.
Repulsive fucking pigs!
