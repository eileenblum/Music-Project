Light turns to dark
Growing cold, oh so cold

As life is fading, we're growing cold
As life is fading, our fate unfolds
As life is fading, our purpose unknown
As life is fading, we're all alone
As life is fading, I'm growing cold
As life is fading, my fate unfolds
As life is fading, my purpose unknown
As life is fading, I'm all alone

Fire, turning black
As our fate unfolds
Our fate unfolds

As life is fading...

Grieve, a lifeless sphere
Now all alone, all alone

As life is fading...
