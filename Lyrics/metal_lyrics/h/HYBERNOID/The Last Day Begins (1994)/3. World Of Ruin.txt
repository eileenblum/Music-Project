The last day begins
With the rising of the sun
Our hands have tied a knot
Which cannot be undone
We have taken more
Then there was to give
Our mother now decides
Whether we shall live

We shall live [4x]

The cries of forgiveness
Now fall on deaf ears
Whats done is done
And no-one ever hears
Our sun is now setting
Never to return
Taken from this place
For nothing did we learn

Did we learn [4x]

The last day begins
With the rising of the sun [4x]
