After the fire a darkness will fall
Entombing all life that remains
Glacial formations swallowing the earth
Dawn of the final age

Ash in the sky... like a mass of black flies
Cut from the sun... the end has begun

Poisonous ash blocks out the sun
Choking its life giving rays
A veil of black cloud lowers from the skys
No oncore for everything dies

Ash in the sky... [4x]

Once fertile lands now desolate, dead
Smothered by a blanket of doom
The circle of time is nearly complete
Once unleashed it cannot forgive

Ash in the sky... [2x]
