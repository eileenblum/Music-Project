Earth blown cold, by final winds
Swept barron and bare, forever suffer
Our lights now gone
In darkness we're thrown
Beyond the horizon
Blackness has grown

Continual nights, of sorrow
Strive for life, then lay it to rest
Global sea, of frozen waste
Encased colossus, shielding the sun

Permafrost [8x]

From the sky it falls, forever it falls
Choking light, enveloping our world
Sleep now earth, in darkened age
Gone are days, crushed in snow wave
