This body, this body is not me
My slave, my slave to act as I command
Our time, our time takes it's toll
Flesh dies, and withers unlike the soul

Unchain my soul
Where shall I roam
Revery my goal
Reaching my soul

My body, my body must leave me now
And return, and return to earth
This mind, it is not flesh it cannot die
Where shall I go, where shall I roam

Unchain my soul...

This body, this body is not me
My slave, my slave to act as I command
Our time, our time takes it's toll
Flesh dies, and withers unlike the soul

Unchain my soul...

My body, my body must leave me now
And return, and return to earth
This mind, it is not flesh it cannot die
Where shall I go, where shall I roam

Unchain my soul...
