These hands hold souls in time
Each turn pulls lives once lost in line
These chimes ring down, down absurd
My sense now hangs on every word

Clocks ticking, hands turning, times
Moving, hours passing, thoughts drifting
Minds timing, lifes freedom, no more

Recall the age, ageless past
Minds penetrate future's cast
Our days pass into years
Each passing hour confirms my fears

Clocks ticking...

Our needs part light from dark
Flesh now cold has left its mark
Formally ordered raging borg
Forward moving manic horde

Clocks ticking...

Each passing hour confirms my fears
Our days pass into years
Minds penetrate future's cast
Recall the age, ageless past

Clocks ticking...
