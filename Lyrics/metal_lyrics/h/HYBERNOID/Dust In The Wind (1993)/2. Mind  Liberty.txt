The broken chains
The severed links
Between my effect
And my realisation

My input transformed
Received and distorted
Unstably react
In my new found dimension

Flesh of grey now free [4x]
Now free

Might I never return
From this altered place
Don't know what its like
To be anywhere but here

I exist in two places at once
I can see only one
When you see me in both
Unless, your also in my world

Flesh of grey now free [4x]
Now free
