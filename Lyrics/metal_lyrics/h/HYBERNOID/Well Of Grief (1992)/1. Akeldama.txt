Redemption our damnation
Emphasise our suffering
He strived to convert
Betray his own morality
Rapture in his damnation

Judas you die
Judas should die
Judas will die
Judas

Discard my teachings
Disclose for mutual gain
Your exposed cast judgement
Infinate in your rejection

Judas...

Bleed, you motherfucker
Judas bleed, you
Motherfucker

You must be out of your mind
You must be out of your depth

Judas...

Redemption betray me
Disclose with a kiss
Lead them to me
Riches for rejection

Judas...

Bleed...

Akeldama

Bleed...

You are out of your mind
You are out of your depth
Infinate is rejection

Judas...

Despair your rejection
Blood now stains
Your soul

Judas...
