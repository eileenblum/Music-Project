I hoped beyond all hope that time itself would end
Leave me in blessed agony, my morbid dreams to tend
Hide away, in ecstasy, inside my darkened room
In the arms of sweet despair, a never ending gloom

I hoped that pestilence had massacred this land
A legacy of hopelessness unto starving man
Left to my solitude to revel in my pain
The last bastion is exiled, exiled in my shame
Exiled in my shame

I hoped the holy ghost has last been exorcised
Cast adrift eternally in sick and feeble minds,
Left to his solitude in cruelly twisted chains
Hang him high, hang him in his chains
Chains

Broken hearts never heal,
Twisted bones poke through skin,
Unburied dead at ever turn
Feel the cancer burning within
Burning deep within
Burning

[Bridge:]
I hoped beyond all hope that time itself would end for me
Leave me in the hands of doom

[x2]
I hoped beyond all hope that time itself would end

[x2]
Broken hearts never heal

[Bridge:]
Pray to live or die
Despondency alive behind my eyes
Hybernoid, the last be destroyed
