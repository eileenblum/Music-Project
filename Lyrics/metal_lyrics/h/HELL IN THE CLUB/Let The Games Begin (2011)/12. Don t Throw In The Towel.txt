[Music by Andrea Buratto, Davide Moras, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Andrea Buratto]

In these days you're feeling broken down
Feels like the walls are closing in on you
In these days you're really out and down
you just want to feel alright

This is a song, it's just my way to say "believe in you"
This is a little thing to say "believe in what you do"
Come on free your fist to hit

[Chorus:]
Let's go now! Don't throw in the towel!
This is your round! Nobody rings your bell today
Wake up now! Don't run for cover!
Open your eyes, this is the time to shoot to kill

Hey, there is this kind of magic
in a dream that only you can see
When you think "there's no way out now"
let your dreams go some more

Listen to me my friend, you must react... it's a brand new day
listen to me my friend, don't care about what some people say
don't live or die that way

[Chorus]

There will always be someone who talks badly about you
Live how you want and do what you want!
Our life is like a concerto without previous rehearsals
Live intensely, laugh, sing, dance and let yourself go
before the lights go out... And the show ends...

This is a song, it's just my way to say "believe in you"
This is a little thing to say "believe in what you do"
Come on free your fist to hit

Let's go now! Don't throw in the towel!
This is your round! They won't ring your bell today!
