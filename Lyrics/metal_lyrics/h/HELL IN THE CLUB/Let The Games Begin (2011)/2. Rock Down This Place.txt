[Chorus:]
I won't take it
there is no evidence
so stop tekking me you are so fuckin' innocent
rock down the place and we'll be fine

I saw you in the middle of the crowd
you were partying hard and singing loud
and all I know, all I know, all I know your look is so deadly

After the show I wanna touch you
I wanna kiss you, I wanna hold you
and the night, the night won't last enough no!

after a bottle of J I feel ready to rock this goddamn place

[Chorus]

After a shot or two at your place
there is no doubt painted on your face
and your smile, your smile, your smile was oh so dirty

And all the filthy games you wanna play
after the first you're begging me to stay
and my hands, my hands, my hands re going deeper

the mirror is showing your naked behind on top of me

[Chorus]
