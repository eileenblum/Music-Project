[Music by Andrea Buratto, Davide Moras, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Andera Buratto]

I can feel the heat... it's so sweet
from my head to my feet
I need another dose of nicotine

Your eyes can kill me, but your mouth could save me
Your scent it shakes my mind, tonight I'm going crazy
You know I can't take my eyes off you
A game called... "can look, can't touch"

[Chorus:]
Follow me, follow me - please baby come with (me) somewhere
and commit a sin... and baby stop this nightmare
Follow me, follow me - forbidden fruit is bittersweet
I don't know why but now I want to eat

You're like a devil in disguise, girl!

Deep inside
I'm paralyzed
You can see it in my eyes
I'm going down... I die
Every time you pass me by

The way movin', the way you dancin'
The way you're shaking all your body's meant to haunt me
You know I can't take my eyes off you
But my hands will... never be free

[Chorus]

I shouldn't take you baby because I'm sure
I'll be heading straight for hell... but... well.... uh!

Your eyes can kill me, but your mouth could save me
I'm going crazy

You know I can't take my eyes off you
A game called... "can look, can't touch"

[Chorus 2x]
