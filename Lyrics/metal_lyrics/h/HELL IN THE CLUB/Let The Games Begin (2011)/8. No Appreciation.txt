[Music by Davide Moras, Andrea Buratto, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Davide Moras]

I see you coming in your Sunday dress
gotta feeling our meeting's gonna be a mess
As you start talking, I keep on walking
hoping my good star will keep me from...

...Tying a rope round your neck and
putting hundred scorpions under your skin
Break your fingers one by one
and feel the sound of your bones all night long

[Chorus 1:]
I don't need your appreciation
your disguise and your fuckin' celebration
I don't need your appreciation
I just need you to stay miles away from me

All you gave me last Xmas was a packet
C-c-c-c-covered with lies
Think once... or better think twice
next time there'll be no one to keep me from...

...setting your house on fire and
Throwing a punch right at your face
having private rock'n'roll with your girl
to feel the sound of her voice all night long

[Chorus 1 ]

[Chorus 2:]
I don't need your appreciation
the heavy weight of your fuckin' invitations
I don't need your appreciation
I just need you to stay miles away from me

What is cool is miles from you
I gotta tell you baby, I gotta tell you
You make me laugh, you make me cry
so please get away... from my eyes
I wanna see you run in march 3.5
I still smell the stench of your lies
You make me laugh, you make me cry
so please get away... from my eyes

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
