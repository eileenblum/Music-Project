[Music by Andrea Buratto, Davide Moras, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Andrea Buratto]

Strong emotions
when I can see my face inside your eyes...
from these lights on 'till the last line... my words upon your smile

I'll take you high tonight
I'll make you feel alright
jumping up and down dressed up like clowns side by side

[Chorus:]
I'm on my way now
take your wings and fly
and may the wind carry you to dance with the stars
oh, have a nice trip my friends, wherever you go
I hope your way takes you far
maybe one day we'll meet on the road

Oh, one day we'll meet on the road
Oh, yeah, maybe we'll meet on the road

A merry-go-round
from show to show
along your road, don't turn around
Another day, another night on the stage
a place that I call home

Now put out your soul
and hear the highway call
Go to sleep in a town
and wake up with the sounds of another one

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Now is the time to leave and turn the page
I want to live my life on stage and not die in a cage
and there's a world outside for you every day
I say come on, come on, come on! Come on take it.
Come on and take it now!

O,h have a nice trip my friends wherever you'll go
I hope your way takes you far away

[Chorus]

Oh, maybe we'll meet on the road
Oh, yeah, maybe we'll meet on the road
