[Music by Davide Moras, Andrea Buratto, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Davide Moras]

Do you remember when
I used to be your man?
I could just never believe it, I could just never believe it

The party was all over
and so the scream and shout
that was the first time we laid, the very first time we met, girl

The rain is pouring down on me - I can't close my eyes
Those days will never be back but in this moment I'm searching the bottom of my heart

[Chorus:]
For your smile, my feelings
all the things I don't wanna forget
The scent of your soft skin
all these memories are killing me since you're not here

I still remember when
you kissed for hours my skin
I can still feel your mouth now, I can still feel your mouth now

The times you held my hand and
looked into my eyes
You used to say you loved me, you would've done anything for me

The rain is pouring down on me - I can't close my eyes
Now that you're gone forever, I'm gonna find you in the bottom of my heart

[Chorus]

Pain - all the pain I'm feeling
Knowing that I'll never meet your glance anymore
I - I''m feeling like shit
I'll never see you,
neither in the arms of another man

[Bridge]

For your smile, my feelings
all the things I don't wanna forget

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
