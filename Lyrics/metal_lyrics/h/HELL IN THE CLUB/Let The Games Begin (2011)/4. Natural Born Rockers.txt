[Music by Andrea Buratto, Davide Moras, Andrea Piccardi, Federico Pennazzato; lyrics by Andrea Buratto]

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Everyone has got a different heart
Eagles in the sky, rats in the dark
with a million dirty or pretty stars inside

What am I? Where is the line?
Maybe I'm a fuckin' sinner, I'm a criminal
'Cause today a dream is like a sin

[Chorus 1:]
I don't know!... because I'm crazy!
I don't know what it's that shakes me
Across my mind, deep inside
Natural born rockers

[Chorus 2:]
I don't know! ...because I'm crazy!
Are you ready for this, baby?
Across my mid, deep inside... here for you!

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Can you feel the flame? It's like a game
Out of control... this is my train
Life's a journey, not a prison! Yeah!

What am I? Where is the line?
I'm a lover, I'm a clown and the killer's blade
creature of the wild generation

[Chorus 1]

I'm a ticket to your madness
A special way to kill your sadness
Across my mind, deep inside... here for you!

[Bridge]

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

I'm an atom bomb and not a man
I'm the fuckin' horns on a fuckin' hand
the joker's face in your card game, no... yes it's mine!

What am I? Where is the line?
I can be what you want... devil or angel
But my flavor... is always the same

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]

I'm a ticket to your madness
A special way to kill your sadness
Across my mind, deep inside... here for you!
