I can hear my whisper in this room so cold
I can hear my heartbeat that is knocking on the door
Rain upon this place, shadows dance with pain
Uh empty glasses, lipstick around
Some do remember, some do forget
Rain upon this place, rain inside of me

[Chorus]
Because I'm missing you, cry for you,
I feel lost without a reason why
So lemme close the door, turn off the lights
'Cause I'm missing you, cry for you
Now you sleep with angels in my mind
Because you're a star inside my night

Someday we'll meet again, don't cry for me
Here I am
Now that you are gone, I sing to you this song
Your flame still burns, here and everyday
'Cause angels never fade away

[Solo]

I wanna feel that you're still near, that you're still here
Cause sometimes I miss you
I wanna feel that you still smile, cause in the sky
Where I can see you shine
From there what do you see, can you hear
That I sing to you these words
Oh please now this song you hear is my gift for you
My gift for you

[Chorus]
Because I'm missing, you cry for you,
I feel lost without a reason why
So lemme close the door, turn off the lights
'Cause I'm missing you, cry for you
Now you sleep with angels in my mind
Because you're a star inside my night

In an empty dark place, when the light's already gone
I can talk to you again, now we're on this world
Well I know that you will be watching over me
FOREVER

[solo]

[Chorus]
Because I'm missing, you cry for you,
I feel lost without a reason why
So lemme close the door, turn off the lights
'Cause I'm missing you, cry for you
Now you sleep with angels in my mind
'Cause you're a star inside my night
