[Music by Davide Moras, Andrea Burato, Andrea Piccardi, Frederico Pennazzato; lyrics by Davide Moras]

Don't like it easy, and I'll never will
I never saw myself there standing still
A time for passion and a time for pain
none of the things I do will be in vain

Never, never will I change shape and leave you alone
Never, never will I swallow this stone

[Chorus:]
All the sins, the mistakes I am not gonna break
and I'll never turn my back, never turn my back now
I may have lost just a couple of fights
but I will win the war, and never turn my back - no more

The storm awakened, storm got me down
in this blue ocean they have made me drown
But even though they'll never disappear
the wounds have healed - now I have no fear
Never, never will I change shape and leave you alone
Never, never will I swallow this stone

[Chorus]

You make me feel like someone, you makeme feel
You make me feel like someone who's not gonne die alone

[Chorus]
