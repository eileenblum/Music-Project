Welcome to my special world, "no life" man
Welcome to my real emotions
Snoop around, listen in, why do you look at me?
What are you looking for?

You're living with a tendency, a terrible dependency
To say whatever comes to mind and take us all down
From your dirty little hiding place with your ugly poker face
Are you really sure anyone will care?

So come join my party
Be my guest and take it away!
Do you really want to try me, hate me?

Listen to me now motherfucker! Fuck your web generation!
Dumb vox populi: decadence of our kind
What are you looking for?

You've got a disease, so tell me, tell me, please, please
Do the words and ranting keep the symptoms at ease?
A confessional - filled with the irrational - it is unbelievable
Save me from your disgrace

So come join my party
Be my guest and take it away!
Do you really want to try me, hate me, bring me down?
So come join my party
Be my guest and take it away!
Do you really want to try me, hate me?

You think you're so important, that your silly opinions count
All your trolling and your verbal instability, get the fuck away from me!

So come join my party
Be my guest and take it away!
Do you really want to try me, hate me, bring me down?

Try me, hate me!
