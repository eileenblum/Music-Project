There is the hot girl, a wanna be model
There's the ugly one, who thinks she is delicious
There's a school girl, who wanna blow her teacher
The same people over and over again

There is a smart guy, a wanna be genius
The photographer, who thinks he won a prize
There's the office chief, a wanna be martyr
The same people over and over again

They all belong in a circus
that should have been shut down for good

And then there's "you and me", to think we see
are wild and beautiful, pure and different
You and me, our world is free
from all their hollowness, we are different from all.
The boring thing that they call life
A life that has already been lived by someone else

There is the poor kid, bullied by bastards
There's the big jerk, who thinks he's always right
(The) local band, who act like Motley Crue
The same people over and over again

The politician, he'd sell you for a dime
The musician, who couldn't write a rhyme
The follower, stalker, the greedy or the vain
The same individuals over again

They all belong in a circus
that should have been shut down for good

"Ladies and Gentlemen get your tickets now! The show is continuous.
It's never out, it's never over, it goes on all the time!
We told you we had living, breathing monstrosities.
They did not ask to be brought into the world, but into the world we came.
Come forward, come forward! Welcome to the freak show!"

They all belong in a circus. The sideshow of Life.
