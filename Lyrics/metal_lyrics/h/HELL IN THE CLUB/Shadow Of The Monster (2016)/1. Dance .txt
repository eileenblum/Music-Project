I wanna fly... back
to the future, back to the old days
When we were raised with vinyls, tapes and cassettes
I wanna roll... back
Roll back time a little and say goodbye
To all the fucked up crazy shit ov our time
And rest my soul
I wanna Dance dance to the top
Rock the night and never stop
Wanna make it all with you
I wanna dance dance to this sound
Rock this place down to the ground
Wanna live it all with you!
Oh, yeah!
The voice of Michael J. it saved our day
Music was our own way to get away
All the epic stuff we did, from right to wrong
No need for likes or tweets, here we dont belong
And here we go
I wanna dance dance to the top
Rock the night and never stop
Wanna make it all with you
I wanna dance dance to this sound
Rock this place down to the ground
Wanna live it all with you!
The masters of the universe
taught me all there is to know
Jason brought me to the lake
to attend his horror show
There was no Nightmare
without Freddy or without Pennywise
Ghosts were busted
Laura wrapped in plastic, Aliens from the sky
Big hair, loud rock, freedom and parties
We left our hearts in the 80's and 90's
Things moved forward and since then
we have been pulling through
But please let me live one night like we used to!
Dance like we dont care, a kind of magik fills the air
Wanna make it all with you
Oh, Dance we will never stop, we'll be rockin till we drop!
Yeah!
I wanna Dance dance to the top
Rock the night and never stop
Wanna make it all with you
I wanna dance dance to this sound
Rock this place down to the ground
Wanna live it all with you!
Oh Dance dance
Yeah!
