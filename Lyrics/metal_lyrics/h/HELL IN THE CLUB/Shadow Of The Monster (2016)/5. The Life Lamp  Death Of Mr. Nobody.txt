His poor weakened karma
Took wing and faded away. It's no longer here
(not been in the long time)
His whispered innocence, his missing self defense
Made him pleasing for the wolves
He smokes a cigarette now
He thinks of the time he wasted
Trying to be a different man... for them...
He turns his back, sits tight, all In black
waiting to fall down just like a heart attack
He wants to fade away

Oh why? There is something inside. In his head, so bad,
that is hurting and no one really cares to know
The life &amp; death of Mr. Nobody
Oh why? There is something inside. In his head,
so sad, that is hurting and nobody really cares.
The life &amp; death of Mr. Nobody

He's been living his life always holding a knife...
aimed at his own veins
never hoped for heaven he knew this was the truth
Sensibility. His worst enemy
A beautiful child. A sad destiny
Yeah he is still living in a bubble so strong and
yet so easy to break, so easy to break
He turns his back, sits tight, all in black
waiting to fall down just like a heart attack
He faded away... this time he faded away

I throw my hands on him, throw my hands on him
He's so cold like a flower that did not even care to grow
The life &amp; death of Mr. Nobody

It hadn't been for all the malice in this world
He could have blossomed like the purest of roses
Now he is no more...

Oh why? There is something inside. In his head,
he always tried to change for you all but you never
understood his wonderful spirit and soul... Mr. Nobody
Oh why? There is something inside. In his head,
so sad, that is hurting and nobody really cares.
The life &amp; death of Mr. Nobody
