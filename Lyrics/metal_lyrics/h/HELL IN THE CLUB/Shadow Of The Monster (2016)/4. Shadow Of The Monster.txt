Uh
Yeahh yeaaah yea
Shape-Change, King of Strange
I dwell in the shadow of the monster
A gun to the head, a knife in the back
Beware! of the creature in black
Mind control, Monster show
together I walk with the Devil!
Teaching me daily the art of disguise
My dear master of compromise
The shadow is growing in me!
(Growin' in me)
The monster is now eating me!
Its a Curse, its a Curse
Day by day its getting worse
Im living in the shadow of the monster
Like a bird, without wings
Im a puppet on a string and
Living in the Shadow of the Monster in Me!
Foul, Dark, Carnasaur
Eating my flesh from the inside
Offerings for the devourer of minds
a fictional version of our human kind
Blood, Shed, Here we go
I feel like living in a freak show!
Destined to act in an infinite play
where all of the characters I do Portray
The shadow is growing in me!
(growin' in me)
The monster is now eating Me!! yeaah!
(the monster is now eating me)
Its a Curse, its a Curse
Day by day its getting worse
Im living in the shadow of the monster
Like a bird, without wings
Im a puppet on a string and
Living in the Shadow of the Monster in Me!
And it feels alright
To embrace the fright
The horror and disdain are just part of this game yeah
No more lashes, no more strings
I can now get back my wings
And be in full control of myself and what life, brings!
The shadow is growing in me!
Growing in Me
The Monster is now Eating Me!
Its a curse, its a curse
and by day its getting worse
Im living in the shadow of a monster
Its a Curse! Its a Curse!
And by day its getting worse
Im living in the shadow of the monster
Like a bird, without wings
Im a puppet on a string
Im Living in the Shadow of the Monster in Me! In Me!
Oooh In Me!
