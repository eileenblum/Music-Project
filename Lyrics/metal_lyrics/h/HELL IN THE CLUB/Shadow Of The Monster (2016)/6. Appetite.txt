Somewhere there's someone like me
Living like a gipsy in a fairytale
Somewhere around the world
Dreaming something, feeling passion, singing songs

Oh it's like an endless journey
Oh it's like falling in Love
Oh it's like a hurricane inside of me
Flowers need rain, I just need this

Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Tonight I break the chains
Oh oh oh oh oh! With a dream I fly
Take it to the limit now! Carry on carry on!
I know my friends you know my appetite

When you need love, when you need rage
It's a way to open your cage
When emotions are so strong
Try to find the notes to write a special song
The stage is like dope to me
It's all I've got and it's a cure for my disease

Oh it's like an endless journey
Oh it's like falling in Love
Oh it's like a hurricane inside of me
Flowers need rain, I just need this

Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Tonight I break the chains
Oh oh oh oh oh! With a dream I fly
Take it to the limit now! Carry on carry on!
I know my friends you know my appetite

I wanna get high every day and night
I'm addicted to this funny paradise
Take it to the limit now! Carry on carry on
This is where I do belong

Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Tonight I break the chains
Oh oh oh oh oh! With a dream I fly
Take it to the limit now! Carry on carry on!
I know my friends you know my appetite
