I don't know what to write about
I don't know what this song is all about
I could talk about the million times
I was trashed by all my best friends in life...

I could talk about the good old times
When my parents used to get me all those toys
When my brother used to show me
All of the rock 'n' roll bands play on TV

They asked me to write...
They asked me to write, they asked me to write
A new song for the outcast but today I don't feel like thinking
They asked me to write, they asked me to write
A new song for the outcast but today I decided to write
An acoustic punk song, an acoustic punk song
I feel like shouting it around to the world and here I go
An acoustic punk song, an acoustic punk song
I feel like shouting it around to the world and here I go

I hope this song will take me to Japan
I'll take a flight, not the same old broken van
I could talk about the million times
I was stuck in the middle of the highway
I could talk about the things I love
My horror movies or the books I'm so fond of
I could talk about my girlfriend,
Now she's in the next room singing like no tomorrow

They asked me to write...
They asked me to write, they asked me to write
A new song for the outcast but today I don't feel like thinking
They asked me to write, they asked me to write
A new song for the outcast but today I decided to write
An acoustic punk song, an acoustic punk song
I feel like shouting it around to the world and here I go
An acoustic punk song, an acoustic punk song
I feel like shouting it around to the world and here I go

There are many ways to end a song
Even if you don't know where you started from
I could talk about the million times I was stuck in the middle of a song-line...
