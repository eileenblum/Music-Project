Oh, Yeah
Yeah yeah, Huh
Uh, yeah
In the the midnight hour, with my super powers
I wanna burn it all with fire, Fire!
And for all the sadness and my glimpse of madness
I have decided to get rid of all the darkness
For all the smiles
I have been losing along my road
(Long my road)
I cross my heart and make a wish
and laugh 'till i have breath in my lungs
I want to smile tonight!
I want to take it easier, for the rest of my life
I want to enjoy the ride!
Yeah and live it easier, like a star i shine bright! Yeah!
Yeah yeah huuhhuh
Ah!
Ooh, With the negativity, you've been spitting over me
I have been building my own castle, Castle!
No illusions, no secret doors
I dont know what i was waiting for
I will lock myself up leaving you to your disaster
For all the smiles
I have been losing along my road
(Along my road)
I cross my heart and make a wish
and laugh 'till i have breath in my lungs
I want to smile tonight!
I want to take it easier, for the rest of my life
I want to enjoy the ride!
Yeah and live it easier, like a star i shine bright!
I want to smile tonight!
I want to take it easier, for the rest of my life
I want to enjoy the ride!
Yeah and live it easier, like a star i shine bright
I cant stop messin' with the fire inside
I will smile smile smile, but if needed i'll still kick you
Down down down where you usually hide
I still got my attitude, I'll never let you cut through
For all the smile, Ohh woah ohhh
Woah woahh ohhh ahh, I
I wanna smile... wanna smile...!
Woahhh!
I want to enjoy the ride!
Yeah and live it easier, like a star i shine bright!
I want to smile tonight!
I want to take it easier, for the rest of my life
I want to enjoy the ride!
Yeah and live it easier, like a star i shine bright!
Yeahh!
Ah, Enjoy the ride!! Yeah!
