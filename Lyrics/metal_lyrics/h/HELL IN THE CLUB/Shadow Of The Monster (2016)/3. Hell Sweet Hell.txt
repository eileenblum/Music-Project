Uh huh Oh  Oh I like it Auh Yeah yeaah Auh
Here we are, here we stand
Face to face with a band
Heart in hand together 'till the end
Ready for the rock show
Ready to burn
Ready for this kind of love
Music is a woman
Music is desire
Magic in us all baby I'm on fire
We are one!
Million faces and one soul!
My friends, this is our feeling
that we get from nothing else
A place like home
We are a family
Horns up!
There aint nothing in this world
better than this energy
We rock this place, a smile upon our face
(Hell Sweet Hell)
With the Sun
With the Stars
We need only loud guitars
Beers in hand, union, crowd and band
Ready for this party
Ready to hell
Raise your fuckin' glass
Dinner with the Devil
Carnival of Dreams
Now the place is hot, stand up and scream
We are one!
Million faces and one Soul!
My friends, this is our feeling
that we get from nothing else
A place like home
We are a family
Horns up!
There aint nothing in this world
better than this energy
We rock this place, a smile upon our face
(Hell Sweet Hell)
Here we Go!
There is nothing like it
to sing like you dont care
To get the best of feelings
from notes that fill the air
Nothing can go wrong if we live it like a band
One for all and all for one
This is our Hell!
My friends, this is our feeling
that we get from nothing else
A place like home
We are a family
Horns up!
There aint nothing in this world
better than this energy
We rock this place, a smile upon our face
My friends, this is our feeling
that we get from nothing else
A place like home
We are a family
Horns up!
There aint nothing in this world
better than this energy
We rock this place, a smile upon our face
Hell Sweet Hell Yeeah
(Hey! Ho!)
(Here we go!)
(This is our Rock and roll!)
(Hands up in the air!)
(Sing this song like you dont care!)
(Like a Wrecking ball, We will party till we fall!)
(Fire! Fire!)
(In the hole!)
(Hell sweet hell our heart and soul!)
