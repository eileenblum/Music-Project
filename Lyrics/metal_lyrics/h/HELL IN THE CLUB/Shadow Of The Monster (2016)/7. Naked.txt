I want to touch your skin
kiss your lips still with the taste of wine
I need all your movements
hear your breath please free our minds
Crazy angel shake for me tonight till the morning lights
Naked, close to me... now nothing to surround us

Send me to heaven and then take me down to hell

No fear no wall baby
Sweet or low, fast or slow
Dance with me, talk to me
We are lost inside of pleasure

I got sinful desires, baby I can take you higher
Now look at my face, every moment, every place
We can do everything, we can do it in every way
Baby please don't stop these hands

Send me to heaven and then take me down to hell

No fear no wall baby
Sweet or low, fast or slow
Dance with me, talk to me
We are lost inside of pleasure

No fear no wall baby
Sweet or low, fast or slow
Dance with me, talk to me

No fear no wall baby
Sweet or low, fast or slow
Dance with me, talk to me
We are lost inside of pleasure
