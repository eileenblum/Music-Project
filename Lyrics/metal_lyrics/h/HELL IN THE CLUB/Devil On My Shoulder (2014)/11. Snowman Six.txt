Paris, I am an invisible, your toxic host
Come down with me, down to Place des FÃªtes and you will see...

...That I'm a... Devil dealing my own ticket to hell
Fighting for the streets where I dream and dwell
And I'm an... Honest motherfucker working for the law
With a chandelier filled with snow

And tonight I wanna set this place on fire in flames!

Fires to the left, fires to the right, this is gonna be a hell of a night
Singing HELL YEAH! - It beats like a kick drum
HELL YEAH! My heart is beating like a kick drum
Fires from above, fires from below, this is gonna be a hell of a snow
Singing HELL YEAH! - It beats like a kick drum
HELL YEAH! My heart is beating like a kick drum

Hey you, in the daylight I'm your sheriff but at night time you'll see that I'm a...
One of a kind Mr. Robin Hood motherfucker, I'm your angel in disguise

And tonight I wanna set this place on fire in flames!

Fires to the left, fires to the right, this is gonna be a hell of a night
Singing HELL YEAH! - It beats like a kick drum
HELL YEAH! My heart is beating like a kick drum
Fires from above, fires from below, this is gonna be a hell of a snow
Singing HELL YEAH! - It beats like a kick drum
HELL YEAH! My heart is beating like a kick drum

And tonight I wanna burn this place with flames and fire
Our neighborhood will light up just like a funeral pyre
I will take you to the stars and even higher
A midsummer night's dream into the fire!
The cannons will fire up and blow up the sky above
It will snow in hell tonight and you'll be falling in love!

All together
We will all go crazy
Mr. Snowman Six will
Guarantee your happiness

Snow white never ending power from the sky is it gonna feed your appetite?
Singing HELL YEAH! - It beats like a kick drum
HELL YEAH! My heart is beating like a kick drum
Fires from above, fires from below, this is gonna be a hell of a snow
Singing HELL YEAH! - It beats like a kick drum
HELL YEAH! My heart is beating like a kick drum
