Hey Now! I want to paint my face in black and white
The white for the drugs, the blacks for the lies
And I say hey hey don't you think I'm crazy don't you think I'm...
Hey Now! Tonight I want to paint my hands with red
Cause I feel so murderous and twisted
Motherfucking twisted - Motherfucking twisted and I say...

I ain't the devil but I'm learning all his habits

One colour for each way I feel all the colours of my heart are real
Yeah! I never go to war without my stains, my stripes, my whore paint
A daily declaration - war and plunder, my good intentions are now six feet under
Oooh! I will be painting off my old mistakes with blood

Hey Yeah! Today I'll paint my body with stripes of blue
Cyan-ide tones for my wasted joy, dark blue for the sadness, uneasy gladness
Hey Yeah! What is the colour that you hate the most?
I'll choose that just to show how much I love you, hey, you wished me... to love you?

I ain't the devil but I'm learning all his habits

One colour for each way I feel all the colours of my heart are real
Yeah! I never go to war without my stains, my stripes, my whore paint
A daily declaration - war and plunder, my good intentions are now six feet under
Oooh! I will be painting off my old mistakes with blood

If you walk with a clown you will have some fun
If you walk with me... You'd better start to run!
Yeah! I will be painting off your ignorance with blood, my whore paint

The day will come when you'll stop examining me
You wanna know who I am? Just take a look at my war paint and you will
See that for yourself, no more questions, no more self-righteous words,
So don't talk to me anymore... 'cause I am the devil!

Hey Now! Tonight I'll paint your face with shades of green
You're a big fat snail who's bursting with envy, green envy, sick envy

I ain't the devil but he told me how to do it

One colour for each way I feel all the colours of my heart are real
Yeah! I never go to war without my stains, my stripes, my whore paint
A daily declaration - war and plunder, my good intentions are now six feet under
Oooh! I will be painting off my old mistakes with blood
