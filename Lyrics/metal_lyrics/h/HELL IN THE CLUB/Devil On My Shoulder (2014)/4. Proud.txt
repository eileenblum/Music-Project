Oh, once upon a time there were four little kids with a dream in mind
They were raised with hope and a little twist of insanity,
Yeah, oh, yeah
'Cause they, they've tried to put us down
They've tried to turn our smiles around
They have cut our hearts into pieces
Served on a silver plate, yeah
Served on a silver plate

Cry out loud
Singing proud
About our rock'n'roll fairy tale
We'll be leaving all the sorrow behind
In the night
We unite
And we'll take control
We'll be leaving the sad disillusions behind

We're proud,
We're larger than life
We're brighter than the moon in the sky
We're proud
Proud of the days gone by

Uh, yeah

The kids at later age
They were taken and locked up inside a cage
Still the playground of their fantasy was a rocking stage,
Yeah, oh, yeah
What they don't know is that we believe in our music, in what we've achieved
So far, so good, they don't know who they are fighting with
Who they are fighting with

Cry out loud
Singing proud
About our rock'n'roll fairy tale
We'll be leaving all the sorrow behind
In the night
We unite
And we'll take control
We'll be leaving the sad disillusions behind

We're proud,
We're larger than life
We're brighter than the moon in the sky
We're proud
Proud of the days gone by

Walk away
Sail away from all our fears
Our dreams will be free from tears
'Cause I'm proud and you're proud
We are proud of our fantasies

Walk away from the cruel things they say
Our dreams will break through today
'Cause I'm proud and you're proud
We are proud of our fantasies, yeah

Oh, once upon a time there were four little kids with a dream in mind
Still the playground of their fantasy was a rocking stage, yeah

Cry out loud
Singing proud
About our rock'n'roll fairy tale
We'll be leaving all the sorrow behind
In the night
We unite
And we'll take control
We'll be leaving the sad disillusions behind

We're proud,
We're larger than life
We're brighter than the moon in the sky
We're proud
Proud of the days gone by

Uh, yeah

'Cause we're proud
