We are the one still dreaming
We are the never ending light
In silence we will win this fight...

6 years old, I was told "You got a very bad disease boy"
I won the fight now I'm alright but I'm always on the look out
(But) no disease, no surprise will harm me more than killing words,
The misery you spit on me to show the world you're number one

I am the one still dreaming
I am the never ending light
In silence I will win this fight

In this world, I was told to be heard you gotta shout loud
"Actions speak louder than words" But they tell me I was wrong now
All the shit, all the lies trying to erase my footprints
Listen to that little voice and you will know I'm number one

I am the one still dreaming
I am the never ending light
In silence I will win this fight

No more lonely bleedings no more broken hearts
I'm the one who'll win this worthless fight
I know I'm getting near, I know I'm getting near, yeah

Listen to my silence now. Brothers and sisters hear my call
Few words to say we are an army - We are the chosen ones
Listen to your heart now. And united we will fight against them all
We are the ones, we'll be the winners in the end
Dream away, dream away baby... Dream away Oh!

We are the one still dreaming
We are the never ending light
In silence we will win this fight

No more lonely bleedings no more broken hearts
We are the one who'll win this worthless fight
I know we're getting near, I know we're getting near, yeah
