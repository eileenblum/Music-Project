1, 2, 3, Go!

Fun but illegal, don't care what I do
I've heard a voice in my head since when I was born
Fever - Burning deep in my soul
I'm not alone in my head - out of control

Higher! A little creature whispers words in my ears
I'm going higher with him hand in hand
There are no angels here tonight

Please forgive me father 'cause I have sinned -
I know. I did it again

Listen up, there's a devil on my shoulder -
Sorry it's not so bad you know?
Oh, oh let me go crazy!
Listen up, there's a devil on my shoulder -
Behind the mirror on my wall
Oh, oh without fear, the devil is inside of me -
is inside of me

Innocent joke, a moment in life
He's got the power of the woman you want
Art of sinner versus a saint
A road to my madhouse and here we go again

Only sin after sin. Yes i have sinned...I know. I did it again

Listen up, there's a devil on my shoulder -
Sorry it's not so bad you know?
Oh, oh let me go crazy!
Listen up, there's a devil on my shoulder -
Behind the mirror on my wall
Oh, oh without fear, the devil is inside of me -
is inside of me

There's something in him that feeds me
With his voice I found, one taste
With one taste I've found madness in me
I've found madness inside my head

Listen up, there's a devil on my shoulder -
Sorry it's not so bad you know?
Oh, oh let me go crazy!
Listen up, there's a devil on my shoulder -
Behind the mirror on my wall
Oh, oh without fear, the devil is inside of me -
is inside of me
