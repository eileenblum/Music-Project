Darling I can't close my eyes
Don't need no medicine to save my life
There's no special place nor time
I need you

I see myself, I see a man
Don't like what I see, what I am
There's nothing left to say now
Please just save me

So take my hand, hold me / Come to me, rescue me
I don't care how but do it now

Baby here I'm bleeding
I can't find my home
Can't resist forever
Girl I need your love
Feel my wings are broken
All my words unspoken
My baby... Save me!

Get my way everyday
But today I've lost my way
I wanna kill, I wanna die
For no reason

I'm a face without the eyes
I'm at the end I realize
Near the point of no return
I need you

So take my hand, hold me / Come to me, rescue me
I don't care how but do it now

Baby here I'm bleeding
I can't find my home
Can't resist forever
Girl I need your love
Feel my wings are broken
All my words unspoken
My baby... Save me!

Now it's time to heal
Your kiss will take me home
You and me together
That would be my world
Feel my wings are broken
All my words unspoken
My baby... Save me!

It's time to react now / It's time for a new day
My dark side is a cancer deep inside of me and you are the answer
You are my savior / Your love's the cure for living all my dreams, yeah!

Baby here I'm bleeding
I can't find my home
Can't resist forever
Girl I need your love
Feel my wings are broken
All my words unspoken
My baby... Save me!

Now it's time to heal
Your kiss will take me home
You and me together
That would be my world
Feel my wings are broken
All my words unspoken
My baby... Save me!

Save me!
Yeah, save me!
