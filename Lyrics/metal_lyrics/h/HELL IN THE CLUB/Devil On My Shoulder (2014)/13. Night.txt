There's a place, real only the night
Where there is magic all around you
Where your soul is fed by your fire
And all things know who you are

Hey! Tonight's a without the end

There is someone who falls in love in the dark
There's someone who drinks real hard, and hits the mark
They spend their money on the road to hell
Others sing and dance until there's nothing more to tell

Different world and different dimension
From day to night everything changes skin
Driving cars, smoking cigarettes
On the highway where all dreams come true

Hey! Tonight's a without the end

There is someone who makes love all night long
Some going high and some going low
They spend their money on the road to hell
Others sing and dance until there's nothing more to tell, yeah!

And tonight... You and I will
Sing this song together
To fly away... To fly high, yeah!

There is someone who falls in love
There is someone who's falling down
There is someone who falls in love
There is someone who's falling down

There is someone who falls in love in the dark
There's someone who drinks real hard, and hits the mark
They spend their money on the road to hell
Others sing and dance until there's nothing more to tell
There is someone who makes love all night long
Some going high and some going low
They spend their money on the road to hell
Others sing and dance until there's nothing more to tell, yeah!
