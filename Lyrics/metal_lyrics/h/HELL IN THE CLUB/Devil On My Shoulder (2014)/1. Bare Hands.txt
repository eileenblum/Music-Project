Kidnapped when you were just a boy
No experience, youth was just a toy
Goodbye innocence, death embodies your salvation
Kill or be killed, another match - abomnation
Say goodbye - kill or die - fear's out of control

Kill him with your bare hands
Choke him like you don't care
To survive just one more day
Rape her with indifference
Torture 'till the final breath
In their foul snuff-twisted play

Beaten on the floor you're the next live prey
The only things you see are hollow shades of grey
Now it's easier when the opponent's falling
Delirious when you hear the curtain calling
Easier - delirious - no fear's under control

Kill him with your bare hands
Choke him like you don't care
To survive just one more day
Rape her with indifference
Torture 'till the final breath
In their foul snuff-twisted play

Your master showed you how to rate the pain
Your self-control will not fade away
Your indifference and your lust for death
Will you ever free yourself from these chains?
But tonight one more match and you will kill again!

Kill him with your bare hands
Choke him like you don't care
To survive just one more day
Rape her with indifference
Torture 'till the final breath
In their foul snuff-twisted play
