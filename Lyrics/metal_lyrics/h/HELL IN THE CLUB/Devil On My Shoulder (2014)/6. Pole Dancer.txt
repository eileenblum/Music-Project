I saw you baby down at the club
Just a flash, lost my head, caught a fever
So dangerous and beautiful
Yeah... Every move drives me crazy
Yeah... It's magical baby

Everybody needs somebody
In this circus - Take me to your fairytale
My unknown dancer, my desire
And now I know want you, now I need you, can't resist you
Take my hand and dream away
My unknown dancer, my desire

I see your legs in a twirl
And the fire is starting to burn deep inside me
It's like a vision - A sweet sin
Yeah... Every move drives me crazy
Yeah... It's magical baby

Everybody needs somebody
In this circus - Take me to your fairytale
My unknown dancer, my desire
And now I know want you, now I need you, can't resist you
Take my hand and dream away
My unknown dancer, my desire

Maleficent looking pretty take me to your emerald city
My heart is beating loud, I'm hypnotized
Now won't you feel me...?
You're my red queen, so terrible, your beauty is unbearable
I want you hard, I'm feeling paralyzed
Now won't you feel me...?

Yeah... Every move drives me crazy
Yeah... It's magical baby

Everybody needs somebody
