Whenever I see you
You move in a trail of colours
Paint my heart and light up my life
Just like a guiding light

There's no world without you
You're a special creative, a muse
A work of art on every wall
The tattoo smile upon my face only when we are together

Every day, every place, every way
You're the queen of charm for humanity
I want you with all your qualities and flaws, I love you
Every day, every place, every way
You're my night and my every single day
I want you with all your qualities and flaws, I need you
You're my madness, you're my life
Woman this is for you

Wherever I see you
A flame lights up within me
Even songs and poetry, talk a little about you and me

'Cause you are passion,
you're beauty and temptation
I'll bring you the stars tonight... To offer you a gift
I will give you my wings to fly forever

Every day, every place, every way
You're the queen of charm for humanity
I want you with all your qualities and flaws, I love you
Every day, every place, every way
You're my night and my every single day
I want you with all your qualities and flaws, I need you
You're my madness, you're my life
Woman this is for you
