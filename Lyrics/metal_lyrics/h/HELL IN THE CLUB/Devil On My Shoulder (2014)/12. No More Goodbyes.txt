I'd walk through hell and back again instead of fighting with you
I'd go through all the pain and suffering instead of living without you

I miss you more than ever, this is why I cry

'Cause you're the one I'm dreaming of tonight
I swear there won't be any more goodbyes - tonight
I would die for you - and you love me too
I won't be leaving you again
I swear there won't be any more goodbyes

I'd go through all the flames of hell again, just to get rid of the pain
And I'd live this madness once again, to show you it wasn't all in vain

Now I love you more than ever, this is why I cry

'Cause you're the one I'm dreaming of tonight
I swear there won't be any more goodbyes - tonight
I would die for you - and you love me too
I won't be leaving you again
I swear there won't be any more goodbyes

It wasn't me pretending, my love is never ending
I feel like dying when I see you cry
My mind is broken I know, but you shouldn't pay for my faults
I am sorry, please don't cry

'Cause you're the one I'm dreaming of tonight
I swear there won't be any more goodbyes - tonight
I would die for you - and you love me too
I won't be leaving you again
I swear there won't be any more goodbyes
