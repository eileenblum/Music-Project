In the maze
Maybe we've got lost
But we are not afraid
In the cave
Maybe it's too dark to see
Will the light be somewhere

We should know
Venturing into a new land
We need to be brave
We are sure
Some dangers in front
But they won't block our way

Now we're moving forward 
Nothing can block our force 
In the sky
In the sea
In the air
It's full of our force

We are the guide
We are the light
We are the warriors
We are in your mind

Go through the fire
Go through the ice 
Bravery and force
They're in the air

Leave the darkness 
Leave the sorrow
Accept the quest
Challenge in your life

Just believe 
Someday we will see
The paradise
It's right before our eyes                

It's waiting for you
The light of hope
And it's coming soon
If we are patient and give it time
There's nothing more 
they can take away

This is my plan
It's the only way to make my stand
The future will be mine again
Given back everything I've fought for

Now we're moving forward
Nothing can block our force
In the sky
In the sea
In the air
It's full of our force

We are the guide
We are the light
We are the warriors
We are in your mind

Go through the fire
Go through the ice
Bravery and force
They're in the air

Leave the darkness 
Leave the sorrow
Accept the quest
Challenge in your life

Just believe
Someday weâll see
The paradise
It's right before our eyes

[Repeat Chorus]
