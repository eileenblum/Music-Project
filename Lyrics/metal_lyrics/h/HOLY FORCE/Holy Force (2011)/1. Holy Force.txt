These endless days, and endless nights
Oh I forever, fight for my life
Praising the sun, unto the earth
It never stops giving life

What we have learned, what lies in store
The path we've taken, shows us the way   
No fear in my soul, completing my quest
You give me hope to be my best

Now I know
It's time for the fight
I am a warrior
All my enemies know me

Sometimes you just have to try
Time will keep passing you by
Believe in me, you'll overcome
Oh I'm waiting for you
Look into our destiny
Take my hand and you will see
No more darkness in your heart
Now I'm waiting for an answer

Stand next to me, there's nothing to fear
If we're together there's no telling
The powers that be, will set you free
I know you can give your all

What do you feel, is this all real
Just letting you know 
that you're not dreaming
No more to hate, letting it go 
We will forge on, forever more

Now I know
It's time for the fight
I am a warrior
All my enemies know me

You have to face hard moments
You have to come a long way
Someday you will reach this land
I am waiting for that day
Come on, my hard destiny
Come on, coldest winter nights
Ready to fight, I won't hide
I'll see the light of hope

You have to face hard moments
You have to come a long way
Someday you will reach this land
The future will be ours again
Courage gives me power to live
Someday weâll see paradise
It's coming soon, it's burning now 
It's our holy force
Holy force
