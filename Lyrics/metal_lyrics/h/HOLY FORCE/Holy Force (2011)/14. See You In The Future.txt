When your life begin to lose the light of life
Don't ever give in
You've got to believe 
It just a quest in your life

Time is passing by me, it's hard to take
Oh it's so painful
It's stirring up my mind
No, it never dies

I am waiting for a light to come
It will bring me to a land where we never cry

You will be a light
And shine in the dark
I've seen it in the future
Someday this will end
Someday we have to leave
And if you do it well
I'll see you in the future

Angels never fall to hell
Demons never live in heaven
On what side do you stand?
Will you take my hand?

Maybe it is damaging your mind
Donât let it break you
Just listen to me
You have to believe

I am waiting for a light to come
It will bring me to a land where we never cry

You will be a light
And shine in the dark
I've seen it in the future
Someday this will be end
Someday we have to leave
And if you do it well
I'll see you in the future

I believe weâll meet
In a land of perfect peace
I know!! I will!! See You!!
Iâll see you in the future
