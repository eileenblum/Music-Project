In the darkest night
Only the moon and you in my eyes
(The only thing I see is you)
Now my longing heart
Crying for you
There's no disguise

A shattered home is waiting, no more complicating
Can you see, can you be, my light
And free my soul

Igniting the flames in the moonlight
Calling in vain
I can feel the power of you
It's close to my soul
Give me a sign, oh I'll be waiting
Biding my time
Only in the night we are free  
We can be whole

Dream in so many ways
Where to turn and how to decide
(The way that I can be with you)
Unknown forces between you and me
Yet I'm still mystified 

A shattered home is waiting, no more complicating
Can you see, can you be, my light
And free my soul

Igniting the flames in the moonlight
Calling in vain
I can feel the power of you
It's close to my soul
Give me a sign, oh I'll be waiting
Biding my time
Only in the night we are free  
We can be whole

[Repeat chorus]
