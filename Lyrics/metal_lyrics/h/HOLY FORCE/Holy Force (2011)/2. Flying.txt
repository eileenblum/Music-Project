Fly...
I'm flying to the sky
Leave behind the earth
Nothing can stop me now
I'm on my way

Love...
There's no need to cry
I'll keep fighting on
Love in my heart
Just beyond a smile

If you believe it 
We are flying
Anything is possible
Finding a way into the sky
Your love is a castle
I feel the power
As we're soaring through the stars
We are the kings of the sky

Clouds...
Blinding my eyes
They can't hide my way
Dark clouds are turning white

Believe...
I just got to believe
It's not just an image in my mind
It's my heart
It is my life

If you believe it 
We are flying
Anything is possible
Finding a way into the sky
Your love is the castle
I feel the power
As we're soaring through the stars
We are the kings of the sky

[Repeat Chorus]
