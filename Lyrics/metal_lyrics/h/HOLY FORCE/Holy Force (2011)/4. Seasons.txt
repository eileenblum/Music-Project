Seasons change
And bring a new day
The circle of life is taking it's toll

The wheels turning, no looking back

Change is coming
No use trying to hide away
There's no denying

You cannot control
It lives in your soul
Taking you away
Into a new day

Seasons changing like the wind
Hiding inside all our sins
In darkness lives our only fear
No way out it lives within us
Letting go the wheels will turn
Leading us into forever
In the future we will learn
Seasons changing, taking us away

Only life
Holding the key
The story goes on, the one you believe
Time burning, ticking away

Change is coming
No use trying to hide away
There's no denying

You cannot control
It lives in your soul
Taking you away
Into a new day
Seasons changing like the wind
Hiding inside all our sins
In darkness lives our only fear
No way out it lives within us
Letting go the wheels will turn
Leading us into forever
In the future we will learn
Seasons changing, taking us away

[Repeat Chorus]
