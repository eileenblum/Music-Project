Holding on
Somewhere we are flying to go
Strange road
We are not afraid of any world

The dream we ever own
It is the light of forever
Face the world without fear
My heart will be burning forever

Stainless soul
Our faith it's just like a stone  
We shall go
We will cross all the ice and fire

The power that we own
It's called the wings of forever
Like a phoenix through the storm
We'll fly into forever

[Repeat chorus]
