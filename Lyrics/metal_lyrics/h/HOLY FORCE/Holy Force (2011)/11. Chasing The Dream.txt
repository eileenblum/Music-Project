The light no longer shines in my life
The pain it shows in my face
I never lose hope in the future
I hope that it's brighter for me

Try to escape, no more losing
Our way to the future, it's promising
Passing by, we're taking our time
No more dwelling on the past

My dream it rises like the sun
I watch the earth below, all life's begun

Driving my heart
Into the future, it gives me hope
From this earth, into the sky
No more facing the world alone
I won't lose my faith ever in life again
In my eyes it's burning
The glowing of eternal light

My heart is longing for paradise
The future is there in front of my eyes

Try to escape, no more losing
Our way to the future, it's promising
Passing by, we're taking our time
No more dwelling on the past

My steps lead me into the sun
Chasing the dream my lives having begun

Driving my heart
Into the future, it gives me hope
From this earth, into the sky
No more facing the world alone
I won't lose my faith ever in life again
In my eyes it's burning
The glowing of eternal light

My heart is longing for paradise
The future is there in front of my eyes

Driving my heart
Into the future, it gives me hope
From this earth, into the sky
No more facing the world alone
I won't lose my faith ever in life again
In my eyes it's burning
The glowing of eternal light

My heart is longing for paradise
The future is there in front of my eyes
Chasing the dream
