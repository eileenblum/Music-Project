Never feeling shame for their greed
They feed upon the weak with no remorse
Taking everything that they can
And giving nothing back, always on the attack

Where's the loyalty, can we find
Not knowing right from wrong, are we blind?
Is it too late, for a change
To turn this all around, reclaiming sacred ground

A country good or bad
Who is in control?
No one seems to know who's pulling our strings
Giving all we can
Until there's nothing left
No one seems to know what tomorrow will bring
Bells ring, we cling to life

Greed and sacrifice, hand in hand
No more backing down, taking our stand
Breaking every rule that they've made 
They never seem to care, only our souls are bared

A country good or bad
Who is in control?
No one seems to know who's pulling our strings
Giving all we can
Until there's nothing left
No one seems to know what tomorrow will bring
Bells ring, we cling to life
