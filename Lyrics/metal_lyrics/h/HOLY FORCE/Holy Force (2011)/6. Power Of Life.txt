Can you close your eyes
And see with your mind
Never let it go
Feel the power of life
The powers that will be
It doesn't mean that you lose
Just keep your faith
When you're crossing the line

Maybe you're up against the wall
Demons in your mind come to call

No one knows what will
Happen tomorrow
We all live together in this world
Lost in this big maze
Only the power of life
Keeps us under control

Knowing that you are 
Controling your mind 
You will understand
How hard life sometimes is
How can you believe
The things you're told
Just let it be
Feel the power of life

Maybe it's just a big black hole
The demons that try and take control

No one knows what will
Happen tomorrow
We all live together in this world
Lost in this big maze
Only the power of life
Keeps us under control

[Repeat chorus]
