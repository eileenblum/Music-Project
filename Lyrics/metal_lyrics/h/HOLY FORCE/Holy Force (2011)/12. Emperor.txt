A warrior is born into this world
Fighting all his foes, he knows what lies ahead

Come with me
All of my brothers
We fight together
For life and people
It's in our sights
The chosen will bring hope
Into the light
We're marching on

We have a dream
Bring hope to the world
Giving all I can
We are bringing victory home
Save the world
Giving all I can
There's no turning back
We can't be defeated

Leading our way to victory
Our heart it's beating for the dream

Look to the sky
We are not flying alone
We can find our dream
Now it's time for us to go

Come with me
All of my brothers
We fight together
For life and people
It's in our sights
The chosen will bring hope
Into the light
We're marching on

We have a dream
Bring hope to the world
Giving all I can
We are bringing victory home
Save the world
Giving all I can
There's no turning back
We can't be defeated

Leading our way to victory
Our heart it's beating for the dream

We have a dream
Bring hope to the world
Giving all I can
We are bringing victory home
Save the world
Giving all I can
There's no turning back
We can't be defeated, no
