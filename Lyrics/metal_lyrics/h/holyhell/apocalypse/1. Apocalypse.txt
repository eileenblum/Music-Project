The Gates of heaven opened
A white horse did appear
There an angel standing in the sun

Fire in his eyes
The angels herald his command
There the keys to hell and death
Were burning in his hand

[Chorus:]
Black angels are falling
The gates of hell are calling
Black angels are falling
Hell's calling

Black angels are falling
The gates of hell are calling
Black angels are falling
The gates of hell are calling you

The seven seals now open
The day of wrath has come
Angels bring us fire blood and hail

Stars fall from the heavens
Mountains fall into the sea
The beast upon his throne is laughing
Evil is supreme

Day into night
Dark into light
For the crown of life

Four-horseman ride
Black, red and white
The pale horse death shall ride

[Chorus]

Black angels are falling
The gates of hell are calling
Black angels are falling
The gates of hell are calling you

The Gates Of heaven opened
A white horse did appear
There an angel standing in the sun

Fire in his eyes
The angels herald his command
There the keys to hell and death
Were burning in his hand

Day into night
Dark into light
For the crown of life
Four-horseman ride
Black, red and white
The pale horse death shall ride
