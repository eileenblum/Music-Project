In sleep he sang to me,
In dreams he came.
That voice which calls to me,
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find,
The Phantom of the Opera is here,
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me,
Our strange duet.
My power over you,
Grows stronger yet.
And though you turn from me,
To glance behind.
The Phantom of the Opera is there,
Inside your mind.

Those who have seen your face,
Draw back in fear.
I am the mask you wear.
It's me they hear.

[Both:]
My/your spirit and my/your voice,
In one combined.
The Phantom of the Opera is here/there
Inside your/my mind
In all your fantasies
You always knew
That man and mystery
Were both in you

[Both:]
And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The Phantom of the opera is there/here
Inside your/my mind

I'm here, The Phantom of the Opera!
He's there, The Phantom of the Opera!

[Vocalizing]

Sing to me!
Sing to me!
Sing my angel of music!

[Vocalizing higher]
