The soul has crossed
Into the flame
Repentance lost
There is no escape

It is darkest before the dawn
Flooding fire, burning higher

Holy water
Holy water
Burn in the fire
Holy water

Open the gates
Of eternal waste
Drown in the stones
Of the fallen graves

Good is evil, in Heaven, Hell
Know your words, know them well

Holy water
Holy water
Can't stop the fire
Holy water

Holy water
Holy water
Burn in the fire
Holy water
Holy water
Holy water
Can't stop the fire
Holy water
Water
Water
