Forever seems so far
Forever seems so cold
Forever cries the heart
Forever young's the soul

And all the angels
Fly far from thee
When demons dance
In dreams

When all these words don't seem to fall
What are these words without your soul
Forever lost the stars
Forever haunts the ghost

And all the angels
Fly far from thee
When demons dance
In dreams

Fall down on me
Fly into the night
Fall down on me
Fly into the night

And now it seems the world has grown
We're in a place we've never known
Just know when darkness falls
Then forever comes the star

And all the angels
Fly far from thee
When demons dance
In dreams

Fall down on me
Fly into the night
Fall down on me
Fly into the night
