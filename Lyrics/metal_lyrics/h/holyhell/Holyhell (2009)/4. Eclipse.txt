Past the sun
Cast out of heaven
Did the black horde fly
Down to earth
Souls for the taking
On the wings of the night
Through the kingdom of fire and darkness
We are free from the light
In the bowels of the earth we await
Here we chose to alight

To the eclipse
Free from light
Into dark
Into night
To the eclipse
Know us well
We who fell
We're angels from hell

From the chaos of the skies
Eclipse will fill the skies
Armies born of fire will arise
And now the sons of hell await
For all who share our fate
To live among the creatures of night

To the eclipse
Free from light
Into dark
Into night
To the eclipse
Know us well
We who fell
We're angels from hell

Past the sun
Cast out of heaven
Did the black horde fly
Down to earth
Souls for the taking
On the wings of the night

To the eclipse
Free from light
Into dark
Into night
To the eclipse
Know us well
We who fell
We're angels from hell
To the eclipse
Free from light
Into dark
Into night
To the eclipse
Know us well
We who fell
We're angels from hell
