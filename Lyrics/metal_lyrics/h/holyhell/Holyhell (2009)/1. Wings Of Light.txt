The brightest moonlight shines in the night
Stars light the heavens in the sky
War in heaven cries out that hell is alive
Power of darkness will rise

Angels dance before my eyes
Demons live inside your mind

Wings of light
Wings of night
Fly into paradise
Wings of light
Wings of night
Fly into light

Feel the curse, now hear the words, a spell for the dead
Your fear lives where angels fell and bled
War in heaven cries out that hell is alive
Power of light will rise

Demons dance before my eyes
Angels live inside your mind

Wings of light
Wings of night
Fly into paradise
Wings of light
Wings of night
Fly into light

Wings of light...
