Darkness calls my name
The one who walks in flame
Blood of ancient serpents rise
Wings spread above the slain
Where fallen angels reign
They live in terror of light

When you fear
Crucify
Know your fear
Is alive

Angel of darkness
Standing in light
I see Satan
Ruler of night

Flames of hell burn high
Rising to the sky
A veil of night blocks the night
Wings spread above the slain
Where fallen angels reign
They live in terror of light

When you fear
Crucify
Know your fear
Is alive

Angel of darkness
Standing in light
I see Satan
Ruler of night
