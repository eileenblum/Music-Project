Gates of heaven open
A white horse did appear 
There, an angel standing in the sun 
Fire in his eyes
The angels herald his command 
There the keys to hell and death were burning in his hand 

Black angels are falling 
The gates of hell are calling 
Black angels are falling 
Hell's calling 
Black angels are falling 
The gates of hell are calling 
Black angels are falling 
The gates of hell are calling you 

The seven seals now opened
The day of wrath has come 
Angels bring us fire, blood and hell
Stars fall from the heavens
Mountains fall into the sea 
The Beast upon his throne is laughing
Evil is supreme 

Day into night 
Dark into light 
For the crown of life 
Four horsemen ride 
Black red and white 
The pale horse death shall ride
