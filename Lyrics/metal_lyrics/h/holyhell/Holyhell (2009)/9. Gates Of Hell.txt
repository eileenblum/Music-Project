Into a starlit sky
Where time begins
Across the universe
Where heavens end

Shadows of the god
Fly above the paradise
We once found
At the gates of light
Standing there, a dark knight
We will crown

The gates of hell will open wide
Welcome to the night

Rising spirit's free
Evil legacy
Wake up to a thousand single deeds
Shadows of the god
Fly above it all
Into the gates of hell

Walk into the gates
And time stands still
The fires burn within
So enter if you will

Shadows of the god
Fly above the paradise
We once found
At the gates of light
Standing there, a dark knight
We will crown

The gates of hell will open wide
Welcome to the night

Rising spirit's free
Evil legacy
Wake up to a thousand single deeds
Shadows of the god
Fly above it all
Into the gates of hell
