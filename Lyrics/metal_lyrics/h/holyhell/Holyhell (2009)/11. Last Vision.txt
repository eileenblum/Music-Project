Heaven did once hold a place 
For those who fell into the darkness from light 
Fell in torment, fell in pain 

Into the fires of hell 
Over the souls of the dead we shall reign 
Till the day we rise again 

Mine is the kingdom of darkness 
Thine is the kingdom of Light 
Fly from the light of the heavens 
Fly into night 

We angels fall from heaven 
From everlasting light 
Into a world of darkness 
To everlasting night 

We'll wait for the end of the world 
We'll wait for the saviors of light to be shamed 
Then the armies of darkness shall reign 

Let the battle on earth now begin 
The souls of the dead will be calling our name 
As they rise up from the grave 

Mine is the kingdom of darkness 
Thine is the kingdom of Light 
Fly from the light of the heavens 
Fly into night 

We angels fall from heaven 
From everlasting light 
Into a world of darkness 
To everlasting night
