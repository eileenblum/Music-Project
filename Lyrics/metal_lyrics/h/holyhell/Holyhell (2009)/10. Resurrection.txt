[originally by Godgory]I ran too far 
Fought too hard and lived too fast 
Broke me down, tore me up 
So I buried myself 
Deep down in the blackest hole 
There I slept, there I wept 
(All) these tears I shed 
Slowly healed my bleeding soul 
(It) takes a fall to rise again 
Inside of me 
I'm ready to grow young again 
Start the fire in this heart of ice 

The time is right for me again so lift your eyes up to the sky 
You'll see me dancing on the winds again 

There's no more tears for me 
Bring life to empty eyes 
I will be once again 
The tears from heaven dance 

Tears from heaven fall 
The fallen angels dance before my eyes 
As I reach out from this womb 
God save this world 
I will walk upon it again 
I will breathe, I will live 

The time is right for me again so lift your eyes up to the sky 
You'll see me dancing on the winds again 

There's no more tears for me 
Bring life to empty eyes 
I will be once again 
The tears from heaven dance
