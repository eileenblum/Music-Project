The world is turning to night
Stars are falling
Heaven's calling
Hell is alive
The moon is dark
And the sun won't give other light
The end has come

Temptations pulls in your heart
A burning flame
Lights the way
Like a thief in the dark
Where light is light
Where black is night
To break in the dawn
Where lightning brings
Angels' wings
The thunder rolls on

Now the end as come
Darkness rules the setting sun
Battle is over and won
Armageddon

The world is turning to night
Stars are falling
Heaven's calling
Hell is alive
The moon is dark
And the sun won't give other light
The end has come

The shadows dance in the dark
Celebrate
The darkest fate
While the heavens move on
There is no light
It's back as night
A world without dawn
Now angels scream
Above the dreams
Of the armageddon

Now the end as come
Darkness rules the setting sun
Battle is over and won
Armageddon
Armageddon

The world is turning to night
Stars are falling
Heaven's calling
Hell is alive
The moon is dark
And the sun won't give other light
The end has come
