Under the midnight sun
Beyond the pearly gates
Where darkness walks the earth
And souls choose their fate

Eden falls
Angels call
Servants pray
A raven song
From dusk till dawn
The end awaits

Light upon lights
Dark upon nights
Night turns to day
Eyes of evil
Heaven's equal
Sweet bird of prey

When the morning star
Awakens from the grave
And all the battles, won
And all the damned are saved

Eden falls
Angels call
Servants pray
A raven song
From dusk till dawn
The end awaits

Light upon lights
Dark upon nights
Night turns to day
Eyes of evil
Heaven's equal
Sweet bird of prey
