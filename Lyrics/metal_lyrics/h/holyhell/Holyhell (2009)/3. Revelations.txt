Echoes silent
Call the shadow souls into depths
Unknown
Blackest moonlit sky
Lighting up the night like a bleeding
Halo

Beyond the light
Beyond the darknest night
There is a light

When the halo
Lights
On wings of shadow
Fly high
Fly

Shades of sorrow
Cast a spell of hope deep into
The hole
A resurrected laugh
Cannot bear the silence once lost
Now that I know

Beyond the light
Beyond the darknest night
There is a light

When the halo
Lights
On wings of shadow
Fly high
Fly high
