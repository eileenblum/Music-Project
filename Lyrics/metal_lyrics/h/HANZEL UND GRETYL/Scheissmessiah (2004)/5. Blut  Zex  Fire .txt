Destroy and pull it tighter
Adjust the angle so slight
Tear the scar be a fighter
Black is death at midnight
Make it feel like there's something
Make it hard as it burns
The liquid light is descending
Das ist mein stern!

BLUT ZEX FIRE!
BLUT ZEX FIRE!
BLUT ZEX FIRE!
ZEX ZEX FIRE!

The subconscious is burning
As the blood is dripping
Transcendental illusion
Pulsating God delusion
Dig the weapons inside
Dig so deep that it cuts
Pull and grind it tighter
Never say enough

BLUT ZEX FIRE!
BLUT ZEX FIRE!
BLUT ZEX FIRE!
ZEX ZEX FIRE!

ZEX! FIRE!
ZEX! FIRE!
ZEX! FIRE!
ZEX! FIRE!
