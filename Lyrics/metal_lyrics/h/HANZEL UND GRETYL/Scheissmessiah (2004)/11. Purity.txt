Passion placed in an orbit
Deep inside the inner sanctum
Of supergalactic
Cosmic blackness
Mesmerized
Transformatic

Sanctified
Cruficified
Demonizer
Terrified

Levitate into the astral
Place of everlasting bodies
Sacrificed
Brutalized
Screaming death for lust inside

Transiting the plague of Saturn
Burning phallic
Rising venom
Blazing light
Draw your last sword
Possess me now and you will suffer

Sanctify
Crucify
Demonizer
Purify

And we shall purify

And we shall purify

And we shall purify
(And we shall purify)

Intoxicating, ritualistic
Chaos praising, so sadistic
Into the void of the resurrected
Divine, sacred and obsessive

Constellations of destruction
Manifesting my seduction
Goddess, death, impurity
Down on your knees and make it bleed

Sanctify
Crucify
Demonizer
Purify

And we shall purify
(And we shall purify)

And we shall purify

And we shall purify

And we shall purify

And we shall purify
And we shall purify
And we shall purify
And we shall purify
