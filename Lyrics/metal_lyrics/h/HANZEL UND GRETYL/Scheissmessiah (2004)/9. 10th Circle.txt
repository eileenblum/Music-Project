There is a beast
Living within each and every one of you
A filthy beast whose name is lust

That's right, ladies and gentlemen
Lust is the beast within you
The beast that wants to consume you
And then spit you out
Into the eternal fires of Hell

And for all eternity
Your flesh will be ripped from your body
By grotesque servants
With razor sharp teeth

And for all eternity
Your blood will boil
Your bones will burn
And your marrow will be reduced
To imputrid black slime

And for what?
For a few moments of weakness

I'm glad you two admire the shit...
