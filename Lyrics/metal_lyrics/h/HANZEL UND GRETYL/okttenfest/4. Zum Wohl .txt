As the planet returns to the galactic center
All things will change, as we have known
Praise to the destiny that we hold near
The end of misery
Of this solar sun

The call of distant galaxies
Echoes within our blood
As the ring of water rises into our sins
Cleansing the death as the sun rises in the west
Our blood turns to blue
Our past put to rest

Prost alle Prost
Prost zu totenfest
Prost alle Prost
Prost zu totenfest
