After the end
We still remain
Alone forever
To the stars again
As the cycle continues
And the numbers fall
The power symbols
Continue to call
Our time in sequence
Our turn to follow
Destiny fights
For survival

After the end...

Attractions flows
To magnetic power
Of erotic greed
As liquids follow
Simply gliding
In the chaos
All things will pass
Into the climax

After the end...

11:11 - 11:11 - 11:11 - 11:11
