I like to bathe myself in bad habits
I like to bathe myself in bad habits
I like to bathe myself in bad habits
I like to bathe myself in bad habits

I baptize myself in mud water
I baptize myself in mud water
I baptize myself in mud water
I baptize myself in mud water

Shine 2001

I open up my head to false prophets
I open up my head to false prophets
I open up my head to false prophets 
I open up my body for profit

I polish off the chrome to my headgear
I polish off the chrome to my headgear
I polish off the chrome to my headgear
I polish off the chrome to my headgear
