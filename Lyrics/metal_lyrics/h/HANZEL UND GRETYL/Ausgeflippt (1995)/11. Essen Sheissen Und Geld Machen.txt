This is nothing and it is mine
Hit the lazy fast and hard
Look a minute at my face
Tell me that it is nothing
What is left and where is mine
Freaky with no idea
Funny here or something
Give me a large beer fast!
This is nothing and it is mine
You think nothing and it's all the same
Freaky and out of place
I think you should be shot
Eat shit eat shit eat shit
And make money!
I have two and you have none
It all stinks but nothing matters
We're coming now and fast
Swimming in killing money
Where is yours where is your slug
Watch out now and fast
Left is nothing and right is never
What means it and where is mine
This is all so wierd, so wierd is
So i know, i know that to shoot is
Only the old lazy punker
Comes to me for a joint
Eat shit eat shit eat shit
And make money
