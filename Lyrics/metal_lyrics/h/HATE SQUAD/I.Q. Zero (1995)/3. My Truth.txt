In this world, surrounded by chaos
It's hard to go the way til the end
May I reach the end of the tunnel?
To see the light, to live my own truth

Walkin' on the way where madness reigns
Can't beleive one word that you try to preach

Live my own truth, try to use my own rules

Meaning of life
Aside my dreams
I am alone
Fight to survive

Never trust you
I know the truth
Never trust you
My truth

In this world, surrounded by chaos
I'll find a way to go till the end
I will reach the end of the tunnel
Will see the light and live my own truth

Walkin' on the way where madness reigns
Won't beleive a word that you try to preach

Live my own truth and I use my own rules

Meaning of life
To realize dreams
Never alone
Never trust you

Never trust you
I know the truth
Never trust you
My truth

Walkin' on the way where madness reigns
Won't beleive a word that you try to preach

Live my own truth and I use my own rules

Meaning of life
Aside my dreams
I am alone
Fight to survive

Never trust you
I know the truth
Never trust you
My truth
