Close mindedness
Shows in everything you do and say
You are afraid of another way
To live a life different from yours
- Different from yours

Tolerance - learn to accept
Ignorance - will lead you nowhere
Tolerance - learn to respect
Ignorance - a one way street for you

But life forces you
And everyone to be tolerant
And accept that not everyone
Thinks or lives the same way
- lives the same way

Tolerance - learn to accept
Ignorance - will lead you nowhere
Tolerance - learn to respect
Ignorance - a one way street for you

Close mindedness
Shows in everything you do and say
You are afraid of another way
To live a life different from yours
- Different from yours

Tolerance - learn to accept
Ignorance - will lead you nowhere
Tolerance - learn to respect
Ignorance - a one way street for you
