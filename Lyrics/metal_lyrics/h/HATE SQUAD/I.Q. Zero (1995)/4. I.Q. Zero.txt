The world we live in
- A stupid human sin
Are you not afraid?
Hell is what we created!

I.Q. zero, stupid heroes rule the world
Polluted minds - they destroy our minds
Rule the world
Polluted minds - they destroy our minds

Have you ever cared?
Hiding like a rat!
Only lived your life, don't know good or bad

I.Q. zero, stupid heroes rule the world
Polluted minds - they destroy our minds
Rule the world
Polluted minds - they destroy our minds

Let's start to think
Ya suckers - think!
I've lost my dreams - This nightmare became reality

The world we live in
- A stupid human sin
Are you not afraid?
Hell is what we created!

I.Q. zero, stupid heroes rule the world
Polluted minds - they destroy our minds
Rule the world
Polluted minds - they destroy our minds

Your life, our life, your life!
Don't let your I.Q. die!
