Crucified, suffering of life
My life failed - Loss of self respect

Life that means nothing to me
Wanna leave the pit, wanna end this shit

My mind is sad, this life is crap
No power left to step ahead - step ahead

Sad life, dead mind
Creepin', searching, dying - meaning of life

My mind is sad, this life is crap
No power left to step ahead

Crucified, down for life!

Life that means nothing to me
Wanna leave the pit, wanna end this shit

My mind is sad, this life is crap
No power left to step ahead

To step ahead, ahead, ahead

Now I'll end my life, my life is crap
