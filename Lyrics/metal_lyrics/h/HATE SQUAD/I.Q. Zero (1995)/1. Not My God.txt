You are not my god
You are not my god

Stupid and sick minds
Try to direct my life
But that don't mean
I need to agree

You are not my god
You are not my god

I know that I am
And live in reality
Please don't tell me
What to do or to leave

Tell me jerks why should I care?
Your words are transparent lies!
I only must grow for myself
Experience my own view of life!

Why don't you leave me alone?
Are you wearin' a crown?
To direct me is not your job
Rot - You are not my god
You are not my god - Not your job!

You failed, that's the only thing that I know - for sure!

You are not my god
You are not my god

I know that I am
And live in reality
Please don't tell me
What to do or to leave

Tell me jerks why should I care?
Your words are transparent lies!
I only must grow for myself
Experience my own view of life!

Why don't you leave me alone?
Are you wearin' a crown?
To direct me is not your job
Rot - You are not my god

You are not my god

Not my god, not my god, not my god
Not my god, not my god, not my god
Not my god, not my god, not my god
