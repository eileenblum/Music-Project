Innocent are victims of attempts they commit

Terror - justify violence with your beliefs
Do you believe that violence is the way
To reach the aims you try to reach
To show everyone what has to change

Misfit in society
Driven by blind fanaticism
Only one goal in sight
To get there is the only thing that counts

Innocent are victims of attempts you commit

Terror - justify violence with your beliefs
Do you believe that violence is the way
To reach the aims you try to reach
To show everyone what has to change

Only a fool lead by others
Was brainwashed his whole life
Religion is not always cure
Your opinion is not always right

Innocent are victims of attempts you commit

Terror - justify violence with your beliefs
Do you believe that violence is the way
To reach the aims you try to reach
To show everyone what has to change

When can we rise above, killing in the name of god
Killing for false reasons

Innocent are victims of attempts they commit

Terror - justify violence with your beliefs
Do you believe that violence is the way
To reach the aims you try to reach
To show everyone what has to change

Justify violence with your beliefs
Do you believe that violence is the way
To reach the aims you try to reach
To show everyone what has to change
