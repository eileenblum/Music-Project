You never tried to face problems in this world
Impassable mind,
Do you know that you're

Blind, dumb, deaf
Blind, dumb, deaf
Blind, dumb, deaf

Shut your mouth, close your eyes, forget all that you've heard
Shut your mouth, close your eyes, forget all that you've heard

Hey dude, one day the bill will be paid
Passive like you are all the fools in this world
Sitting in your locked cage

You never tried to face problems in this world
Impassable mind,
Do you know that you're

Blind, dumb, deaf
Blind, dumb, deaf
Blind, dumb, deaf

Shut your mouth, close your eyes, forget all that you've heard
Shut your mouth, close your eyes, forget all that you've heard

Hey dude, one day the bill will be paid
Passive like you are all the fools in this world
Sitting in your locked cage

Blind, dumb, deaf
Blind, dumb, deaf
Blind, dumb, deaf

Shut your mouth, close your eyes, forget all that you've heard

Hey dude, one day the bill will be paid
Passive like you are all the fools in this world
Better stay in your cage!
