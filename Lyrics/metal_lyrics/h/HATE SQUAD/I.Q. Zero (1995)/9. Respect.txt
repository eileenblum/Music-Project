You know me, I'm your child
Have you seen, seen me for a while?
I was here, but you don't care
Not one word, is that fair?

In my heart, in my soul - I'm your son
What is wrong, what mistake have I done?

I tried hard to get your respect
All my deeds are done to get respect

No, no love, attention - no respect!
No, no love, attention - no respect to feed my soul!

Beaten hard, my own dad
Not the kind of respect I meant
O.K. dad, I've lost this round
I'm down, but not out!

In my heart, in my soul - I'm your son
What is wrong, what mistake have I done?

I tried hard to get your respect
All my deeds are done to get respect

No, no love, attention - no respect!
No, no love, attention - no respect to feed my soul!

No chance at all, to feed my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul!
No chance at all, to feed my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul!

You know me, I'm your child
Have you seen, seen me for a while?
I was here, but you don't care
Not one word, is that fair?

In my heart, in my soul - I'm your son
What is wrong, what mistake have I done?

I tried hard to get your respect
All my deeds are done to get respect

No, no love, attention - no respect!
No, no love, attention - no respect to feed my soul!

O.K, I will go my own way
This is all I have to say
To you no respect will be shown
I need my respect for my own, for my own
I need my respect for my own - child!
