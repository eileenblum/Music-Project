You tell me you got treated like dirt
The unwanted son â Not needed at all
You blame your misery on your past
Born into a life â Surrounded by crime

Cause and effect
The cause was your life â Crime the effect

The cause was your life â Crime the effect

Hey thatâs no excuse
Some were born to lose
Others found their way out
Try even if you doubt

Just look where you are at now
And where you can be if you only try !
