Violence and aggression
Are ruling in the streets
Eat or be eaten
Thatâs the rule that I mean

Every fight weâve lost together
Every fight Iâve lost alone
Fills my heart with hatred
Turns it to a heart of stone

Hate produces hate
My hate produces hate
Your hate produces hate
Our hate produces hate

Country versus country
Race against race
Religion fights religion
And the death against us all

Every fight weâve lost together
Every fight Iâve lost alone
Fills my heart with hatred
Turns it to a heart of stone

Hate â I hate !
Violence â I fight !

Stand up and fight
For your own life
Try to leave poverty
But respect humanity

Violence and aggression
Are raging in the streets

Youâll never learn !
Weâll never learn !
