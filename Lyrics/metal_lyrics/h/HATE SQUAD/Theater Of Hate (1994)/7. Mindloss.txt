Last breath has gone
No time anymore
I remember my life

Things that Iâve done
Fights that Iâve won
Without a meaning at all â Now !

When death has arrived
And your body is cold as ice
No way to turn back
No chance left to change the facts

Now I face the mistakes
Mistakes that you canât erase
Too late for a change
Canât take back what Iâve said

Last breath has gone
No time anymore
I remember my life

Things that Iâve done
Fights that Iâve won
Without a meaning at all â Now !

Last breath has gone
No time anymore
I remember my life

Things that Iâve done
Fights that Iâve won
Without a meaning at all â Now !

When death has arrived
And your body is cold as ice
No way to turn back
No chance left to change the facts

God give me a chance
A chance for a second try
Like a mindloss it hurts
To accept this bungled life
