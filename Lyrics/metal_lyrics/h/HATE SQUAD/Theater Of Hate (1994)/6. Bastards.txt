Bastards

Fuck all you bastards
Fuck all you bastards
Fuck all you bastards
Fuck all you bastards

We hate your lies, corruption, false pride
You wimps, you wankers, you suck

We will hate you âtil we die
You decide for our lives
And weâll pay for lies with hate
Get the fuck out â Out of our way !

You hold the key
To our destiny
You do dirty deeds
Canât face reality

Fuck all you bastards
Fuck all you bastards
Fuck all you bastards
Fuck all you bastards

We hate your lies, corruption, false pride
You wimps, you wankers, you suck

We will hate you âtil we die
You decide for our lives
And weâll pay for lies with hate
Get the fuck out â Out of our way !

You hold the key
To our destiny
You do dirty deeds
Canât face reality

Canât you see ?
You treat us like jerks !
Time will not heal all our wounds

We will hate you âtil we die
You decide for our lives
And weâll pay for lies with hate
Get the fuck out â Out of our way !

You hold the key
To our destiny
You do dirty deeds
Canât face reality
Fuck you â Bastards !
