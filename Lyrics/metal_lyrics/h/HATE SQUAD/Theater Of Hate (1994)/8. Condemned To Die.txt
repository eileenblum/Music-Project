Home â I know the word
But where home is
I do not know

Life â I know the word
But my life failed
Is this the end ?

Drugs !
My only friend !

Home â I know the word
But where home is
I do not know

Life â I know the word
But my life failed
Is this the end ?

Friends â I donât have any
Who cares about me ?
Only the drugs !

Condemned to die
But what can I do ?
I need your help !

Drugs !
My only friend !
Help me !

Dreams of life and death
are dancing in my mind
Can you show me how to find â the right way ?

Home â I know the word
But where home is
I do not know

Life â I know the word
But my life failed
Is this the end ?

Condemned to die
But what can I do ?
I need your help !

Drugs !
My only friend !
Help me !

Dreams of life and death
are dancing in my mind
Can you show me how to find â the right way ?

Help me [repeat 4x]
Help !

Home â I know the word
But where home is
I do not know

Life â I know the word
But my life failed
Is this the end ?

Drugs !
My only friend !
Help me !

Help me !
