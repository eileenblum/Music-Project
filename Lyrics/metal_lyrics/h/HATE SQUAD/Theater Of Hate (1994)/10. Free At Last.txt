Oppressed for the colour of the skin
Times have changed â People began to think
Once oppressed for the colour of the skin

Free at last â Times have changed
Free at last â And rearranged

Now you have shown, shown the world
That resistance pays in the end
If you stand for your rights
You can change a whole fuckinâ land

Now reorganized â Like a new land
Worst times are over â Better times ahead
Ahead ! Ahead !

Oppressed for the colour of the skin

Free at last â Times have changed
Free at last â And rearranged

Now you have shown, shown the world
That resistance pays in the end
If you stand for your rights
You can change a whole fuckinâ land

Now reorganized â Like a new land
Worst times are over â Better times ahead
Ahead ! Ahead !

Once oppressed for the colour of the skin
Free at last !
