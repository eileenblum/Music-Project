Lifeâs sicker than you thought
So get up and face the facts
Keep fighting if you have failed
And one day the shit will end â My friend

Tear down the walls
Wake up â Fight back â Demand your life !
Tear down the walls
Wake up â Fight back â Demand your life !

Self â Defence is no offence !
Self â Defence is no offence !
So what !
Fuckinâ what !

Like diggers â The face in the dirt
The pressure dwells in your head
Whereâs your pride â Your will to live ?
Try to fight for every breath you take !

Tear down the walls
Wake up â Fight back â Demand your life !
Tear down the walls
Wake up â Fight back â Demand your life !

Self â Defence is no offence !
Self â Defence is no offence !
So what !
Fuckinâ what !

Blind leading the blind
Weâre puppets in our life
Deep inside itâs growling in my head
Why canât I win in this fuckinâ game called life ?
It is sad â Sad but true !

Lifeâs sicker than you thought
So get up and face the facts
Keep fighting if you have failed
And one day the shit will end â My friend

Tear down the walls
Wake up â Fight back â Demand your life !
Tear down the walls
Wake up â Fight back â Demand your life !

Self â Defence is no offence !
Self â Defence is no offence !
So what !
Fuckinâ what !

Self â Defence is no offence !
Self â Defence is no offence !
Self â Defence is no offence !
Self â Defence is no offence !
