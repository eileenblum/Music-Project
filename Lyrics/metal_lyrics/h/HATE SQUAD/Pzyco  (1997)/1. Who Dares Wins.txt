All the best for me!
A stupid way to be?
You're not me!
Why do you disagree?

All that I do need
Is fuckin' harmony
Think, choose, win -
An easy way for me!

Who dares wins
But nobody count my sins
So why should I lose in this game
I never will lose my aims
So why should I do mistakes?
Livin' in sin -- Who dares wins!

Who dares wins
Who dares wins

Let me tell you what
Don't rest your life in mud
Try to break -- out of your cage

Rules are made to break
So try to make your day
Bet your life for victory

Who dares wins
But nobody count my sins
So why should I lose in this game
I never will lose my aims
So why should I do mistakes?
Livin' in sin -- Who dares wins!
So dare, so dare -- you'll win!
Who dares wins

Who dares wins
Who dares wins

Who dares wins
But nobody count my sins
So why should I lose in this game
I never will lose my aims
So why should I do mistakes?
Livin' in sin -- Who dares wins!

So dare [8x]
Cause who dares wins!
So dare [3x]
Cause who dares wins!
So dare [3x]
Cause who dares wins!
