I walk the path of time 'til it's over
Why should I care what others say?
I tried to find the real independence
Please let me search, don't cross my way!

What do you say?
Freedom-freedom-freedom
For me, for me!

Make my day -- Freedom speaks!
Get outta my way -- Freedom speaks!
Come here to stay -- Freedom speaks!
My separate ways -- Freedom speaks!

Make my day -- Freedom speaks!
Get outta my way -- Freedom speaks!
Come here to stay -- Freedom speaks!
My separate ways -- Freedom speaks!

I know my past so I will look forward
Won't waste no time to count my sins
Who got the right to judge my existence?
I know the way so set me free!

Freedom-freedom-freedom
For me, for me!

Make my day -- Freedom speaks!
Get outta my way -- Freedom speaks!
Come here to stay -- Freedom speaks!
My separate ways -- Freedom speaks!

Make my day -- Freedom speaks!
Get outta my way -- Freedom speaks!
Come here to stay -- Freedom speaks!
My separate ways -- Freedom speaks to me!

I will decide what I should mind
I will ignore your rules and your lies
Able to eat more you can feed
I'll only bleed for what I see -- and what I feel!

I walk the path of time 'til it's over
Why should I care what others say?
I tried to find the real independence
Please let me search, don't cross my way!

Make my day -- Freedom speaks!
Get outta my way -- Freedom speaks!
Come here to stay -- Freedom speaks!
My separate ways -- Freedom speaks to me!

Set me free!
