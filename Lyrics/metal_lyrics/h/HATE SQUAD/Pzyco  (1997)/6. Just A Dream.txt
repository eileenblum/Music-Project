You said you will stand by me
I thought you know how I feel
But you killed the heart inside me
Now I can choke on my tears

Just in my dreams it is so real
You know exactly how I feel
You are the one who makes me win
But I know that's just a dream

Now all the pain reminds me
That we had better days
I know it was not your fault
But you destroyed my dream

Just in my dreams it is so real
You know exactly how I feel
You are the one who makes me win
But I know that's just a dream

But I know that's just a dream
But I know that's just in my dreams
- You know exactly how I feel

Just in my dreams it is so real
You know exactly how I feel
You are the one who makes me win
But I know that's just a dream

A dream -- But I know --
A dream -- But I know --
A dream -- But I know --
A dream -- But I know --
A dream -- But I know --
A dream -- But I know --
A dream -- Just a dream --
Just a dream!
