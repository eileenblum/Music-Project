Synthetic twin -- From skin to skin,
Synthetic twin -- The toxic sin
Synthetic twin -- From skin to skin,
Synthetic twin -- The toxic sin

Keep the sense of real humanity,
Don't fuck around with nature's harmony --
A circumstance that we don't really need
Don't build a fence --
Don't bite the hand that feeds --
The hand that feeds

Synthetic twin -- From skin to skin,
Synthetic twin -- The toxic sin
Synthetic twin -- From skin to skin,
Synthetic twin -- The toxic sin

Don't be proud of what you'll never see
A silent shout inside insanity
Regulate the source extremities

Exterminate the killing factories, the factories
Synthetic twin -- From skin to skin,
Synthetic twin -- The toxic sin, Synthetic twins!
