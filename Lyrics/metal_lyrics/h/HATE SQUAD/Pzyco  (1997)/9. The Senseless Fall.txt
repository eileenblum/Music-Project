Hear me, oh heaven I speak to you
And tell me -- Am I possessed by you
I heard the sirens callin'
I saw the angels fallin'
Salvation! Love nation!
Don't try to prove my day

Save my soul, make me free
Take control, no misery
Lead my mind, my destiny
Rule my life, how it should be

Hear me, hellfire I spit on you
But tell me, for what you want me to
I hear the devil callin'
I see the victims crawlin'
Damnation! Hate nation!
Don't try to cross my way

Save my soul, make me free
Take control, no misery
Lead my mind, my destiny
Rule my life, how it should be

Be yourself and don't believe the lies
Just follow the wings you see and pay the price
Learn how to love and to feel or learn to crawl
The meaning of life is about the senseless fall!

You made me, who ever you want to be
Don't hate me for the kind that I can't see
I make my own decision, I'll try to reach my vision
Evolution! Revolution!
This world is made for me

Save my soul, make me free
Take control, no misery
Lead my mind, my destiny
Rule my life, how it should be

Save my soul, make me free
Take control, no misery
Lead my mind, my destiny
Rule my life, how it should be
