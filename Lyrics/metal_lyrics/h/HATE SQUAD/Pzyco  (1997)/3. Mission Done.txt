I struggle for my life
And try to touch the sky
Be a loser or winner
I have to choose what's mine

Take care my friend
The coin has two false fuckin' sides
I also got problems,
One of them is I can't say:

Mission, Mission done [3x]

Life's teachin, I'm learnin'
That is the walk of time
Keep my life -- Rise above
Try to forget all pain

Take care my friend
The coin has two false fuckin' sides
I also got problems,
One of them is I can't say:

Mission, Mission done [3x]

Now I will require
To get what I deserve
Take my hand and check out
If you can go my way

Take care my friend
The coin has two false fuckin' sides
I also got problems,
One of them is I can't say:

Mission, Mission done [3x]
