Sometimes it's hard --
To live my truth of life --
The daily fight --
Against my human mind
I'm pzyco but still alive --
For me two wrongs make one right
The way I choose --
Might be o.k. today --
Don't need to say
I don't care anyway --
What for? What for?
I'm pzyco but still alive --
For me two wrongs make one right
Can you explain me your sight? --
Or give me a piece of the pie!

All that I give --
Is what I got before --
That was in fact --
The pain I got from you --
No more! No more!
I'm so alone --
Please come with me on my ride --
Within my heart --
I know I can turn the tide --
Should I?
I'm pzyco but still alive --
For me two wrongs make one right
Can you explain me your sight? --
Or give me a piece of the pie!
Sometimes it's hard --
To live my truth of life --
The daily fight --
Against my human mind
Alive [3x] --
But I'm still alive [4x]
