Can you hear my voice?
What happens in your mind?
You cannot take it away
You are my slave
Alone without gods
Let me see what lies inside

[Pre-chorus:]
I'm here - I'm coming back to you to possess your soul
I'm here - I'm coming back to you to dry your life from inside

[Chorus:]
I'm taking you beyond the dark line
To the reign of madness
I'm the emperor of your mind

I can see your secrets
Your anguish and dreams
Now they belong to my soul
Distorted visions,
Darkness, Confusion,
Flashbacks and fears in your head

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus:]
I'm taking you beyond the dark line
To the reign of madness
I'm the emperor of your mind
The master of the ancient secrets
Creator of nightmares
I'm the emperor of your mind

Feel the wind tonight
Here it comes and comes - the pain
Listen to the world
Waiting for your fatal time...

By the ways of madness
Through the fallen kingdoms
I'm coming to you
