Down - into the pit - I'll bring you, I'll bring you down
Down - give me your soul - I'll bring you, I'll bring you down

Can you hear these voices? it's hell that calls your name
Can you see these spirits? to hell they're taking your soul
Can you hear this silence? might you be dead now?
Can you feel my anger? it's midnight - farewell

Look in my eyes
You can see just hate
No mercy, pain left his old master
The blade in my hand
I want now your blood
I'm taking your soul - your power is my life

The skies turn red
Madness is my only god
Rain will wash your sins and your blood away
Don't you hear the crows?
They are here for you
Look out - the worm is behind you

[Chorus:]
Wake up - it's midnight - and hear: it's the calling of death
She is crawling
She is coming
Wake up - it's midnight - don't turn and look to your end
She is crawling
She is coming

Down - into the pit - I'll bring you, I'll bring you down
Down - give me your soul - I'll bring you, I'll bring you down

Can you hear these voices?
Can you see these spirits?
You can pray now
It's midnight - farewell

Can you hear this silence? give me your soul
Can you feel my anger? watching you fall
You can pray now
It's midnight - farewell
