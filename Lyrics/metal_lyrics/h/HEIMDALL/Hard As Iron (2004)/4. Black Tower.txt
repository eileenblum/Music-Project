The sun is turning black now
And the shades are falling down
In this lonely hall I stand -
O dark queen of my dreams
Where are your bright wild eyes?
Waiting for the time, for the time to come

Pre-chorus:
I feel you in my solitude tonight
And in the dusk I am
I close my eyes and see you again
In this black tower

[Chorus:]
Watching you crawl...

I hear an echo, a whisper
After that... the silence
In these melancholic walls -
I hear the darkness breathe
I'm still in this dim hall
Like in a dream, in a dream I live

Pre-chorus

[Chorus:]
Watching you crawl...
Watching you fall...
Watching you lie...
Watching you die

[Chorus]
