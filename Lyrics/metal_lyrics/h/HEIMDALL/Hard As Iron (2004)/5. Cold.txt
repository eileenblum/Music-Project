Where are you, my angel?
It's cold in this dead world
Where are your dark long hair?
Where have you fallen?
You fallen?

[Chorus:]
Among dark paths and tombs I roam
Why haven't you returned?
Again - my soul longs for her home
But tonight it's still cold

Where are you, my angel?
I've lost my way
For you I raise this song
I watched you flying
I'm bleeding

[Chorus:]
Among dark paths and tombs I roam
Why haven't you returned?
Again - my soul longs for her home
But tonight it's so cold
