I'm coming from beyond
Through the black ways of the past

I am here to complete the gods punishment
I am their noble heir - so it is written in the secret and dark scripts

[Chorus:]
Watch me in silence
Look to my power
Feel my stroke - as hard as iron

I am the anguish and fear
I am the worm inside

Burning with anger - I'll take you into the depths
Deserts will be frozen - flames will arise to the heights of skies

[Chorus]

I live in darkness
I knew death and despair
I am the emperor -
The master of your lives

[Chorus]

Hard as Iron
Hard as Iron
