In this glorious night, my flame is burning again under the stormy sky
In the shades created by the cold moonlight, I have come back for you

I am the sign of the gods
The son of the dark

[Chorus:]
Moon - Red light - I am the legend that lives on
Moon - Red light - Testimony of my return

Here I am again, from the abyss I was reborn
My spirit roamed, he has known and gone through the living and the dead world

I am the immortal Lord
The almighty soul

[Chorus:]
Moon - Red light - I am the legend that lives on
Moon - Red light - Testimony of my return
