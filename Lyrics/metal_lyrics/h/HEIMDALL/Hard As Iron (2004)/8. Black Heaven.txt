Look around - tonight - there is a strange atmosphere
No sound - no light - also the moon is black
Like her - like stars - I would like to disappear
To melt in the shades - to escape my memories

[Chorus:]
The crowd is gone
And the curtains are falling down
The start is like the end
Welcome to my beautiful land - my black heaven

Like in a gothic paint, the dim sea is still - no move
Cold winds don't touch and brush my skin anymore
Now words are dead - my song is fading away
I'll close my eyes - I don't want to be myself anymore

[Chorus]

My black heaven
