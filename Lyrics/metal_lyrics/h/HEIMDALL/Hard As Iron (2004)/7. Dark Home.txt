Show me what lies beyond the stars
Where the moon is black and the night has no end
Show me the path no mortal has seen
Give me the key - Take me home

I feel you
I still hear your dreams and your screams
I whisper your name in the wind
Can you hear me?
Can you see me?
I'm coming to you
I'm ready - reveal me the Word of the King

[Pre-chorus:]
I'm roaming through the shadows
I'm a prisoner between the light and dark
Like a damned phantom
Please take me away

[Chorus:]
Take me to the land without end
Through the black and infinite deserts
Take me through the shadows of the abyss
Through the door - the holy tomb - to the dark home

Endless valleys
Seas of fire
Dim blood red skies
The air is still tonight
Shadowy rivers
Dismal forests
I feel the door is near
So tell me what lies beyond

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Show me what lies beyond the stars
Where the moon is black and the night has no end
Show me the path no mortal has seen
Give me the key - Take me home

[Chorus]
