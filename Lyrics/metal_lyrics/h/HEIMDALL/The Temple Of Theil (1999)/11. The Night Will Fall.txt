[music: S. Duccilli, C. Gallo; lyrics: C. Gallo]

[Sidgar]
Tears take away the torment of my soul
And winds take away my desperate song
Spirits, sacred messngers of the shame
Of an evil lord, take away her proud soul

[pre-chorus]
I hear the clash of blades
Howling screaming for my revenge
What are you waiting for, still, 'fore my sword longing for victory

[chorus]
I bring the fire to the frozen heart
I sink my metal sword and THEN NIGHT WILL FALL
I hear thy voice while you are falling down
Thy helmet slides away and THEN NIGHT WILL FALL

In the smoke of the fires and the dust of the duel
On you who are my enemy I turn my stare of rage
Fearlessness and pride lent force to my strong arm
Which the song of the dark made ever more sure

[repeat pre-chorus / repeat chorus / solo / repeat chorus]
