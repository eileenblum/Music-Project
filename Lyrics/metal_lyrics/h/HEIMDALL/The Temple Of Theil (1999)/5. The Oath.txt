[music: C. Claps, S. Duccilli, C. Gallo; lyrics: F. Calluori]

In a nameless time when frost enveloped all the lands
And the glory of the first reigns had not yet shone
Storytellers sing that three gods made a noble promise
They swore eternal loyalty

[pre-chorus I]
Three emblems of stone
Sculpted in blinding light
Are three parts of the sacred icon
The Shield of Might

The gods decided to keep it in the land of Eternhill
Where there arose a majestic shrine

[pre-chorus II]
But one of the almighty
Betrayed the noble path
Uniting the three parts of the icon
Breeding chaos and war

[chorus]
He was broken THE OATH
Defying its force - And the power of the gods
He was broken THE OATH
Uniting its force - Of the three emblems of stone

[solo]

Beware, noble Sidgar, according to the holy oath - 
A god can not rise up in arms against another god

[solo / repeat chorus]
