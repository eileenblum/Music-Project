[music: F. Calluori, C. Claps, C. Gallo, S.Duccilli; Lyrics: F Calluori &amp; E. D'Amato]

From his infernal and divine gaze a dark malediction rained
So the anger of the god was appeased

[Daragor]
I promised you eternal love,
Infinite light
And access to the world of the gods

Now i give you a new kingdom - And the crown of black sorrow

[chorus I]
Your eyes will see some truths no mortals could ever see before
The gates of destiny will open to welcome your arrival
In the land of eternity you'll know the SECRETS OF TIME
to COME... COME... the SECRETS OF TIME... to COME...

Look to the sky tonight
The stars will show you
The secret path of men's fate

You will paint - Black scenarios of sorrow and death

[chorus II]
Your voice will sing dark poems, sad and tragic songs
But no men will listen to the dismal laments of your words
You can reveal to no one the SECRETS OF TIME
To COME... COME... the SECRETS OF TIME... to COME...

[solo]
to COME... COME... the SCRETS OF TIME... to COME...
