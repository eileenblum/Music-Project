[music: F. Calluori; Lyrics F. Calluori &amp; E. D'Amato]

[Iselin]
Will I ever arise from this endless dark abyss?
Where the god took me to roam
In the kingdom of loneliness and dusk
Will the sun ever return after this long eclipse?

[chorus]
How many times I heard her voice
In the twilight i heard her song
She fell in tears

[Iselin]
I'm prisiner, a leaf caught in a whirwind
Leave me alone! O dark voice
Of a fatal hate and endless pain
How many times I asked my blade to save me from these chains

[repeat chorus]

Why did you foolish men leave her secrets buried in the heart?
Why did you call her witch and liar?

[repeat chorus]
