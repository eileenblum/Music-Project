[bridge]
I give you this song - To celebrate the love,
The sorrow, the courage - Of Sidgar and Iselin

Silent alone amoung the ruins he stood - 
Looking toward the sky
Waiting for a new sign to announce a different end - 
For the mercy of the good gods
While the night was fading away - 
Sigar was bent on his bloodstained sword
Scaring the white dawn arising beyond the hills
And a night without stars filled his soul

Together with the shades of night
Sidgar rode away from the Temple of Theil
He knew he was condemened to roam
Like a burning star - Until he passed the gates
That sepearate - Our ways and paths
Of the other side nobody ever discovered where he had gone
Where his anger had burned

When the dark falls you will see
Shining the flash of his blade among the stars
When winds blow among the ruins
You can hear the lament of the warrior
For the sacrifice - Of Iselin
Her body still lies burried in the Holy Land
Awaiting the return of the lonely

[chorus]
Warriors, thy name will be
Carved in the stone - Of eternity
Warriors - poets and bards
Will sing - for centuries, for centuries
For times to come thy pride

May i give you this song (I sing glory, honour till the end...) - 
To immortalise the pride,
The honour, the glory - of Sidgar and Iselin

[solo / repeat chorus]
