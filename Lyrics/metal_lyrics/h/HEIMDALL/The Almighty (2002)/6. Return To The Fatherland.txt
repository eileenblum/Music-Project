Many years have passed
Many wars I have fought
Before I came back to you
For you I killed - for you I cried
O Cradle of my life

[pre-chorus]
I ran away towards some place far beyond
I told you farewell in order to defend
The honour of thy noble flags

After many clashes - After long journeys
I see you again, my lovely home
Dark, sad and still - No word, no move
To welcome my arrival

[pre-chorus]
Are these grey stones all of the grandeur left by war?
No - not all thy strength, not all thy fame is gone
Not all the memories in you live

[chorus]
Among these ruined walls, my Lords
I feel a great power still lives
So in this lonely place it shines on
Witness of the ancient glory

[chorus]
Among these ruined walls, my Lords
I feel the immortal spirits live
So in this lonely place they shine on
Guardians of the ancient glory
