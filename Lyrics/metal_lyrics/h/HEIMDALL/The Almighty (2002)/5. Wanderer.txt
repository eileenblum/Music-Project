I'm wandering in a world of chaos
Through a dark route in search of you
I have said farewell to my beloved land
Moved by courage and by cowardliness

[pre-chorus]
I see you every night
I see your wild eyes in my dreams
There - beyond a gate
Your still face is more and more far

I'm walking in an unknown world -
Lonely and secret - where gods have died
There is no religion, words have lost their value
All is confusion and without sense

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]
Your grey eyes look at me
Shining with a strange and wild flame
I feel you are a mystery
That lives inside and belongs to me

Where are you?
Why don't you appear before my eyes?
The empty space inside calls my name

[chorus]
