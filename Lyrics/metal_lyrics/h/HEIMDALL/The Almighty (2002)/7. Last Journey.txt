No mortal can see what I have seen
No god can feel what I have felt
No one can dream what I have dreamt
Please Father save me

I saw you in my dreams, queen of Hel
I felt your black flame in my heart
'Mid dark thoughts of a grey tomb-stone
My soul found itself alone

[pre-chorus]
The noble hosts, the immortal knights lift up their eyes to the almighty
They invoke my name watching the holy black ship sailing away

[chorus]
Somewhere - Out of time - Out of space
My soul roamed alone
Somewhere - Out of time - Out of space
My last journey began

Awe, stillness, melancholy and pain
Confusion, destruction and fear
O - Never all these moods have dwelt
In my sacred spirit

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]
