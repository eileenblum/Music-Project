"They said there was a distant land
The only one where you could be free
They told there was a noble world -
Its name was Godhall..."

I have spent my life to travel and roam
From land to land in search of Godhall
My eyes have seen rich and poor kingdoms,
Enchanted places and desert plains

[pre-chorus]
Kings and nomads
Fallen from grace
Knights of any race
Hosts of warriors
On my way
I have seen until my power failed

[chorus]
In nameless, dark lands
Like a burning star
I roam and run
In nameless, dark lands
Like a burning star
In search of Godhall

Now - old and still - I lay on my bed
My eyes, that saw all, are now tired
The sacred words, the ancient tales
Have been revealed to be false truths

[pre-chorus]
My past madness is now dead
Turning into stillness
The value and ardour of my youth
Left me and with them all my dreams

[chorus]

I have sacrificed my life to find you
Why now do I feel you near?

[chorus]
