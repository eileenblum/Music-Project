[chorus]
You died for those words
You lived for those words

Magic blood runs in thy veins
Show thy great value to the eyes of the gods
Warrior - it is thy fate:
Search for the Grail

[pre-chorus]
Forgotten words gave back life to its ancient force and blinding light
The holy script told that a pure-souled knight could pronounce the arcane formula
And reveal the mystery

Thirst for truth gave life to thy search
Through the blackest forests and deepest seas
Thy holy pride took you for years
To challenge the great mystery

[pre-chorus]
