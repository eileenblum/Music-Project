My wish for freedom
My sake forart
I have been travelling for centuries
My love for you
My thirst for knowledge
Gave life to my race

[chorus]
Floating in space
There is no way
Why have you, o gods, left me alone?
Up there you sit
On your thrones and watch
Spectators of the eternal race

I always miss you
And I need you
I feel alone in my quest
I run to you
I wait for your arrival
I create to see you again

[chorus]

I wrote these verses for you
To get near
I sing this song about you
Just to feel you

I wrote these verses for you
To have you nearer
I tell this story about you
Just to feel you

[chorus]
