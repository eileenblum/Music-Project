In these dark walls I celebrate the start of our journey
May our souls - humbled but brave - drink within the grandeur of this temple
The gloom and the glory of these altars

O poets, whirlwinds and storms announced the clashes
Be thy scripts testimonies of our noble deeds
In the holy name of freedom through the centuries

[pre-chorus]
In your hearts courage shines like the stars
In this holy nights - follow its light

[chorus]
In this battle with you I shall rise
To the sky my sword-arm - I'll pray for the souls
In this battle with you I shall fight
With honour and vigour - I'll call the gods

Look on the fallen kingdoms
Look on the dying brothers
Look on the raining blood
Now hear my calling

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]
