So condemned in the land of no one
I'm mortal and divine
The flame of power burns in my hands
Creators of life

[pre-chorus]
Like a god - I can give light and energy
To inanimate things
Like a mortal - I can't be the future
I dream and die

O unjust Lords, reveal to my eyes
What lies beyond
Show the way of eternal light
Make me free from my chains

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]
Rise beyond the light
My song and my cry
Touch the sky
My poetry survives
Through all times
My art creates life
And never dies

[chorus]
