During last night, I dreamt about you
I touched your pale, marmoreal skin
For awhile - then it faded
A sense of terror and delight came from my heart
I felt what it means to love you
But they took you away from me

I've written these words
to immortalize that time
To live and feel it one more time
While the dark of the night falls 
Illusive words
you can't give her back to me
You can not tell me what lies 
beyond her eyes
Make me feel her warmth

[chorus]
O Symit, I hear your song
I feel you when the night falls
O Symit, tell me the truth
Only in the shadows
I look for you
