[Heimdall:]
"Brother gods, Asgardr in flames
Now the ice is burning
And my voice invokes my sky
My blood feeds the earth...
Rain wets my bloody armour
My arm holds my sword
And my eyes are closing
I glimpse the SUNSET
Rain wets my bloody armour
My arm hold my sword
And my eyes are closing
I'll reach the SUNSET"

These were his last words
Leaves fell on his still remains - Now the wind too brushed the god
And all, all was still - Silver tears shone in the heavens
While the moonlight waned
