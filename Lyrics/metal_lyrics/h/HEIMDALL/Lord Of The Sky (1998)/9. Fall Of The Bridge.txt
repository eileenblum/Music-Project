"And one day will come the ends and thus is the fate of the gods"

In the midst of time, the power of the evil force created troops of darkness
Naglfar, built by the nails of the dead attacked

[pre-chorus]
The lord of the wind turned black all the world
And called up the giants of the north
Muspell's sons shattered the sacred and burning BifrÃ¶st
...HEIMDALL was a storm of steel

From the depths of the abyss, a stream of fire arose
It ran over all the creatures in the land of ice called Vigridr

[repeat pre-chorus]

[chorus]
Blowing with power through the mystic horn
The final clash began on the frozen plain
The noble gods headed by Odin rode at the call of the horn

[repeat pre-chorus and chorus]
