A terrible winter announced the beginning of the DARK AGE, 
when Loki gathered the hosts of hel, 
ice giants and all the dark forces for the last battle. 
So the shadows of the twilight enveloped trees' branches, 
rings of fire surrounded snow-capped mountains. 
Fear and madness enchained the souls of the living. 
Streams of blood flowed into the valleys, and while the old wise men, 
in ancestral temples, lifted up their hearts in prayer, 
the ancient words of the prophetess resounded high in the sky
