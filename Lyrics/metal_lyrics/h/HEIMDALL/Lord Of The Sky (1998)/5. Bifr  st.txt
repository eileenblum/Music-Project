White Lord sat at the limits of the sky
Son of Odin, the enemy of the giants of ice
He was the guarantor of the balance of the worlds

[pre-chorus]
Soaring high in the heavens
Defending the dwellings of the gods
He lived in the fortress of the sky

The Bright warrior oversaw the bridge of fire
It was BifrÃ¶st way between the earth and the heavens
He was the guarantor of the balance of the worlds

[repeat pre-chorus]

[chorus (x2)]
With his gold wings - 
He flew high in the sky And with sword of fire - 
He guarded BifrÃ¶st

[repeat chorus (x2)]

One day HEIMDALL was called to Odin's court...
