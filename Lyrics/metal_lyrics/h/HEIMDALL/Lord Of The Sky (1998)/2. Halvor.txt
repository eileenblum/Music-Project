"My Noble lord, I can't offer you either richness or jewels,
crowns or sceptres, either lands or nations to submit.
But hear, my king, hear my song telling the legends of an
ancient age when the evil forces contrasted the dominion
of the gods and the balance of the universe.
My Lord... My Lord, keep in your heart the saga of the god
whose name was HEIMDALL"

(Invocation)
