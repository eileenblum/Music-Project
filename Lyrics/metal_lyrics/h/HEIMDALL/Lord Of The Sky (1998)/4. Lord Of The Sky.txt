The LORD OF THE SKY - The force of the earth
The LORD OF THE SKY - The father of mankind
The LORD OF THE SKY - And no future no past

At the dawn of time when chaos dominated
The dark was dispelled by a sudden light
An awful noise shook the earth
Echoing throughout the universe

Flames invaded the bowels of the earth
And opened the gates of mankind

At the dawn of time a child was bred
By the waves of the sea at the limits of the earth
The force of the earth made him strong
The waters of the frozen lakes blessed him

Sacrificed blood made him immortal
Earth's humour sharpened his senses

[pre-chorus]
Life was in his hands
The earth gave him his name - it's HEIMDALL
The warden of the keys that opened the doors of the gods
..."and no future and no past"

[chorus]
The LORD OF THE SKY - The force of the earth
The LORD OF THE SKY - The father of mankind
The LORD OF THE SKY - And no future no past
Warden of the keys of the world of the gods

[repeat pre-chorus and chorus]
