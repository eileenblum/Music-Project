The cries of the dying gods rose like a sad song over black castle ruins
A Violent snowstorm began in the eternal winter night

Darkness reigned over the field of battle
War cries rang out throughout the worlds
Thunder and lightening announced the challenge
While a crystal wind howled over the plain
...HEIMDALL was before his mortal foe

[chorus]
In the duel his sword swung with power
The Defender of the gods
In the duel his bright blade sparkled in the dark
He was HEIMDALL Storm of Steel

Chaos and order, they faced each other
Blades quick like lightening, their burning eyes
The ring and the clash of dark revenge
Against the shield of the White God
...the earth was quaking with their mortal strokes

[repeat chorus]

Fury and anger in their eyes and their swords quick like arrows of fire
And their bloody armour, their bloody blades
They fell on the knees, mortally mounded, the one before the other till the end

[repeat chorus]
