[Book III â The Wanderings of Aeneas]

We are lost in these walls of ice
We are lost in this hell
We are lost in these mortal waves
Searching for a light beyond to ride

As bright as a blade â moon, watch over our lives
And show the new way to sail
Thy silver rays be our eyes

From the ashes weâll ariseâ¦

[Chorus:]
Rise â donât bleed tonight
Thereâll be a new day
Donât fall â waiting for the dawn
Together weâll arise
Stay side by side
Donât fall â waiting for the dawn

A new dawn will shine again for us
Dispelling the shades of this night
Erasing those flames from our minds

From the ashes weâll ariseâ¦

[Chorus]

Now, hear the windsâ¦
They will take us far from here
To new horizons and lands
The gods want a new fate for us

[Chorus]

[STORY]
So Aeneas spoke after sailing from Troy. The journey in search of
the promised land began. First, they sailed towards north to Thrace,
then, towards Cete, the cradle of the Trojan race, where a pestilence
forced them to go away. In a dream Aeneas saw Heperia, the land of
the west, as their ultimate goal; so they started a new journey towards
west. They encountered and fought against the Harpies led by Celeano.
They sailed on to Leucas in West Greece and stayed there a year. At
Buthrotum in Chaonia, they were welcomed by the former Trojan
Helenus, who had been enslaved by the Greeks but later freed, made
a king. He prophesied the Italian future and the route to take, including
going to the Sibyl at Cumae. Aeneas departed and sailed across the
Ionian sea to the boot of Italy and on to Sicily. They encountered the
Greek Achaimenides, who told them his story about the Cyclops. They
all had to flee Polyphemus when he appeared, and ended up at Drepanum
on the west coast of Sicily. Aeneas finished his account with the death of
his aged father Anchises.
