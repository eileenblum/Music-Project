[Book X â Aeneas at War]

[STORY]
With the Trojan camp under siege, Aeneas returned with his allies and
called his companions together, his words echoed around the whole plain
and pierced like arrows of fire, the hearts of men who were listening to him:

Iâm with you to celebrate this day
Iâm with you to draw a new world paint
Iâm with you when pride will be our god
and when the black clouds will cover the sky

United together
Under the noble flagâ¦

[Chorus:]
All of us â in this magic age
We are marching and marching on
The hardest way
All of us â in this mystic place
Revolution is calling our names

Iâm with you in these shady plains
Iâm with you in for deliverance
Iâm with you when the dawn lights us
and when the blood-stained curtain falls down

United together
Under the noble flagâ¦

[Chorus]

[STORY]
Led by his noble and brave words, they fought with honour and courage
and, despite the fact that they were in minority, they conquered victory.
But this clash saw many deaths in both armies. Turnus killed the young
and brave Pallas, Aeneasâ ally and dear friend, stripping him of his sword
belt, as a reminder of his victory, and Aeneas killed Mezentius, Turnusâ
strongest ally, and his son Lausus.
