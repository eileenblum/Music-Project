[Book IV â Dido and Aeneas]

[STORY]
Though bound by a vow to her husband Sychaeus, Dido fell in love with
Aeneas. Juno got Venus to agree to their union and arranged a hunt and
a storm to take them together into a caveâ¦ but Aeneasâ destiny was
different. The father of the gods, Jupiter, through the words of Mercury,
reminded the Trojan of his noble and sacred duty. The cold farewell words
of Aeneas, prompted by Jupiter, caused the anger of Dido who swore
vengeance. Warned by Mercury, Aeneas and his people hastily departed
in their ships. Abandoned and wrapped by pain and desperation, the
Carthaginian queen ascended to the pyre and took her sword, cursing him
and prophesying eternal hatred and war between Carthage and the
descendants of the Trojansâ¦

Why did you find rest here on my shores?
Why did your words light the flame in my heart?
You enemies will be the same that have loved you till tonight
Why are you fleeing taking my soul to distant suns?

[Chorus:]
Hear the ballad of the queen
A melody of pain
Hear my memories and dreams
Hate â for the years to come

I was so foolish to hear your words
The same that now are as cold as blades
Your friends will be your enemies
And the sun will start to cry
Hate will domain between our mates
I swear it to the stars

[Chorus:]
Hear the ballad of the queen
A melody of pain
Hear my memories and dreams
Hate â for the years to come
Hear the ballad of the queen
A melody of cry
Hear my memories and dreams
Damned â for the years to come

The flames burns on into my heart
It does go onâ¦ I must stop it
Cold friend, free me under the stars
And give me peace, give me peace,
Give me peaceâ¦
