[Book XI â The Despair of the Latins]

[STORY]
The battle paused for funeral rites for the numerous victims. After his
first victory, Aeneas mourned the death of his dear friend Pallas:

Away in the sky where the heroes live
There â thy spirit runs
Our hearts on a bed of thorns
Bleeding, pray for you and cry
You leave them alone

Fly, noble warrior
to the right arms of the gods
Fly, noble warrior
beyond the sun and the clouds
Fly to the high gold world
Thy armour shines on like thy value and pride
Fly noble and dear friend
While the silver rain goes on falling down

Away in the sky thy spirit flies
while these tears say goodbyeâ¦

[STORY]
After the funeral, Pallasâ body was taken to his father, King Evander,
who cried for the death of his beloved son and called for Turnusâ death
while pyres consumed the bodies of the deceased. In the council of the
Latins, the kings expressed their will to stop the war against the Trojans,
suggesting to make a treaty with them or, in alternative, to end the
conflict with a single combat between Turnus, as he was largely responsible
for it, and the chief of Trojans, Aeneas. Turnus who was not ready to
concede defeat, accepted the challenge. The council was interrupted by
the news that the Trojans and Etruscans were advancing. Turnus called
the men to arms. The battle began. It was once again cruel and bloody
and saw the death of another Latin hero, the noble virgin warrior Camilla.
At the end Turnus, defeated, retired with his warriorsâ¦
