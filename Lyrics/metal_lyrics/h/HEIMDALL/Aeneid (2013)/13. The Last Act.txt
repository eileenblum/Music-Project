[Book XII â The Final Combat]

[STORY]
It was the timeâ¦ Turnus decided to face Aeneas in a single combatâ¦
Aeneas acceptedâ¦ in his hands not only the destiny of Lavinia, but
above all the destiny and the future of his people. Too many warriors
have died in this war, too much blood was spilledâ¦ Aeneas invoked
the victory for the birth of a new breed where the Latins and the
Trojans could join and live togetherâ¦ At dawn, both armies gathered
on the plain for the coming battle between the two championsâ¦

[The Last Act (The Combat of Aeneas and Turnus)]

The sunâs just started his march
and the clouds darken the plain
Look â the swords high in the sky are ready to fight
The winds brush their skins
Now no move â eyes to eyes
Honour, pride, fates of their mates
in a single fight

[Pre-chorus:]
Hear the force of the winds
An era is dying
Hear the rumbling of thunders
The sound of the blades

[Chorus:]
Master of the thunder
Their future in your hands
Master of the thunder
Itâs the birth of the empire

The king is on the ground
Now defeated, bloody, unarmed
Praying for a noble burial
or his life to be speared
Around him, holy and bright
The sword â belt of his friend shines
Blinded by anger, Aeneas slays the foe

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

The storm is near
The hero fights alone
Aeneas slays the foe blinded by anger
