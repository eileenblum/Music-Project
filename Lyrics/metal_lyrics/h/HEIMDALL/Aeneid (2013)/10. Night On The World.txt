[Book IX â Attack on the Trojan Camp]

During Aeneasâ absence, Juno sent Iris to Turnus to tell him that the
moment for attack had come. So accepting the divine call to arms, he
and his troops marched on the Trojan camp, alongside the river. The
Trojans, according to the instructions of Aeneas, didnât respond to
Turnusâ challenge, remaining behind their walls. In the meanwhile,
Nisus and Euryalus, close friends, decided to pass through the enemy
lines in order to reach and warn Aeneas. In the silence of the night,
they fell upon the sleeping enemies, killing many of them, but when
their journey started, Euryalus was discovered and caught. Nisus, who
had managed to escape, returned but he could not save his friend and,
after heroically avenged him, met his death. The Trojans saw the heads
of these brave warriors impaled on enemy spearsâ¦ the battle started
againâ¦

Look up the horizon
The heavens blacken
The screams tear the silence
Watching above â the moon
No light here in this lonely land

Iâm in the dusk
Watching the world fall
Still in the darkness

[Chorus:]
Burning down
The gods are crying for our fate
Burning down â night falls down
here on the world

The armies clash tonight
The bloody swords twirl without rest
Fragments in black and white
Silver tears rain down from the skies

Iâm in the dusk
Watching the world fall
Still in the darkness

[Chorus]
