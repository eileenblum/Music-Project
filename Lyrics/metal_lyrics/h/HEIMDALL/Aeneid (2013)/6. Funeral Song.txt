[Instrumental][Book V â The Funeral Games for Anchises]

[STORY]
Watching the flames in the distance, the Trojans sailed back to Eryx
in Sicily where King Acestes received them. He and Aeneas decided
to hold funeral games to honour Anchises who had died one year before.
When new rays of sunlight shone high in the heavens and when the
stars had already gone away welcoming the birth of a new day, Aeneas
remembered the death if his beloved father Anchises, in the land of Sicicly:

âOnce more, hail, my sacred father: hail spirit,
ghost, ashes of my father, whom I rescued in vain
I was not allowed to search, with you, for Italyâs borders,
our destined fields, or Ausoniaâs Tiber, wherever it might beâ
[Aeneid â Book V]

The image of Anchises appeared to Aeneas, asking to come to him in
the underworld. In the meanwhile, Venus appealed to Neptune to
protect the Trojans during the journey and was reassured by him
that only one man would be sacrificed as they sailed to Italy. This
was the fate of the helmsman, the noble friend Palinurus who was
put to sleep by the god of sleep and fell into the water.
