[Lyrics by Guilher, Music by Andre]

The gas lamp that illuminates the pier walk
Attention to the woman that holds it
The stumble look in yours, that wonders
That involve, transmit the message
Telepathically she already awaits for me anxiously
To the coitus like the end of a saga
In the middle of the coitus, the blood let flow
From entrails of this beautiful virgin witch
She offers her orgasm and her blood that are pure
Will be blend to the semen and will make it pure
Alchemy, magic, women singing and dancing
Celebrate the force of the ritual of power
She flows naked with her involved body by the veil
Flittering now in a blue sky of crystalline world
I'm drinking of the evocation electricity
The death is the orgasm of spirit

Telepathically she already awaits for me anxiously
To the coitus like the end of a saga
