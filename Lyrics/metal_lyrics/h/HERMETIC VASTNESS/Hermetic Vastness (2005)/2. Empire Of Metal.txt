[Lyrics by Guilher, Music by Andre]

Hey warriors
Welcome to the world of... metal...
Our brothers fell in glory
Make us immortals...
Will be remembered in blood for the future generation...
And for us will be celebration...
In our spirits forever...
Forever...
The empire of metal
The empire of metal
The empire of metal
Our warrior's clÃ£ in, the silence of the night
Will evoke the power of our gods cause
Will fight to the conquest of the universe
Future in crystal ball is construction of the empire... Empire... empire... empire...
The defeat to us is just a legend
And isn't written in books of our ancestors
We have the key to evolution race
Lucified force that gives us pleasure to play the steel
The steel... the steel... the steel...
Empire of metal the touch to the swords is the contact
Empire of metal the touch of the swords is the contact
Come on to victory, the black sword order in the history
The winds flow the ritual flames to the ancestors
Batting the enemies blood and clinching the black sword
We declare the freedom and raise the flag of the empire...
Empire... empire... empire...
Empire of metal the touch of the sword is the contact
Empire of metal the touch of the sword is the contact
