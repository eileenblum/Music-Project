[Lyrics by Guilher, Music by Andre]

His mantle occult his million of faces
Comes the master walking from twilight
Throwning the seeds of stars, espheres of life
From his magic hands, he is the lucified
At his surround our spirits to assist him
Now stamped with ancient symbols of ancient battles
The energy irradiated throwgh the ressonant melody
Like a wasp in the void resplandecenting
Comes the master from the stars
The sunrise again, after a long winter of tears
Where the flowers were derelict
A floating walk in one more silent world
It`s time to appear the life from the magic spheres
