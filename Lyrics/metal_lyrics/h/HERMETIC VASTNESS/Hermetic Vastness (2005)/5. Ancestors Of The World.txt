[Lyrics by Guilher, Music by Andre]

All the ocultism of sabatian rituals
Celebrates the birth
Of the chosen ones
Giant salamander sings with his ignious voice
Dancer flare,
Dances according to the wind!!!
Cyclone of fire, waves in sea of fury
Voracious ocean
That cannot be sailed
And on land the five elements make the union
We are the fusion with
Something that cannot be seen.

Earthquakes are like discocerting drums
That rise the dust
And spread it on the eyes.
Go to the seven seas and to the four corners of the world
Thrown by the volcanoes that
Woke up for great party.

Come and join us for our banquet
Your lord invites you to be special...

Drink the sacred wine of consagration chalice
Dance in divine sanssarra of great at spÃ­rits...
