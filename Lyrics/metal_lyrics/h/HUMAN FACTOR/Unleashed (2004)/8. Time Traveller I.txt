[Olivares, Elbelman, Espinoza]

I, I've crossed through the mountains...
And I, must return to the past
Follow all my emotions
To see the light again
Ride then against the wind
There's fire in your soul...
Deep inside your madness never find control
Don't, don't ask me why
My journey has just began
And don't, don't try to stop me
I spread my wings and I'll fly to the skies
Flying across the seven seas
I'm tracing my life to the past
Memories of sorrow I'm leaving behind
New horizons are back
A brave new world is waiting for me
No one can take me apart
I'm free to choose, I'm living my life
'Cos now I'm saying Good Bye!
Ride fast against the wind
There's fire in your souls...
Deep inside your madness never find control
Don't, don't ask me why
My journey has just began
And don't, don't try to stop me
I spread my wings and I'll fly to the skies
No return, never again
Don't follow me...
