[Olivares, Elbelman]

If you want to race, my engine starts to roar,
'Cos now it's time to show you
That if you don't want to die,
Just try to keep in mind the road is not a joke...
Red light is turning into green...
Tires are spinning and burning!
Faster! Faster I'm driving my life...
Don't try to escape, my wheels are commanding my dreams
Listen what I say! horsepower through my veins
And fuel to keep my heartbeat
And if you still don't know I was born to win my goals,
And this is my road...
The ending line is coming near...
And once again I win!
Faster! Faster I'm driving my life...
Don't try to escape, my wheels are commanding my dreams
After the race I see it clear, a feeling of glory is into me...
I cannot stop, my life goes on and
Deep inside my heart is a V8!
Faster! Faster I'm driving my life...
Don't try to escape, my wheels are commanding my dreams
Faster! Faster I'm driving my life...
Don't try to escape, my wheels are commanding my dreams
