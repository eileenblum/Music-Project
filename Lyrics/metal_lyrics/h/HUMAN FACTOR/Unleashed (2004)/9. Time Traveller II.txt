[Olivares, Elbelman, Espinoza]

Here I am trying to return to my own world
The last age of hate now is waiting to regin...
Why is mankind condemned?
Why does the ocean carry death?
Fly to the past, I'm back in time to help
People from the pain
Fill with the light their minds and souls
To save the future of mankind
Rage inside, the ancient spirit will guide
For you to cry a change is so needed to live
Why is mankind condemned?
Why does the ocean carry death?
Fly to the past, I'm back in time to help
People from the pain
Fill with the light their minds and souls
To save the future of mankind
Time will be forever
You're a slave of time
