[Olivares, Elbelman]

Walking down the streets, some visions come to me
And darkness fills the world
Fire down below is burning up my soul
I spread my wings
I'm not afraid to fight the evil one
Again I'll try to give my best
The fallen angels now knock at my door...
I feel it near
Is this a dream?
Inside Hell...
Demons are fighting blasting all the ways
Inside hell...
An endless nightmare never lets you go... Oh no!
Battle was so strong, extermination blows
Skies are turning red
I'm waiting for the dawn to sacrifice their souls
Arising my blade
I'm not afraid to fight the evil one
Again I'll try to give my best
The fallen angels now knock at my door...
I feel it near
Is this a dream?
Inside hell...
Demons are fighting blasting all the ways
Inside hell...
An endless nightmare never let you go... Oh no!
