[Olivares]

When the lights have fallen, passions never end
Feeling the fire on me, and I'll take your heart away
I see your eyes like an eagle from the skies
You won't resist, you will be mine tonight
I get wild, not even ashes will remain
Nobody knows what it means, what fire is...
Fire, every night...
Fire, to survive...
Fire, every night...
Fire, to survive...
No more, I need the fire to spread my wings
I need the fire to fly to your arms again... Yeah!
I touch your body softly, and you close your eyes
I feel this like I'm dreaming, and you will be mine
Completely united, now it is time to burn your soul
Give me your love, and I will give you my last breath
I get wild, not even ashes will remain
Nobody knows, that it means... Scream and Shout!
Fire, every night...
Fire, to survive...
Fire, every night...
Fire, to survive...
No more, I need the fire to spread my wings
I need the fire to fly to your arms again... Yeah!
