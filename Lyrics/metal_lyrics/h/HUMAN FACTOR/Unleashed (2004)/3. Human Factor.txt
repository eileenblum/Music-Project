[Olivares, Elbelman]

The light has gone forever
Flashing memories in my head
Destruction is all arround me
Darkness and fear looking at my eyes
I see the light of dawn
Power awakes to return 
Nothing else to fear... Please believe me!
When the sun begins to shine so bright,
New horizons will rise from the dark,
and the voices of the world will be united
As you will see... Human Factor is the way!
...the way!
After all blowing disaster
An age of conscience must regin
Now take your own knowledge
Look at yourself and realize
I see the light of the dawn 
Power awakes to return
Nothing else to fear... Please believe me!
When the sun begins to shine so bright,
New horizons will arise from the dark,
And the voices of the world will be united
As you will see... Human Factor is the way!
...the way!
