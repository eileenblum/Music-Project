[Olivares]

Feel the passion burn
Running through your veins
Feel the engine moving you ahead
No! This is the way to live
No one can stop the journey you begin
Close your eyes
Touch your soul
Be the hero of your life
Your are free to choose your life
Try to understand
You are the one who cares
Be the one who cares
Be the one who strikes against
The pain
No! This is the way to live
No one can stop the journey you begin
Close your eyes
Touch your soul
Be the hero of your life
Close your eyes
Touch your soul
Be the hero of your life
