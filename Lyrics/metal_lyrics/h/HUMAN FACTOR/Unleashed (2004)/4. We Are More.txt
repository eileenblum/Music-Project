[Olivares]

Here from the mountain I see the world
Laying themselves about a fantasy world
Crying from freedom because they know... They were wrong!
Inside out the story goes, like a kind of slave, you know
But the Lord is not here, and now
We are more... Fighting for the same thing,
We know that we can and you know, that it's true
And you know... That we can be destroyed,
It's nothing more than an illusion, oh... We are more
Now I can see that we are not, just flesh and bones
Don't be a slave, you know you can...
Do what you want!

Do what you want, crying for freedom
Now it is time to arise, yeah!
I'm ready, I'm ready to fight!
