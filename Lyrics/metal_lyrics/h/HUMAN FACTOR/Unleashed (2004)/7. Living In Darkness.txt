[Espinoza, Olivares, Elbelman]

Into the field of horrors and sadness
I try to survive leaving behind...
...All my pain, I'll never fall again!
Fight is my name and killing is my game
I'll never give up, never surrender
...All your tears apart!
Now hear what I say
It's time to break the chains
Now I can feel it's to break free...
...i'm living in darkness
The end isn't far away
And sun will shine again
Why, I'm living in darkness
Try to feel the magic spell
Deep into your heart
After the night a beam of sun
Will show the path out of the dark...
And you must trust your faith
Now hear what I say
It's time to break the chains
Now I can feel it's to break free...
...I'm living in darkness
The end isn't far away
And sun will shine again
Why, I'm living in darkness
Try to feel the magic spell
Deep into your heart
