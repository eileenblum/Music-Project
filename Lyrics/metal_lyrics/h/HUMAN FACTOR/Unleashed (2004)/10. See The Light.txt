[Olivares]

Sometimes you feel that you are drowning in a glass
That you are lonely and you're forced to be alive
Look arround
Try to find the way
You're the one
That's going down 
Can you see
The light is near
If you want you'll survive
See the light
The light in front of your eyes
Be the one
The one against the pain!
Sometimes you need to feel 
That you're against the wall
To prove yourself
That you're strong enough
Can you see
The light is near
If you want to, you'll survive, oh yeah
See the light
The light in front of your eyes
Be the one
The one against the pain
I feel stronger than before
It's time to realize my thoughts
Realize!
Sometimes you need to prove yourself
That you are strong enough to fight against, oh yeah
