[Olivares / GenÃºa]

Long time ago, I had the future in front of my eyes
I was alone, and nobody show me the way
So much to do, I never though it could end like this
So many choices are left behind and I didn't know what to do
So young, so meanless,
I tried to escape from my Destiny
You know, I was under pressure
I would like to be back in time
Give me the sign
I 'll try to find my own way
Give me the sign now or tomorrow will be too late
Give me the sign
I 'll try to find my own way
Give me the sign now or tomorrow will be too late
Years go by and I need to know
What am I searching for?
Deep inside I hear the call
But I feel like a blind key
Let me know...Who I am...that's what am I waitin' forv
Deep inside I hear the call
But I feel like a blind key
So young, so meanless,
I tried to escape from my destiny
You know, I was under pressure
I would like to be back in time
Give me the sign
I 'll try to find my own way
Give me the sign now or tomorrow will be too late
Give me the sign
I 'll try to find my own way
Give me the sign now, or tomorrow will be too late
I had the future in front of my eyes
Give me the sign...give me the sign
