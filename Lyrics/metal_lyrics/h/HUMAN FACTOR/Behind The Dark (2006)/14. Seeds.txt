[GenÃºa / Olivares / Rozas]

Can you understand, what we are fighting for?
Can you see, the human misery
Can you feel the power among our minds
The strenght you need to fight against all odds
There is a place beyond time
Which your mind can't conceive
If everything has a reason
Why cant we discover it?
We are seeds, awakening for light
Bearing up against the pain we live
Look at my eyes and now you will see
The rising sun shining again
Shining again
Don't be afraid if you feel you are not alone
Evolved beings are keeping safe your soul
Have you ever felt that you already lived this life?
It might has sense, don't you think you are mad
There is a place beyond time
Which your mind can't conceive
If everything has a reason
Why we cant discover it?
We are seeds awakening for light
Bearing up againts the pain we live
Look at my eyes and now you will see
The rising sun shining again
Shining again
Time is out
Humanity failed
Why you don't care about others?
Why you are still worried about meanless things?
This mistake could kill you!

[Solo GenÃºa / Solo Olivares]

We are seeds awakening for light
Bearing up againts the pain we live
Look at my eyes and now you will se
The rising sun shining again
Shining again
