[GenÃºa / Olivares / Rozas]

Awakening in a dark hall
A freezing whisper lift me up
I am empty , I'm lighter
I can't remember anything
I need an answer to explain my numb
I need a key to understand the truth
I am a new man
In a new world
I don't know anybody
Nobody knows me
I am a new man
In a new world
I don't know anybody
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me!!
I try to look inside of me
I cannot find my past
This is awfull
I cannot see who I am
Without roots, without feelings
A new state of mind?
Or just a fake world?
Dazed and confused I'll try to find the path
I need some answer to explain my numb
I need a key to understand the truth
Sometimes I wonder
What if I had a Life Unchained?
But the time I've been here
I realize I cannot Escape!
