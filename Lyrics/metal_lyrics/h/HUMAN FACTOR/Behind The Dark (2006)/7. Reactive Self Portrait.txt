[GenÃºa]

A shield of pride used to heal the pain inside
Makes yourself feel a step ahead in life
Wear the chains instead of feel released...I told you
Greatness belongs to small minds
Do you Feel devastated for your own weakness?
Use your "reactive self-portrait"
I keep the strength to face the un-faceless
While you pretend to be what you are not
While you betray , your evil eye is behind the dark
Remember that nobody cares 'bout your "reactive self-portrait"
Words of fear turn to Everlasting knowing
Disguise to hide what you never want to show them
Look inside , is this all you can hold on to?
Greatness belongs to an empty heart
If the coward unconsciously designs strategies to survive
Why don't you Clean the scars?
I keep the strength to face the un-faceless
While you pretend to be what you are not
While you betray , your evil eye is behind the dark
Remember that nobody cares...

[Solo GenÃºa / Solo Olivares]

I keep the strength to face the un-faceless
While you pretend to be what you are not
While you betray , your evil eye is behind the dark
Remember that nobody cares ....
'bout Your "Reactive self-portrait"
