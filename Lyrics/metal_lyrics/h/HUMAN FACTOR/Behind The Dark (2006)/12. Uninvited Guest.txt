[Olivares / GenÃºa / Gulle / Rozas]

Just a number , just a fact
We come to this world , no one reacts
Enlighten souls are waiting to survive
You give us life, we give you pride
But you forget we need your light
We could be lost without your shining sun
Look in the mirror, just look inside yourself
You will discover your real side again
I'm the uninvited guest - the one who pay for your mistakes
I'm the uninvited guest - the only one you're gonna blame
I'm the uninvited guest - the one who pay for your mistakes
I'm the uninvited guest - the only one you're gonna blame
It seems to be that after all, we are just a waste to left behind
But we all have the strength to carry on
You give me the unwanted role
I expect to take this off
I'm not your slave, just leave me alone
Look in the mirror, just look inside yourself
You will discover your real side again
I'm the uninvited guest - the one who pay for your mistakes
I'm the uninvited guest - the only one you're gonna blame
I'm the uninvited guest - the one who pay for your mistakes
I'm the uninvited guest - the only one you're gonna blame
