(GenÃºa/ Olivares)

There is a burning fire driving my fate
Living my life to extreme I'm on my way
No matter what is on your mind, just let me be
Life is what I make it, you cannot stop my dreams

I have lived so many ways, I have been so many places
But this rage was always on my brain
I was trying to move backwards, I was my own enemy
Wings of steel will take me away

I feel stronger than before
In spite of all
I'm still stronger than before
'cause I only trust in me

I was walking through fire, you never saw it
You tried so hard to stop me , but I'm still here
Now I can hear the call, there is no turning back
I'm riding out the storm, I'll never break my pact

I have lived so many ways, I have been so many places
But this rage was always on my brain
I was trying to move backwards, I was my own enemy
Wings of steel will take me away

I feel stronger than before
In spite of all
I'm still stronger than before
'cause I only trust in me
