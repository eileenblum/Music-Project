[Olivares / GenÃºa / Gulle]

Tender eyes staring at the sky
full of dreams he never knew a lie
there were no hurting words of sorrow.
He didn't care about the world's grief
his mind was immersed in his fantasies
Give me shelter in your arms
Let me please go back in time
Let me be a child tonight
I just need to feel you in my heart
Little soldiers in my hand
trying to take over an imaginary world
Kneeling on the grass and nothing to concern
just childhood memories.
I used to wish, you had been there for me
A selfish thought of a little lonely heart
I wish I knew that you'd soon disappear
so we could make up all the wasted time.
What I'd give to be a child again
What I give to be waiting in your womb
Give me shelter in your arms
Let me please go back in time
Let me be a child tonight
I just need to feel you in my heart
Little soldiers in my hand
trying to take over an imaginary world
Kneeling on the grass, and nothing to concern
just childhood memories
