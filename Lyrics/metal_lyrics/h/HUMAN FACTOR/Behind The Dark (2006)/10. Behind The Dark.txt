[GenÃºa / Olivares / Rozas]

She is a Blackened Empty soul
A cold Breath in the middle of the dark
She is in charge of the final journey
Although she has never been invited
No where to go
No where to stay
Fear,
Is the only way to know
That she is always behind your back
Always she'll get you
Always she wins
Silently she appears behind the dark
Even you try to escape, you will see
You won't have the chance to hide away
She decides your role in the Masterplan
And If you try to fight her
You won't have the chance to hide from her
behind the dark
Sometimes we fight, Sometimes we win
But in the final fight
We always lose
That's the way it is
Nobody hears her call
And no one will answer your prayers
There's no way to know if she's still there
To take your soul away
Always she'll get you
Always she wins
Silently she appears behind the dark
Even you try to escape, you will see
You won't have the chance to hide away
She decides your role in the Masterplan
And If you try to fight her
You won't have the chance to hide from her
