[Olivares / GenÃºa / Gulle]

I've been trying to walk together with this ever changing world
But I guess I 've never been fast enough, I'm a step behind
I wonder if this is a joke, why are we reacting like fools?
But it seems to be the only way to reach our dreams and goals
The real fools are treated like cools,
I rather a good one than a cool one
The real good are treated like fools
And everybody laughs and laughs of them
The more I wonder why
It seems the less I understand
And every little answer I get
It makes me find out it is all unfair
I wish I have an answer to every hopeless soul
I wish I have the key to lock up inside your minds all those hurting thoughts
There are good ones crying and the whole world doesn't care about
There are cool ones dying and it makes me feel with my tied hands
The real fools are treated like cools,
I rather a good one than a cool one
The real good are treated like fools
And everybody laughs and laughs of them
The more I wonder why
It seems the less I understand
And every little answer I get
It makes me find out it is all unfair
