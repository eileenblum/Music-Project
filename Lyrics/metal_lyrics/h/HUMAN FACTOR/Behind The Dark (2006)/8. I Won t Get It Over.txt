[GenÃºa / Olivares]

Strange Voices in a middle of a dream
Are screaming from reality again
My arms are trembling and I wake up in this hell
I realize my mind is breaking me
I Blind my eyes with the shadows of the night
My heart is bleeding, meanwhile you play with me
Cos' while I dreamt with your world of fantasy
You took my breath away, and broke my loving heart
I believed in you,
Now you must pay for all the pain,
I won't get it over
I believed in her,
Now she must pay for all the pain
I won't get it over
Awaking lonely, with anger in my veins
I can't control this rage inside my head
Confusing feelings made fade my mind to red
I can't believe I took your life away
I Blind my eyes with the shadows of the night
My heart is bleeding, meanwhile you play with me
Cos' while I dreamt with your world of fantasy
You took my breath away, and broke my loving heart
I believed in you,
Now you must pay for all the pain,
I won't get it over
I believed in her,
Now she must pay for all the pain
I won't get it over

[Solo GenÃºa / Solo Olivares]

You rip My loving heart, I won't get it over
I'll rip your bloody heart, I won't get it over
