[GenÃºa / Olivares]

I was breathing from the bitterness
Looking for hidden truths of life
Thinking that you made each clue was denied,
I wondered ...was my life wasted and gone?
My father always told me
"you are the black sheep"
He blamed me for the things
that happened in my life
he don't remember when he abandoned me...
I was alone ,I could not kill remains!
We Twine the threads of destiny
learning from the past we'll ride away together
Out from the abyss you will realize
That in this changing world, everything's connected
Threads of destiny
I was trapped into my lonelyness
I promised never fall again
But when I look behind I feel a frozen sweat
I wonder If I could change my fate? Yeah!
My father always told me
"you are the black sheep"
He blamed me for the things
that happened in my life
he don't remember when he abandoned me...
I was alone ,I could not kill remains!
We Twine the threads of destiny
learning of the past we'll ride away together
Out from the abyss you will realize
That in this changing world, everything's connected
Threads of destiny
