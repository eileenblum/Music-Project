[Solo Olivares]

I've been faking a life made by myself just to protect you
To conceal you from this hurting world outside my wall outside my wall,
Now I feel so'lone, so empty, I was so selfish
How can I explain?
All I did was protecting me for hurting you
Can you understand?
I can't stand to see you suffering
Can you understand?
Is it Love Insane?
Liar, I can see my face so complicated
Liar, every time I close my eyes and think about you
Liar, an accusing voice inside my head is
Liar, how can she forgive this Lie?
Forgive this lie all the things we made all the step we gave,
are just to forget? Now you're hurt and I'm so scared,
I feel so alone living this way
I was good and you were mean,
just a lie to make you believe in me.
Can you understand? I can't stand to see you suffering
Can you understand?
Is it Love?
Am I Insane?
Liar, I can see my face so complicated
Liar, every time I close my eyes and think about you
Liar, an accusing voice inside my head
Liar, How can she forgive all this Lie

[Solo GenÃºa / Solo Olivares]

I swear I never meant to hurt you (liar)
I just wanted to be your shield (liar)
Believe in me!
