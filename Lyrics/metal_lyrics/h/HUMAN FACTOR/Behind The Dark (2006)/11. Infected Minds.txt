[GenÃºa]

I am your guide, the reflections of all your feelings
All what you do is up to my own expectations
Now you will see the power of what you're thinking
You never thought that all your feelings become so real
I live in the depth of your conscience
Since you were born everything goes to the way I planned it
You can't realize I am regining inside of you
I am the one guiding your mind
Infected minds are controlling your destiny
Are you prepared to take the consequences
I tell you what you have to do here and everywhere
Your human side is hidden behind this conspiracy
You know that is all in your hands but you don't want to see
This is the price you are paying for trying to be a step ahead
I live in the depth of your conscience
Since you were born everything goes to the way I planned it
You can't realize I am regining inside of you
I am the one guiding your mind
Infected minds are controlling your destiny
Are you prepared to take the consequences
Infected minds are controlling your destiny
Are you prepared to choose your way
