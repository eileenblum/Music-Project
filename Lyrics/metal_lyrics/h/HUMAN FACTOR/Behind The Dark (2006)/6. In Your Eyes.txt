[Olivares]

[Solo Olivares]

Sometimes, when I look at you
I can see your spirit telling me the truth
In this world of fake faces
I can see you got a broken heart
Your silence break me through
My soul can't wait you talk me too
In this world of fake faces
I can feel you got a broken heart
Outside I can see
A happy smile on your face
But your eyes are telling me the truth

[Solo GenÃºa]

Why are you trying to escape,
I notice you are in pain
In a world of changes
I can see you got a broken heart
Outside I can see
A happy smile on your face
But your eyes are telling me the truth
I see the sun and the rain
I feel when your heart is in pain
I hear your voice is afraid
In your eyes, your eyes
Every time I close my eyes I can see you there
Why don't you cry for help if you are next to me

[Solo Olivares / Solo GenÃºa]

I see the sun and the rain
I feel when your heart is in pain
I hear your voice afraid
In your eyes, your eyes
