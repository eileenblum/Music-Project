She's so totally in love with me
But I am too much of a fucking coward
To be anything for her
Because I am too afraid to find something worthy of love in myself

And I am being smothered
Crushed by my own inabilities, insecurities, instability, crushed
And I am being smothered
Crushed by my own inabilities

And I'm afraid to move around her
Without calculated action
She just might figure out
That I want nothing more than to love her back
And I do, I do

I want to feel that, the truth is that
While she's looking for ways to help calm the storm in my chest
I'm looking for ways to keep her at the end of my outstretched arms
A welcoming sight indeed but a trick nonetheless
A welcoming sight indeed but a trick nonetheless

And I can't, I can't take this

This constant back and forth like waves crushing rock
And I am being crushed

She can't see me the way I see myself
It will break her
It will, it will break me

And I am being smothered
Crushed by my own inabilities, insecurities, instability, crushed
And I am being smothered
Crushed by my own inabilities

And I wish, I wish I could live in another skin
Someone else's maybe but anything other than my own
Because it's getting too tight
And desperation has me longing to leave this shell behind
Leave this shell behind

And I wish, I wish I could live in another skin
Someone else's maybe but anything other than my own
Because it's getting too tight
And desperation, desperation has me longing to leave this shell behind
(Leave this shell behind)

Shed it all and leave her here
With the image she and I created of me
