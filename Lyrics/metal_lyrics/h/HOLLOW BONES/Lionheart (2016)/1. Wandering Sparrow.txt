And in him grew a rage
That so desired to be known
Yet it remained quiet and unheard

And in a stroke of genius or tragedy
The universe sent him to his grave
And his rage went quietly with him

This is the story of our age
This is the story of our age
I am the voice of nightmares
I am the voice of nightmare
