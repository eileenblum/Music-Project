Brother where have you gone?
Why have you left me? You were here just a moment ago
And sometimes it feels like you're lingering
Still lingering

Looking over my shoulder
I front like everything is okay, like everything is okay
The truth is I'm still so fucking mad that you left me
To face the world alone, to face myself alone
I put on a brave face for the people I love

But my heart is rotting without you here
It's been six years now and time hasn't
Done anything to heal the wounds you left

I still don't know if you did this to yourself or not
It was supposed to be me and you
Against the world like some clichÃ© movie line

And there at the center of my pain
You resonate in a cadence of fury

Without you here I see nothing in myself
Without you here I see nothing, nothing

My heart is rotting without you here
And it's been six years now
But we were young and reckless
And we said things that we hoped that we'd
Understand someday when we grew up
When we grew up

It wasn't your fault, it wasn't your fault, Jim
(I can see now how helpless you were)
You had the weight of the world crushing your shoulders
(Locked behind the fortress you built)

And you thought the blame was on you
It wasn't your fault, Jim
(I can see now how helpless you were)
And now I get it, I understand now
It should have been me
(Locked behind the fortress you built)
I wish, I wish it had been me
