Where do I find the strength to live in this world?
In a world hungering for my dreams and disposition

We were promised it all
But instead what we got was a monster, ever thirsting
One that lives inside of us
And one that we recognize as the world around us

We are destruction
And as the world swallows us whole
Our monumental failures
Will be the only thing left behind

We can either be crushed
Under the weight of that truth (The weight of that truth)
Or one by one we can spread our wings
And together lift humanity

We are the crawling flesh of the Earth
There is no need to take what we have
We'll keep consuming until we're drowning
In overstimulation and stupidity

And all I see
And all I see is that we're a fucking plague
We'll keep consuming until we're drowning
Until we're drowning in our precious belongings

We can either be crushed
Under the weight of that truth (The weight of that truth)
Or one by one we can spread our wings
And together lift humanity

I want to believe that man can shine bright
Instead of being snuffed out
In the dark by our own breath
By our own breath

I want to believe that man can shine bright
Instead of being snuffed out
By our own breath in the dark

The end of the world is coming
And it will be by our own
Inability to love, to grow and to move forward
We are on our own
