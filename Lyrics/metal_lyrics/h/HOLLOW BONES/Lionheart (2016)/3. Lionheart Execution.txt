"Dear God," she cries, "make it stop!"
I am a ghost, I am a ghost of who I once was
A shell of who I should be

There is a boiling rage
Sitting right beneath my skin
I've seen her cry again and again
For the love of someone who isn't there

Begging for the reassurance that was once promised
But no, the ugly face of what we call humanity
Has abandoned her as she's left struggling
To find an answer to what she's done wrong

But it is her fellow man that has wronged her
Shamed her into believing that she is broken
She's not broken
She's not broken

The god she was taught to turn to has sentenced her
To eternal suffering, to eternal suffering

An execution wearing the face of banality
It's wearing the face

Death by false values
We've signed the orders for her execution
This world has turned its back on her
And we've signed the orders for her execution

I always swore I would do more than just exist
But my fire has burnt out and I am just suspended
I always swore I would do more than just exist
But my fire has burnt out and I am just suspended

(I will love, I will grow)
(I will move forward)
(I have the heart of a lion)
(The heart of a lion)
