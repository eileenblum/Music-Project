In my dreams I have a fever but they're not fever dreams
I'm just so fucking mad that you won't ever hear this
Unwilling or apathetic, I guess it's all the same
But your voice will always be the roots that keep me here

Bones laid upon bones

Bones laid upon bones that inhabited my life
And I thought that you'd come to put them to rest
I couldn't have been more wrong
You just added, you just added to the remains

And I have been so let down by you

This is all on you
This is all on you and I've been left to burn
You left your life
You left your life scattered across my heart

You are the lesson learned the hard way
That love will always let you down

Bones laid upon bones that inhabited my life
And I thought that you'd come to put them to rest
Bones laid upon bones that inhabited my life
And I thought that you'd come to put them to rest

Because in the pale light of the aging days
When I lie by myself in between
Pages and quotes you made sure I'd never forget

In that pale light I see your face
Pale like your skin
Pale like the feeling of being forced to let go
Because you didn't have the courage
To tell me you didn't love me anymore
