I am selfishness incarnate
Self-loathing personified (Personified)
This is gonna be a fucking nightmare
I'd say I don't feel right in my own skin
But honestly that's not enough to describe how bad it's been
Living with myself these past few years, I am ashamed
I'm at the end of my rope
Surrounded on all sides by sharks

These old sails are getting tired
Carrying the weight of these beautiful bones
The weight of these beautiful bones
And I'm tired of dragging everyone down with me
Down with me

The guilt like lead in my guts
The guilt like lead in my guts
I have no one to blame but myself
This is my life and it's all I've known
I have no one to blame but myself
This is my life and it's all I've known
It's all I've known

The truth is when you dance with the Devil
You wait for the song to stop
The truth is when you dance with the Devil
You wait for the song to stop

I am selfishness incarnate
Self-loathing personified (Personified)
I've spent all my time searching
For my reflection in those I love (In those I love)
But I'll always be let down that way
Because what I'm looking for should be in me

Why isn't it in me? It should be in me
Why isn't it in me? It should be in me

I feel like a raw nerve
Exposed, alienated with no purpose
No direction, nowhere to feel at home
What happened to the courage
I grew up telling myself that I had?

What happened to the courage I swore I had?

I am the voice of nightmares
And I am never satisfied
And I am, I am never satisfied
