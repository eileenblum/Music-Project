I'm losing sleep and I'm losing heart and while that's okay
I just don't think that there's a place for me
At dusk tomorrow, I just don't think that there's a place for me
When the sun sets

So bury me and my hollow bones
As I blink away the life I knew
Or give me something worth fighting for
So bury me and my hollow bones
Or give me something worth fighting for

Every day I'm forced to look into the empty eyes of my fellow man
There is no empathy there, there is no understanding
Focus your eyes inside yourself
This is no way to live, this is no way to live
No way to live

Tell me, do I sound like I'm fucking happy?
These are the words from the mouths of your youth
You're killing your children with neglect
You're killing your children 'cause you can't set down your pride
You're turning a blind eye when they needed you the most
You put it all on someone else, wash your hands and walk away

This is what we do, it's what we're taught works
It's what we believe
They say they understand but there is no empathy
In the eyes of my fellow man

You're letting the world around you fall apart
And you're letting that broken world raise your children

Fuck
