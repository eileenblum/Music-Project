These days I'm dreading sleep
Avoiding it like lovers avoid gazes when caught in a lie
Because I fear my dreams will be better than what I'm living
And I'm living less than half my dreams

A thick cloud of smoke
Has taken up permanent residence in my lungs
To keep your face from haunting me
To keep your face from haunting me

Hoping my mind will finally find some peace
Or piece of mind and you can have a piece of mine
'Cause it's impossible to pretend
I don't care what you think

Hoping my mind will finally find some peace
Or piece of mind and you can have a piece of mine
'Cause it's impossible to pretend
I don't care what you think

They say that misery loves company
But I have never been more alone
And I'm starting to think that love loves misery

They say that misery loves company
But I've never been more alone
And I'm starting to think that love loves misery

A thick cloud of smoke
Has taken up permanent residence in my lungs
To keep your face from haunting me

Hoping my mind will finally find some peace
Or piece of mind and you can have a piece of mine
'Cause it's impossible to pretend
I don't care what you think

Hoping my mind will finally find some peace
Or piece of mind and you can have a piece of mine
'Cause it's impossible to pretend
I don't

It's 3 A.M. and through tight lungs
And sweaty palms, my peace of mind
Goes to war over your pretty face
I watched the snow fall and bury your bones
