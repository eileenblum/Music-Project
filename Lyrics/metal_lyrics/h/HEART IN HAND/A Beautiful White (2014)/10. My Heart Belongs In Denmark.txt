Can you keep a secret? I know I can't.
Words fall from my lips like waterfalls,
We drown in what we call love,
The idea of your pale complexion, it drives me wild.

I can't take my eyes off of you. Take me to where I lay my head,
But the truth is, you don't really care. You don't even care about me.

You must love the rush, coming up on lust,
Not thinking about tomorrow, sweating out our trust.

It runs down, down the small of your back,
Walking up alone and empty, but I'm used to that.

I wish I could stay here, but I can't.

It's the all I can't be that I fear, now I'm scared that I might disappear,
Tell me how I'm safer now, I can't take my eyes off you,
Take me to where I lay my head.

You will always have a place, in my heart.

It's the all I can't be that I fear. Tell me how I'm safer now.

I can't see this side of you. It hangs with the doubts 'round my neck.
If you were better than the truth, then let me be the love you forget.
[2x]

It's the all I can't be that I fear, now I'm scared that I might disappear.
Tell me how I'm safer now, I can't take my eyes off you.
Take me to where I lay my head.
