The weight is too much to bear,
Crushing my dreams, crushing everything around me,
Even though I'm surrounded, I feel so alone.

I can always hold on. I can always hold on for something more,
It just takes time.

I'll wait a little longer, for this feeling to pass. Maybe I can sleep it off.

Fells like, I'm walking on broken glass,
Every step gets harder, what a bloody mess I made.

Finding a balance, just take things day by day,
One foot before the other, I'll come out on the other side, just fine.

I've been down, I've felt the lowest of the lows,
My world turned got upside down, but I managed to turn it all around,
And I almost left, I almost left you. [2x]

Take a side, take a side
I know I will.

Feels like, I was walking on a tightrope,
But I learnt my lessons, I realized what meant the most to me.

Finding a balance, just take things day by day,
One foot before the other, I'll come out on the other side, just fine.

I've been down, I've felt the lowest of the lows.
My world turned upside down, but I managed to turn it all around,
And I almost left, I almost left you. [2x]
