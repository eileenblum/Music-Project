I know, feelings change,
But why this sudden change of heart?
You are the one that found me,
Not the other way around.

And I'll be ok, in the end.
Until then, I'll keep this to myself.

And my perception of you,
Has vastly changed these last few months.
Two weeks is all it took to change your mind, about me.

Am I trying too hard? Push me back against the wall,
And if it hurts this much, then is it really worth it?

Forever alone, forever alone.

You can't pretend, that you never loved me.
You can't deny, that you'll always care.
So go ahead and lie, to yourself.
You are the reason, I now doubt myself, everyday.

I'll take to this bottle, just to keep you off my mind.
A drunken haze, is all I know now.
A drunken haze, a sober distance.
And if it hurts this much, then is it really worth it?
And if it hurts this much, then is it really worth it?

Forever alone, forever alone.
For this last time, let me tell you...
