No remorse and no respect, no romance and no regret,
This is how we spent our nights, this is how we live our lives.
[2x]

Drag me aside, and close the door,
Shut the world out, no one will ever know.

Last night you told me, everything,
What's on your mind? It's on the tip of your tongue,
Lie to me, come lie to me.

It was never my intention,
But it was always at the back on my mind,
The nights get darker before the light.

Spit it out, that dirty secret in your mouth,
Spit it out, last night you told me...

I'll find it hard to keep this to myself.
My conscious can't rely, on sealed lips alone.

I can't believe a single word from your mouth,
And I can't believe, this is happening.
[2x]

Last night you told me, everything,
What's on your mind? It's on the tip of your tongue.

I'll find it hard to keep this to myself.
My conscious can't rely, on sealed lips alone.

No remorse and no respect, no romance and no regret.
This is how we spend our nights, this is how we live our lives.
[2x]
