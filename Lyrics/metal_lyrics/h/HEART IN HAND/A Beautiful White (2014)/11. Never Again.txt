Instantly hooked,
On the whole situation and what we had,
Blind to your lies, I took you inside,
And kept you as if you were mine,
It all happened so fast.

I don't know how I couldn't see past your lies and deceit,
It kills me inside, to think that I let you be a part of my life.

Never again, will I put my trust in someone like you,
And never again, will I let my guard down and be so naive.
Never again, never again. I hope to never see your face, ever again.

Everything changed,
in a moment and everything turned sour,
Blind to your lies, is this something, I could never see,
Or that I could revive?

You are nothing. You are no one.
[2x]

I don't know how I couldn't see past your lies and deceit,
It kills me inside, to think that I let you be a part of my life.

Never again, will I put my trust in someone like you,
And never again, will I let my guard down and be so naive,
Never again, never again. I hope to never see your face, ever again.
