These flowers wilted, like your love for me,
And I have this memory,
This memory of you.

In my head,
As clear as a photograph,
An image of you holding my hand,
Forever on my mind,
I wish I never let you leave,
Watching you walk away, nearly killed me.

Blurred by poison, my eyes can't see my mistakes.
When you left, my lungs gave up.
I'm a shell of what I used to be,
I'm a shell of what I used to be.

All I have is this memory of you.
