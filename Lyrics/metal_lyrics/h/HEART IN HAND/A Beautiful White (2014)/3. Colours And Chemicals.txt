I'll carry myself, as well as I can,
I'll put on a brave face, and face the world,
No one will ever know,
No one will ever know, how fucked up I am.

The simplest of things, seems so great,
That look in your eyes, means the world to me,
This is dedicated to you, you make me feel so alive,
When you're around, I feel protected.

You make me feel, so alive.
You are, the only one that knows the real me.

Life rushes by, at a pace that we can't keep up with,
These feelings are real, embrace them,
There's nothing to fear, you're by my side.

No one will ever know, how much this means to me.

The simplest of things, seems so great.
That look in your eyes, means the world to me.
I'll keep this to myself, because you are,
The only one that knows the real me.

Life rushes by, at a pace that we can't keep up with,
These feelings are real, embrace them,
There's nothing to fear, you're by my side.

Place your hand, on my chest, my heart in racing,
I don't want you to leave, please don't go,
Take me with you.

This is dedicated to you, you make me feel so alive.
When you're around, I feel protected.
You are, the only one that knows the real me.
