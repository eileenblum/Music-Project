Say what you want
Spit your venom
Spit your poisoned words
They only fall deaf ears
No one is fuckinâ listening

A negative mind will get you nowhere
A negative life leads to nowhere
Few years will pass
Your perception of life will change
Growing up is clearly too hard for you
For you

There is more to life
More to life than hate
And I know success is the best revenge
So Iâll keep pushing forward

We are the strongest we have ever been
We are the strongest we have ever been
And I feel unstoppable
And I feel
I feel unstoppable

You wonât break me
I feel sorry for you
You wonât break me
Sad and pathetic
You wonât break me
I feel sorry for you
You wonât break me
Sad and pathetic

Clench your fist
Throw a punch
Embrace the hate
It only makes you stronger

Clench your fist
Throw a punch
Embrace the hate
It only makes you stronger
