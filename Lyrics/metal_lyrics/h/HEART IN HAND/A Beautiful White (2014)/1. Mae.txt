1. Mae
You told me stories, now I have them first hand,
While you cry yourself to sleep, I stand here helpless,
Feels like my hands tied behind my back.

Pour all of your insecurities into me,
And IÂ´ll paint a picture of, how beautiful you really are,
And IÂ´ll always be here, whenever you need me, my darling.

You close all of your doors, but just let me in,
IÂ´ll smash the lock, if you donÂ´t give me the key,
Hand your heart over to me,
You donÂ´t have to face this all alone.
DonÂ´t face this all alone.

Rest your head, on my shoulder,
Spill your tears,
I donÂ´t mind.

I hear you screams for help,
IÂ´m helpless, you need to let me in.
I hear you scream for help,
Let me in.

And IÂ´ll always be here, whenever you need me.
And IÂ´ll always be here, whenever you need me, my darling.

You close all of your doors, but just let me in,
IÂ´ll smash the lock, if you donÂ´t give me the key,
Hand your heart over to me,
You donÂ´t have to face this all alone.
