This time last year.
I'm a loaded gun, and I'm about to go off,
Taking shots, we're all still awake,
I'm going to hell, and your coming with me.

My eyes are open wide, look into me,
I can see where this is heading, follow me,
I wouldn't change it for the world, or start a new,
But sometimes, you push me way to far.

Like New Years Eve, you always come back around.
Like New Years Eve, you always come back.

This time last year we're in the same place, nothing's changed. [2x]

You believed in me, you said I was your God.
You said you had faith in me, faith in me,
And if I could, turn water to wine,
We would be pissed all the time.

This time last year.
It's time to turn things 'round, to make a change.
It's time to turn things 'round.

Now things are different, it's time to settle down,
A beautiful white, a blank page,
It's time to start from scratch, a fresh start.

You believed in me, you said I was your God,
You said you had faith in me, faith in me,
And if I could, turn water to wine,
We would be pissed all the time.
