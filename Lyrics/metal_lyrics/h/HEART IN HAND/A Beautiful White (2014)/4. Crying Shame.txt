Waking up on the floor again,
Fully dressed and bleary eyed.

I'm half the man I was last night,
Collecting postcodes, just like trophies,
This is not the way that you should live your life.

And it's obvious things have changed,
I can feel a tension building, something is about to break.

Feelings aside, this is what we call life,
No matter what, we will strive to be the best we can,
And it's a crying shame, that you had to act this way,
And it's a crying shame, that the world just doesn't revolve around you.

Another year has passed, 365 days, by my window,
Things might have changed, but I could never bring myself to leave,
I could never bring myself to leave.

Sometimes I don't know how I go on,
The pressure gets too much to bear.

We all collapse, sometimes,
You are always there to help me up and dry my eyes,
I've said it all before, something is about to break.

Feelings aside, this is what we call life,
No matter what, we will strive to be the best we can,
And it's a crying shame, that you had to act this way,
And it's a crying shame, that the world just doesn't revolve around you.

Take this chance, to live your life, take a fall, take a chance.
