[feat. James Leatherbarrow Of Death Of An Artist]I canât believe you have stuck by me after all you heard,
(after all these years)
It means so much to me that youâre still around,
so scream as loud as you can.
(scream as loud as you can)

Letâs make tonight a night to remember,
fuck what you heard.
Letâs make tonight a night to remember,
at least this once

So what am I supposed to do?
Just stand here and take this?

Sticks and stones wonât even break me,
this time,
I still have the scars from before.
Sticks and stones wonât even break me,
this time,
Over time I will heal.

So take a step back,
And show me what youâve got.

You know itâs all just lies,
Iâll rise above this,
wish I could find a better way to thank you.
This doesnât feel enough.

So what am I supposed to do?
Just stand here and take this?

Sticks and stones wonât even break me,
this time,
I still have the scars from before.
Sticks and stones wonât even break me,
this time,
Over time I will heal.

And after everything,
You stick by my side (by my side)
And after everything,
(after everything)
How could I as for anything more?

This is my life,
And Iâm going to live it.
