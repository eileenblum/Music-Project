Give me your hand,
Open it wide,
Show me your heart,
Show me you care.
Show me that you
Will always care.

You are my anchor.

You hold me down,
When I try to run,
Run away from all my problems.
You help me face
My inner fear.
Youâre all I need,
Nothing even comes close,
To making me feel so safe,
I need this embrace.

I need you to be my rock
When times are hard
When Iâm going under,
When Iâm going under.

Hold me up when my head sinks.
I have a fear of deep water,
Iâm on the edge of breaking,
Against this shore.

Give me your hand,
Open it wide,
Show me your heart,
Show me you care.

Show me that you,
Will always care.

You are my anchor.

And my life jacket,
In a sea of hate,
Not even a tidal wave of tears
Will wash me away.
You are my life jacket,
Help hold my head up.

This love is bigger
Than an ocean.
This love is
Bigger than you,
Would ever know.
