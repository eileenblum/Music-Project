[feat. Dani Winter Bates Of Bury Tomorrow]We could have travelled the world,
We could have seen it all.
I saw a change in you,
A change in direction.

As we drifted apart,
Itâs apparent to see,
That you were like this all along,
Itâs just a matter of time.

Never again will I,
Take the blame for you,
We can never go back to
how things were before.

Nothing,
can mend these broken lights,
(these broken lights)
Our eyes canât find a way to
(see through what youâve become)
A former you.

I see
Youâve turned from me,
Become a person that I didnât think youâd be
I see youâve turned from me,
Become a person that I didnât think youâd be.

Try and pick up the pieces,
But you know itâs too late,
The damage has already been done.

Never again will I,
Take the blame for you,
We can never go back to
How things were before.

Nothing,
can mend these broken lights,
(these broken lights)
Our eyes canât find a way to
(see through what youâve become)
A former you.

If you ever look back,
You will find me
In the wreckage and the wake.

And if you ever look back
You will find me.
