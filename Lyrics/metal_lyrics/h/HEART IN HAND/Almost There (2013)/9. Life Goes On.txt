Iâll swallow my pride,
And walk away,
Thereâs nothing I can do,
Thereâs nothing you can say,
To make things right,
Life goes onâ¦

My heart feels like
Itâs smashed into tiny fragments,
In my mind, I feel so alone,
Try and make things right?
Life goes onâ¦

Iâll pick myself back up,
And carry on.
Forever looking forward,
Never looking back.
Iâll pick myself back up,
And carry on.
Forever looking forward,
Never looking back.

I still have no regrets.

Everything happens for a reason,
Lessons learned and bridges burnt.
I found a reason,
To carry on,
To carry on.

I wish you had,
Just told me the truth,
I know itâs hard, but honestly,
How did you not think,
This would hurt me.

This isnât how things should be.

Iâll swallow my pride
And walk away.
Thereâs nothing I can do,
Thereâs nothing you can say.

Who knows if our story
Will have a happy ending?
Right now do we care?
This isnât how things should be.
