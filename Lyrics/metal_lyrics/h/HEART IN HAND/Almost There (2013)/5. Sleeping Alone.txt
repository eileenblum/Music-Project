I tried so hard, to make things work,
To keep that smile on your face,
To keep your eyes fixated on mine,
To keep us alive.

You took all I had to give,
and threw it away.
You took all I had to give,
and pushed me away.

This doesnât fell right anymore,
My chest feels tight.
There is no easy way to tell you,
This doesnât feel right anymore
Your touch is cold
And even though Iâm lying next to you,
feels like Iâm sleeping alone.

After all this time,
we find ourselves,
trying to hold on.
Iâm losing my grip,
losing my grip on you
We find ourselves walking down that path,
weâve walked a thousand times

Can you see the end?
Can you see the end?

This doesnât fell right anymore,
my chest feels tight.
There is no easy way to tell you
This doesnât feel right anymore
Your touch is cold
And even though Iâm lying next to you,
feels like Iâm sleeping alone.

Iâve never felt so alone.

This bed was never made for two,
I guess we were just cheating ourselves.
Bare faced liars, Iâve found a way out.

Open the door, and let me out.
Let it all out.
