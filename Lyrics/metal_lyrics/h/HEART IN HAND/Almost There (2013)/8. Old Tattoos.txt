I donât know how I always find a way
To forgive you, but I do.
And always will,
and always will,
Iâm nothing without you.

I donât know how I always find a way
To forgive you, but I do.

Iâll scream at the top of my lungs,
to make you hear,
And Iâll scream at the top of my lungs,
To make you understand.

And like old tattoos,
Iâll never change,
Iâll promise to never change

Iâll promise to never change.
