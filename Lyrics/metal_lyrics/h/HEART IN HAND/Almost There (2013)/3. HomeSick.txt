Home always feels so far away
Home always feels so far away
What have I done?
What have I done to deserve this?

I have no control
This is out of my hands now
I have no choice
I have no choice but to leave

If home is where the heart is
That's where we're heading
And if home is where the heart is
I can rest myself

Come back stronger
I will come back stronger

I'm sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm sorry
I'll leave now but I promise to return
I promise from the bottom of my heart I will return

This is killing me
I stand here screaming
But nothing comes out
I hope you can see
The pain in my eyes and what I'm going through

You have to trust me on this one
Have I ever given you a reason to doubt me?

I'm sick
Home sick and tired

I'm sick
Home sick and tired

I'm sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm sorry I'll leave now
But I promise to return
I promise from the bottom of my heart I will return

I'm sorry I'll leave now
But I promise to return
I promise from the bottom of my heart I will return

I will return
I will return
I promise to return
I promise to come back
