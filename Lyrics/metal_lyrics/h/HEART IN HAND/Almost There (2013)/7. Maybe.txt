[feat. Mikey Chapman/Sam Douglas Of Mallory Knox]I fear the worse itâs been ten days and still no word.
I fear the worse, have you lost your voice?
Or just your heart?
Iâm sure this will not last,
In fact Iâm positive that there is something wrong
(there is something wrong)
Is this the beginning of the end?
(please tell me)

Last time we spoke,
Everything seemed fine.
Why are you leading me on?
Why canât you just,
Open up and let me in,
Because Iâm tired of sitting here,
and wondering why,
feels like Iâve been sitting
on this fence forever.

Why canât you,
Keep your promises?

So sing me something other
than all your sad songs,
and Iâll sing what I believe.
Something I believe

And I drew the line
when you were sitting on fences,
Weâve crossed wires
A thousand times.
And I drew the line
when you were sitting on fences love,
All we loved has died in vain.

I feel so lost,
Iâll pack my shit and leave,
I have to go,
But Iâll be back next month,
The month of December,

Nowhere near as cold as you,
Please make up your mind,
Last time we spoke,
Everything seemed fine.
Absence makes the heart wander.

Why canât you
Keep your promises?

So sing me something other than
All your sad songs
And Iâll sing what I believe.

Next time,
Iâll keep my feelings to myself

All we love is gone,
Itâs died in vain.
All we love is gone.

Something I believe.

And I drew the line
When you were sitting on fences,
Weâve crossed wires a thousand times.
And I drew the line
When you were sitting on fences love,
Now all we loved has died in vain.

All we loved has died in vain.
Died in vain.
