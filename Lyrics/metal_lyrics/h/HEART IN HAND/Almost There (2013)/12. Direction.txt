Why are you so
Fucking ignorant?
Of whatâs around you.
Take a closer look,
Look inside yourself,
And what you have,
Embrace it.

Show us the way,
Show us how to,
Better ourselves.

You have to realise,
This life is just a game,
Play it out,
However you want.
Donât let,
Anyone stand in your way.

Iâll help you,
Keep your feet on the ground,
To keep you grounded.
Iâll take it upon
Myself to lead us,
In the right direction.

Show us the way,
Show us how to,
Better ourselves.

We only have one life,
So fucking live it.
