Iâm half a litre deep,
And I havenât even drowned yet,
Iâve had to cross these lines, but Iâm still alive.
I must be doing something right, even if itâs wrong,
I must be doing something right.

And in a moment,
Things can fall apart,
Thatâs all behind us now.
And in a moment,
Things can fall apart,
This is a distant memory,
Itâs in the past.

And youâre the one,
That will save me
From myself,
Keep me by your side,
And donât let me go.
Donât let me go.

Iâll take a deep breath,
Realise myself.
Iâm almost there.

So donât forget,
Never give in, never give up,
Never give in, never give up,
So donât forget

We all have problems,
We have to overcome,
There is no looking back.
We all have problems,
We have to overcome,
There is nothing in our way,
Keep pushing on.

And youâre the one,
That will save me
From myself,
Keep me by your side,
And donât let me go.
Donât let me go.

Iâll take a deep breath,
Realise myself,
Iâm almost there.
