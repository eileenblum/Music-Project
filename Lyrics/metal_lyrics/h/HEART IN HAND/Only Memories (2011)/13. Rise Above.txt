[Bonus Track]I have been down and felt rejection
Sometimes it feels like there is no going back
But I'm standing on my own two feet again, and ready to take on the world, the world
Rise above
And every little step you take, feels like you've taken two steps back
You're still alive
You'll be the only one to look out for me, for me.
Take my hand, let's end this now
I must move on
You took my blood, my sweat, my tears
Never let anyone tell you any different
Be yourself, never change, rise above.
