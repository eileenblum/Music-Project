I used to care, you were my oxygen, and every breath I took, and now my lungs have seen better days,
I have to come to terms that, youâre not around,
I have to come to terms,
I wish you werenât so cold,
Itâs not my fault your such an awful liar, your lust will come, back to haunt you,
your lust will come, back to haunt you,
And you stole my heart, My heart,
And even though you said youâd stay,
I had to let you, slip away,
And even though you said youâd stay,
I had to let you go,
Let you go,
Never thought Iâd be the same, but Iâm fine,
I have come to terms that you are not around,
I have come to terms,
I, am better off now,
Itâs sad to say, I donât fucking miss you,
anymore.
Whore,
As the sun comes up, you go down,
And it must have been, a good night,
Good night, my love,
