We find somethings in life, unbearable,
But, I will never care any less,
Nor will I fold,
We sometimes make the wrong choices, 
But, I will never care any less,
Nor will I fold,
Iâll remember all the good times we had,
And the times we shared,

Brings me back to life,
the sun will shine once again,
Every moment of my life is precious, to me,
Even when, life gets dark,
you will be the light to get me through,
I make this promise to myselfâ¦
I, wonât, sacrifice, my happiness for you,
This is all we have,
This is all I have,
To give,
This is all I have to give,
Iâll remember all the good times we had,
And the times we shared,

Brings me back to life,
the sun will shine once again,
There is no such thing as a perfect life,
But we will try our best,

Not captured on film, forget the negative,
No regrets,
only memoriesâ¦â¦
We, we wonât taint ourselves,
We, we wonât taint ourselves,
