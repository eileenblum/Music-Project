This is the last time, I put my trust in you,
The last time I drop my guard, why does this hurt so much?
Feels like your hands are around my neck, around my neck,
lucky for me, you have weak wrists,
There is no trust,
So why the fuck do I care?
There is no love,
So I have nothing to lose,
I have nothing to, lose,
By telling you goodbye, By ending it all,
And I hate the way my soul, gave into your beautiful lies,
And If I gave you second chance,
would you allow me to breath?
But Iâm sad to see you go,
Iâll break, all, communication,
You canât see, into my life,Â  Anymore,
You did this to yourself, itâs your fault your alone,
Now your reaching out for my hand,
But I wonât take it,
last time I drop my guard,
My lips feel like they are falling apart, falling apart,
Must have been the poison off your kiss,
There is no love,
So I have nothing to lose,
This is the last time, I trust you, last time,
This is the reason your gone.
