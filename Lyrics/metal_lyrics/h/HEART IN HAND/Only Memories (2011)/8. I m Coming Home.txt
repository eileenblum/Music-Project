Every night we get to do, what we love,
Still counting down the days âtil, I get to see you again,
I know you will be waiting,
I know you will be waiting,
I, have never been so far away from home,
Another sleepless night again, will keep us on our feet,
we know this road will take us, where we want to go,
but Iâm not sure If I can, make it through, without you,
My body aches, I need some time alone,
My body aches, I just need some time alone,
just for a while, Just for a while,
And Iâm sick and tired,
of the fighting,
why canât we allÂ  just get along?
Once, again we seem to head off in our own directions, without you,
but somethingâs never change, never change,
you are always on my mind, I miss you, But Iâm coming home
Iâm coming home,
Every night we get to do, what we love,
Still counting down the days âtil, I get to see you again,
I know you will be waiting,
I know you will be waiting,
But Iâm coming home,
We must keep pushing forward, but I could sleep forever,
I could sleep forever.
