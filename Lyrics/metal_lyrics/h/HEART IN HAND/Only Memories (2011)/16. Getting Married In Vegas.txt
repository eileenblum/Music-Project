[Bonus Track]She is so close to me, but yet so far, I wish this pain would end,
No one, can even understand, what you have been through,
once this is all over weâll run away,
Time will tell, time will tell,
Never take that picture off the wall,
Time will tell,
Shoot an arrow, through my neck, just goes to show how much I care,
Just goes to show, how much I really care,
I couldnât do this, I donât know how youâre so strong,
sleepless night after sleepless night,
Friendship must be the only thing that gets you through,
Make a wish, make a wish, and blow out the candles,
That shows how much you care,
Even though you're not always around, just remember this one thing
Iâll always be here, for you,
Just keep your head up high, if you only knew,
Iâd do anything for you
