[Bonus Track]I took a chance, didnât think it would turn out like this.
I gave my blood, and now itâs all gone.
And everything that I did, was never, good enough for you, for you.
But I walked away, even though I was pushed, No fight or struggle,
I am bigger than this, but Iâll never be alone, itâs true,
canât wait to, wait to watch you,
Fall, I wonât forget this, but, I, was, hurt,
Canât wait to watch you, fall, I wonât regret this, but I, got, hurt,
Canât wait to watch you, fall.
But, There is no hatred, just disappointment,
we were like brothers back then,
there is no hatred, just disappointment,
I Wish you all of the luck in the world,
And everything that I did, was never good enough for you, for you,
Ink this blood, down my face, this is, permanent,
I watched my dreams shatter, I walked, away without regret, in my mind,
turns out itâs not all itâs made out, to be, the choices, you make in
life, make you who you are,
and now Iâm stronger,
Now, Iâm stronger than ever,
Follow your heart, follow your dreams,
Youâll be ok.
