[feat. Andy Convey of Burn The Fleet]Imagine looking at your life and feeling like,
You had nothing left, all that you loved, faded and disappeared,
How would you carry on?
How would you cope?
But I have this feeling, everything will be ok,
I feel comfort in my knowledge, that you are safe and sound,
So whatâs left of me? As these moments pass by,
Like snapshots of a life, truly left behind,
So whatâs left of me? As these moments pass by,
Like snapshots of a life, truly left behind,
I wonât, take you for granted,
Or curse your name,
We may fall apart,
But we will always remain,
If only my eyes could, take photographs, I could see a better day,
Everyday.
If only my eyes could, take photographs, I could see a better day,
Everyday.
I could see a better day.
