[feat. Ian Fike of It Prevails]Youâre the latest fashion that everyone wants to wear,
But in the end,
youâre the label that no one can, seem to get off,
Stabbing me in the back,
And, these watercolours, that I painted our perfect life with, will run,
will run,Â  run,
Once my tears hit the paper, once the ducts are open,
once the ducts are open,
We flood our hearts,
You think itâs fine to do things your way, but this lump in my throat, 
Keeps getting bigger and bigger, from swallowing my words,
Hope I donât choke, on the truth,
You've  found a way to fall apart, You've found a way to change and disappear,  With no help from me, My tears have been the catalyst to the process of  you fading away,
Youâve become a ghost,
And It turns out, you are, as fucking selfish,Â  as I first thought,
Â And, these watercolours, that I painted our perfect life with, will run,
will run, YEAHHHHHHHHH
Once my tears hit the paper, once the ducts are open,
once the ducts are open,
Weâll flood our hearts,
And weâll flood our hearts,
Now youâre gone,
As my eyes grow heavy,
WE FLOOD OUR HEARTS
My tears speak of regret,
WE FLOOD OUR HEARTS
We fall,
WE FLOOD OUR HEARTS
Now youâre gone,
