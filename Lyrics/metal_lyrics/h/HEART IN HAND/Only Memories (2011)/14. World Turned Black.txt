[Bonus Track]It was a day like any other, just after I left my world turned black
Crashing head-first, back to reality, I run over to find you bleeding
I can't think of anything, my mind is blank, your blood has drenched this dirty ground
So calm you sit, the pain has yet to kick in
I'll be by your side
No matter what goes wrong
There is always love
There is always hope
There is always us
Just goes to show you how, in an instant things can change
You're not gonna lose it, thank God
You're coming home, and I'll be waiting here
This is just like a bad dream I can't wake up from, as long as we have each other we have nothing to lose
I'll be by your side
No matter what goes wrong
There is always love
There is always hope
There is always us
There is always love.
