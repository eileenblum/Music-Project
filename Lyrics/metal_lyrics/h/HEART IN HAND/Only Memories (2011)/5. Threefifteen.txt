Painting our lives, with abstract eyes,
I wish you had stopped time, just for me,
In this moment, we could, be as one,
We could, promise to never leave,
They say that time flies, but our time is slipping away,
Our lives are slipping away,
Our lives are slipping away,
They say that time flies, but our time is slipping away,
Our lives are slipping away,
Will you, catch me when I fall?
When I fall
What is there left to smile about?
when everything falls apart around me,
When love, turns to hate,
And this is, tearing me apart,
You have these funny ways of, making me want more,
Woke up with a hole in my heart today,
ItÂ  wasnât a dream,
There is something missing from my life,
It wasnât a dream,
There is something missing,
If I was granted just one wish,
Anything I wanted, It would be to have you by my side,
By my side,
But there is no time, I would have waited forever,
Our time is up.
There is no time, I would have waited forever,
Our time is up.
They say that time flies, but our time is slipping away,
Our lives are slipping away,
Our lives are slipping away,
They say that time flies, but our time is slipping away,
Our lives are slipping away,
Will you, catch me when I fall?
FIGHT, FUCK, FORGET.
If I was granted just one wish,
Anything I wanted, It would be to have you by my side,
By my side,
But there is no time, I would have waited forever,
Our time is up.
There is no time, I would have waited forever,
Our time is up.
