Wind will suddenly dry my tears,
War screams will shatter a fantasy of old plains -
Dispel subtle hushfulness of frozen trees in a field;
Will summon a cloud over this white distance.

Fireflag is proudly moving in the air,
Aboveground after battles

A Kestrel is crying above a deep forest,
Flies over the fields in a narrow arc.
I charm the winds and snows,
To take away an arrow from my heart.

I bewitch a flying arrow,
Don't touch the grass - just fade away
I don't want to see in nocturnal dreams,
That I am touched by sanguine hair.
