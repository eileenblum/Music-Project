The dry foliage riding on wind is whispering,
Calming down the world with its incantations,
Like it was calling again in morning to go
To Battle!

In dreaming depth of blind darkness,
Grey snowstorm fluttering the flags,
Like dead people are loath to go
To Battle!

Snow was falling, on forgotten fields,
And keeping its silence
Snow, please cover the bodies of the fallen in battle,
So for the whole night the wind will sing them songs,
So the grass will wake up in the mornings,
By the new life between forgotten bodies...
