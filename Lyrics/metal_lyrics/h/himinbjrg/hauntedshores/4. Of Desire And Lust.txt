Dakaltra, mistress of one's dark desires,
I acknowledged and knelt at your feet.
My funeral bride, your silver, icy eyes
remind me of Lilith.

I gazed into your icy eyes, ya Dakaltra.

I rode over the storms
and defied time for you.
My only maze was the mists of your heart,
your dark altar, yeah!

Dakaltra, your spell so strong
and organic as my heart,
forever cold and burnt.
We shared our blood and souls.

My only maze was the mists of your heart,
since these neverending nights
when your gaze ablazed my heart
