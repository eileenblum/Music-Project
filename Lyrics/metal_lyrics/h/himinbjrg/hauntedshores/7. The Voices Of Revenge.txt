Alone I walk in the night.
All around me is so dark.
Too many things I don't understand.
All this hate I hold in my hands.

In the eyes of the night, I saw evil.
In the eyes of the night, I saw

In my head burn the flames of destructions.
In my veins flows the blood of malediction.
Voices of revenge ,calling me.
Could they some day be set free?

In the eyes of the night, I saw evil.
In the eyes of the night, I saw

Voices of revenge ,calling me.
Could they some day be set free?
