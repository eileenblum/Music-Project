My life opens out
into a deep and glowing silence.
I break through the wraths of light,
one after the other, forever faster.

Now the silence wraps me in its material heat,
thicker and thicker, warmer and warmer,
as I melt into the eternal.

Everything accelerates.
Everything becomes lighter.
Everything finishes.
I am no more.

Everything brings me back to who I am.
I have everything to do.
I feel. I see. I touch.
I hate myself.

My inner being stands up in front of me.
It stares at me. It's me. I stare at it.
I look myself staring at myself.
