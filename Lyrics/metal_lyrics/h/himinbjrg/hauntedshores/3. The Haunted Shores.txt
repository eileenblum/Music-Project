I am a shore, haunted by the waves of the devil.
to be drawn in a dream,
and saved by a nightmare.

They come and go, just take and give.
to be drawn in a dream,
and saved by a nightmare.

I'm no longer without them,
As these waves are no longer without me.
to be drawn in a dream,
and saved by a nightmare.

And the stars shine on the ocean,
calling me to rise and join the right,
to accomplish my life.

But the stars that I see
and covet are in the water.
They're just a reflection,
and as I could melt with my dream,
they go back and this is neverending.
