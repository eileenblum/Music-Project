Some tears flow out along the face of a child.
Explosion, black out, some terrifying cries.
A hat covers the body of a child.
Angry, hate, everything becomes blind.

You, the godsend, the hero of the nation,
You say that you kill to save your country.
You obey some shadows
that someone makes dance in front of your eyes.

You're only a slave.

Some tears flow out along the face of a child.
Explosion, black out, some terrifying cries.
A hat covers the body of a child.
Angry, hate, everything becomes blind.

These are the tears of the nation,
And not those of the masters of this world.
These are the children of the nation
and not those of the tyrants of this world.

The nation is just a child, to whom we lie,
But don't forget that it's blood which flows.
Free yourself from these traps,
so that some rays of light spring from your steps
