Waking up in a cold sweat
I see before my eyes what could be my death
Bombs are dropped from planes high above
Nuclear destruction crushes us below

A harsh reality to understand
Nuclear war is close at hand
The world is full of ammunition
I see it as a premonition

Scorching fire takes us all
Victims of the blast we all shall fall
Dreams of we can't believe is true
Feel those flames ripping right through you

All are blinded by the flash
Confusion brings hope but it won't last
Feel your flesh drip from your bones
The evil one laughs as he takes his throne

Die!
