On the morning of December 26th
A day when nothing seemed a miss
This unsuspected attack was planned
With many a musket held in hand

Fourteen-hundred Jagers shown
This brute force of our own
In this icy water crossed
What was to be a decisive victory

When the twilight became the dawn
They pushed on toward Commander Rall
With their numbers doubled in strength
The Brave toppled the Hessian brigade
