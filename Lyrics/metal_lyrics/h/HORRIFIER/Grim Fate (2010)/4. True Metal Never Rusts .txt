Put on your leather, chains, and spikes
We're gonna raise some hell tonight
One for all and all for one
Metallic fury just has begun

Metal
True metal
Never rusts

What we play is not a trend
We'll stay this way until the end
We live it, breath it, it's in our blood
All should beware your time has come

So crank the Marshall's and down a beer
Pure aggression is all you'll hear
Our salute to the metal gods
Has been shown here in this song
