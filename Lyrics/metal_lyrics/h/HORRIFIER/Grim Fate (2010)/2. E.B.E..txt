Locked within the shell
Of the frozen armor's mass
An answer to a question
That man's been searching for
Precious knowledge lies within
A craft of mystic origin
Rests with the spirit
Trapped within it's core

What is the truth
That we don't deserve to know
Why do they hide it away
To keep a man clueless
Is to keep him obedient
Oblivion leads mankind astray

Taken to a fortress
Of unknown location
The truth that never existed
Is waiting to be found
A key to life's sanctity
Awaits annihilation
Hidden away from the public eye
Locked safe and sound

Labeled as a Fallen Angel
That which we cannot see
What is so far and yet so near
Kept by those we obey and fear
Code named E.B.E.
