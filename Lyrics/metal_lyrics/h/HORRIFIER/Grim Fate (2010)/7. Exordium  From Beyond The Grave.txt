When it came to be on that dark winter's eve
The Night was so cold and black
All were sleeping in their homes
Unprepared for the relentless attack
Galloping hoofs heard from down the path
Awoke them from their dreams
Many screams were ensued by the sight of the beasts

They came
From beyond the grave
Nothing could stop them
No one could save
They came
From beyond the grave
Don't think twice
Run for your life
Or be forever taken

They told the children to go run and hide
But most were trampled and met their demise
Others were caught under the blade
And some were impaled in the misty haze
Thou hath come thy specters of death!
One man said in his last breath
He spoke of one on a pale horse he rode
The truth he did speak âtwas the harvester of souls
