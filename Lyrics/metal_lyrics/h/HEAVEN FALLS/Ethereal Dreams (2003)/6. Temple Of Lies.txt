In the skies...Eagles blaze
Their wings spread on the winds
Burst to the sun...Flying so high
Another day is coming to cover up the night

So open your mind
And free your soul
Dream is not a simple illusion
Assay the real world
Play your role
In the game of life!

We're living in a temple of lies
In this web o fallacy we build inside

[Chorus]
Wake up and realize the changes around
The treasures kept inside a child
...in a pure smile!

We are slaves of time
Ified by their oppression and their lies

[Chorus]
Wake up and realize the changes around
The treasures kept inside a child
...in a pure smile!

In your eyes
A tearful maze
Leads up to ethereal dreams
That opens my mind
And free my soul
Dream is not a simple illusion
Away form the real world
Of your role...
