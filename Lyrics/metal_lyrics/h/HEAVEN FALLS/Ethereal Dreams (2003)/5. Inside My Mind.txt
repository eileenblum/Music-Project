Right through these moments
Even though I hear your voice
I feel aching inside, my heart!

Can't control the coming of a new kind
Got to be afraid all the time

Hoping, wondering
What the hell is going on?
Realizing, we are all alone.

The emptiness of silence
Keeps wasting my soul
I wish someday I can forget

[Chorus]
Lost inside my mind
Beyond the darkness I hope I can find
Another way to go
Roaming through the night
By the light of the stars
Along the way to go...
