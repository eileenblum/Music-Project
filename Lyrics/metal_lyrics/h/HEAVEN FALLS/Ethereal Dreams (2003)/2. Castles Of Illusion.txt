Against the winds..Forgotten dreams
Distant desires...For an eternity
I'm lost in here...Burning in fire

Seven ways, Seven days
Holy liars, I dive in the abyss of disillusion
Oh! I dream...

[Chorus]
Into the dark ride of moon
I will reborn within the black sun
Depression is deeper
I will awake to live my destiny
Into the dark ride of moon
I will reborn within the black sun

Oceans of tear...Gloom and fear
A solitary nomad...Oasis of sands
Emptiness stands...Sacred and Damned

Seven lies, Seven nights
Cold fire, I'm building Castles of Illusion
Oh! I live...

Into the first rays of sun I will reborn
I'll clear my soul
Angels and Demons fighting for revenge
On their insane war

[Chorus]
Into the dark ride of moon
I will reborn within the black sun
Depression is deeper
I will awake to live my destiny
Into the dark ride of moon
I will reborn within the black sun

Your last words in life...Let me look at you
I know you'll live another life...And I'll meet you there
