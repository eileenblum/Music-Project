Beyond the silence of a dream
Locked up in dark cages within
Along the way to disillusion
A sacred balance of destruction

Bemoaning cries over the night
From deepest places we cannot hide!

[Chorus 2x]
Without you
No, I can't see
Without you
No I can't live

One dream for you
My wish to come true
Blind truth's despair
Inner Prision still there!

Guiding my eyes through the black path of this tunnel
Guiding my mind through this darkness there is You!
The light is You!

[Chorus 3x]
Without you
No, I can't see
Without you
No I can't live
