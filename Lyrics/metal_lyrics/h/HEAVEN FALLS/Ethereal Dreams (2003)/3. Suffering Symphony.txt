Wandering between the shades
I'm just an empty reflex to the moon
Fearing the death that's shown at each step
In this cold night
Wandering between the shadows
Escapin form the darkness that pursues me
In this morbid night
With no face...without a law!

I feel a deep anguish
That becomes anxiety at each sight
Tired, I leave my body in your cold embrace

[Bridge]
I feel my blood flowing trough your frozen lips
As a tear falls, I caress your face

[Chorus]
Deliriums and desires
Travelling in my feverish body
And I can't control it
In a perfect fusion where my soul dances
At the beat of the Suffering Symphony

"And in the dense night while I clamor your name
I still hear that inebriating song
Calmly whispered
Being the pain only a dream
Until the Dawn!"

[Bridge]
I feel my blood flowing trough your frozen lips
As a tear falls, I caress your face

[Chorus 2x]
Deliriums and desires
Travelling in my feverish body
And I can't control it
In a perfect fusion where my soul dances
At the beat of the Suffering Symphony
