[Lyrics by Roberto Negrini]

In my veins, Thick warm tears
Donât feel and the pain dies
In my eyes, The blinding dark
Pain makes awake

Grey boxes, inside my head
They choke my conscienceâs breath
Theyâre waiting for its death
And all those questions, will we return?
A door as a loaded gun
Hit the mirror or your arm

Nevermore the same, Nevermore this place

Thoughts float in stillness
Time seems to hesitate
Nothing is real
In the darkest dream

Here and now.
Feel, emptiness.
Here and now.
Feel, emptiness.

Do you feel this sore?
Do you pray for some?
Have you ever lived before?
(paint your circle on your own)
Do you deserve this sore?
Do these tears mean more?
Have you ever lived before?

Nevermore the same, Nevermore this place

Thoughts float in stillness
Time seems to hesitate
Nothing is real
In the darkest dream

In my eyes.
In my veins.
