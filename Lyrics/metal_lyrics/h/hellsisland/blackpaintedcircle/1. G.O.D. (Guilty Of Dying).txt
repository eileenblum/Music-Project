[Lyrics by Roberto Negrini]

In flames, on the earth
A death and a birth

Need to unleash what we canât say
Fear of sins that we create

Alone in every pray
Hearing that voice so loud
Screams the promise to save
A damned soul

Eternity is a plan
God is not a masked man

Need to be what we canât be
Fear of a hell that we just live

Alone in silence
Breathing to leave behind
The promise and chains
To feel alive
