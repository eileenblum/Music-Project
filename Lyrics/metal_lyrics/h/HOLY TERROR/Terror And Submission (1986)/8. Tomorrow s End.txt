Projectiles of death falling from the sky
Destroying humanity
As the mist of darkness rots the lives
Evil's presence is seen
Tartarus is rising through the Earth
As darkness fills the world
Voices are howling through the air
But no one speaks a word

[Chorus]

The demons curse rules the night with terror and disease
Bleeding souls captured in the sights shadows of the beast

Mephistophelian boundaries trap the souls
Who walk the night alone
No tomorrow except for those
Who follow what they know
Plutonium children attack the world
With Lucifer at their helm
Ascending from the infernal empire
The spirits of doom take hold

[Chorus]

The final day the final battle
The final judgement call
Bleeding souls of Armageddon
Bloodshed plagues us all
Blessed enough to see the light
Shining in the sky
Blind enough to walk the night
Tempting flames shall fly
Who's the one to save your life
And turn the night to day

[Solo: Mike, Kurt, Mike, Kurt, Mike, Kurt, Mike, Kurt]
