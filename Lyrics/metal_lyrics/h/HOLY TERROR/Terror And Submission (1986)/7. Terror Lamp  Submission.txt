The conflict raises swift before you
Abominations of human life
As if you've seen it all before you
Join the celebrated strife
From somewhere deep beneath the surface
The calls of millions just fade away
Signalling their new traditions
Timeless honour, the proud must pray

[Chorus]

Submit to force
I will stand my ground to the bitter end
Submit to force
None deny me my right to die
Submit to force
Now the terror is real
Submit to force
Closer to fear than before

Holy light of dawn is coming
Prince of darkness now retires
The black cat eyed feline mistress
Chants by the cauldron's fire
Packs of human wolves are howling
Smell of blood is in the air
Banshee screams her hellish aria
Faithful souls beware

[Chorus]

[Solo: Kurt]

[Chorus]
