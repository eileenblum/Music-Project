A seeker of the fortune
Heir to the throne
From the horn of plenty
I taste life alone
Memories soon disappear
Through the haze becomes the twilight
An omen for the future
The destination lies in sight

Even gods in their infinity
The immortals fall away
Sanctuaries, uncertainty
Masterpieces turn to grey
In twilight I witness higher fall
Leaving from where they once belonged

Sands of time forgotten so quick
Ages pass as none regret
On their knees I see supreme
Fade into their mortal place
The ending of some passing dream
Genocide or higher race

Even gods in their infinity
The immortals fall away
Sanctuaries, uncertainty
Masterpieces turn to grey
The mighty must now scrape and crawl
To keep from losing what was owned

Evolution, mercy non betray
The gift of life arrives with death
Creation let to sentence lives
Declared exile, ancients survive
Escape to heavens halls to wait
Poised to loose their touch of hate

Sands of time forgotten so quick
Ages pass as none regret
On their knees I see supreme
Fade into their mortal place
The ending of some passing dream
Genocide or higher race

Even gods in their infinity
The immortals fall away
Sanctuaries, uncertainty
Masterpieces turn to grey
In twilight I witness higher fall
Leaving from where they once belonged
The mighty must now scrape and crawl
To keep from losing what was owned
