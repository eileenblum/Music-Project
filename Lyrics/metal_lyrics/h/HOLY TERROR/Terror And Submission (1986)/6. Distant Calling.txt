Almost the season, a time of prophecy for those who know
Almost the reason, why the voices of the dead come known
A gnawing in torment divided by the polarizing line
Prey to the masses, hunted in numbers, tortured, death divine

Estranged to nocturnal light
In search for what is known but lost by the time
Desperately clawing, deceived as a puppet for a price
Servant of the master, a watcher of the world until you die

And when you see the light of lights
Out of the corner of your eye
There and then you will be falling
For you must answer to your calling

[Solo: Kurt]

Revolving on a never ending journey
A glimpse into the gateways of eternity
Led to the edge, then pushed to falling
For you must answer to your calling
