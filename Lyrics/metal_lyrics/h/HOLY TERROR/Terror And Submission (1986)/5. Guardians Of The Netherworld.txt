Protectors of forbidden places, keepers of the watch
Seeing those enslavened faces, withered souls forgotten lives
Atop the perch a silent throne, the vindicating eyes
Believing their all seeing vision
Saints of hell, of desperate cries

Guardians of the Netherworld, captors of the damned
Pinnacle of your disaster, the watcher on the stand
Exiled on a lifeless steeple, appointed from above
A veil was placed across our brow
Anointed one and all, to die

A war is raging on inside us, guarded by the horde
With lesser gods of higher rank, prodding them to war
No Father, Son, or Holy Spirit
Nor defences from the foe
All are battered, tortured, shattered
Allegiance without death is woe

Guardians of the Netherworld, captors of the damned
Pinnacle of your disaster, the watcher on the stand
Exiled on a lifeless steeple, appointed from above
A veil was placed across our brow
Anointed one and all, to die
For lust of life

A maelstrom of impending evil, futile fight to win
Tides of blackness, pull you toward it
Consuming within its doors
Both life and death
