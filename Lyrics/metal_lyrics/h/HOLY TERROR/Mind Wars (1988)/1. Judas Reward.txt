[Deen, Alvord]

Sun's ultraviolet beacon
Leaves of chlorophyll so green
Stone stands its silent vigil
Seas of knowledge lay in waste

Nirvana landscapes seethe with anger
Sadistic poison fills the soil

The evil chariot, the swinging mace of hatred
Pounds the Earth to crush the weak of heart
The choking wind gags on the noxious gasses
A bad seed sprouts in the hallowed ground

The conscious youth the minority of their generation
Reject the code of conduct of their peer betrayers

A Judas reward to collect and to horde
Scum lizards of fashion pray to their gold lord
Their prejudice eyes see society's lies
To bear witness and to laugh about life aftermath
Tribe of the street the clan smells the deceit
Corporate serpents live off the dead meat
The carcass of death now is all that is left
Into the ground goes another soul bound
To another financial plan

Global oasis lies in waiting
Sanskrit scriptures hint of fate
Secrets hidden from the masses
Answers to a future plan

The conscious youth the minority of their generation
Reject the code of conduct of their peer betrayers
