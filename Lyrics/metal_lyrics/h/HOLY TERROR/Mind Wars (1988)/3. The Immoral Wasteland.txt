[Deen, Kilfelt]

In it's wake the immoral wasteland
Fallout erodes the technological shrines to greed
Damnation of the most sacred mother
Three piece jackal prophecy decreed
The fusion heavens, the burning rainfall
Allied breaks in the pattern of all that is
Righteous faction, bribe a blessing
Respite fallacy by blinded ghouls

Defend the keep, garrison resolve
With mail upon thy soul
Antipathy, resist the mark
Covenant of pure belief
The crow he flies, God speed be with you
The insatiable want for all
The ember riders, on steeds of death
Terrify the soul surviving shine

Patrolling outskirts, the men of vision
Phantom legions fire rays of static light
The blackened sky, the gray horizon
Nova blind standing inner sight
Molecular man, science fiction future
The millennium and a time to evaluate
The guiltless conscience, the peaceful syndrome
The universe within the biological self

From the streets, the leukemia leader
Empathic prophet speaks
Divining reach, the hand of fate
Providence of true belief
The raven cries, its callous caw
For kismet iniquity
Knighted brothers, sextons to the church
Patriarchs against the ebb of eternal light
