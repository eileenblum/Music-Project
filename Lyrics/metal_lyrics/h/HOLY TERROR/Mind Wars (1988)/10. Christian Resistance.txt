[Kilfelt]

Guilty of a common sin
Destruction marks our path
Bloodshed of the fallen victor
Genocide befits the wrath

A reason seems so hard to find
The cause obscured by clouds
That blinds the violent hate reaction
Created by the mind

None withstanding keep christian resistance
All are martyred in their minds to all
Troopers of the baptism must fight
In the name of Jesus Christ we massacre

Every action brings reaction
Neither seen the hidden force
Participation repayed by death
A feeling of no remorse

The heart the mind the soul entwined
The thought reality
A baleful stare, a witches lair
The blind society

None withstanding keep christian resistance
All are martyred in their minds to all
Troopers of the baptism must fight
In the name of Jesus Christ we massacre

The fornication upon hallowed ground of the holy and the righteous
Breeds the souls of decadence supreme clearing vision for the moment
The tyrants of the past keep the third dimensions safe
From prying eyes comes the blinding light to illuminate the black
