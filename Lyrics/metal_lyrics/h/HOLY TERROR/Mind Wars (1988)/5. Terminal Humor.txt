I have sinned against you my Lord

If anyone raped anyone she raped me

"Knowing God is having the promise of life that now is,
break that religious curse over you, it's held you in
bondage, I'm convinced by the spirit of God, that the
majority of christians have been held in bondage by
stained glass prisons, held in bondage by a religious
spirit that tells them the days of miracles has past."
