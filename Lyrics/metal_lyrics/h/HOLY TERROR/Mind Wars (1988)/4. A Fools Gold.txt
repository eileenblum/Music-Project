[Kilfelt]

War seen from far to the eyes seems so unreal
Pray on your knees that some savior will guide you
Out of his place of violence and torture
To eternal rapture life in heavenly comfort

Still the bound fall to the ground
And mourn the tragic tale their living
Don't pity those who knowing fair
The choice denied the blind beware

The fools beaten down
Conquered by their church's armies
Forsaken by their God
Destiny ordained by priests

The machine is in motion
Though few step out of time
To the drums played by the victors
Calling forth the broken lives to join
That which they can't escape

Together we can rule the world
A promise of a brighter future
A better life for every person
A lie believed without a question

The fools beaten down
Conquered by their church's armies
Forsaken by their God
Destiny ordained by priests
