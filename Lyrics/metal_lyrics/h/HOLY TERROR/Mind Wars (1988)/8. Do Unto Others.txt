[Deen, Alvord]

Give me a blindfold, give me a smoke
Hang me at dawn, watch me dance as I choke
Laugh as I perform for you
I must be evil, I must be damned
I must repent for the person I am
People like me should be put to the test
People like me should be put to the death
Sing now for the day is new

Now you are cleansed you have killed the disease
Now you feel safe now you feel released
Purging through others is easy isn't it?
Your soul needs to nurse on another soul's tit
Someone's suffering, how relieved are you?

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
This system could work but for human nature people are screwed

Who is the man that won't even try
Who won't fight his battles who's afraid to die
Insatiable flesh keeps people sedated
Violent aggression it's all related
The animal kingdom is thriving well
If you think it's heaven I think it's hell
No trust in hidden power

A cardboard condo, no shower you stink
You're down on your luck, you could use a drink
Social awareness says say no to drugs
Easy for rich man and the money he hugs
Save the ivory tower

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
This system could work but for human nature people are screwed

No just cause you read your Bible
Do something while you're still liable
Just let the martyrs do it all for you
How easy to get your wings

It's not fair
It's not fucking fair
Why should you care, some challenge some dare

Who is the man that won't even try
Who won't fight his battles who's afraid to die
Insatiable flesh keeps people sedated
Violent aggression it's all related
The animal kingdom is thriving well
If you think it's heaven I think it's hell
No trust in hidden power

A cardboard condo, no shower you stink
You're down on your luck, you could use a drink
Social awareness says say no to drugs
Easy for rich man and thee money he hugs
Save the ivory tower

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
This system would work but for human nature people are screwed
