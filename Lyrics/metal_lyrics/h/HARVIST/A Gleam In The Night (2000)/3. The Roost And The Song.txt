Twas that night, so superb in flight
The raven flies majestic
Upon it's wings a maiden sings
As the knell for mankind rings...

And as the song echoes among the distant hills
Carried by pestilent winds, the last breath of man it kills
As the raven finds it's roost to watch the babes of god die
Sits high on judgements throne as mans rebirth is denied.

Twas that night, a fire burns bright
For holy words so hard they die
And upon the wings the pestilence brings
And showers upon all things
Twas that night, so superb in flight
The raven flies majestic
Upon its wings a maiden sings
As the knell for mankind rings...

And on the ground of god there lays
A forsaken world now in waste
Ripped to shreds by our desire
The earth is now a burning pyre...
