A woe surpass such a nightly coil
A bother to speak of this
Yet in dreams it haunts me
An eternal silent abyss
Though in most dreams
I did catch a flickering of a light
To hold the hand to all my hopes
Was a gleam in the night.

It's merely a gleam at distance
That guides me on my way
And the warfare of the moon and stars
Brings a death to the day

A funeral passes the plutonian shadow
And peers with it's emerald eye
Daring me to take up flight
And break the boundaries of the sky.

And wishes never come true
And yet they still breath
The dreams are the children
That our minds decieved
