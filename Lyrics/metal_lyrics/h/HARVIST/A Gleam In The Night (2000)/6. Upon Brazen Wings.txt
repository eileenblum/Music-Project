In the sunset sky I engage
Ghosts of all angelic grace
Secret words slipped from my tounge
All to speak of youth so young

And as the moon rapes the sky
Midnight clouds flutter by
Ghosts of all angelic grace
Permit me as I try to embrace

Simplicity for me was lost
As I sat upon this earth
With no hope to ever reclaim
What I had lost since my birth

And as I taste my tears
The stars kiss away my fears
Thought I have the mournful disease
The pain will stop when the breath cease.

And I know I shall have to wait for my time to slowly bide
'til I shall fly so free upon the wings of suicide.
