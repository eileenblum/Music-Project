As a child born so innocent in sleep
Yet in the womb of earth, purity is decieved
And a kiss upon his brow, a lament for his life
For all of mankind's woes are reflected on his eyes.

As his tears drowns the earth, all shall mourn this child
As we realize hope is lost at birth
We have failed to see the innocense we have lost
As our shells return back to the earth.

And as the darkness ends the day
Tears clouds our sight
Because time is a thief
That robs us blind in the night.
