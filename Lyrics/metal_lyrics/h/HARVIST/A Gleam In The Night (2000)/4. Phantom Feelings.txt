It was only as days could be
That which fades for all to see
In bleek essence and hopes of sleep
A sense of distress begins to creep

With it's purpose to burden me
I lean across my bed
To try and tame a shadow
Into the moonlight it fled
So now I am again in desperate search for release
Haunted by the ghosts of my past, how they tease

Hark Oh twilight with your cast so profound
Around my throat for no air or sound
So is it that silence shall take me
Or is it that I detest myself?

Though in some nights I recall in splendor
My misdeeds that compells this pain
And everynight the ghosts become clearer
Calling me to the other plain.
