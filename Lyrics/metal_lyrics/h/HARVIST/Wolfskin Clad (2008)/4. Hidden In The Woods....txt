In these deep dank forests
hidden like hell's fortress
If only to dwell alone and to forever be...
Between two old fallen oaks
Triumphed by an ark of its kin
A husk lay in the dark
Covered by night's overshadow
Sleeping so long,...
All becomes bleak
Eyes glaze over
Now may the ancient owl take this soul
As lifeless a body is fed upon by nature
Weather well, this lonesome hermit
And carry this soul the evergreen isle
