I am the hammer, thee art my nail
I am the hunter, thou art my prey
Life of no respect has led ye astray
Now watch as all thine joy soon fades away
A pox on the house in which thee dwells
Lowly and broken shall art thou be
Degraded life, worthless existence
May thy memories haunt thee to thine end
May thy offspring drawn in thee cess
I summon thee, oh great bearer of plagues
Acknowledge my enemy as thine own
May doubt and deceit overrun their lives
