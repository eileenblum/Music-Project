As one mountain crested as did yet another
as a fist thrown toward the sun
while slamming down upon frozen seas
The skies ring with thunder,
lightning stabs the heavens
water rumbles blood and waves break with fire
May time cease to exist this world a funeral
For wretched mankind
burdened by the weight of its husk
