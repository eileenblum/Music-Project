Bring about this wilted, withered fruit
Take the place of this wilted, withered heart
So, I may bury it beside her
So, I may remember to tread old paths again
May the moon again guide me to your doorstep
Where I'll replenish myself with your everything.
And where maples and pines lined my youth
Bury my heart there in the valley
Where a tear was shed, I bowed my head
All what flourished, now is cold and dead
