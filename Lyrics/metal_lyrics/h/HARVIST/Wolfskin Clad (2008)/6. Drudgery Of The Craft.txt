The skyline lit in green
torn from this gentle blue soul
Where I, a lad, would sit
overlooking this town of old
And I understood
that to make my dreams real
it would take the sacrifice of another dream I made that day
For all the pain that I've endured
I will never cease the attack
Into the woods, I go
The drudgery of the craft
beckons me to strive
for higher plains than thee
But I shall return to your wretched land
when I feel the need to suffer again
