Enshrouded in loneliness
Be comforted in clouds of despair
Don't let the dawn begin again
The night rules the land and the air.
Above and beyond sacred plains
Beneath fertile soils of green
Amongst stone spires and lodgepoles
Unleash the storms upon us.
We stand divided
On ashen, smoldering fields
Life once immaculate
Is now diseased.
Open my eyes
And let me see
The sorrow and suffering.
Unshrouded from loneliness
No comfort in the clouds that were there
The dawn will begin again
The night still rules but I'm no longer there.
