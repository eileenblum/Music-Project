Do you watch the sun go down?
Does your anger sink away?
Watching all over the world
Does your anger sink away?
Is it the hope for closer
That makes things so hard?
I looked before, yet found nothing
I try again &amp; try harder.
True peace is found within
Inner ground unforsaken
Absolution of the self.
The waste of time
Heroic words are still empty words
A soul misplaced
From it's heart dying but still beating.
True peace is found within
Inner ground unforsaken
Absolution of the self
Sink into my rivers
Peaceful in it's turbulence
For a heart still beating.
