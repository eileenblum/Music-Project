With no seclusion foundin overrun multitudes
My wish for woods
Undaunted search
Astral Voyaging...
As I wade through the cosmic ocean
The pepper weed shall take me there.
Secreted by lush green temples
You'll find nein hide nor hair.
To taste the sweet obscurity
The arcane fruit, esoteric...
And hidden by these woods
Free of man's diseasehis corrupt existence
And snarling teeth.
Away from his disease
Away from humanity.
