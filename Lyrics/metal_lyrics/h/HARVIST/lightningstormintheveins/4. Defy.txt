I feel more hatred
From you in the name of peace
I cannot condone
That kind of blasphemy.
I will defy you
I will not bend
I will defy you
It will never end.
Conformist society stares
Wanting me to be a sheep
I will never submit
To their fucking mindless ways.
So think before you speak
Free the tongues of hypocrisy
Think before you actfree yourself of hatred.
