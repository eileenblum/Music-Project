Here's to my old father
Who made me a better world
He may be of blood
But he is thicker than blood shall be.
His only love will reside with him forever
In the grandest memories of the past
The truest of all human beings
Enforcing everything he belives in.
A man of peace and simplicity
At one with the cards life has dealt him.
Mourning for eternity the only one he has ever loved
No woman could fill such mighty shoes
His kindness &amp; support will never be forgotten
An important figure where another was absent.
The respect I have been taught
Will be taken to my grave
An immortal in my eyes
The outdoors his calling
His hardworking handscombed these eternal valleys
For several years now'
This his time for rest &amp; peace.
