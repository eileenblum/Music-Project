How many times these thoughts won't go away?
I will break these chains today
Maybe you could help me if you just raise your hand
Help me if you raise your hand

Far beyond my dreams I saw your eyes
You where blinding your lies
Maybe you could help me if you say that you'll stay
Help me if you say that you'll stay

I don't want to feel alone
All my hopes and dreams are strong
Take me closer to your side
Tell me the things that you hide
Take me closer to your side
To your side

How many times these thoughts won't go away?
I will break these chains today
Maybe you could help me if you learn how to say
Help me if you learn to say

I don't want to feel alone
All my hopes and dreams are strong
Take me closer to your side
Tell me the things that you hide
Take me closer to your side
To your side

Nothing can change now
The only thing that's right
Nothing can change my mind
Nothing can change my mind
Take me to your side
