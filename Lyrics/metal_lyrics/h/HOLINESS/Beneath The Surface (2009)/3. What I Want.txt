Take your foot off my neck
Take your thoughts out of my head
I'm not who you think I am
I'm so tired, I want to pretend

What I want is to feel
Feel that I can be free
What I want is to feel
Feel that I can be free
No one can stop me now
I felt my soul somehow
No one can stop me now
I felt my soul some...

No one told me what to do next
You never helped me when I called your name
You know how to choose a better way
Somehow I know what to say
What I want is to feel
Feel that I can be free
What I want is to feel
Feel that I can be free
No one can stop me now
I felt my soul somehow
No one can stop me now
I felt my soul somehow

And now I know where I belong
Now, I know where I belong
I can see the sun, I can feel the wind
No longer in the dark
I can see the sun, I can feel the wind
No longer in the dark
