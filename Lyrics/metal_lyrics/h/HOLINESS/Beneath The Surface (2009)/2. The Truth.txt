Every lie you tell
I Just can't forget
Why is it so hard to believe you?
And my thoughts go hide
In another place 
Where your words can't hurt me again
And now
When can I go home?
I want to know

I used to believe
In a better life
Now I see that I was dreaming
I just wanna run
Never feel the pain
Wounds on my skin that bleed
Please, show me the way out
Now I'm leaving and I'm not coming back for more
I will tell you everything I know but I can't help you now
The message lies between the lines and only you can
Find out, can find out the truth

Every time you loose
You learn to win
Somehow you know it's your turn
When I begin to play, I'll beat you
Now you're inside my game, no need to
Run away from the pain, that's useless
It's all in your mind

I will tell you everything I know but I can't help you now
The message lies between the lines and only you can
Find out, can find out the truth
