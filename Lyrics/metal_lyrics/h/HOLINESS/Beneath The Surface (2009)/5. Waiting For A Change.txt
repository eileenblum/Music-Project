Every time that you take a breath
Are you really trying just to breathe?
All the shadows that surround you
Separating you from all the rest
When the silence is finally broken
And the promises forgotten
But I never forget

I'm counting all the hours
Cause you know our time is running out
Every path you follow
One choice that you don't even see
When the light is blinding your eyes
And you dream while you're awakening
But I'm never dreaming
No, I'm never dreaming...

Time goes by and I'm
Waiting for a change
I know I try
I'm never giving up...
When your fears begin to haunt you
And your words can no longer be heard
I can see the curtains closing
Sometimes I can hear your lonely cry
When you pay for all your mistakes
And your regrets don't let you sleep no more
Are you screaming for help?

When there's nothing left to say and
Everything you wanted seems so far
You can try to run forever
You can live in denial but it won't help
When you think that you are so close
I am always one step ahead
Don't try to forget
Don't try to pretend

Time goes by and I'm
Waiting for a change
I know I try
I'm never giving up

Time goes by and I'm
Waiting for a change
I know I try
I'm never giving up

I know it's not easy to be free
When you're tied to your lies
If you would just open your eyes

Time goes by and I'm
Waiting for a change
I know I try...
(I try)

Time goes by and I'm
Waiting for a change
I know I try
I'm never giving up
Never giving up, never giving up...
Never giving up, never giving up...
