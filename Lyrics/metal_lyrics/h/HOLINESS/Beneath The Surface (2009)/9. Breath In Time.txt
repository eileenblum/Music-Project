Waiting for the day everything will end
Watching the years go by and keeping my faith
Will you take me, or will I stay and see?
Do I deserv to know if my life has any meaning?
I just want to say

If there's some place to stay
Some holy ground to pray
Someone calling my name
All this must be real
I want to heal all this pain
Want to believe in my fate
Make a promise and stay
We are just a breath in time

Talking to yourself
Are you still afraid?
Time to close your eyes and make a wish
When the night falls, why do you disappear?

Something is telling me you're running from your own ghosts
Don't deny and say

If there's some place to stay
Some holy ground to pray
Someone calling my name
All this must be real
I want to heal all this pain
Want to believe in my fate
Make a promise and stay
We are just a breath in time

And I will stay with you
I will be here with my fears
Don't deny me this my dear

Everything changes, nothing remains
Why worry? We all have the same sins
We'll be forever in some places
Where pain won't matter anyway
