Iâm not gonna say âIâm sorryâ
For the things that I have done
I donât mind if you donât mind
Our time is passing by
I donât know you anymore
And there are no excuses right now
Inside your head, tell me whatâs going on
Tell me whatâs going onâ¦

Out of the darkness
Into the light
Feeling my soul
Begging for more
Break all these chains
And take them away
I need to break
What I wanna change

Iâm not gonna find a reason
I wonât doubt my mistakes
I know that I have changed
Iâm not the same
And I can feel that I found my way
Because I wonât be there
To catch you when you fall
To hold you when youâre down

Out of the darkness
Into the light
Feeling my soul
Begging for more
Break all these chains
And take them away
I need to break
What I wanna change

I wonât be there
To catch you when you fall
To hold you when youâre down
More and more I see the end
And that feels good
I donât need to try anymore

Out of the darkness
Into the light
Feeling my soul
Begging for more
Break all these chains
And take them away
I need to break
What I wanna change

Out of the darkness
Into the light
Feeling my soul
Begging for more
Break all these chains
And take them away
I need to break
What I wanna change
