I was lost among my thoughts
Trying to find a way to hide
I wish that I could never see
All the truth behind the lies
Is there anyone who could tell me 
All the words I would like hear?
And here you are
By my side

Now I can feel the taste
The taste of not being alone
My thoughts have taken me away
To the place where I belong
Higher than any cloud could be
It's my first time now
Maybe I will see
And here you are
By my side

Can I really trust myself?
Can you really trust me?
Will you take me far away?
Will you let the rain fall and bring...

Can I really trust myself?
Can you really trust me?
Will you take me far away?
Can I really trust myself?

Can I really trust myself?
Can you really trust me?
Will you take me far away?
Will you let the rain fall and bring...
Your light on me

And I have heard what you told me
My world have changed with one world
Everything I thought I have lost
I'm no longer looking for
