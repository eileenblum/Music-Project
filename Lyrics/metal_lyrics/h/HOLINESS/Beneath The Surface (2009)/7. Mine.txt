I'll waste my time
I'll be your strength
You will be my blood and my heart
I will bring you down
I will steal your soul
You will be mine, you will be mine
Why can't you see?

You say you are
Ready to get away from
All those who are bringing you down
And you won't
Let me in
I want to know your deepest desires
And your fears
Under my command
You won't be alone and afraid no more
No more.

I'll waste my time
I'll be your strength
You will be my blood and my heart
I'll bring you down
I'll steal your soul
You will be mine
You will be my heart
Will be my heart
Will be my blood.

I swear that I will treat you right
If you just tell me your lies
Give me your trust and I won't tell
In your dreams
You will see my face
And finally feel what I mean
There is no truth
I just have a point of view
I wish that you could only see

I will waste my time
I will be your strength
You will be my blood and my heart
I will bring you down
I will steal your soul
You will be mine, You will be mine
You will be my heart
Why can't you see?
We were meant to be together.

In life or death I will be by your side
I will give you my air
You will breathe when I command you to
Nothing in this world
Can make me give up on your love
Even if you don't want to, I will make you
Change your mind and you be.
Will be.
Mine

I will waste my time
I will be your strength
You will be my blood and my heart
I will bring you down
I will steal your soul
You will be mine, You will be mine.
Will be my heart
We were meant to be
Together
