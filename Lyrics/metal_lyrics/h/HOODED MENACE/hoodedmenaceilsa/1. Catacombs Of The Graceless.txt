[performed by Hooded Menace]Fear frozen in the dead eyes
Life has drained from the veins
The hanging woman bothering minds
There is more to it than they know
Gravedigger with a deranged mind
in love with the dead
Wicked widow calling spirits
The doctor reanimates the deceased

Black magic, morbid desires
Mad science so vile
Macabre mystery
A crypt full of horrors
The mansion will fall
In chaos and misery

The loon is roaming the catacombs
For cadavers, fresh and old
Violent decapitation
As an undead he is to meet soon
Evil begets evil

Black magic, morbid desires
Mad science so vile
Macabre mystery
A crypt full of horrors
The mansion will fall
In chaos and misery
Catacombs of the Graceless
Catacombs of the Graceless
