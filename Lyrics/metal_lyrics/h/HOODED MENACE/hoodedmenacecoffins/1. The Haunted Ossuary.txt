[performed by Hooded Menace]Moss covered gravestones shroud the unknown
Through the dust and bones you remember decay
demonic hands pull in your ribcage 
and faded burial garments levitate away

The Haunted Ossuary
contain the ashes from death
Breed spirits into terror on Earth
The Haunted Ossuary

The well of forgotten beings from eons ago
Summon forth the chalice of unearthly blood
Creations born from hell return for their haunting
Rotting and Rising through the flesh in the mud

The Haunted Ossuary
contain the ashes from death
Breed spirits into terror on Earth
The Haunted Ossuary
