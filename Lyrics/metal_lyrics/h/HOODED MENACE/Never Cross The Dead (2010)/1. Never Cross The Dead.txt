Dark clouds form over the centennial celebration
Destroyed 500 years ago
Return for revenge and unholy desecration
Hordes of Templars hunting to kill

Resuscitation her blood is for
The undead hunger grows
Never Cross the Dead!

Festival of hope leads to certain death
These decaying shamblers hear your breath
One false move and you're cut to shreds
Gorging on blood and freshly chopped heads

Resuscitation her blood is for
The undead hunger grows
Never Cross the Dead!

Trapped inside with fear all around
They attack and kill by your own sound
Wait until dawn for them to crumble away
From bones to dust by the sunlight's ray

Barricaded inside the nearby church
Hordes of Templars hunting to kill
Majestic fog-shrouded riders of death
Swords decapitate, your blood to spill

Resuscitation her blood is for
The undead hunger grows
Never Cross the Dead!

Resuscitation her blood is for
The undead hunger grows
Never Cross the Dead!
