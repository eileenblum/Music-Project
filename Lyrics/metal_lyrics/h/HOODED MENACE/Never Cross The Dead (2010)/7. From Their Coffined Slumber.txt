From their coffined slumber, the horrid Vampyres rise,
Black velvet shrouds draped upon their sultry dead flesh.
Through a forgotten cemetery the bewitching two shall lurk,
In search of lost souls to satisfy their shocking appetites...

Lesbian daughters of the hunger for hot blood
Into their lusting mouths your life shall flood...

The Vampyres' whoring voluptuousness beguiles you...
Because while candles flicker upon their nude white flesh

Lesbian daughters of the hunger for hot blood
Into their lusting mouths your life shall flood...

Upon shining daggers are their ravenous desires reflected
And beside your drained corpse, Fran and Miriam shall kiss...

Daughters of Darkness, daughters of Dracula
