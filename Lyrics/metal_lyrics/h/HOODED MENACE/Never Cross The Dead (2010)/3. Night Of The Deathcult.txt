Riders from hell on steeds of horror
Roaming the beachside for virgin sacrifice

Chained to the rocks the screams cry out
Unimaginable terrors from the Blind Dead kings

Undead entity of living bones
Night of the Deathcult

No eyes but your heart beat gives you away
Villagers gasp as their families are destroyed
Seagulls fly across the bleak skies of the dark
The town is left barren and in ruins forever

Night of the Deathcult
Night of the Deathcult

Undead entity of living bones
Night of the Deathcult

Chained to the rocks the screams cry out
Unimaginable terrors from the Blind Dead kings
