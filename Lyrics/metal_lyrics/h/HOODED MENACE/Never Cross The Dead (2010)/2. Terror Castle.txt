Thunder cracks in the dark night sky
Grave robbing fiends unearth the dead (faiend)
Under the command of Frankenstein
These are the evil creatures you dread

A twisted plan to resurrect
a beastly giant
The corpse is prepared
for surgery of the brain

The doctor's minion's: creepy hunchback, perverted dwarf
All these freaks of nature are completely insane

Castle of freaks
Hear the blood-curdling shrieks
Castle of Terror
Horror beyond your belief

Lurking shadows in the castle of Frankenstein
His strange experiments are befitting a crime
Terrorize the living,
re-animate the dead

Awaken the beat he starts
a nightmarish bloodshed
The pitiful dwarf is shunned from the castle
He meets a horrible caveman of monstrous size

A battle of freaks, Giant versus Caveman
Enraged goliaths fight till death, now everyone dies!

Castle of freaks
Hear the blood-curdling shrieks
Castle of Terror
Horror beyond your belief

Thunder cracks in the dark night sky
Grave robbing fiends unearth the dead
Under the command of Frankenstein
These are the evil creatures you dread

The doctor's minion's: creepy hunchback, perverted dwarf
All these freaks of nature are completely insane

Castle of freaks
Hear the blood-curdling shrieks
Castle of Terror
Horror beyond your belief

Castle of freaks
Hear the blood-curdling shrieks
Castle of Terror
Horror beyond your belief

Terror!
Terror Castle!
