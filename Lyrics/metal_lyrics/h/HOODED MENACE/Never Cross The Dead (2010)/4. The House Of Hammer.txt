Welcome to the house that utter horror wrought
Founded upon an appetite for carnage and carnality
Shadowed by a legacy of blackest Gothic terror
Smutted by a shuddersome trade in the morbid

Dwelling there are those cut from the Macabre
In its dark halls do madmen and monsters lurk
And the Women lie waiting, whetted with hunger
You are called to enter, bu you will never leave

The House of Hammer: classic grotesqueries
Glorious purveyor of blue blood sinema atrocities
The House of Hammer: horrors found nevermore
Cruel Britania: the Union Jack weltered in gore

Through those windows, unspeakable nightmares flicker
Hellish experiments of the monstrous German Doctor
Satanic debauchery of the dread Transylvanian Count
Nightmarish hauntings of reverend phantom Clegg

The House of Hammer: classic grotesqueries
Glorious purveyor of blue blood sinema atrocities
The House of Hammer: horrors found nevermore
Cruel Britania: the Union Jack weltered in gore

Depraved Mocata's black mass, tribute to the Goat
Snarling village dead, arising from stinking coffins

The doomed white lycanthrope, born of lunatic rape
Fleshly Countess Dracula, on krono's stake impaled

The House of Hammer: classic grotesqueries
Glorious purveyor of blue blood sinema atrocities
The House of Hammer: horrors found nevermore
Cruel Britania: the Union Jack weltered in gore
