From beneath the blackest shadows
The creatures spawn in rancid decay
In the ground they rest until Hell opens wide
A rotted church of eternal dismay

Beings of lunacy shall rise
To capture their living glory
Blood drips from the tomb
Below the dwellings of purgatory

The undead shall never rest
On their never ending quest
Life soon comes to an end
As the creatures ascend

The castle walls now tremble
As the putrid beasts behind to scream
These nightmares of blasphemy creeping
To haunt your venomous dreams

Demons prowl the halls of death
The reaper collects his slaves
Solemn rituals summon the souls
Forever shrieking in their graves

The undead shall never rest
On their never ending quest
Life soon comes to an end
As the creatures ascend

Beings of lunacy shall rise
To capture their living glory
Blood drips from the tomb
Below the dwellings of purgatory

The undead shall never rest
On their never ending quest
Life soon comes to an end
As the creatures ascend
