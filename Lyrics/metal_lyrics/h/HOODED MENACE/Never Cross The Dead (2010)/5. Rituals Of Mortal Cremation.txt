Serpents from below the realms
Ascend from your wretched graves

Conjure unholy manifestations
Upon these Rituals of Mortal Cremation

The holy ones are soon to fall
To become our demonic slaves

Conjure

Darkest nightmares shall come alive
Within this coven of vile sorcery

A world immersed in rotting death
Final cimes from the funeral bell
Let the pious submit to suffering
Banished to the kingdom of Hell

Banished to the kingdom of Hell

Conjure unholy manifestations
Upon these rituals of Mortal Cremation
Conjure unholy manifestations
Upon these rituals of Mortal Cremation
