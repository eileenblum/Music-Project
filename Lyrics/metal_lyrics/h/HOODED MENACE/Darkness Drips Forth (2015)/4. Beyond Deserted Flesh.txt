Eyes torched by dawn 
Bones crumble into dust 
Skulls in grotesque swirl 
Absorbed into oblivion 
Drear enigma 
Lured inside the maze of sins 
Writhing shapes wallow in dusk 
Heavens ripped for centuries 
Bleeding through the shroud of gods 
Sunset of 
Hysteric prayers 
DeathÂ´s swallowing gaze 
The watchtower upon flesh 
Consecrated to obscure 
Clocks possessed 
TimeÂ´s turned back 
Cutting through silence 
Of embryonic dreams 
So our sins start anew 
Graven perversions 
Skullptures of scorn 
Die! 
Lanterns like veins 
Light unreality 
Waters stand still 
Woods petrified 
Dripping with anguish 
Exquisite tombs 
The bone cradles of our doom 
Soul-ripping lullabies 
The shadows drag 
With surreal misery 
Mad prophecy 
Scars yawning wide 
Bells rumble to dust 
Looming towers of guilt 
Devotional in nothingness 
Abode of the soulless 
Lured inside the maze of sins 
Writhing shapes wallow in dusk 
Heavens ripped for centuries 
Bleeding through the shroud of gods 
Cold Oblivion 
Beyond deserted flesh 
Consecrated to obscure
