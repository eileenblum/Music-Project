Drawn to the verge 
Of life dissolved 
Wails fondling the sails 
In shattered remorse 
Faith conceals 
Rigor mortis drift 
With no aim 
Tides of rot 
Wash away the hearts 
That once craved 
When unseen, 
Fear looks vibrant 
Coffins' jaws 
Sigh reprisal 
Creeping shades 
Of the skeletal crawl 
Dread or embrace 
The graves deeper than the sea 
On dead calm sheets 
Time suppurates 
Sleep in the arms 
Swinging a blade 
In void eyes 
Desolation thrives 
Vile from birth 
Tides of gore 
Purify the souls 
That once were 
When unseen, 
Joy looks violent 
Coffins' jaws 
Gasp for silence 
Dormant world 
In skeletal daze 
Maddening pleasure 
In blood dripping bliss
