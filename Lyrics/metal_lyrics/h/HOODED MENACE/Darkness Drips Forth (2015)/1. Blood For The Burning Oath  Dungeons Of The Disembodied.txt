Blood for... 
For the burning oath 
Blood for... 
For the burning oath 
Cold pyres 
Withholding a cinder 
Of sanity 
Remembrance 
Bloodstained and distorted 
Gathering 
On the sacrificial grounds 
Chained to 
A morbid trace 
Of condolence 
Inverse 
Dungeons 
Incorporeal 
Vaults oozing drips of the curse 
Whispers from maggot holes 
Damned souls 
Trapped in the screams 
Slave to 
The endless winds 
Damned souls 
Trapped in the screams 
Pale reflections 
Lush disharmonies 
Paralyzed 
Caught in a bizarre dream 
Charred formless 
Communing with bleakness 
Reveling 
Held captive 
In barren existence 
Ardently 
Crushed by dead feathers' weight 
In the fumes of 
The ghastly oath 
Bygone desires 
Return 
Dungeons 
Incorporeal 
Vaults oozing drips of the curse 
Whispers from maggot holes 
Damned souls 
Trapped in the screams 
Slave to 
The endless winds 
Damned souls 
Trapped in the screams
