Endless, howling dark 
Pulsating aeons 
Unfold in gape 
Supernatural weight 
Of sorrowsÂ´ black haze 
Descends to eclipse 
Immersion in gore 
Cast of souls 
Fade into absence 
To rot in resurgence 
Gross dance of the bones 
Mesmerized 
Hopeless gleam impales 
A window of throe 
Mirrors deform 
Poisoned urns of lust 
Illusions in fire 
Lead astray 
Edge of the nightfall 
Madness and disbelief 
Grace of the forlorn 
Ashen with solemn decay 
Abysmal pulse 
Of colossal gloom 
Now ashes heave 
Ethereal seance 
Draws death 
The dust of souls 
Darkness drips forth 
Darkness drips forth 
As twilight disgorges 
Eloquent, wild beasts 
Of eternal midnight 
Those elusive ruins 
Of fleshless caress 
Reflect on the dead eyes 
Growing black moss 
Rising high 
Sordid tears it cries 
Parasite in paradise 
Sick serenades 
of the headless choir 
Edge of the nightfall 
Madness and disbelief 
Grace of the forlorn 
Ashen with solemn decay 
Fade into absence 
To rot in resurgence 
Sordid tears it cries 
Parasite in paradise
