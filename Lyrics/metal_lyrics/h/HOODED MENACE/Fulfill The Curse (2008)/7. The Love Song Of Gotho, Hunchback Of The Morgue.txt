Wolfgang Gotho:
Hunchback of the Morgue,
Lurking amidst carrion
deep in hospital bowels.
A hulking malformed horror: his face
Will turn your guts!

But tender hearted is the brute -
and hungry for love

The gruesome hunchback
Will love you for always
And hideous Gotho
Will see you die...

But in Feldkirch
There is no love for Gotho,
Only students' mockery
and children's stones.
But there is Elsa, pale with
Consumption's kiss.
To her, Gotho brings roses -
Always the roses until...

But melancholy breeds
a morbid lust for murder
And then the hunchback
Will have his revenge!
The gruesome hunchback
will love you for always
And hideous Gotho
Will see you die...

Inquisition's crypt: a home for
Gotho's dead bride,
Chambers lighted by rabid vermin,
Burning alive.

Elsa sleeps in black rot
and Orlo promises rebirth
Morgue pillaging and grave desecra-
tion: The Primordial must feed!
Orlo's abomination
Needs living flesh...
Chloroformed lesbo convicts -
All for Elsa's love...

The hunchback's deranged horrors
descend into Hell:
Autopsy guttings, shovel bludgeonings,
Iron maiden deaths...
But all in vain, the Doctor's
Megalomania revealed.
Unleashed is the Primordial, that
Oozing humanoid nightmare!

It hungers and howls
and attacks the hunchback
But the acid bath awaits - and the
Burning rats cry Gotho's name...
The gruesome hunchback will love
You for always
And hideous Gotho
Will see you die...
