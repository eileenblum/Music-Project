Beat, Beat, Beat, It's Alive!
Sit Up! Stand! Look me in the eyes!

Diabolical experiments,
Creating life from death
The monster kills his creator,
The Baron takes his final breath
The monster's on a rampage,
Terror stalks the village
Killing all in his path, Smashing, Destroying, Heartless pillage

Laboratory of Nightmares
An Evil Twisted Mind
Bizzarre Lust, Strange Desires
It's Lady Frankenstein!

"I am my father's daughter." are the
words from her mouth
And just like the Baron, Tania
creates a monster for herself
Her plan is to create the perfect
man, Thomas' body
with Charles' brain
Filled with depraved lust, Lady
Frankenstein is insane

Creature vs. Creature,
In the dank laboratory
Stabbed to death, The Baron's
creation dies slowly
Only the monster that she made,
Could satisfy her desire
Choked to death while making love,
She perishes in the fire!

Laboratory of Nightmares
An Evil Twisted Mind
Bizarre Lust, Strange Desires
It's Lady Frankenstein!
