The full moon is here
You can never escape your dark destiny
The horrors of your existence
Plague you mortal mind

A beast, a monster
A creature cursed by a witch
Hungry for blood, hungry for flesh
You seek revenge to kill this evil bitch

She laughs she taunts
She enrages you more
Your helpless, pathetic
She must pay
The unholy whore

You will live for eternity
As you fulfill the curse

The full moon is here
You will kill and destroy forever
The horrors of your crimes
Will haunt your human soul

A beast, a monster
A creature cursed by a witch
Hungry for blood, hungry for flesh
You seek revenge to kill this evil bitch

She laughs she taunts
She enrages you more
Your helpless, pathetic
She must pay
The unholy whore
