Lost prophecies of perversion
A mortal soul removed from Christ
Morbid creatures prepare the flesh
With scriptures of holy sacrifice

Let the fiends
offer a virgin to the beast
Beauty and the Feast
The undead chant
and evil is unleashed
Beauty and the Feast

With a thirst for human blood
They arise from a rotten tomb
Foul beings of blasphemy
Possessed by the full moon

Let the fiends
offer a virgin to the beast
Beauty and the Feast
The undead chant
and evil is unleashed
Beauty and the Feast

The crypt has been opened
and nothing shall pass
Now the time has come for an
undead black mass

Black candles shall be lit
To illuminate the unholy chalice
Hell's hordes capture a victim
For a ritual within the evil palace

Remove her clothes and tie her up
She screams as the knife cuts
As blood pours from her corpse
The demons now feast
upon her guts

Let the fiends offer
a virgin to the beast
Beauty and the Feast
The undead chant
and evil unleashed
Beauty and the Feast
Forever obsessed
with torture and sin
Watch as the zombies now rip
through her skin
