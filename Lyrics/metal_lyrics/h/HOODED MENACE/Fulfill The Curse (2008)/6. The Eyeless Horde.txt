Hop the tracks on a train ride to hell

A reign of terror dating from centuries ago
Here in the cursed village of the Berzano

Rising from their tombs
for a night of blood feeding
Choking on terror
Your soul gripped with dread
You can't escape
The curse of the walking blind dead

On this wretched eve
The knights Templar shall rise!

Virgin sacrifice grants us life beyond the grave
An iron fist rule keeps the populace enslaved

Rising from their tombs
for a night of blood feeding
Choking on terror
Your soul gripped with dread
You can't escape
The curse of the walking blind dead
