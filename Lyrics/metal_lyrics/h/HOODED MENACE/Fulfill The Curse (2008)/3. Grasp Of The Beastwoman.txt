Beneath the river she dwells
craving human blood
When the moon is full,
a reptile-creature she becomes
Eternal horrors await you
Forget the sensibilities of a mortal

Can you comprehend her evil?
She'll be waiting
Grasp of the beastwoman

the legend of the Lorelei
She'll love you then kill you
tear your heart out
and live forever

Eternal horrors await you
Forget the sensibilities of a mortal
Can you comprehend her evil?
She'll be waiting
Grasp of the beastwoman

Siren rising from the depths
to claim an everlasting mate
underground chamber,
damned in hell
kill the beast or succumb
to your fate

Eternal horrors await you
Forget the sensibilities of a mortal
Can you comprehend her evil?
She'll be waiting
Grasp of the beastwoman
