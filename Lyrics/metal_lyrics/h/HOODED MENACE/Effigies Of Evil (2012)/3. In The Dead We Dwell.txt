Stampeding horses, the witchhunter's ride
Burnt at the stake is Satan's bride
Creatures of the devil die in the fire
Sinful flesh consumed on the pyre

Black mass, virgin sacrifice
Bloody offering to resurrect an evil vice
We exist only in hell
Consuming, vampiric souls
In the dead we dwell

Blood drips through the cracks of the tomb
Summoning Satan to bring death and doom
Shroud of evil, cloaked in darkness
Twins seduced by the satanic count
Sent by the devil, one of the undead
Bloodthirsty vampire from beyond the grave

Black mass, virgin sacrifice
Bloody offering to resurrect an evil vice
We exist only in hell
Consuming, vampiric souls
In the dead we dwell

Stake through the heart and decapitation
Brings an end to the servants of Satan

Black mass, virgin sacrifice
Bloody offering to resurrect an evil vice
We exist only in hell
Consuming, vampiric souls
In the dead we dwell

In the dead we dwell
