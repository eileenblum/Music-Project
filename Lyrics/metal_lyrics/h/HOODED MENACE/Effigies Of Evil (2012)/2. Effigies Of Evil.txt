Savage butchery in a dreary light
Slain victims laid to rest in unholy ground
Tombs are sealed with the images of man
Buried deep, the dead don't make a sound

Effigies of evil
Have possessed your soul
Effigies of evil
The ancient are in control

Arcane monuments stand guard over decaying flesh
Desolate cemetery, where the dead now rot
Statues reanimate possessed by the dead
Pulsating plasma revives moss-covered stone

Effigies of evil
Have possessed your soul
Effigies of evil
The ancient are in control
