Through the Vortex Macabre
The blind dead travel
As the evil is unleashed
Your weak soul unravels
Looming figures of horror
The templar knights will rise
The absolution of death
Becomes your welcomed demise
Seeking to destroy the mortal flesh
Upon ghoulish steeds they rides
Your heart, your breath betray you
You can run, but you cannot hide

In the Vortex Macabre
The ancient templars remain
Where horrific apparitions
Shall forever reign
In the Vortex Macabre
The ancient templars remain
Where horrific apparitions
Shall forever reign

Violent forces beyond the dark void
Worthless mortals are crushed and destroyed
The templar knights have bled, have fought
Now in the vortex they eternally rot

Vortex macabre
Vortex macabre

Sightless, heartless creatures
From beneath the earth
Resurrection through vengeance
They seek unholy rebirth
The revenge obsessed wraiths
Unleash a murderous rage
Gruesome nightmares are now reality
The blind dead bring endless fatalities

In the Vortex Macabre
The ancient templars remain
Where horrific apparitions
Shall forever reign
In the Vortex Macabre
The ancient templars remain
Where horrific apparitions
Shall forever reign

Vortex macabre
Vortex macabre
