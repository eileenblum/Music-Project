Morbid fears trapped inside rotting walls
Shrieks of insanity fill cryptic halls
Warped vision inside a demented brain
Barbaric atrocities of the insane
Cursed bloodlines succumb to madness
Usher blood tainted with evil
Decaying mind obsessed with fear
The hour of doom is drawing near

House of the damned, house of the cursed
"If the house dies, I shall die with it"

Behind decrepit walls is where you dwell
Held like a prisoner in a living hell
Strange afflictions plagued by torment
Cracks in the stone where souls lie dormant
Bizarre insanity, a twisted soul
Tortured existence in a festering hole
Entombed in a crypt, sealing your fate
Buried alive, you must now escape
Impending death consuming your thoughts
Surrounded by misery as your mind rots
Crumbling insanity, crumbling stones
House lies shattered like a pile of bones

House of the damned, house of the cursed
"If the house dies, I shall die with it"
