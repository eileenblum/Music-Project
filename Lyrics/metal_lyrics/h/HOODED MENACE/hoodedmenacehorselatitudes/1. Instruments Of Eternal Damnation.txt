[performed by Hooded Menace]Looming cathedrals stand as sentinels
Watching over the unholy legions of man

Self-appointed saviour, religious psychopath
Holy redeemer is unleashing God's wrath

Sadistic saviour on a holy inquisition
Evil released by the blade's incision
Instruments of eternal damnation

Exorcise the devil from sinful sodomites
Collecting souls for the fallen angel

Shackled in chains, a virgin sacrifice
Wicked sinners trapped in the devil's vice

Sadistic saviour on a holy inquisition
Evil released by the blade's incision
Instruments of eternal damnation

Savage messiah stalkes his prey
Crimson blood pools where the bodies lay
Black mass held in castles of corruption
Exterminator of evil seeks absolution

Practitioner of gruesome satanic rites
Maniac butcher putrid bloody gore

Sadistic saviour on a holy inquisition
Evil released by the blade's incision
Instruments of eternal damnation
