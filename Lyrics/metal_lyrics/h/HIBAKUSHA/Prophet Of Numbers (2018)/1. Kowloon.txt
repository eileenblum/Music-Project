I built the sky for you

Unaware passengers strangers in this place
Defined by ignorance they look away

This is the city built on broken backs and bruised skin
We are the creators but don't even know

Grand device fueled by tears
It's about to break this is the price
Greased by sweat near to fall
Take a breath and burn them all

Lost consciousness along the way
As the sun is fading the sky turns grey
It does not matter take my hand give in to these aeons
From the path we will stray

Ancient city artificial life
We are drones
What does the world revolve around
What does it revolve around
Not around you
This world is not about you

I built the sky for you
