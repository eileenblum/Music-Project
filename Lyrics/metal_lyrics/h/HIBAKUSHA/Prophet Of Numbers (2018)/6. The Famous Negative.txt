Luminiferous aether deludes intelligence
Winds of light block out the sun while time slows down

Calculations draw the lines of your perspective

Bringing tranquility exchanging wisdom
I raise my fist to stand this ground forevermore

I walk the walk of giants a journey to behold
This is a world of tyrants our future is foretold

Follow me into the night embrace the light

Famous singing shameless living aimless
Bleeding into painless thinking nameless
Blame us weightless faceless

I walk the walk of giants a journey to behold
This is a world of tyrants our future is foretold
Now I am liberated chains broken set me free
Show me my prejudice now washed ashore

Sensory deprivation
Awoken into mud

I walk the walk of giants a journey to behold
This is a world of tyrants our future is foretold
We are now liberated chains broken set us free
Show us our prejudice now washed ashore

Sensory deprivation
Awoken into mud
Bringing tranquility
Exchanging wisdom
