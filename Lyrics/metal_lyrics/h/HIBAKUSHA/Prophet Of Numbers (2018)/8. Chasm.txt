Day and night what a difference it makes
To not be able to hear herself
Thoughts coagulated in nothingness
Self aware but trapped by her own will

Creating and destroying simultaneously
Architect of her own downfall

Poisonous illusion dangerous delusion
Swim up to the surface
I'll be waiting for you

Architect of her own downfall

Tracing back all the things that you said
Where did it all go wrong?
Deep down in your heart you really know
Come back to me

"Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear's path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
[Dune by Frank Herbert, 1965]

Vicarious redemption through cognitive dissonance

Poisonous illusion dangerous delusion
Swim up to the surface
I'll be waiting for you
