Malevolence callousness disregard for morality
Your desperation in tune with my imperfections
Revolution inside my head

Flow of life's blood meandering through flesh
Eroding my disregard for morality
My heart frozen melting the core bright light

My eyes wide open I still can't see the sun
My cries unfrozen an omen to this world
Black smoke fills my lungs suffocating
Dive down in fallout set it down in stone
My knees a cold floor existential bliss
Whispers breath whither is all this even real
Embrace submission suffer consequence
My dear what have I become

Your hand in mine soft lips cold skin
Your grip fading slowly slips away

Years passing by me memories never left
First light of daybreak tearing down these walls
Remorse has left me show me what can be
Is this world my enemy

You're exactly what I aspired to be
I have become that which you've always despised
Newborn icon of psychopaths

No matter how hard nothing left but pain
No matter how long all will be in vain

Malevolence callousness devil inside of me
Your adoration cures insanity

"Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity in all this vastness there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves."
[Pale Blue Dot by Carl Sagan, 1994]

Unleash the torrential downpour
Punishment make me suffer
Purify this callous heart
Lead me to redemption
