Floating on the dark sea of disparity
You meet the faceless storm
Transcending my dependencies
Infecting and polluting

Crumbling midnight sky
Clouds gather intertwining morals
For my gain deconstructing
Soon your last breath will be exhaled

No it will not matter how often I recall the tragedy
Your constellation
No it will not matter how many lies we spread
Provides no consolation

Addicted to manipulation
Delusion fills my veins
All around falls into examinate illusory

I become a black hole consuming
Reaping and devouring
Insatiable void

Abusing their fragility
The body imprisoned by the mind
Suffering afflictions
I take what is now mine

Seek out the weak the sick and the foolish
Their insignificance holds their value
My life's blood
