After the storm a breeze softly brushes my cheek silence
Soothing warmth tells me all I need to know

What was all of this meant to be?
Now was this what you had in mind?

Delusional by design

All this time I was trapped in these fractals
Black dead smoke has now cleared so it seems all show

Follow me down

After the rain
I finally feel sane
It all starts with me
This is how it will be
And after the fire
Your lies will expire
There's things you cannot amend
But this is how it will end
Read my lips word by word
My story will not go unheard
Broken loose from the hive
Now I feel so alive
