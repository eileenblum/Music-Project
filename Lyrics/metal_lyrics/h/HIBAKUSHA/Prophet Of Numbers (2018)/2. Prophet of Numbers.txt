This isn't what we had in mind who's to blame?
Levitating on false promises lost control
I thought I warned you
Warned you stay true
Paralysis a consequence you'll soon learn
For intentions for my gain but who's to blame?

Life synthesized within the boundaries of our own imagination
We gently lay to rest all that remains
Our words our prayers mere whispers floating in the wind
Honesty and truth still run through these veins

Remember me by these words
The midnight in your soul growing colder and colder

Weightless he sailed on and on and on and on hoping to find his long lost brother
A final look to that western sky wishing once more he could turn back time
I forgive you please forgive me

Remember me by these words
The midnight in your soul growing colder and colder
When the tide is highest we meet again
We sing for solace standing shoulder to shoulder

This isn't what we had in mind who's to blame?
Levitating on false promises but who's to blame?

Warning
