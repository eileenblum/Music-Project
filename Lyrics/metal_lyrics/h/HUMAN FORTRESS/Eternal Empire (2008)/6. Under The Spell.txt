Dark shadows in the sky
In lost horizons
Can you see these things
That are dwelling deep inside

Chosen to be alone and...
Banished into isolation
My freedom lies in solitude
My hope, no faith, just emptiness

Show me the way
Don't lead me astray

Let me be your guide
I am the light, the light that you see
Let me be your guide - you're lost in me

Deep down in the ocean
I swallow everything around
A saviour, a traitor
My light is the last hope
Making the innocent drown
This is my spell

An empty heart in a cold world
A room of silence
Save my soul tear down the wall
Around my heart it's breaking down
In lost horizons
Can you see these things
That are dwelling deep inside

Chosen to be alone and...
Banished into isolation
My freedom lies in solitude
My hope, no faith, just emptiness

Show me the way
Don't lead me astray

Let me be your guide
I am the light, the light that you see
Let me be your guide - you're lost in me

Let me be your guide
I am the light, the light that you see
Let me be the light - you're lost in me

Deep down in the ocean
I swallow everything around
A saviour, a traitor
My light is the last hope
Making the innocent drown
This is my spell
