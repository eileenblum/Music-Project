A mystery for so many ages
But no one found the answer no prophets nor sages
Why are we here where do we go
Tell me the secrets I don't know
Tell me the truth behind it

Show me the way, give me the light
To find my way in this eternal light
Destination out of sight
Eternal existence
Present the masterplan that will not fail
The holy grail

With all my might, with all my power
I command in the name of God
Grant me salvation, no damnation
I don't want to rot

I'm the end of everything, even that of gods
When I dance on your grave
You'll get what you deserve

Now it's too late
No one threatens me, you fool
That's your salvation
I grant you damnation

Welcome to my horror show
Just step into the dark
And enjoy my gloomy realm
Welcome now - my little horror show
Just step into the dark
There is no escape - No way out!

Everyone is equal to me
holy men, children and bastards
There is nothing you can say or pay
You'll be mine one day
Then you'll get immortality
Near the borders of insanity
This will be my gift to you
Cause no one's equal to me

Look back - so sad
You've lost your silly head
My holy grail - the only way
Look back - so sad
You've lost your silly head
That's your salvation I grant you damnation

Welcome to my horror show
Just step into the dark
And enjoy my gloomy realm
Welcome now - my little horror show
Just step into the dark
There is no escape - No way out!
From my horror show there is no escape - No way out!
