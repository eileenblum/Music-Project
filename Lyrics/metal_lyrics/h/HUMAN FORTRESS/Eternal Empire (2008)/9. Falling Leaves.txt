Why did you call his name?
Why didn't you accept the shame?
Why did you grab the sword you could not handle, you could not bear?
What did you try to achieve?
What did misguide your belief?
What did you think to find in useless battles but tears and death - but tearful death

Here lies my dying son
Soon my own time will come
In the halls of our fathers we shall meet again
My world's now an empty shell
I'm burning in a living hell
And my soul screams out vengeance, I will not return - not return

How did you make him gone?
How did you slay my son?
Now you will serve the king of pain in his dreadful realm, his fearful realm
Where will you meet your death?
Where do you hide from my wrath?
I will not rest til I'm free from the spell and your doom is sealed, a sinister fate - your sinister fare

Here lies my dying son
Soon my own time will come
In the halls of our fathers we shall meet again
My world's now an empty shell
I'm burning in a living hell
And my soul screams out vengeance, I will not return - not return

Here lies my dying son - I will not rest until my quest is done...
