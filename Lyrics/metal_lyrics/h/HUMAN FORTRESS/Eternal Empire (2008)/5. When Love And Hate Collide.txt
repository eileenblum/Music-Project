Pain is just one step away
I can't explain
Draw a distinction between
Love and fidelity

I really hate the daily grind
Can't turn back time

Wipe away the rain of tears
I draw the line
Wipe away the rain of tears
When love and hate collide

Tried to mull over my faults
Yield to despair
Just thinking twice - can't decide
What's wrong or right

Wipe away the rain of tears
I draw the line
Wipe away the rain of tears
When love and hate collide
