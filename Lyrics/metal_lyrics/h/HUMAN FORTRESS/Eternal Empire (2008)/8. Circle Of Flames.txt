Safely locked in a cell
I'm sleepless in my bed
A prisoner for ages
Time is gnawing through my head

I kept the secret well
That burns me from the inside
I fell a darkness grow
That swallows every light

I bow my head. I clasp my hands
For a very last prayer
Forgive my sins, your grace begins
Where men turn away

One night of desperate hours
Starlight fading in the light of dawn
No might on Earth left to save me
When the devil writes my name
In a circle of flames

I don't think they'll miss me
When I'm not seen anymore
Much too late I start to feel
Things I've never felt before
Sympathy and regret
Only words until this day
Who can teach me how to pray?

I bow my head. I clasp my hands
For a very last prayer
Forgive my sins, your grace begins
Where men turn away

One night of desperate hours
Starlight fading in the light of dawn
No might on Earth left to save me
When the devil writes my name
In a circle of flames
