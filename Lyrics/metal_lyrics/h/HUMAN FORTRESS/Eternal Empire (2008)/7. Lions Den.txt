Honour to the king, his will alone be done
No other man or God as great as him
He wisely put us here to watch over his lands
In bloom thanks to our good advice

Glory to our king, to him alone we bow
Forget the sky, look up to the throne
We prepared a law: In your name we shall ban
All religions except the praise for you

There's one man close to you
Who won't abjure from his god
Unfaithful betrayer, into the lions' den

The righteous remained
In the lions' den
As the lions' friend
Proved the traitors wrong
In the lions' den
As the lions' friend he returned

30 days and 30 nights, for a predecent is due
Prayers or pleads not to you be their last deeds

There's one man close to you
Who won't abjure from his god
Unfaithful betrayer, into the lions' den

The righteous remained
In the lions' den
As the lions' friend
Proved the traitors wrong
In the lions' den
As the lions' friend he returned
