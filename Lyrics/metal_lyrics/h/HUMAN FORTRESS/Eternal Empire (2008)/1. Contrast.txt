Walking in a world with black and white horizons
Talking to a crowd with empty words of silence
Why should I carry on? So alone
Cause I'm the grey between

Nothing more but a scheme
Like noise on a screen
I'm flickering from side to side
I can't hide, don't know what's wrong or right

Come, close your eyes
Don't mind reality
Join in our lies
Find your eternal sanctuary

I am lost between the worlds
I'm on a path leading to nowhere
Lost between the worlds
I'm on path leading to nowhere

Between the frontiers of ignorance
I fail to balance
I don't have a chance
It tears me apart
It devours my heart
A candle in a rainy night
A desperate fight
There's only wrong, no right

Come, close your eyes
Don't mind reality
Join in our lies
Find your eternal sanctuary

I am lost between the worlds
I'm on a path leading to nowhere
Lost between the worlds
I'm on path leading to nowhere

When I close my eyes
I see the world in bright shining colours
Don't mind reality
Found my eternal sanctuary

I am lost between the worlds
I'm on a path leading to nowhere
