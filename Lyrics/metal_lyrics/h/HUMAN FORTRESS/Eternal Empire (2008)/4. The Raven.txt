When I look into your eyes
I see them all arise(all arise)
My feathered friend, observer of grief
Dark visions of the past
A horror that will ever, ever last
It is the truth that I can't believe

You have seen so much hate
Growing till it was too late
A manmade hell here on earth
Just when death closes in
Time to confess all their sins
Forced to return the gift - the gift of birth

With silent cries he drifts into the dark
With sorrow in his hear

The time the last light dies
All grace will be denied
The end of our future
When the dark Raven flies

Taking the eyes from the dead
Blinding a blinded head
They couldn't see while they were alive
Watch the reaper's dance
To the score in your bloody hands
A deadly symphony written for gun and knife

With silent cries he drifts into the dark
With sorrow in his hear

The time the last light dies
All grace will be denied
The end of our future
When the dark Raven flies
