My lord save me
Thy son, thy blood
With evil thoughts in mind
So dark, so black
A fallen one

(oh black wizard)
Oh wizard in your hollow
Repent your sins
And beg for our grace
Pray, pray
Wizard in your hollow
Repent your sins
Or never leave this place

Hear my warning or you will die
Don't turn away, reveal the masterplan - now!

Confess, reveal
We bless, we heal
Change your fate
Before it's too late

What happened to me, what have I become?
A black shadow's son, a darkness in me
But there's no way back and soon I will be free

Lord give me strength
For heart and Soul
With hatred in my eyes
So cold, so cruel
I'm the one

Black wizard in your hollow
Repent your sins
And beg for our grace
Pray, pray
Wizard in your hollow
Repent your sins
Or never leave this place

Hear my warning or you will die
Don't turn away, reveal the masterplan - now!

Confess, reveal
We bless, we heal
Change your fate
Before it's too late

What happened to me, what have I become?
A black shadow's son, a darkness in me
But there's no way back and soon I will be free

There will be no grace(oh wizard in your hollow)
You'll never leave this place(oh wizard in your hollow)
There will be no grace(oh wizard in your hollow)
Never leave this place - now you die

Black wizard in your hollow
Repent your sins
And beg for our grace
Pray, pray
Wizard in your hollow
Repent your sins
Or never leave this place
