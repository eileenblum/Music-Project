[L: Parcharidis / M: Parcharidis, Wolf, Zaios]

Knights are the one who own the powers and the skill
To bring us back from those cold nights and winters chill
While riding on the horseback of their mighty stance
We are ready to arise for the battle of the Prance

Our hearts trust in our strengh
In the hour of combat - Firm hearted like a bull
We are there to fight until our kingdom owns all lands
A hundred thousand failed at our sight

[CHORUS]
Shining through the sky - We're shining
Shining as the knight in shinning armour
Our stell shines so bright - We're shining
Shining through the sky - We're shining

A master guide our hands - We praise our God in bed
And help our heroes while they live and keep them dead
We show the power of the runes to those who hear
We fight to save the world and all that we hold dear

Lords of fear, great of fame - In the hearts of all lands
Casting fear in hearts - We go forth in valour
Return in triumph - The greatest of awe

[CHORUS]

Lords of fear, great of fame - In the hearts of all lands
Praise not the (just) shining knights - In glory did they fall
But also those who failed - But gave to it their all
Let's celebrate the fallen ones
