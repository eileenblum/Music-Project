[L: Parcharidis / M: Tammen, Wolf, Zaios]

Into the arena they were sent to fight
Some used spears, swords or might
While the spectators roared
A combat so fierce, heated blood smelled everywhere
Between men and hungry beast
While the emperor joined this feast

[CHORUS]
Honor strengthed his soul
An actor who plays his role
Gladiator of Rome
In search for your glory, the arena remained your home

The crowd cheered them on
They were clapping at the kill
All were awed and amazed by the warrior's skill
Clashing blades swing, bleeding chaos in the sand
Hundred victims were killed by gladiator's hand

[CHORUS]

[FINAL CHORUS]
Gladiator of Rome - In search for your home - The arena remained it
Gladiator of Rome - In search for your honour - The arena will praise you
Gladiator of Rome - In search for your soul - The arena has taken her
Gladiator of Rome - In search for your glory - The arena remained your home
