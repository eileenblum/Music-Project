[L: Parcharidis / M: Parcharidis, Wolf]

I've watched the waves crush on deck - Lashed to the rigging cold and wet
I've travelled through ill winds and fair - The cold, the spindrift in the air
Standing on deck - soothed by the way - Watch the horizon awaiting light of day
The breathless search leaves me in awe

[BRIDGE 1]
Holy grail mine - I will search 'till my holy soul will bend
Holy grail mine - My strength is never breaking as the strength of ten
Holy grail mine - I will search 'till my soul will bend
Holy grail mine - I will search 'till my soul will bend

Gamblers under deck searching for their holy grail
A table full of dreamers, their hope, the perfect deal

[CHORUS]
Holy grail, wisdom of my life
Of his secret seek to find
Or is it lost 'till the end of time

[BRIDGE 1]
Holy grail mine - I will search 'till my holy soul will bend
Holy grail mine - My strength is never breaking as the strength of ten
Holy grail mine - I will search 'till my soul will bend
Holy grail mine - I'll go overseas to find you in the end
Holy grail mine - I will search 'till my holy soul will bend
Holy grail mine - I will search 'till my soul will bend

[FINAL CHORUS]
Holy grail, wisdom of my life
Of his secret seek to find
Or is it lost 'till the end of time
Centuries my ancients rode
To find this mistery of old
Immortality as the legend told
