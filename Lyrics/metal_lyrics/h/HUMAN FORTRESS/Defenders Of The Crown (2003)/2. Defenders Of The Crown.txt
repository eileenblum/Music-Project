[L: Parcharidis / M: Parcharidis, Wolf, Marquardt]

Templars of steel, Knights of the cross
Unite our armies to honour our God
Holy land, we are marching on
Ten thousand men, beneath the ashes of Jerusalem

God sons ask for thyself to honour Jesus majesty
We shall return proud from the sea
Richard the Lionheart, the emperor of that century
Fought fo the cross, for Cristianity

[PRE CHORUS]
We are there to fight - Defenders of the crown
With the legion of our God - We will conquer Ascalon
Even cities like Acre, Jaffa and Jerusalem
Cannot break us iron men - We're defenders of the crown

We proudly sail across the seas
Muslim invaders bow down to your kness
With a great king upon our side
The Lionheart - This leadership will tear them all apart

Richard the Lionheart took part in the third great crusade
Fought forces of mighty Saladin
Richard the Lionheart, the emperor of that century
Fought for England - For territory

[CHORUS]
We are there to fight - Defenders of the crown
With the legion of our God and our military sound
Our forces will unite with our strengh and might

[BREAK]
Lionhearts men's blood paved the legend - Sacral quest Jerusalem

For such a brave and noble men king Richards death come soon
An arrow strike brought forth his doom
Richard the Lionheart, the emperor of that century
Legendary buried in Fontvraud Abbey

[CHORUS]

[BREAK]
