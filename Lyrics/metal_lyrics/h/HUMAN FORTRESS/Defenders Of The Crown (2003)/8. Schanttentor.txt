[L: Parcharidis / M: Human Fortress]

A road so old, so dark - A trail where the damned walk
I've reached the gates of Schattentor
Here under this sycamore - Lies buried my claymore
Through long absence I have not been here

Now armed with dagger, sword and bow - A thief will never let you know
That he is blamed to be the source - The bringer of an evil curse
That he is evil, honourless - Never crave a good fight
Yes I'm a thief, a larcenist - A creature of the night

[CHORUS]
Torches guide my way to Shattentor - Where wandering souls forlorn
For gold my soul will wander alone
Will wander alone

I'm a thief who never learned to fear - Often quiet when you come near
My life is all I hold dear - I am well paid for the bloodstains long
For robbing the wicked - And sending them where they belong

The guardian knights next to arrive - No, they will leave me alive
I saw their horses, through the tress - Heard their panting through the
leaves
Rumble, ruble through the grass - Through villages they pass
And over hills to find the thief - Known far and wide

[CHORUS]

I'm the tief known fear - The thief known far and wide
Know places I can hide - To elude a guard or enemy very close
For I am swift and clever than the most - The people don't know what I'm inside
