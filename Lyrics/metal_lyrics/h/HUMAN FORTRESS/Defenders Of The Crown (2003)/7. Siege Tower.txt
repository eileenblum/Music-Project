[L: Parcharidis / M: Parcharidis, Marquardt]

Stranger has thou seen their lordly castle
The castle that was build so near by the sea
Ancient walls standing tall
Black oil hath come to boil
Archers are ready to bloody the soil

My fighting hands ain't numb by enemy breath
My vie in today in this distant land
My warfare has to withstand
Steely shines keenly honed
Made ready to slash  the opponent's flesh

[BRIDGE]
There is nothing to fear but fear itself - Why should my attack dust away on a shelf

[CHORUS]
Siege tower raised high - My castle of greed raised as high as the sky
I attack in the night - When my crossbowmen are out of sight
Siege tower raised high - Offensive archers are prepared now to die
With my arrows stream of fire - Soldiers are killed with desire

Soon death will come upon this castle - In pain will one lord die
The minstrel then will sing death's song - For him per chance or I

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]
