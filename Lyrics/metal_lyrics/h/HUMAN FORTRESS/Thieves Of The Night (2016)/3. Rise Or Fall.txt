Lived a lie
Many times
Riding through the storm
Wounds are still bleeding
Can't stop screaming
Feel the blade
On my neck
For my dying breath
Anguish is floating
Through my veins

Rise or fall
Rise or fall
Try to find a way to win
And crack the wall
Rise or fall
Rise or fall
Bow down my head
Confess my sins
By grace of god
Rise or fall

I have failed
To corrupt
The guardians of the night
They want to take vengeance
Bounty on my head
Catch my horse
Chain my hands
Never get my soul
You'll never break me
I shall prevail
