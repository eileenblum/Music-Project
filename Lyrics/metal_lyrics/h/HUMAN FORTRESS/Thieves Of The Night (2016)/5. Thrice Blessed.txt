Sheltered all days
Guarded in any ways
So much-admired
Fulfil all desires

Wealth is untold
Enjoy the rain of gold
Live without care
Isolation beware

Whenever I'm dreaming
I leave for a spell
Take me away to my better self
Welcome to the real world
I'm sheltered from reality
Thrice blessed

Can't bend the grates
From my gilded cage
No place to hide
Surrounded by my guards

Lonely and lost
No high degree of trust
Breach of the rules
Are without excuse
