Nothing ever works out
Like you want to
Nothing ever happens
Happens like it should
As the wind of time blows by
I close my eyes
Things would never be the same

Look for a distant memory
Deep inside of my heart
Feel the shame suddenly
Run down a dead end street
All I need
There's no excuse
I am free

I'm alone
I'm a hunter on lonely roads
I'm alone
When my damn war is over
I'm alone
Pain of 1000 lies are inside my mind
I'm alone
All alone

There's no return on lonely roads
Spend too many years away from you
Why can't you see
What's real
I am free all alone
On my own
