Steal a glance
In bad faith
Hungry eyes
Never disappear
Greed for gain
Take the haul
Show our skills
Just to fill the bolt

No mens rea
Never surrender
There's no sense of shame

We're gonna fall from grace
'till the end of time
We are the thieves of the night
Get lost without a trace
We are hard to find
We are the thieves of the night

We want more
Take it all
Mean no harm
We're insatiable
Aiming high
Without strife
We won't stop
'Cause we can't get enough
