Deep in the dungeons of doom and despair
Sneak to a place in the dark
Eke out a living you can stay alive
Better pay heed what I say

Cleft of the rocks are too small to escape
No daylight in my grey world
There is no torch, no candle, no view
To see moon and landscape my mate

Pestilence
In the dungeons of doom
Of cold ashes and coom
Where rags can't keep warm
One last glance
To the dungeons of doom
I'll decay in the ruins
Burn off my disease

Pestilence
In the dungeons of doom
Of cold ashes and coom
Where rags can't keep warm
Trembling in the ruins of despair
Death came as my release

Who put me out of my misery
There is no way to survive
Verminous food you can't even relish
Don't want to be buried alive
A virus corroded my body and soul
Let me go to devils hollow
My temple is burning always yearn to die
Get rid of my sorrow
