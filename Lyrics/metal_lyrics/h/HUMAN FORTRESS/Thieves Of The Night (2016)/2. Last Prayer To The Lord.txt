Waiting for a sunrise
Tired and aggrieved
I don't dare to get up
The devil rests gently
Still remain in silence
Try to hold my breath
I can hear a whisper
Evil is awake

I try to run
I try to hide
All entries locked
Want to survive
Suppress my fear
To clear my mind
'till I'm out of danger

Last prayer to the Lord
Before it is over
Last prayer to the Lord
Hallowed by thy name
Someone to assist
Endure these dark hours
Struggle for survival has begun
The sway of evil shades the sun

I can't bear the slander
Pure indignity
Fatal smile of anger
Nothing good's foreseen
Rolling like a thunder
Hear a blast of rage
Running fast for cover
Until the storm is flashing by
