Always take no risk
In my world of bliss
Never had a creed
Overcautiously

Telling many lies
They won't recognize
Chase away the ghost
Taking all their gold

You always strive
To avert my eyes
Fear my killing glance

Gift of prophecy
I foresee your stroke of fate
When it's all over now
Gift of prophecy
Determine your destiny
Read it in your hands

Victims buy my fraud
Believed all I told
Call the afterworld
To your ancestors

Their last-ditch attempt
To find out their fate
Gullible and dull
They deserve to fall
