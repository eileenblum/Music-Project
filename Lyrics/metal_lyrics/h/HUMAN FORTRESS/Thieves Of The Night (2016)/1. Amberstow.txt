Yearning for a better world
To live without sorrow
Yearning for prosperity
I strive to do

Yearning for equality
Union of nations
We stick together now

Begging for passage to
My final journey
Begging for assistance to
Ride out my way

Begging for a piece of luck
To ward off evil
I leave it all behind

Follow me - Amberstow
Beyond the horizon
Praise - Amberstow
I know it is real
My own world won't stop turning
Before I arrive
I am free - Amberstow
I'm under your spell again

Try to visualize
In the middle of nowhere
It must he wonderful
Too good to be true

Is. this so far away
Or just an illusion?
To leave it all behind
