Roll the dice for my prophecy
Man just forges his destiny
I believe
Play my card in the game of life
Gamble for high stakes
I just have to try to survive

Vicious circle
I cannot escape
Evil eyes blazing in my face
Vicious circle
Did I get ensnared?
Repressed my mind at desperate times
Dwindle into misery

I'm a shame to society
Miss a chance
I'm a renegade
Now it's too late
Never doubt my dishonesty
No one  cares
I don't give a damn
I'll never change
