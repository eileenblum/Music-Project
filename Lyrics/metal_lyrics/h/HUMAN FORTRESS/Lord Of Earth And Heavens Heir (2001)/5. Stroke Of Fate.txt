I see a blind man who follows my way
Inside a trap
Shattered he breathes out decay

He's trying to refuse something he cannot choose
'cause there's a trap he always steps inside
It shatters you it steals my light...it steals my light

I can shatter my mind and hide what I feel
It's not the the right way to loose myself
This hard stroke of fate and inconcievable pain
Can't break my poor heart before it heals inside

He's building castles out of sand with his once broken hands
It's running through with no chance to hold back just one single grain

It's time to believe in our gods and souls
To break down iron walls

He's trying to refuse something he cannot choose
Cause there's a trap he always steps inside
It shatters you it steals my light...it steals my light

I won't hide the way I feel
It's not the right way to loose myself

Oh, god come on.............
