No,no
....a little flame can't dive into the sea

Don't believe all hope is receding
Don't believe you just can walk away
Ups and downs make you feel giddy
What's the price you have to pay

Your life is like a night without the moonlight
A little flame can't dive into the sea
The endless lies to clear up all your sorrows
These wasted days to find a way
A little flame can't dive into the sea

You're just a boasting fool
All you know are your own laws and rules
You never finished school
And guess now " I'm a smart boy" and selling shoes

Your mind is full of hate
And get into a rage you create...you create
You like your muscle play
To flee from your dejection day by day

Lost in the depths of my fantastic world
Vague fragments of days will turn
Into grotesque black visions
A god before a god
"summon all the demons to rise from the graves"

Still believe time goes by
Still believe it's hard - it's hard to survive
Let it be and see what's real
All the time - there's something you just can conceal

See what's real
It's hard to survive.....it's hard to survive

Wake up and don't defy
You're a slave of your depression and lies
What else can turn your brain
There's no vain of truth in what you try to say

Your life is like a night without the moonlight
A little flame can't dive into the sea
These endless lies to clear up all your sorrows
These wasted days to find a way
A little flame can't dive into the sea

Still believe time goes by
Still believe it's hard - it's hard to survive
Let it be and see what's real
All the time - there's something you just can conceal
