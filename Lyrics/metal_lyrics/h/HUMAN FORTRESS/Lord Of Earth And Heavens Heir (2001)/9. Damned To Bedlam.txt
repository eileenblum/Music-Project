Inside hidden towers
In a glorious land
Where superior beings punish mortal men
They're not human as they appear to be
Their purpose here, to torture you and me

Inside dungeons of despise
Their dark dominion marches on disguised

They were mad, they were damned
Had no way to defend
Caught in chains behind walls without doors
Empty hearts, helpless souls
We're out of control
In a hell of their raging own
We're damned to bedlam

It's the living inside, our misery burns
A place of isolation far away from the free
We are sick of desperation
Unable to feel behind borders of steel

And now it's necessary for you to plead
To your inner self, examine the need
Well, it's to late to change greed into creed
And this could have been done
By doing a good deed

It drives me crazy - it tears me apart
I'm damned to bedlam and caught behind walls
I won't find innocence in my heart
There's no liberation - just no helping hand
Just pain and madness again and again
Is it were I have to stay 'till my end
