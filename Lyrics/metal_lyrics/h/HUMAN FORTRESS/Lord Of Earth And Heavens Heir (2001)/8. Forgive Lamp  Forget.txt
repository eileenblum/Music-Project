Maybe time heals my wounds
And I'm crying deep to myself
This feeling in my broken heart seems to die
I've been disappointed

Tell me will I find out
The reason I understand
But maybe I am a gullible fool
Who ignores each warning

I'm still trying to forgive and forget
These endless lies can't go on - I'm still
Trying to forgive I regret
Mistrust will remain - I can't forget these days

Save me, I need support
To be strong now, I don't like this game
From now on, I know for sure that I am
Too weak to recover
