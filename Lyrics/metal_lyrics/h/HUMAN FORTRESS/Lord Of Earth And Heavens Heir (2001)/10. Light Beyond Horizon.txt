Sun comes up
blows the darkest night away
Feel a year like just one day
Don't look back
To the way that you have gone
'cause as hard as it may seem
What's your fate, what's right or wrong within your life

A life's full of power, live fast just be free
Don't care about a future to know what will be
Your steps guiding forward on a way you don't see
You're running through time
"dream or reality "

What's your fate
What is right and what is wrong
On the way within your life
If you feel good
Let this day begin
Clear up questions of today
What's your fate, what's right or wrong within your life
