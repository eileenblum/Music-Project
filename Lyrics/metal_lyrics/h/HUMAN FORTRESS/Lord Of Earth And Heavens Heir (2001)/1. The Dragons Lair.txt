A dragon in his wildest state
Polymorphed by greed and within burning hate
Empowered by mad bloodlust
Hs shives to turn all life to dust
From three caverns filled with fire, death desire
We paralyzed by a dragonfear
Mighty knights grow numb when he's near

We march into our doom - into the dragons lair
Three caverns of dust and fire
A battle breaks the gloom - he's strong as fair
Those dragon skills - turn hope into despair

With his putrid fire breath
In those valliant knights ear he whispers pure death
Wizards burn in lightning rain
They writhe in an infernal pain
Into the dragons lair we march
Into the dragons lair......

His leather wing brewed up a storm
Blows and gusts to move his form, so he can fly
Fly before the dawn
He'll be back before too long
He could grab us with his demon blood soaked claws
One evil ghost without fear without honour
Mighty knights grow numb when he's near

The dragons lair
