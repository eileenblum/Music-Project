Lying here in the face of death â 
I realise Iâve survived â 
Rub my eyes, nothingâs wrong
With aiming high but I lost everything
And pay the price for my greed

Lying here, out of breath I tried to move away
Lean on steel, that spares my sin
Lost in the land of my enemies
Damned to die lonely on a battlefield

Pray for salvation, self-revelation
I have to pray to confess my sins
Show me the way to ride out that day
Rise up to paradise when I die

Pray for salvation, self-revelation
I have to pray to confess my sins
Show me the way to ride out that day
Rise up to paradise and now I die
