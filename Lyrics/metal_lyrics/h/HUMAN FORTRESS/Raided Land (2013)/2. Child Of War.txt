Thereâs nothing I can hear
No one I can see
Nothing that I can feel
Thatâs the way Iâd like to be

There were many things to bear
Shed tons of tears
Too much havoc and crime
Deep inside of my mind

You canât heal me â wear me down
No one can free me â I have a mind on my own
You canât heal me â no you donât
Iâm just a lonely soul â a child of war evermore

Always walking all alone
Dine on my own
Feel empty inside
Iâm restless at night

Thatâs my struggle for life
It tears me apart
Though never say die
Iâm the one to get by

You canât heal me â wear me down
No one can free me â I have a mind on my own
You canât heal me â no you donât
Iâm just a lonely soul â a child of war evermore
