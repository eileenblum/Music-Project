Our last embrace
One melding gaze
We drenched in tears
No silent reproach
A desperate deed I have to dare

Give me a shelter
Is there a den I follow
I have to fool my enemies
Give me a shelter
One place to hide forever
Want to survive to live my dreams

Saddle my horse for my last ride
They canât chase me on my secret path
When waft of mist are lying on such miry ground

The time is right to take my sword
The battle axe, arrows and bow
For my defense â thereâll be falling one by one

Give me a shelter
Is there a den I follow
I have to fool my enemies
Give me a shelter
One place to hide forever
Want to survive to live my dreams
