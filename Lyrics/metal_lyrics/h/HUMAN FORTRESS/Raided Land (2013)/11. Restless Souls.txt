Weâre the last who left behind
Weâre just out to get it right
Just believe the prophecy
Thatâs our will, our destiny

Against shadows and darkness
Salvation to find the key
Follow stars on our holy way
To the end on judgment day
Curse and passion

We are â band of brothers
Searching, all around the world
We are restless souls
âtill the end of time

Under blue skies, oceans wide
âround the world leaving all behind
Find the sanctuary
Heal our souls
For ourselves before we fall

Against shadows and darkness
Salvation to find the key
Follow stars on our holy way
To the end on judgment day
Curse and passion

We are â band of brothers
Searching, all around the world
We are restless souls
âtill the end of time
