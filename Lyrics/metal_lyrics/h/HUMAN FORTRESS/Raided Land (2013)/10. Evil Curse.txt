Donât you dare
Never touch the wand
Donât take his elixir
Have to beware
Heâll chant a spell
The bane of your life

Brace yourself
Youâll disappear without any trace
Now burning eyes are watching me
So bright they glare

Evilâs meant to live forever
Hell to pay for now and ever

Don't cast a spell on me
No evil curse on me
You canât deny the truth
Iâm not another prey for you

Desperately
Now itâs time to fight
To prevent my destiny
I will survive
This mortal agony
The bane of your life
