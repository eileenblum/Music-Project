The sands of time are burning out
What is all this roar about?
There are many things to do
Now I know
No I canât brace up myself
Lost in thoughts forever
Just reflecting my past life
Full of pain

Wasted wasted years
Shed so many tears â 
Iâm walking through the dark
Weighed down with sorrow
Wasted wasted years
Itâs so plain to me
I canât turn back time
Canât go on â Itâs over now

Just before I pass away 
There are many things to say
Just my sole heir hold my hand
All alone
My good heart is full of trust
But thereâs nothing I can give
I made too many mistakes in my life
Wasted all my property
It got lost forever
Lived too long beyond my means
Now I care

Wasted wasted years
Shed so many tears â 
Iâm walking through the dark
Weighed down with sorrow
Wasted wasted years
Itâs so plain to me
I canât turn back time
Canât go on â Itâs over now
