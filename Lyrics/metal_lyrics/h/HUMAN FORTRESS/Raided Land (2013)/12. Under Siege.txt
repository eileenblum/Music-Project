One day of shame
Weâre longing for a second chance
But we didnât heed
The warning from our enemy
The breach is irreversible

Under siege
We fight behind our gates of steel
The king of war weâre still fighting for
We swear an oath so heaven canât wait
Itâs no time to die
We will recover from the storm
Raise our swords before weâre gonna fall

They donât gain ground
But we believe in victory
Our losses should not be in vain 
My Lord is sneaking up
Far behind to catch our souls
A bloody prey he canât let go no
