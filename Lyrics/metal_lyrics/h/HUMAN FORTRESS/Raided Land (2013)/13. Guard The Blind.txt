Weâre part of some strange plan
Feel a little lost in Johannâs hand
Who can take a hold â 
To save us on the stony ground â
I know

Gonna burn to ashes
A self-defeating prophecy
Gonna fell their lashes 
To goat us on
Itâs all forlorn

Our king dictates a dreadful war
Follow the blind weâre still fighting for
Weâre marching on the path of no return
To try to guard the blind

We couldnât see the sky
The smoke of battle right in our sight
The moment Johann died
We really had no chance to win this fight

Gonna burn to ashes
A self-defeating prophecy
Gonna fell their lashes 
To goat us on
Itâs all forlorn

Our king dictates a dreadful war
Follow the blind weâre still fighting for
Weâre marching on the path of no return
To try to guard the blind
