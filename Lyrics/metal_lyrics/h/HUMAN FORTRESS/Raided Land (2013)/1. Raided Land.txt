We march and ride 
Through fields and land
Our hearts are filled with pride 
We are confident

Our journey leads us on
From the mountains to the sea
Conquer, steal and crucify
In the name of kings and queens

A Spanish man called Cortes
Conquered furious seas
To discover unknown lands
To scavenge for his king

We will kill, we will burn, looting their gold
Surrender, your capital is in our hold

They remain in dread and fear
Facing a genocide
By the grace of God, show no mercy
Weâll enslave them forever
âtil the end of time!

Conquer the land
With the strength and endurance within
Break their will to strive
Almighty

Conquer the land
With the strength and endurance within
Itâs useless to defy
Raided land!

Our machinery of war
Anchorâs at the shore
Letâs crucify their flesh
And take their wealth back home
