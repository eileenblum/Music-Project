Maybe only god would know â what could be done
Maybe only god would know â that Iâm the chosen one
Is this the end of the world?
Take all the things I cherish and love

Defeat the demons deep inside of me
Sets my marrow on the edge â 
I realize thereâs no return â no victory
A world of make believe

I am forging my sword of trust
Keep on marching, I am the chosen one
Itâs my mission, my passion, my command, my war
What Iâm still fighting for

Maybe only god would know â what happens to me
Maybe only god would help â to kill my enemies
Warriors donât know my fear
But thereâs a disbelief â I donât know what is real

Defeat the demons deep inside of me
Sets my marrow on the edge â 
I realize thereâs no return â no victory
A world of make believe

I am forging my sword of trust
Keep on marching, I am the chosen one
Itâs my mission, my passion, my command, my war
(Thatâs what) Iâm still fighting for
