Suspense was killing me
Mortal fear is running through my veins
Time to take the arms
Behind the gates

Here I had to fight
Listened to the deadly battle cries
Iâm ready for the fray or my grave

Suddenly â they slam the gate
Blinded by â the daylight glare
Opened my eyes â a hall of arrows
Killed brave brothers

Gladiator â fighting in fury
The devil wants his share â wants my soul
Gladiator â fighting in glory
The arena is my home, my life, my hell

Who are my enemies
Cover me before their next assault
When just a day of grace can save me
Hope for my final deed
May I still survive â hard to believe
When just a day of grace can save me
