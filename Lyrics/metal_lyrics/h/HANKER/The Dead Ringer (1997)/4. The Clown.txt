"Now that they're all sound asleep
My Friend and I are going to meet
Since the day I was born no one would ever keep
Those promises that always sounded so sweet
There's no one in this world I can trust but you
Cause it's you I want, it's you I need
Only you, I do live for... Clown"

I could live without my mother
I could live without my father
But how can I live without my clown?
Often I ask him in my mirror
He always gives me the same answer
You cannot live without your clown

My mother treats me like a stranger
Since she got me this new mentor
But can I live without his guile?
Often he looks at me and whispers
If you want to we could go further
So stick with me I'll treat you nice

Oh they're always laughing at me
But my clown stands by me
When I'm scared and worried
He will comfort me

Hang on, we will reach for the sky
Keep on, we're about to fly

Ride on, we're getting way up high
Come on, trust me! We'll never die!

Yes I could live without me brother
I sure could live without my sister
But I just can't live without my clown
