He's rocking his chair
With nobody around him
He is in despair
Perhaps they've forgotten
So he waits with tears on his cheeks
Hoping they'll come see him for a while
Maybe they'll come... Will they all come?

He feels in the air
An angel around him
He'll pretend he's not there
Still hoping they'll come see him
Yet he has been fair with them
Why don't they come see him for a while
Maybe they're gone... Could they be gone?

He stands up off his chair
Though it's so hard for him
He's not ready to go yet
So the angel says to him
You have always been fair with them
You gotta follow me now and when they come
They'll say he's gone... Too late he's gone!

Why don't we get closer to the elders
Knowing time won't stand still for the reaper

So he stays there reliving his past
He stays there wondering why they won't come
He feels so forsaken!

Why don't we get closer to the elders
Knowing time won't stand still for the reaper

He stays there
Reliving his past
He stays there
Hoping for someone to talk with
He stays there
Asking why they wouldn't come
Too late
The angel has come
Sorry I'm gone
Yes I'm gone
So long I'm gone
Damned! He's gone!
