You say you want more
And I'm starting to worry
You say you want war
Sorry, that's not my way

You say we need war
In spite of the evil it creates
You say we need more
Haven't we always had all the breaks

Have you ever thought about how the world could be
Don't you ever think twice
Haven't you ever seen all my eyes still see
It is not so nice

What are we waiting for?
Is that all you have in mind
I'm oh! so sick of war
Enough destruction of mankind

Have you ever thought about how the world could be
Don't you ever think twice
Haven't you ever seen all my eyes still see
It is not so nice

No more war, no more war
No more war, no more war
We want to live again
And we won't fight in vain
'Cause in our souls,
We just want peace, peace!

Can't you realize how stupid you can be
Don't you ever think twice
Haven't you ever seen the pain, the misery
Someone's gotta pay the price

No more war, no more war
No more war, no more war
We want to live again
And we won't fight in vain
'Cause in our souls,
We just want peace

No more war, no more war
No more war, no more war
