On a pale endless night,
winds seem to swirl straight from hell
I wouldn't want to do it this time,
but rat blood for me is no longer fine
Wild thoughts are ravaging my brain,
under the moonlight I can see your veins
You think that you've known fear before!
My friend! You're in for some more!

You still don't know, you may become my prey!

Sure I would cry, but I ain't got tears in my eyes
Sure I should cry, 'cause my teeth do cut like knives
Sure I could cry, as you may not live to see the light
I'm dead as the night, and the dead rule the night

I can't look at the sun,
and I don't need the rain,
to wash all my sins away
I just need a break,
I don't mean to inflict pain
I just wanna know if I'm going insane
Am I going insane?
Am I insane?

Like long sharp knives,
second thoughts are carving me up
I must be the only one,
who feels sad all night long
I've got to find my real aim,
before I make you feel pain
I think that I've been strong so far,
but remorse is striking me to the core!

I still don't know, if tonight I'm gonna slay!

Sure I would cry, but I ain't got tears in my eyes
Sure I should cry, 'cause my teeth do cut like knives
Sure I could cry, as you may not live to see the light
I'm dead as the night, and the dead rule the night
But may they rule the night
Yet! They can't stand the light

My time's running short,
'cause darkness is going
My coffin's calling back for me...
