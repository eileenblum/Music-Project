People of the land claim that they care
They just keep on screaming about kings
But many of us try reaching for the stairs
To the throne and rule over all earthlings

We had better get along
Together we'll be so strong

Though masters of the land swear that they care
Like puppeteers they excel at pullin' strings
But any simple man goes sayin' rulers beware!
He who lives by the sword dies agonizing

We had better get along
Together we'll be so strong

United we stand
Divided we fall
United we stand
Divided we fall

United-Divided
United-Divided
United-Divided
United-Divided
We fall!

All of us we have to really care
Though we're different we all live for the same thing
Don't you feel something good's in the air
Instead of crying, raise your fist and sing!

We had better get along
Together we'll be so strong
People just got to hold on
United we can't go wrong

United we stand
Divided we fall
United we stand
Divided we fall
We won't fall!
