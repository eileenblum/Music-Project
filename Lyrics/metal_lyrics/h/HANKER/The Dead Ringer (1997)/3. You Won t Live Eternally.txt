Let me tell you this simple story
'Bout people who really love glory
Let me tell you that I am worried
'Cause not long ago they were just like me

I'm tellin' you

You won't live eternally
And your way won't get you free
So keep your feet right on the ground

They're being betrayers, they follow the wave
What happened to the children of the grave
We won't follow we'll save our courage
To do what we want with feelings and rage!

I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you

You won't live eternally
And your way won't get you free
So keep your feet right on the ground

You won't live eternally
And your way won't get you free
So keep your feet right on the ground

Let me tell you the end of the story
They sure look well but they might feel guilty
Let me confess that I'm still worried
That's why I'm just trying to stay the real me

I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you

You won't live eternally
And your way won't get you free
So keep your feet right on the ground

We won't live eternally
Yet there's hope for you and me
One day we'll all become as one
Become as one
