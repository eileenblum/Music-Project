"There is a time in our life when we have to choose
between the easy and the hard way to fulfill our dreams.
Consequently, many of us and especially the youth of
today often opt for, living in the fast lane."

You have no time to wait again
You've got to do it, to make it quick!
You can't afford to lose this game
You're just looking for the quick fix!

You have no time for all your friends
They are too slow or too boring for you
You got no respect for your native land
Nothing but you and only you!

You don't care, but you will find
Those shades you wear, are makin' you blind

Don't forget your friends
Before you regret
Because you'll regret
One day you'll regret

"Good things, they say, happen to those who wait..."

You want to climb higher and higher
You've got to be the star, for you it's only fair
Glory might taste that much better
If you would only share!

You wouldn't care, but now you find
Those shades you wear, have made you blind

Don't forget your friends
Before you regret
Because you'll regret
One day you'll regret

Don't forget your friends
Before you regret
Because you'll regret
Nothing but regrets!
