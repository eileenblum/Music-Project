Day after day you live in a dream
With your eyes fixed on the screen
Day after day you revere your channels
With your finger stuck on power

You say that you love nobody
'Cause the world's so cruel
You say that you need nobody
But many times you cry... you cry... you cry

Night after night you follow all their rules
You could buy the world from your room
But night after night you just cannot find sleep
Good for you that you've got "holy screen"

You say that you love nobody
'Cause the world's so cruel
You say that you need nobody
But many times you cry... you cry

When you're alone,
you watch the screen
When you're alone,
you'd like to scream

The screen is like a god to you
You may scream but no one will hear
Holy screen

Year after year you're alone with your dreams
Your eyes still stuck on the screen
Year after year you follow all their rules
But you cannot buy love from your room

Someday you'll have to love someone
Though the world is so cruel
Since you were young you've had no one
And so many times you cry... you cry

When you're alone,
you watch the screen
When you're alone,
you want to scream
When you're alone,
nobody'll hear
When you're alone,
may as well scream
Unholy screen
