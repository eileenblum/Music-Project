The swirling mist inside my mind foretells litany
Haunting visions of the past are now my destiny
I live in fear

[Bridge I:]
Soon will come the gardener, soon to sow his pain
Soon will come the pardoner, to delete my brain
To delete my brain

He has tried to steal my mind, he tried to buy my soul
The future I was fearing is now my hellish hole
My heart is bleeding

[Bridge II:]
Here he comes the gardener, to inflict his pain
Here he comes the pardoner, he has come to maim

[Chorus I:]
Confess your crime
I'll ease your mind
Confess your crime
Your crime, your crime

[Solos]

[Final Bridge:]
Guardian angel, save my soul, take away my pain
Guardian angel make me whole, so I can dream again

[Chorus II:]
Confess your crime
I'll ease your mind
Confess your crime
Your crime
Confess your crime
Confess your crime
Confess your crime
