See me praying for God's mercy, See me begging on my knees
See me with my saintly smile, See me crying out my pleas

[Bridge I:]
Give me your faith and you will see, I am the one who holds the key

Hear me preaching about His glory, Mesmerized with my creed
Vow a land of milk and honey, Provide your wealth to sate my greed

[Bridge II:]
Give me your faith and you will see, You're so lucky, can't you see

[Chorus:]
Cause I'm a confidence man, Yeah! I'm a confidence man
Sure I'm your confidence man, Your confidence man
Believe! Cause I'm your confidence man, Confidence man

Well, well, well

[Solos]

I am your Healer, I will deliver thee, I'm your awaited Saviour
Sacrifice yourselves to me

[Bridge III:]
I change your fate as you can see
I'm so crafty, can't you see

[Final Chorus:]
Cause I'm a confidence man, Yeah! I'm a confidence man
Sure I'm your confidence man, Your confidence man
Believe! Cause I'm your confidence man, your confidence man
You're such gullible men, I'm still your confidence man
