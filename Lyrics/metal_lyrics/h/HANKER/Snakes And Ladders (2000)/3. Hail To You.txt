You, you like your way
You, our reason we play
Without you we would not survive

You, you came here today
To come hear us play

[Bridge I:]
Oh! Here we Come!

[Chorus I:]
Louder, prouder, Hail to you
Louder, prouder

You, you make the day
You, we won't betray

[Bridge II:]
Oh! Here we come! Oh! To play your song!

[Chorus II:]
Louder, prouder, Hail to you
Louder, prouder, Hail to you
Without you we would not survive

[Solos]

Now, time's run away
We wish we could stay

[Repeat Bridge II]

[Repeat Chorus II]
