Selfishness with our self pride,
Sloth and rage live deep inside

[Bridge I:]
We have all fallen
Into the world of sin

Miserliness with our greed
Desire and lust are what we need

[Bridge II:]
We have all fallen
Into the world of

[Chorus:]
Me and you, the world
We are all alone, all alone

[Special I:]
In a bed of sins we all lay down

[Solo]

[Special II:]
You know what they say,
You know what they say,
It's too late to pray

[Repeat Bridge II]

[Final Chorus:]
Me and you, the world,
We are all alone, all alone
Into the world of
Me and you, the world,
We are all alone, all alone
