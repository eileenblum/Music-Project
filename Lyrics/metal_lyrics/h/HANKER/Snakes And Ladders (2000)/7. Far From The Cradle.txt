They all want me falling, falling, falling
Just because I'm rising, rising, rising
Far from the womb
They all want me crying, crying, crying
Just because I'm laughing, laughing, laughing
Far from the womb

[Bridge:]
Oh! Their lupine ways, Oh! I am their prey

[Chorus:]
Out of the cradle, into the lair
Far from the cradle, you'll find me there

They all want me dying, dying, dying
Just because I'm living, living, living
Out of the womb

[Bridge II:]
Oh! Their lupine ways, Oh! I'm still their prey

[Repeat Chorus]

[Special:]
Out of the cradle, far from the womb
Far from the cradle, close to the tomb

[Solos]

[Repeat Chorus]
Far from the cradle, you'll find me there
