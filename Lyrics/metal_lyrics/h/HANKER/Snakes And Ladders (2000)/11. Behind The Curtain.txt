Time's running out my son
Realize, life has just begun
Don't ever show what you feel
Hide away behind your shield

They'll surely say my son
You lead a perfect life
Don't ever tell what you feel
Play the game, don't show you care

[Bridge:]
Fearing what you feel
Trapped between two worlds
Fearing what you could be

[Chorus:]
You've tried to cry out all the things you've kept inside
Yet you have become the prisoner of your own lies

[Special:]
Hide them, hide them
Don't let your feelings out
Hide them, hide them
The past is safe behind
The curtain, curtain

Fear!

[Solo]

[Repeat Chorus]
Your lies, your lies!
