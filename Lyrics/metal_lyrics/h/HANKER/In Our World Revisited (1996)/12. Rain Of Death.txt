[Isn't it time we did something about it!]

The water from the stream
Sang while hitting the rocks
In this once floating mirror
My own reflexion would fade away

This sweet splashing water
Used to be so refreshing to me
But one day from the sky
A rain of fire, came down endlessly

Hurting me! Killing me!

Look around you all
Nature feels its death coming
Why don't we seem to care
For a world, that needs repair

Lord I swear! Gotta beware

'Cause we, humans, have made
the rain of death
We're the ones behind our own demise!

The water from the stream
Used to sing against the rocks
In this now shattered mirror
I'm lost forever, forever...
