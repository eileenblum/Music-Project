Energy has come back
ready for the perfect game
Stepping on it to the end
till there is nothing else

Darkness and boredom
finally swept away
Tricky situations
all cleared away

Dawn is slowly creeping in
so glad to live for something
Sun is now up for a day
like no other

Now we know what we want
all we have in mind is
our music to move
to move your hearts

In the morning you find dew cuddling your dreams
At night feel the breeze blow away your worries
Then you will feel joy submerging you
It is so easy, all you gotta do is sing

Madly Alive!
Madly Alive!
Madly Alive!
