[That battle is our own, hope we'll win...]

When the night comes
And the sun has gone down
Arrives the time
For the people to get out

Sunrays are now
And forever more
A source of pain
Misery and disease

Can't get away from the pain
That is always increasing
That's our own fault
And we won't have any other choice

Fight the light!
Fight the light!

Got to assume the sun shield
That we broke
Before it's too late
Night's not the real way out

Can't get away from the pain
That is always increasing
That's our own fault
And we won't have any other choice

Can't get away from the pain
That is always increasing
But to win we've got to fight
There is only one way out

Fight the light!
Fight the light!
