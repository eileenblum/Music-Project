[To err is human; too bad some mistakes can't be rectified..]

Looking back at dreams I once had
Looking at 'em now they seem so far away
During all these years being a witness
Of these freedom ideals gone so far away

So many times I've been crying
All these lonely tears have gone too far away
Hoping for honesty and justice
But in people's minds it won't change anyway

So why are we taking people's lives
I pray God to forgive us for our faults
But they speak well, they teach well
They do well, they've got the right way
They show you, they rule you
They got you, they send you away
Now I'm reaped, I'm tired
Exhausted, I'm washed away
Though I'm striving, I'm fighting
And creeping, in that mess anyway

You know they speak well, they teach well
They do well, they've got the right way
They show you, they rule you
They got you, they send you away
Now I'm reaped, I'm tired
Exhausted, I'm washed away
Though I'm striving, I'm fighting
And creeping, no mercy anyway

Hanging on worthless promises
It's always been the same thing each and
every day
There's nothing you can do about it
In our world it's always been like this
anyway
But I don't lose hope...
