[Life is so very precious...]

So you think you're all alone
And you cannot get out of it
Close your eyes
Then imagine if you die
And you'll see
Your doomsday is gonna come
Good or evil will get you
And you won't have a say
No you won't have a say

Maybe you'll go to heaven
And you'll be very pleased
but close your eyes
then imagine the other side
'Cause you see
Everything will be red and hot
And you'll regret it a lot
But you won't have a say
No you won't have a say

This could be heaven
This could be hell
This could be heaven
I don't know

This could be heaven
This could be hell
This could be heaven
I don't know
Please don't lose it

This could be heaven
This could be hell
This could be heaven
I don't know

This could be heaven
This could be hell
This could be heaven
I don't know
