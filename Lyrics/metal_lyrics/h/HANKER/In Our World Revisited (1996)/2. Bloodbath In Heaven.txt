[The horrors in the City of Angels, really make us wonder...]

Weird feeling in the streets
People running everywhere
Everywhere they fear
The sky is getting darker
Wind carries the fire
Everything explodes

Evil's on the loose
Getting into your mind
Makes you lose control
Think you're a warrior
You're screaming in the streets
Got no hold of yourself

God, take me to the sky
I don't wanna see these things
God, take me to the sky
Hurry it's so late

Because you run and you scream in the night
You take what you want for your life
You run and you scream in the night
Blood flows and you're feeling right

Bloodbath in heaven
Bloodbath in heaven, bloodbath everywhere
Bloodbath in heaven, bloodbath but you don't care

Minutes seemed like hours
Many a crying all over
Calm's slowly coming back
Evil has gone away
Awaiting another day
To take another place

God, take me to the sky
I don't wanna see these things
God, take me to the sky
Hurry it's so late

Because you run and you scream in the night
You take what you want for your life
You run and you scream in the night
Blood flows and you're feeling right

Bloodbath in heaven
Bloodbath in heaven, bloodbath everywhere
Bloodbath in heaven
Bloodbath in heaven

Because you run and you scream in the night
You take what you want for your life
You run and you scream in the night
Blood flows and you're feeling right

Bloodbath in heaven
Bloodbath in heaven, bloodbath everywhere
Bloodbath in heaven
Bloodbath in heaven, bloodbath but you don't care
