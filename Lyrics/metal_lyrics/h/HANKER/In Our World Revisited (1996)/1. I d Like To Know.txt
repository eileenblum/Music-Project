[How stupid can we be...]

I'd like to know why it's so hard
To understand the world today
I'd like to know why it's so strange
We all seem to ignore the truth

Did you read the papers today?
Corruption and evil still go on
Another clash! Another fight!
History books are written by wars

We must open our eyes
Search no hideaways
'Cause we have to rise
To go through this craze

I'd like to know why children starve
When there's more than food enough
We know there's something we can do
No more waiting let's get to it

We must open our eyes
Search no hideaways
'Cause we have to rise
To go through this craze

We must open our eyes
Search no hideaways
'Cause we have to rise
To go through this craze

Won't you open your eyes
Search no hideaways
'Cause we have to rise
To go through this craze
To go through this craze
To go through this craze
To go through this...
