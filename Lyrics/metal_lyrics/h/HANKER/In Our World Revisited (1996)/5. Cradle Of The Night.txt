[A nightmare, we hope, will never come true...]

Goodnight everybody, will you please shut the light?
Goodbye everybody, I need to close my eyes
Goodnight everybody, please let me dream tonight
Goodbye everybody, I've got to leave my life
In the cradle of the night
In the cradle of the night
Don't care about yourself
Look out here it comes

Light! Shining in my eyes
I can't move my legs are afire!
I can't breathe no more
I just wanna live
Let me live
I just wanna live
In the cradle of the night
In the cradle of the night
Don't care about yourself
Look out here it comes

The Nation is now a memory
The atmosphere is cold and black
People gotta stay home! Stay home!
Justice and freedom have been done
But dearly paid
We're dying
We're dying
We die!

Light! Shining in my eyes
I can't move my legs are afire!
I can't breathe no more
I just wanna live
Let me live
I just wanna live
In the cradle of the night
In the cradle of the night
Yet you touch the stars
Welcome to heaven
Am I in heaven?
