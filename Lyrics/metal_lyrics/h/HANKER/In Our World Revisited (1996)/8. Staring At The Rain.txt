[Lies can bring sadness, but someday, the sun will dry these tears away...]

Staring at the rain, pouring down my window
I keep on wondering why you lie
Like the tears I had to cry
Sliding down with pain
You're still hangin' in my brain
And I feel like such a fool

Staring at the rain, pouring down my window
I keep on wondering why you lie
Like a ship left on the sea
And the ocean in a rage
With the waves that run so high
It's a never-ending tide

I don't wanna keep on dragging myself
I seem to live in happiness
I don't wanna keep on dragging myself
I need someone to find my way
And I feel like such a fool

Staring at the rain, pouring down my window
I keep on wondering why you lie
Like a bird lost in the sky
Flying down with pain
You're still soaring in my brain
It's a never-ending flight

I don't wanna keep on dragging myself
I seem to live in happiness
No I don't wanna keep on dragging myself
I need someone to find my way
And I feel like such a fool
Such a crazy fool

Staring at the rain, pouring down my window
I keep wondering why you lie
Like a prisoner with no cell
Learning about love meanwhile
I can't see it, I'm out of time
It's an endless mental fight

I don't wanna keep on dragging myself
I seem to live in happiness
No I don't wanna keep on dragging myself
I need someone to find my way
And I feel like such a fool
Nothing but a fool

I don't wanna keep on dragging myself
One day I'll find what happiness is
I don't wanna keep on dragging myself
You're the one who knows my way
But I feel like such a fool
