[Some people talk too much...]

You speak for nothing
You're blowing our minds
You scream for nothing
Destroying our ties
You speak for nothing
Submerge us with lies
You scream for nothing
You're smashing our lives

You'll reach down to hell's gates
Your blood will start to boil

Tell me again
I am wrong and confused
Show me again
I'm just dust in the wind
Tell me again
And you'll see, I'll refuse
Show me again
You're insane, you're nothing

You'll reach down to hell's gates
Your blood will start to boil

Watch out! Death's all around!
Be honest! Judgment day is coming!
Wake up! Can't you hear the sound!
Be careful! The end is arriving!

Lethal liar
You lie to yourself
Lethal liar
You will die by yourself

All of your friends
Never say anything
You think they love you
They'll never get out
All of your friends
Feel this fear arising
You think they love you
But they could knock you out

You'll reach down to hell's gates
Your blood will start to boil

Watch out! Death's all around!
Be honest! Judgment day is coming!
Wake up! Can't you hear the sound!
Be careful! The end is arriving!

Lethal liar
You lie to yourself
Lethal liar
You will die by yourself

There'll come a time
You'll have to give, not take
And of your life
You'll be disowned by your friends
There'll come a time
You'll realize your mistakes
And of your life
You will soon see the end

You'll reach down to hell's gates
Your blood will start to boil

Watch out! Death's all around!
Be honest! Judgment day is coming!
Wake up! Can't you hear the sound!
Be careful! The end is arriving!

Lethal liar
You lie to yourself
Lethal liar
You will die by yourself

You'll end up in hell
