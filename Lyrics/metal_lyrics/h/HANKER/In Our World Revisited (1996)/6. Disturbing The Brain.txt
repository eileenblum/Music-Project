[Every mind has its own madness, gladly most of us are not conscious of it...]

All of my life
I've been tracked by that fear so strong
Every night
Keeps haunting me till I can't go on

That's no life
Having to face a world so unreal
Every night
Watching the thread of my life unreel

They won't believe me
'Cause they did not see
And I live that nightmare
On my own

Disturbing the brain [repeat 6 times]

Awaking in my mind
Devils from the confusion road
Feel the stress
I'm scared and I'm chilled to the bone

They won't believe me
'Cause they did not see
And I live that nightmare
On my own

The won't believe me
'Cause they did not see
And I live that nightmare
On my own

Disturbing the brain [repeat 6 times]
