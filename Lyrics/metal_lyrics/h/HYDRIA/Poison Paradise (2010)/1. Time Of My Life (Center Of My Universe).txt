The sun awakes in the center of my universe
There's no darkness or shadows in my sky
For all of this years I've tried
To find out my way to light
There's no doubt in my heart now

And when the night falls down
I can't be afraid anymore
'Cause I know that I'll be Ok

[CHORUS]
I left behind my sacrifice
I am free now, I...
I won't regret
This is the time of my life
This is my choice, I chose my dream
And you know that I'll be safe in here
In the center of my universe
