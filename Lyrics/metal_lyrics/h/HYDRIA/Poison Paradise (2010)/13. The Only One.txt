[2012 Onda Zero Soundtrack]

I didn't felt the words comming out
I never wanted to make you cry
The truth is here if you look into my eyes
I just wanna make it right

[CHORUS]
Not even for a second
I would forget your face
Every day I love you more
Just remember that nobody else could ever take your place
'Cause you're the only one for me
For me

There's so much I can't say to you
I couldn't put in down in words
But what I feel inside is stronger
Let me show you that I'm real

[CHORUS]
Not even for a second
I would forget your face
Every day I love you more
Just remember that nobody else could ever take your place
'Cause you're the only one for me
For me
