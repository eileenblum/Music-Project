I fall asleep in your arms
It feels like every memory has slipped away from my mind
But I know your whisper and the bland sound of your voice
Maybe there's a sign that I can find out in the past
So I'll find the answer

For every beat of your heart
That I can hear while my head is laid on your chest

[CHORUS]
I am the untold lie
You are the secret of time
Our souls will be one forever
Like water and salt in the ocean

Silently I sail away
Through a sea of light and passion in your sweet embrace
It doesn't matter if my senses start to fade away
For the silver star that always shines down on my face
There will be no darkness

[CHORUS]
I am the untold lie
You are the secret of time
Our souls will be one forever
Like water and salt in the ocean
