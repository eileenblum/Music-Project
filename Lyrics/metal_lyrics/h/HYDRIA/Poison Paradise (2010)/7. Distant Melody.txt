It comes from so far away
The words come from inside
An inspiration flows like water
Turning into sound

It's like a waterfall, falling over me
The water keeps falling down, down and down all over me

[CHORUS]
I can feel you through a distant melody
And the speed of sound has brought you here to me
Stay, don't go away, I need you close to me
To hear my voice to the sound of...

Once it was started, there's no way of turning back
This is the song that can never be undone

It's like a waterfall, falling over us
The water keeps falling down, down and down all over...

[CHORUS]
I can feel you through a distant melody
And the speed of sound has brought you here to me
Stay, don't go away, I need you to be near
To hear my voice to the sound of your strings
