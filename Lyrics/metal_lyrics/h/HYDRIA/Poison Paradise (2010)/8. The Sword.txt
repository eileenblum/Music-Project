There comes the sword
Which will cause your deepest wound
But don't be afraid
'Cause pain will give you strengh

The darkness will set you free
From the emptiness that you fear

[CHORUS]
Don't you ignore what your eyes can't see
You will find out that you're strong enough to face
your fears

The blade will hurt
But it can't bring you down to the floor
Your fate is in your hands
You must fight for your beliefs

The darkness will set you free
From the emptiness that you fear

[CHORUS]
Don't you ignore what your eyes can't see
There is much more in life for you to learn and feel
In the air you breathe, the love you seek
There's all life's beauty
You will find out that you're strong enough to face
your fears

You shouldn't forget what words can't say
You have so much more to give
