I didn't know how to say goodbye
And every time you called I walked away
I was just trying to find my path in life
But that doesn't mean I don't care about you 'cause I still do

All of those memories I just can't erase
They're living in my mind
And I will always be there
When you call my name

[CHORUS]
Is it too late to say I'm sorry? 'Cause I am
Is it too late to sing your song?
Here is my voice, it's for you
It's to say how much I miss you
But I was too blind, too cold
Too far to reach your hand

You know it's not easy to forget
I needed time to calm down and understand
And finally I feel ready to get close to you
To be your friend and let you hold me in your arms again

All of those memories I just can't erase
They're living in my mind
And I will always be there
When you call my name

[CHORUS]
Is it too late to say I'm sorry? 'Cause I am
Is it too late to sing your song?
Here is my voice, it's for you
It's to say how much I miss you
But I was too blind, too cold
Too far to reach your hand
Even if I'm not always around
I'll be your star, always shinning down on you (yes I will)
Even though we're not together

[CHORUS]
Is it too late to say I'm sorry? 'Cause I am
Is it too late to sing your song?
Here is my voice, it's for you
It's to say how much I miss you
But I was too blind, too cold
Too far to reach your hand
