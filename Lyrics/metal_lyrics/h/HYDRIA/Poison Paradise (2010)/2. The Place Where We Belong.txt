It's not too high to be reached
Too strong to defeat
Too hungry to feed, to alone to lead
We can't just let you forget
The cross that we bear
The nights we've spent lying in hell

They can't take it from us
We'll keep claiming for more
This place they want to ignore
It's the place where we belong

[CHORUS]
It's safe in me
What I long to be
And I'll fight for my own rights
To save my dignity

All of the tears that we have shed
It's the price that we pay
For all your greed and our helplessness
There is no justice for us
There's nowhere to run
There're only your false empty word

They can't take it from us
We'll keep claiming for more
This place they want to ignore
It's the place where we belong

[CHORUS]
It's safe in me
What I long to be
If we fight for our own rights
We'll taste our freedom
It's safe in me 
Where I long to be
And I'll fight for my own rights
To save my dignity

They can deny but there's no way to
Hide all their disregard
And the truth will always remain
The youth keeps screaming for a better chance
But no one can hear a sound 
'Cause silence is more convenient

[CHORUS]
It's safe in me
What I long to be
If we fight for our own rights
We'll taste our freedom
It's safe in me 
Where I long to be
And I'll fight for my own rights
To save my dignity
