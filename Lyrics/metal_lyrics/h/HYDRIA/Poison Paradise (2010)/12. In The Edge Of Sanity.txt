[2012 Onda Zero Soundtrack]

There's something I just can't describe
It's hard to understand
There's a thousand voices calling my name
Inside my head
I can't just let it go
It's something I still try to figure out
I know there's something more
More than what your eyes can see

'Cause it's there to me
Maybe I'm just crazy - it feels so real
I just can't control this nightmare I'm living
I'll try to find relief alone, alone

I can't sleep with all the things I see so clear (I don't wanna see)
The cross I bear is too heavy to carry all alone
I just can't let it show, I know they wouldn't understand, so I
I keep on wandering across the edge of sanity

'Cause it's there to me
Maybe I'm just crazy - it feels so real
I just can't control this nightmare I'm living
I'll try to find relief alone, alone

I just can't deny it, cannot fight it
There's no other way
I gotta face it, I can't be afraid!

'Cause it's there to me
Maybe I'm just crazy - it feels so real
I just can't control this nightmare I'm living
I'll try to find relief alone, alone

'Cause it's there to me
Maybe I'm just crazy - it feels so real
I just can't control this nightmare I'm living
I'll try to find relief alone, alone
