Beautiful girl, she's only thirteen
Sweet innocence for sale
The price is too high

She had no choice in this cold reality
There's no home and no time to play
Her childhood is gone
Everyone can see her pain
But they don't give a damn
She'll keep on running
Always running

[CHORUS]
Every night there is a different man to steal the child's dreams
Her innocence
You can hide, pretending you can't see
So just come closer
Come closer

Brutality is part of the show
She can't refuse to feed their lust
And they always want more

She had no choice in this cold reality
There's no home and no time to play
Her childhood is gone
Everyone can see her pain
But they don't give a damn
They just want money (just money)
Always money

[CHORUS]
Every night there is a different man to steal the child's dreams
Her innocence
You can hide, pretending you can't see
So just come closer
Come closer

And you'll see...
