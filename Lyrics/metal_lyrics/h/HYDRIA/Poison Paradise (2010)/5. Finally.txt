It's clear to me
Oh darling, don't you know?
What you've turned out to be is not what I deserve
You're always around thinking about your next step
Darling, why'd keep playing this game?

I was lost
But now I've finally found my way back home
And now you can't bring me down

[CHORUS]
Finally my mind is getting wiser
I'm leving you behind
Don't tell me you're sorry
Finally my heart is getting stronger
And for the first time
I'll sleep without crying
I'm safe tonight
Safe tonight

For what it's worth
For every tear I once shed
I want to find my own path
Far away from you

[CHORUS]
