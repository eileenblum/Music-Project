I'm not alone this timeCause you are by my sideTo guide me through the starring sky Fear is not my friend anymoreAnd i belive in everything you do for me We'd come from so far away in timeJust to be together in this lifeYou'll always be my greatest treasureAnd now i see  [Chorus]like a field of white rosesIt feels so good insideAnd it will last forever...My eternal dream We're lost in a grand blue seaFull of joy and serenity There will never be a dayWhen i'll let it slip away in time Because we are together in this lifeYou'll always be my greatest love  [Chorus] My eternal dream... You will always be.
