The rising day cries hate from the world
People fighting against their will and their beliefs
(to hide the agony of acceptance)

Each day your heart gets colder
Your thirst for justice feeds your ache
Search for a better way to break the silence

Sunset reminds the lost pleasure
you once relied upon yourself to retrieve
and change your new reality

[chorus]
heal your sores and chain your madness
There's a better way to live
Deep inside you'll find salvation
and for a while you'll taste your freedom

Save yourself from the silence
that feeds the violence
The same olf faith will save you now
if you fight for your free will

[chorus]

Knowledge Grows in the silence
of those who know how to hear
the voice of time telling it's own history
