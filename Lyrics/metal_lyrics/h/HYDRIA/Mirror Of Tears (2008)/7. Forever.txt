People went through a march with no personality
In a path full of emptiness and broken dreams

[chorus]

Forever
This stain will remain
Don't let your pride make you forget
Forever
Marked in history
The pain of those who had lost everything

Time tells us the truth you want to hide in denial

They can't feel the pain anymore
But time brings back the reason of their sore

Forever
This stain will remain
Don't let your pride make you forget
Forever
Marked in history
The pain of those who had lost everything

Time tells us the truth you want to hide in denial

They can't feel the pain anymore
But time brings back the reason of their sore
