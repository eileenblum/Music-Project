Let my skin be softly touched by the wind
The rain to fall down on me
Taking away all my fears
I see nothing but clouds in the sky
Trying to hide it's tears
Singing the song of thunder

In the vast gray sky, it's coming
Would my shadows still consume me?
I want to forget my past
Nothing but my hope will last

I want the rain to destriy this dark jail

I'm gonna close my eyes to darkness
I'll open my arms to fredom
Let my spirit starts to raise up to the sky
And feel the rain

[CHORUS]
The cold is near, The Beautiful Storm
Is coming soon (And I...) I'm all alone

The thunder brings the light of freedom
There's no room for my old weakness
I'll save the essence of my soul
Superficial feelings will be extinguished

I'm not a sinner!
I don't need forgiveness for the thing I've done

[CHORUS]
The cold is near, The Beautiful Storm
Is coming soon (And I...) I'm all alone

Close your eyes to the darkness
Of this jail that confines you
Open your arms and feel the wind
Blowing through the ashes of what's left behind

There's no one by your side. It's time to fight!

[CHORUS]
The cold is near, The Beautiful Storm
Is coming soon (And I...) I'm all alone

The cold is near, The Beautiful Storm
Is coming soon (And I...) I'm all alone
