I'll be the one
Who'll guide you through your way 
In the betrayal night
Of your dreams I'll be flying

Please don't be afraid
I'll show you no more pain

[CHORUS]
In the immensity of the Sky
I look through the eyes of an eagle
It bring the hope I once forgot
The undying strength of the wisdom

Onwar to the Sun
Where my soul will melt away
And my body will burn
In the wings of illusion

Theres a place 
Where I'll be safe in this world
I need to find the night course
And free my soul of this nightmare

[CHORUS]
In the immensity of the Sky
I look through the eyes of an eagle
It bring the hope I once forgot
The undying strength of the wisdom

Blood and destruction
I don't want to see
The pain in the eyes of this child 
That lives in my dreams

[CHORUS]
In the immensity of the Sky
I look through the eyes of an eagle
It bring the hope I once forgot
The undying strength of the wisdom
