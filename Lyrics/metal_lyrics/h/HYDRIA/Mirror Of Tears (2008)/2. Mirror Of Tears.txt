My lust, your fright
Your love, my sore
My wish, your deepest scar

My warmth, your shelter
Your smile, my sickness
My demands will never stop

You belong to meÂ

Come make all of my dreams get lost 
In your salvation
Your weakness is the fuel of my desire

I wanna take you with me to 
my inner wonderland
YouÂ´ll see a dark and beautiful world
Of pleasure and sacrifice

ThereÂ´s no escape 
IÂ´ll convert you in a prisoner
Of my unfair desire
Come and see through my clear
Mirror of tears

Come make all of my dreams get lost 
In your salvation
Your weakness is the fuel of my desire
Come make the darkness close the door 
To your own freedom
YouÂ´ll be the prisoner of a lonely soul

Translucent eyes will lead you down
To my scars
You will feel the rage behind
This maskÂ
