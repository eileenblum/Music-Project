see you in my dreams every night
And i try so hard to forget all the memories
that you bring to me in my sleep
I can see you smiling at me again

Why'd you have to go so early?
Why'd you have to leave this world now, so soon?
I know that i'll miss you somehow

Nothing seems to be real
everything changes when you're not by my side
I can't stand all this pain i feel
alone in the dark of the night

It seems you have to blow away with the wind
You'll be sailing in the sea
Like a child, you'll be floating in the air through the clouds
and then you'll be in heaven

[chorus]
You're here with me every time i close my eyes and go to sleep
In my dreams you're smiling at me
and i'll pray for you to come back one day

Innocent people are dying every day
Silent victims of a brutal violence that cannot be ignored.
Guns, blades... or the evil dragging a child to death!
When will it stop??
That question remains in our minds
Pushing away every good thought
and leaving just fear
Fear of everything. Fear of everyone...

[chorus]

You're here with me every time i close
My eyes and go to sleep
And i know you're watching me from heaven
But please, say you'll be coming back. Say you'll be coming back

to comfort me one day...
