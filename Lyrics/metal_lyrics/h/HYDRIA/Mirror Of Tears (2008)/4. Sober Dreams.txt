Only in my dreamsShow me the whisper of your sadnessShow me the dark side of your soulAfter all this would it be still possibleTo hold you tonight? Blind for your light so insane...I canÂ´t understand your rules Lady of my sober dreamsOf the wind that blowsAnd suffocate my thoughtsCome with me tonight I wander in my silent sleepWhile my timeIs running awayIÂ´ll wait for the sunrise of a new day Tired of this journeyTo a drunk world of prideOf diving in a misterySo distant from realityIn my mournful desires Blind for your light so insane...I canÂ´t understand your rules Lady of my sober dreamsOf the wind that blowsAnd suffocate my thoughtsCome with me tonight I wander in my silent sleepWhile my timeIs running awayIÂ´ll wait for the sunrise of a new day Wherever i goYour face is haunting meAnd i can hear your voiceWhispering softly in my ears...
