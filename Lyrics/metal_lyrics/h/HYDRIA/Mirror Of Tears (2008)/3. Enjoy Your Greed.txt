Everything happens so fastAs fast as the speed of lightWe're running in circles, waiting out for the truthin this illusory world Can't you see we are at risk?Open up your eyes right now!The same old faithCan't save us now if we won't wake up  [chorus]This can be the endof all the things that we once knewEverything will stand behind Open your eyes!What do you see?(What you see, what you see)We cannot run, we cannot hideIt won't stop, never stop!This world is agonizingin a deep dying silence  [chorus]This can be the endof all the things that we once knew?Don't you know the world cannot surviveto this cold tragedy that burns what's alive?Everything will stay behind Treading everything along your wayKilling, destroying and feeding the rage of natureForget your own descent, enjoy your greed!  [chorus]
