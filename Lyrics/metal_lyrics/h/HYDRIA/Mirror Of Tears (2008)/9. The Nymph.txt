Life is slowly passing with her tears
There's no place to go, she feels so weak

The girl you used to know this time is bleeding
Hiding from the shadows of her mind
Drowning in a river made by her tears
Tell me now, do you feel the same?

[CHORUS:]
Innocence lost in a great unfair world
Feeling smaller than life
She kept her wings tide to a love denied
The Beauty breaking down
And you are her sore

She knows she's not her refelction
She's what lies beyond her skin

Deep in her eyes there's a broken hope
Wrecking everything she once build up

The girl you used to know this time failing
She was always so strong, but now crawls
Trying to get up, she keeps on falling
Tell me now, do you feel ashamed?

[CHORUS:]
Innocence lost in a great unfair world
Feeling smaller than life
She kept her wings tide to a love denied
The Beauty breaking down
And you are her sore

She's not her refelction
She's what lies beyond her skin

Her heart is broken, her wings are tide
Someone will free her,
And then she will fly.

[CHORUS:]
Innocence lost in a great unfair world
Feeling smaller than life
She kept her wings tide to a love denied
The Beauty breaking down
And you are her sore
