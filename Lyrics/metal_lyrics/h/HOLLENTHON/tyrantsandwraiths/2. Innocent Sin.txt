Phantom crows brave the skies
Fallen squires branding the cross
In the wake of rebellion Lucifer's morning star
By the light of the ages the damage is done
Burying the laughter the bright light of darkness is undone
In the blink of an era blinding the sun
Innocence doused in sin
Fallen squires branding the cross
In the arms of affection ravishing virginal pyres
Repenting to mutes sharpen fiery tongues
Reeking of roses the foul air of piety abound
In a moment of strength sanctity downed
Drinking the wine
Tasting the flesh
Solemn demons
Fallen angels
Crowned desire and chaos, preaching peace
Crowned desire and chaos, repenting honor
Crowned desire and chaos, relentless savior
Crowned desire and chaos, drowning in blood
Seeking paths to eternal bliss
Amongst thieves of eternal youth
Gasping fiends steal the dying breath
The morbid gaze of still life speaks no lies
Phantom crows brave the skies
Fallen squires branding the cross
Innocence doused in sin
Fallen squires

Phantom crows brave the skies
Fallen squires branding the cross
In the wake of rebellion Lucifer's morning star
