Desecrated
Sealed death
Walking corpses
Reapers of Gomorrah
Calling from the East
Savoring sweet sermons
Satan's feast
Fragrant, foul, alluring
Lurking venom spills
Minions maiming courage
One by one
Desecrated
Putrid lips
Deathly dirges
Reapers of Gomorrah
Marching in the East
Decotion drenched in blood
Deed by deed
Fragrant, foul, alluring
Weeping blinded eye
Hordes awake in nightmares
Dream by dream
Saviors
Soldiers of misfortune
Drown remorse
With scented lies
Wretched are the humble
Blessed are the bold
Craven putrid pledges
Fade
Wretched are the mourners
Blessed those who kill
Incestuous putrid pledges
Cry
Wretched are the peaceful
Blessed cowards flee
Spineless putrid pledges
Run
Inheriting the dying
Hallowed be thy nameless
Lethal putrid pledges
Fade ...Fade
As carrion men moan for burial
And foul deeds reign free upon the earth
No sentry keeps the flame afire while squalls of rage devour their name
Desecrated
Putrid lips
Deathly dirges
