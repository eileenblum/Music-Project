For thine is
Life is
For thine is demise
No... No...
Tempestuous souls
In everlasting prayers
Rest in peace
Rest in peace
Fractured tombs
And catacombs of woe
Flowers bloom
Flowers bloom
For thine is
Life is
For thine is demise
No... No...
The hollow men
With eyes that disappear
Selling dreams
Selling dreams
Fading stars
Extinguishing the light
Empty tombs
Empty tombs
In this valley of the fallen
The valiant wind carries the souls
Of broken stones
And silents foes
Of hollow men
In Death's other Kingdom
Walking alone
Solemn night, hearts of gloom
Grieve lasting love
While tales are told to deceive
And songs are sung in distant dying paths
To fill the emptiness... the emptiness
For thine is
Life is
For thine is demise
No... No...

For thine is
Life is
For thine is demise
No... No...
Tempestuous souls
In everlasting prayers
Rest in peace
Rest in peace
Fractured tombs
And catacombs of woe
Flowers bloom
Flowers bloom
For thine is
Life is
For thine is demise
No... No...
