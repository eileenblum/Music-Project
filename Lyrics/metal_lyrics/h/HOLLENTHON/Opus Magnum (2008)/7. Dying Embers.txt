I drown in ashes
As demons thrive
Unsightly faces behind the mask
Sweet embers hide my dying eyes
The smell of amber
And weary lies
Evoke the ages
Of humbly times
To cloak the sorrow in virgin white

Few fought back the darkness
The eternal black
In the midst of the terror
As the tyrants reigned
In ensuing violence
And pandemic rage
Taking their wrath home
With the words of a prince

On the brink of destruction
Most vile race
When the sound of the trumpets
Never found their way
Drowned out by laughter
Now the cross is ablaze
Hell-bent and hellbound
Hallowed downpour of plague

Damnation unleashed
On desolate plains
On oceans of sadness
The tempest howls

As time stands still
And torment takes shape
In the wake of doom

With open arms
Lorn saving grace
For pest and friend
In darkness dwell

Fire...Deliverance
