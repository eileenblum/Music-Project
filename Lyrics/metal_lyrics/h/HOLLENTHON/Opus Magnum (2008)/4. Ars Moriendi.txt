Eerie calling
In the pale moonlight
Carrying darts of death with Hades at his side

Wretched conquest
A rogue's delight
Stealing dawn's first kiss, craven thief of night

Pallid slaughter
Riding storms
Hungry oceans gain on kingly shores

Reaping angel
In grim delight
Greenish tinge upon his countenance

Stealing the life from our eyes
Standing still black as the night
Eternal companion of kings
Reaping rewards of our sins

Pallid slaughter
Riding storms
Hungry oceans gain on kingly shores

Reaping angel
In grim delight
Stealing dawn's first kiss, craven thief of night

Stealing the life from our eyes
Standing still black as the night
Eternal companion of kings
Reaping rewards of our sins

Death seeks Life
Through seas of blood
He rides

King of dire
Flames and pyres
Dawn in pieces
Night closes in on the morn

Bells toll ice-cold
Lost souls forlorn
Damning bells, spirits dwell
Earthly hell, farewell
