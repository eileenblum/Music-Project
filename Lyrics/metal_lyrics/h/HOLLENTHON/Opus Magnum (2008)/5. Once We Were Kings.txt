Fire...I hold the mythic flame within my palm
Fire...Wildly dancing in the still of night

This dream that fades before it soars
A frozen lake of blood and guilt
Abandon hope, who enter here
My love has died so long ago

Cowards...You preached from temples made of flesh and bone
Envy...She was the poison torturing your souls
Gorging...Devouring killer gnawing at our scars
Fury...A beast in bondage rotting in the ground

And my heart and my soul flee with the flames
Once we were kings

Before your throne
We tasted death
For promised stars in skies we longed
Yet stars don't shine, where darkness reigns
May fiery hope deliver us

And my heart and my soul flee with the flames
Once we were kings
And the wind gently sings
Of the lives we have lost
But once we were kings

And as the fire sears our weary flesh
The seven rays have lost their hold
The slaves of yore rise with the smoke
This reign shall fall and rise no more

Your wrath remains, your pleasure wretched
A wayward child lost in the storm
Forgotten feats return to haunt your doom
I will not be the last to go

And my heart and my soul flee with the flames
Once we were kings
And the wind gently sings
Of the lives we have lost
But once we were kings...
