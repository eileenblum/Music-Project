Wistful temptress
Scarlet-clad and decked in gold
Baneful muse
Fallen whore

Moaning siren
Drunken with the blood of saints
Reign of vice
Nevermore

Within these walls of naked hare
The beast awaits to consume her flesh
The waters tremble in fearful disdain
While she burns in her fiery bed

Within these walls
No music sounds
Misterium Babel
Her luscious charm...Unveiled

Unfolds
Recoils
Fades

Wistful temptress
Scarlet-clad and decked in gold
Baneful muse
Fallen whore

Moaning siren
Drunken with the blood of saints
Reign of vice
Nevermore

Within these walls
Of naked hate
The beast awaits to consume her flesh
The waters tremble in fearful disdain
While she burns in her fiery bed

Within these walls
You led a stray
With sweet caress
Your magic spell...Unveiled

Unfolds
Recoils
Fades

Within these walls
No light will shine
Your naked flesh
In darkness dwells
