Hordes of rings bear demons of despair
Hungry bellows brought by gales
Vigils of the night remember well
Fear-flung shadows of a lie

Herald of War
Exiled from light
Domination

Eagles of ruin
A flash of wings
Devastation

Inching over moors like frenzied fiends
Caravans of doom fall in
Ravage rampant of massive footstep
A gripping dust chokes the sky

Scars of wilted wrath
Kiss the dying ground
Present, future, past
Eradicated

As darkness dies this hour before encorcelled eyes
Visions of fate await the rogue of savage lands
The rabid ritual rests on saber, sword and ruin
Renounced companions of morning stars at dawn
