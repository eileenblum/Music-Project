No cypress shades the grave
But gentle violets weep with dew
Weave on war-torn bones
Buried nameless in eternal sands

[Chorus:]
Sound no trumpet of mourn
Forget not the wandering soul
One with this brazen earth
With vilest of worms to dwell

No sunshine reverent
But stoic storm clouds soak scarlet ground
Wash the bloodstained face
Vanished nameless in eternal sands

[Repeat Chorus]

Losten closely
Dreadful and grand
The hush of the null and void
Slave to fate kings and desperate men

Await the splendor
Dreadful and grand
Lingering shadows undead
Slave to fate, kings and desperate men

Forget not wandering souls
With vilest of worms to dwell
