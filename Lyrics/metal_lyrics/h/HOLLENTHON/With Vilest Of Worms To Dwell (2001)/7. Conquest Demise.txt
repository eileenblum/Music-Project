Fearless fury battered and torn
Hoist thy head to the turbulent clouds in the sky
Where banshees play with solemn chord
Ballads to beckon the end
But through the mist blinding the ward
Thy sword wild to the winds of wretchedness signs
Thy heart beats in thy broken soul
The rage that haunts in the night

[Chorus:]
Bright-eyed raven
Hast thou taken flight?
Bright-eyed raven, Morrigan
Dwell no longer on this cold, cursed ground
No longer on this cursed ground

Corpses strewed by lonely hour
Scattered kinsmen in arms crawl to wage one last stand
To look the nemesis in the eye
Banish the beast back to hell
In battlefields of bleeding earth
E're the ashen thieves stalking each somber bend
The dragon doused with poisonous war
Recoils before the dying star

[Repeat Chorus]

Promises of glory
Thy warriors betrayed
Bludgeoned under sable wings
Yet best to die in struggle and strife
Then live in endless shade

Fearless fury battered and torn
Hoist thy head to the turbulent clouds in the sky
Where banshees play with solemn chord
Ballads to beckon the end
