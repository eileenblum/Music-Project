I'm getting ready to war
Working till I get to the top
Unpredictable

Put together the pieces
Nothing's out of sight
If you think all is right
I'm walking down the line

I'm getting ready to war
Working till I get to the top
Unpredictable

Put together the pieces
Nothing's out of sight
If you think all is right
I'm walking down the line

Getting ready is easy
Challenge's at the top
Break the pot, curse a lot
Falling short of my goals
Is something I don't know

I'm finding a new start
That you'll never be a part of
Fool me once or fool me twice
With your tricks there's no disguise
And my scars don't lie

I'll come for you
I'll counter you

Put together all the pieces
Pieces of me

All night I've been drinking about it
Until it gave me the strength
To the top I went but the bottom can't deny it

I could lose everything
I could have conquered the world
Too much of the same old style
And I'm doing it for pride
Not letting it slide
