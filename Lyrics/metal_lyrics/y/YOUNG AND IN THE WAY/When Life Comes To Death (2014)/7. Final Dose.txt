Torch lit and shaking. Bent metal, boiling.
To consume and take me far away from here. Curled up. Belt tight. Veins constricted. Anxiously awaiting to be fearless and warm.
Locked up each night. Life is wasted. Taking it all. All is mine. Tyrant, infect me. True love, protect me. Final dose, give me strength. Clip my wings and watch me decay.
