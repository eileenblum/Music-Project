I am not within, within myself. I am not here, here I lay asleep, asleep in someone else. Hopeless eyes, withered skin,
Who is this man that stands before me?
My eyes blind, I can't stay here. In a fog so thick, all is grey.
I misplaced myself and I lost my face. I hate what fills my shell.
There is nothing clear and nothing is mine in this self-made hell.
I am not here, not within myself, cleanse me, rape me.
Fill me Satan. Fill me father, bringer of light, be my blood.
