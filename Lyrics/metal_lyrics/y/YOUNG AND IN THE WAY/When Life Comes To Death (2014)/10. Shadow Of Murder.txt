I wipe the blood from my hands, and wash the surface of time.
I am left alone, empty and dying.
My choices have made themselves and lifted the weight of all.
These dreams cripple me. The pressure pulls me down.
Free, free at last. Freedom from all my past.
I wipe the blood from my hands, and wash the surface of time.
I am left alone, empty and dying.
My choices have made themselves and lifted the weight of all.
There is nothing to fill this void, and tears still pour down my face.
Free, free at last. For me nothing lasts.
