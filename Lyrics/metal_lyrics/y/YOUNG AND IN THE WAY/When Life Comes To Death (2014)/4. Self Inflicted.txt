Love me. Possess me. Pull me down
Twist my effort. Suck me dry. Contain me. Manipulate and blame me. I am beast of the living. A coward in this war. I exist for nothing. Build me up and destroy me, over and over.
Let me in and defeat me, time and time again.
I am weak, barely living. I deserve nothing.
