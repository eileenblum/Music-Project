I became a slave to myself. I will not prevail.
In your eyes and mine, I will always fail. Eyes deep with sorrow, gaze upon me. Eyes filled with fear, stare straight through my shell. Feast upon my worthless flesh. Drown down in my blood.
Make use of my wasted bones.
Comfort and warmth, pressed against my cold hard skin.
Send me forth into oblivion, just for a moment.
Let me rest. Just for a moment, let me rest. Clouds before me. Nothing in the distance.
There are no shadows cast. Embrace extinction. Not a footprint left. Embrace extinction
My eyes are burning, dry and red, no tears left. None for you and none for me.
I yearn to be beautiful. I died in the mirror. I died in my eyes. I died in the mirror. I died in vain. And what for, life or something better?
