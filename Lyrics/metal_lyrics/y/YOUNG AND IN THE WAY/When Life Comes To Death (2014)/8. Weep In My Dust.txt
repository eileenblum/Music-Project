Ride, full speed into the night and disengage.
To my funeral, Iâll raise my fist up and ride in the night.
I can't hear you. I can't see you. Into the darkness, I will fade. I can't be you, I can see through the sheep locked in this cage.
If you were god, your own god. If you were god, wouldn't you want to die?
Our bodies may burn and the eagle will bleed, but we won't kneel to your feet. We will all die free.
