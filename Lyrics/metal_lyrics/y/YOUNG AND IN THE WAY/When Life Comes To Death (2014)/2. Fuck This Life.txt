One last tear, look into my eyes. Weep at my feet, and follow me as I fall. Feel it all.
Donât approach me, don't breathe.
Youâll see it all, and this moment you will remember.
My last breath, reaching out to you, only in death will I pull through.
Fuck this life. Only in life will I see your face, and only in death will it erase. Fuck this life.
