Times are Cold
These Days When You Look at Man
&amp; See Him on His Knees in Debt to Ghosts

I Look at Myself
&amp; Plunge
I've Never Felt Chills 
Like These
Yet I Am
Drenched in Absence
Linger in Season
&amp; Never Kneel
These are the Ways that I Am Brave

Times are Cold
These Waters are Mine
Yet I Am
Drenched in Absence 
Linger in Season
&amp; Never Kneel

It's True I Use My Chest 
To Purge the Ice
My Hands Remain Unclasped

I grip the surface.
