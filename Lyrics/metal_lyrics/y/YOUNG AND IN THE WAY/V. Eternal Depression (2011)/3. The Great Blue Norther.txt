Behind My Eyes
Desperate Clouds Surround the Sun
All has Vanished
&amp; I am Left 
Tense &amp; Empty
Face Down in My Palms Again

Vengeful Winds Whisper in My Ears;

Embrace Me
Seize the Light
Erase Me
If it Takes the Night

I've Tried to Drown You Out 
Familiar Words Freeze My Bones 
Honest Tears Fill My Hands
&amp; I Follow Them 
Down

Am I Alone
My Body is Numb
Am I Alone
I'm Weak

The Sun Knows My Name
I Can't Relate.
