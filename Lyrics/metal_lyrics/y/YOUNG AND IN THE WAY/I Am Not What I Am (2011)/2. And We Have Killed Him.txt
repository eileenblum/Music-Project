outside your state of mind / rivalry is born from society's womb / inside the
only way to know that it's time for change is running far from / that's just
saying so much more / running far from society's womb to leave a space for
change / you're a loaded gun / the battle has just begun / and this time I
thought to dream of your eyes shut / the only one I see is you / there is no
way to see this through / outside open / I have controlled my hate for the
sound of you / you're a loaded gun / the battle has just begun / this time I
thought to dream of your eyes shut / enlighten my eyes / ignite the flame.
