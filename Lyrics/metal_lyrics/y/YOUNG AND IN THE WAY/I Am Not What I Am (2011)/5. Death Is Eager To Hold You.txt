on your death bed forever turning / how long can we stay here / on your last
leg we watch you suffer / this false hope could tear a heart out / a wife / a
life / that's better a lost one / give your life dive into the grave / on your
deathbed injecting poison / how long can we stay here / on your last leg bent
over backwards / while the world moves on and steals your life / let them die
and be free / send their souls to the empty ones.
