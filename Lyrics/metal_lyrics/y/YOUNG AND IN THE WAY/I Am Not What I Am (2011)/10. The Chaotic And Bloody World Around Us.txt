waiting for my eyes to bleed / from seeing everyone sick / waiting for my skin
to recede / it only takes one click / nightly I lay my head on my pillow in
thought / daily I spin my neck it's got me in knots / they can see it all / and
they're so sick and twisted / they can make a call / and have you killed for
living / they've been thinking of a bad plan / to get things done on their own
/ they've got a foot for your door / a wrapped fist for your window / there's
no safety / they've got a cell for your son / and a grave next to your kin /
can you see / there's no where to run / no place to hide / they've been
thinking of a bad plan / to get things done on their own / they've been
thinking of a bad plan / to get things done.
