why would I spend all my fucking life locked to the things that won't show me
no time / she spends her days throwing rocks to pass the day to me / these
awful things / the devil's deeds / you can try the foolish ways of crawling on
your knees / but today won't sleep not for the weak / "I can't" / this brings
no hope to the ones that don't give a shit who / "I can't" / and see through
they do.
