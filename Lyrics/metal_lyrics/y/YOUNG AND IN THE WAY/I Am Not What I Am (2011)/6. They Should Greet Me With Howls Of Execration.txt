lay on your back take a breath rest your eyes tomorrow's the day to lose the
mask and reveal the lies (this long black dream) into the black a lovely death
and no one cries a life that lacked one to bliss to simplify all humankind.
digging trenches your life spent in the dark and moved on to building bridges
only to leap from the top and drop.
