tears still rain nails scratch the rocks / I'm falling / constant winds freeze
my limbs / all is cold no one to hold / but the ground / eyes still froze /
can't control myself / my heart still beats / there's no words left / I'm
headed straight for the ground / what makes you feel more alive than falling
from heights that could kill before you hit the stone / more alive than
fulfilling your dreams / fill the earth with your bones on your own.
