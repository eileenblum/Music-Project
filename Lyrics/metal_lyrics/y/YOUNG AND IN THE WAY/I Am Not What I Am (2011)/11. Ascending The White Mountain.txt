the sound of drums and rising horns pressed on our backs / we've moved through
sand against a wind that carries nothing / my words must be meaningless against
your breath / show me your celestial face and let me judge thee / you are
what's wrong with us / you are the blight / you are the ruin in all of us / you
are the stealer of hearts / gaping breaths / and tear-soaked smiles / you are
the ruin in all of us / my words must be meaningless against her breath / if I
could I'd gladly stray from my path of oblivion / the brimstone / the fiery
lake / the pit of sin / the brimstone / the fiery lake / that hails within / I
would climb up / from the abyss / to stare back into her eyes / and scream /
farewell sweet wounded night / let the fog surround thee.
