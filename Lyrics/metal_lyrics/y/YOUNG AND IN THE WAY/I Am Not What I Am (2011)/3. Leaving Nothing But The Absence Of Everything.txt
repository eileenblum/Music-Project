in my head I'm dreaming of a different land that would fit you more than the
one we roam / this goddamn town where the shadows are demons / more than the
life we know / dead end town just picking up pieces / the one that fits the
hole has thicker skin and a heart of coal / a different life in the place we
know / it takes a man that has swallowed his soul / to give up your own soul is
to give your own / to give up on your society / take the life from your dream /
"running forward" / screaming words through me / running for hope / singing
words into ears / bury the lies that saved thee / bury the lies they feed me /
I'll bury the lies / running far to share the word / scream these words through
me.
