[performed by Young and in the Way]I want to tear open your flesh 
to see the face of a god.

nevermore
will you cage me
nevermore
will you rape

ACCUSER
I have control

I want to tear open your face
and devour the tongue of the "father".

OPPOSER
I hold the knife

Destined to dream endlessly. I will 
deny every word you preach.

Ever hungry darkness cover me 
in shadows. Send me your poison. 
You've sent me here to die. 
Be now by my side.

In you I see a light.
In you I see a fire.
In you I see a decaying god.

Set you alight.
May night, and death
reap you.
