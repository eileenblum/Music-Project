[performed by Young and in the Way]He wakes with me, breaths with my 
breath, feeds on pain, and shares 
my name.

There's no escaping what lies inside.

I am the eternal womb of the follower 
plaguing my mind.

With you I sleep in the void. 
A cavity is where I'll be as long as 
you're inside. Washed beneath the 
undergrowth in a shadowed valley. 
Naked and blistered shivering with 
shame, guilt, and weakness with 
you to blame.

Demon inside
I can't deny

Lift me higher
Tie the noose
Watch me descend!

Demon inside
why won't you die

Feel the pressure
Twitch and cry
and let chaos rise!

Alone and sleeping. Into the night I'm 
creeping. You've shown me the way... 
Never to feel again.

Alone and dreaming. Out of the void 
I'm leaping. You've shown me the way... 
Never to feel again.
