Got a life sentence
For taking part in a brutal murder
Of his own siter
Caused by sexual drives.
Sentenced by humanity
Cursed for brutality
For the cliched
Blood obsession
Accepted by a bunch of similar
Ones
Shocked society on the one hand
Awaiting redemption
On the other - pathological family
In difference, atrocity of the act.
Him - mad, scrupleless
Just got the knife
And with a sexual gesture
He butchered his sister
...But why can't I believe this
Why can't I comprehend
Such behaviour,
Or his bloody instinct?
I'm overwhelmed by fear
I feel a murder lust
His stare and his dumb smile
Of an eleven-year old boy.
