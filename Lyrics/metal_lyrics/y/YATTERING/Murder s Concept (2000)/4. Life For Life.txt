Internally old organism
Rejected its fetus
But occuring reactions won't allow
To tear out the bringer
Of human existence
Fight for life - what life,
Which one question
In great fulfilmnet life was created
To sacrifice - life for life...
Off happiness for human
Satisfaction left is
Impotence and emptiness...
And scattered human
Creation is being removed...
Save life - but what life,
Which one question piece by piece,
Effectively and carefully
Small head which was
Supposed to see the world
(to give happiness and
mother's devotion)
Inertly lies in the surgeon's hands -
A few stumps, closed and blood covered
Eye - lids, deadly grimace
Of the childish face...
Someone must stay life -
-But what for, why?
Emptiness will persist,
Nervous breakdown and fear...
Looking at the deadly fetus in all -
-Embracing inability
weeping won't help
in blood - life is taken away to rescue
(Another) life
and then...to forget (?) - life for life
Unforgettable grief...
