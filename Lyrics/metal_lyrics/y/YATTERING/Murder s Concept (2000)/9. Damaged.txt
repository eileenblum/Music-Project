.....I wish I had the choice
now you curse me-this is your will

Some eerie force makes me act
I wish I had the choice...

It is a voice I have to follow 
A silent call comes from within
Sudden decisions,violent impulses
Abject emotions ,insane drives

I wish I had the choice 
Now you beat me - that is you will

I`d love to stroke 
Your baby-face
I`d love to hold you 
In my arms
But there`s little love 
In my grip
My tender touch
Becomes your pain 
I wish I had the choice...........
