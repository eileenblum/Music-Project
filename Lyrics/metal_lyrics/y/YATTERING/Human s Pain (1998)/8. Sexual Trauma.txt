Extensive damages of tissue
And many blisters
It's a picture of a woman
Scared...and alone

-Light doesn't bring consolation

All- embracing pain in the face
Intensified by incomprehension of situations
Breathing space pain again
fleeting dream and nightmares
...Darkness will bring consolations...

Hardly palpable caress
Touch and crawly feeling of the body
In convulsive thrills
Streaming with perspiration and suffering
...Terrible scream...
A raped woman can't see the torturer
She feels his squalid sperm

No! It's absurd
Istn't it true
-Light has brought consolation
But for whom
