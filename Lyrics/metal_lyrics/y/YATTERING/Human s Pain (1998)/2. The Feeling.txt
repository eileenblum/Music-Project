Spotted with woman's blood
I feel her smell around
Eyes starring at abyss - disappointed
- Why death and rape connect me - with it...
Her arms - pointed with long sharpens
Her face - maltreated - crooked with deadly grimace
Where should we hide
Leave stuff...How I wanted it...

No, nobody can remember eyes... - massacred...
- Face has to disappeared
No, nobody can find it... earth...cold...
- Swallowing young beauty
I felt you - connected with this body in ecstasy
I wanted - your every move sight body
You burnt me - nothing couldn't stop me
I felt close to you
You're standing next to me
You're dancing with your hands and body
My desire is growing...kiss...love sewer...
My desire is growing...sharpens...kiss...blood...love sewer...
Usual unpower Too proud - I made bloody thoughts
Jealousy - Contempt for usual creature
Feeling - is growing
Thoughts - unfinished war - pain - murder
I'm tearing you madness screw
I'm connected you with death...
