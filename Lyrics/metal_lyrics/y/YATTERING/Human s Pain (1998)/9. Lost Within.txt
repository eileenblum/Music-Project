Watch him Empty
Void Within Himself
Solid his faith for nothing
It was too hard to keep

Watch her dead
Dead within herself
Grave her body for free
It was to cheap to sell

And watch us mad
Mad within ourselves
We washed our souls to nothing
They seemed to filthy to you!

So scrutinize my eyes
They've seen so much too much

Plug into my ears
They've heard so much too much

Squeeze my heart
It once felt so much
It used to feel so much too much
