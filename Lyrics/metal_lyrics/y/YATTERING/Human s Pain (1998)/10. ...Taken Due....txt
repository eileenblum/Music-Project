Inside torture
Appearing - between disposed legs
Covered with blood
Bloody gift from nature
Torpid brain won't give any tears
But other will listen to the mother's scream

Something died inside her
Before she wanted to
Andnow has been lying...spat
-Taken with bloody hands -

Anemic system made nothingness
Foggy image and sleepy visions
-My baby...my...give it back...- back...
Going away somewhere deformed image

Clumsy bright person coming revolves in rooms
Looking for a terrible image of memory
Bottomless sigh (showing no feelings)
Which earlier was burning with bright
-Remembered the baby
...And that king wants to recove...
Murdering new-born creature
Restored the vision of the bird
And now squatted in the corner
Spasmodically holding
Piece of taken due
