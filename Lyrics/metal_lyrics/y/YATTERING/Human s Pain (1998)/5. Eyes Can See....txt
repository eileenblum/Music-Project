[Music: Yattering]
[Lyrics: Marcin ?wierczyÃ¡ski]

Generated of hatred ganetically
Wasted creature
Development killingly attacked
With morbid violence

Patiently endured pain
And sneering laughs...
...They generated only inside attack!
Real madness fight with the brain
Exceedingly wanting to discharge

- Eyes can see the evil... Feel the attack -

Live normally
Alone fight the fading mind
Extremity brutally
Threat's the revenge
Life's been jailed

- Eyes can see the evil... Felt pain themselves -

Absurd attack of animal rage
Made a cripple out of the oppressor
He'll look nobody
In the eyes

- Eyes don't see anymore -
