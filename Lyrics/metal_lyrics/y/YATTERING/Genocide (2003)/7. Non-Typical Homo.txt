[Music:  Yattering, Lyrics:  Svierszcz]

Living in unawareness of your own skin
Of something that sticks in us, in me
Untypical homo
Trance sapiens...
(I feel an inertia of my soul, deeply)
Untypical body
Deviation, extreme, sadism
Untypical homo...
Perversity raping
An individual one
Drive yourself in madness
Own I, I / you??
You ill treat everything own I and him!!
Hands derive delight
With orgiastic abilities
Extrementophilia
Joy, pleasure
Orgasm, deep pleasure
Darkness sticks
In you man without his own I
