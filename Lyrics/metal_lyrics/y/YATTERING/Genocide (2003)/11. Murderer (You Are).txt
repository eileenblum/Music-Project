[Music: Yattering, Lyrics: Jhabba]

It comes unexpectedly 
Breaks dream...
Disrupt skin
Penetrates inside
Disrupt entrails
Body's burning
Murderer!!!
(You are) murderer
Thirst for death
Escape from the pest
Nightmare of killing
Seized inside demands blood
You move on hunt, satisfying
(Your) wildest instincts 
Murderer!!!
(You are) murderer (you are)
Excitement with blood tearing of inert body
Violation of innocence for satisfying greed
It comes the end
Of perverted game
Death...
