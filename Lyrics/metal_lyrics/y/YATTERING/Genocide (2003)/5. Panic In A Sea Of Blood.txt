[Music: Yattering, Lyrics: Brezniew]

Lust for a murder
Like a sexual perversity
Written down in genes
For generations
Provokes you to strange, sick acts
You don't understand
You look from afar and
You don't know then...
Strong stream
Will snatch you with it
Did you become someone when you brought a gun???
Did you leave your trace on biographies???
Feeding on pain and suffer
There are different ways, 
But only one end
Bullets tear bodies off to shreds
Panic in the sea of blood
