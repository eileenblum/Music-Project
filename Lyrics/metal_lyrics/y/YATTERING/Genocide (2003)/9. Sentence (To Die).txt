[Music: Yattering, Lyrics: Jhabba]

Sentence has dropped...
Waiting for social terms of thankfulness
Arrangement of next subtle plan of extermination...
Your fantasies are out of hopelessness of time
Not fulfilled expectations of desire and unfulfilment 
Sentence has dropped
You creep for your next victim, molest it in dreams
Imaginary crime
New impulses disrupt interior
Suffering of unrealized hopes
Madness
Sentence has dropped
It came the end of satisfied lusts
New impulse penetrates brain
Impossibility of breaking with addiction
Self-annihilation
