[Music: Yattering, Lyrics: Czarna Zuza]

No one will hear you crying
You are alone with your pain
Pain and fear are the price
Of the rapist's pleasure
Orgasm through torture
Innocent screaming victim
Darkness full of fear
Can you imagine that??
Why??  Why??
You'll never forget it
Dirty stink of the rapist's body
No one is going to help you
Cause the world doesn't care
Fucking enemy
Without human feelings
