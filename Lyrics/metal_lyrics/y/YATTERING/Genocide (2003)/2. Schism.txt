(Music: Yattering, Lyrics: Svierszcz)

You kill, destroy, you filth,
You arrange internal existence potential
On murder, mechanical structures
Destroy a tribe, nations, life doesn't
Let breathe, hallucinations and
Hypersensitiveness internally destroys a tribe.
Sperm, situational murder is always
With us and nobody's interested in your
Past, future, relationship of sperm,
You come from mountains, destroying
Listening to filthy rhythms of
Old nations destroying...
Growing gray...
Lack of breath, you suspend syllables
You hold your own breath
You suspend suffering...but...
You die,
You destroy a human nature in you
You create appearances of existence 
Motherfucker without creative hopes...
