[Music: Yattering, Lyrics: Brezniew]

I am ready for death
But I'll take many of you with me
In the name of right cause
I'll stain with blood
As a living bomb I roam streets
Heading for a destination place
Where sacrifice will be made
Deeply breathe air last time
Quartered bodies of women and children
Innocent people massacred through explosion
Unaware of threat, they left their own houses
When I roamed streets as a living bomb
