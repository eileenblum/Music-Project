[Music: Yattering, Lyrics: Svierszcz]

You seek, you revolve
You roam roads
Inflow
(Thought from outside)
You find orders by yourself
You suffer, 'cause you have dreams
Fantasies...
You suffer...imaginary pictures arise
Beauty, evil, satisfaction, passions, lust
You seek and revolve, listening...
Finding pictures by yourself
Carnal visions accompany you
In searching of strange experiences, passions
Trembling body
Your visions you actuate by superfacient
You roam, you seek, you murder
Eternal wanderer, searching of
Sex changing extremality
And merciless attack on your own nation
Woman - man
Murdering women...
