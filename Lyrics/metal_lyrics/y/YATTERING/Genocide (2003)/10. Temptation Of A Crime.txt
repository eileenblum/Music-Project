[Music: Yattering, Lyrics: Jhabba]

Another sleepless night 
A wish of leaving a trace,
Of impression of your own
Individuality on this
Valley of weeping
With this you explain your temptation of a crime...
You showed your cards
Ace with the face of a criminal
Justifying your temptation
Intelligible only to you
A wish of being the best
Showing yourself to the world
Brought you to
Impression of a sign
Of another criminal
