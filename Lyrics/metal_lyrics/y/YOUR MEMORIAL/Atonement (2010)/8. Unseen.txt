In the quiet and the still you will hear the sound
what will you choose, will it be a moral life now?
Follow the straight and narrow, navigate to truth.
Dwell in your amorality, always in search of proof.
With your eyes open can you see everything?
This is not what you expected it to be.
With your eyes open do you see everything?
The good and the bad, everything in between.
Some chose to turn a blind eye on the evil that consmes everything inside.
I choose to reach out and make a change.
Even if it's the most minimal of ways.
With your eyes open can you see everything?
This is not what you expected it to be.
With your eyes open canb you see everything?
The only thing keeping me alive is the unseen.
