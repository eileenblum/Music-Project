When it's all coming to an end.
You start to think where did this begin?
At times I've said the worst, but you loved me. You saw my worth.
Did you know everything that I would say?
Would you feel everything that I would do?
You saw all of me, even before I began.
My whole detailed plan was built by your hand.
You knew that I would love, you knew that I would fall!
I did not ask for the life that I was given.
It was still given none the less.
I did not not ask for the life that I was given.
With it I did my best.
(My whole detailed plan was built by your hand)
I did not ask for the life that I was given.
It was still given none the less.
I did not not ask for the life that I was given.
With it I did my best.
You saw success and trial.
Felt the pain, seeing through my denial.
You knew I would walk new man.
You knew me, you saw my lifetime.
