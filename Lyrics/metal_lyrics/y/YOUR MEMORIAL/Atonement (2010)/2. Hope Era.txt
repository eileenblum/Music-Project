Onward to an era of hope.
Cease the disbelief, drop this yolk of despair.
There is meaning in these trials.
We have grown with one another.
Bring back the light.
Your heart is meant for something great.
I wont stand by and watch you fall.
To the deep, now only to see you waist deep in grey.
Not all is well.
Hope is and will always be here for you.
I will stand with you, by you always in love.
And as promised, this is will be our world.
In these eyes you are a meaningful campaign.
Strong willed servant, pick yourself up.
Struggle is what makes us human.
Failure solidifies our need for a savior.
Struggle is what makes us human.
Failure justifies our need for a savior.
Onward to an era of hope.
Cease the disbelief, bring back the light.
