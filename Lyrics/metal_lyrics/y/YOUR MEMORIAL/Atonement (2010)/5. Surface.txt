Oceans surround me, I've surrendered all.
Please take me under, I'm welcoming the fall.
Flowing through motions, saying I'm awake.
My sense of security, was my own selfish trait.
I dream I'm floating on the surface of my life.
Passed are these days and upheld is my strife.
I dream I'm floating on the surface.
A proven strength, building Inside of us.
A proven strength, a heart-filled sense of trust.
A proven strength, unfathomable power.
A proven strength, calvary in my needed hour.
My harbor of fear, decayed with lies.
Gladly washed away, our distress fully capsized.
A glimpse of perfection, flooding over me.
Your endless mercy, deeper than any sea.
