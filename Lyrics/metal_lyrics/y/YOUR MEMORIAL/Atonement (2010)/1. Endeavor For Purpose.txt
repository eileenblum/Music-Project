Weighted down, burning out.
Looking past everything to see.
This is on my conscience, when facing my elimination.
(Decline) This is a decline we all have to meet.
(Staring) Staring past everything to finally see,
(Daylight) Daylight Im finally living
(Downfall) This is a downfall that I had to heed.
Weighted down, wearing thin.
Looking past everything to see.
This is on my conscience, when facing my elimination.
Venture forth with direction, in pursuit with determination.
This is my endeavor for purpose.
What am I here for?
This is a decline we all have to meet.
Staring past everything to finally see.
Daylight Im finally living.
This is a downfall that I had to heed.
Close my eyes, hands to the sky.
What are we for?
