In this life, I am a prisoner to my selfish ways.
Desires of the flesh waging a war.
Two masters fighting for the throne, of my heart.
Oh God when you look at me, do you feel I'm being honest?
Or am I just a coward, giving in to all that is offered?
Rescue me, what a wretched man I am.
Pull me from this body, break the chains and set me free.
From this place of desolation, with a hand of redemption.
Pull me up and pull me out. Save me from myself.
This is where I end and grace begins.
This is where I end and you begin.
Atonement.
