Awakened are my thoughts
Alive are my eyes again
I'm hanging, not fallen
Feelings indescribable
I will scream your name again
I'm longing for nothing more
Nothing more than a light to guide my way

Witnessed with blind eyes

The grey sky inspires color
The blank page generates creativity
As the awakening brings hope to us all
I'm holding nothing back, we'll shatter boundaries for which they set.
I've finally come to the realization for myself
Of those, those three words I will never hear you say

You have failed

My path is set with a hand to to hold
I'm ready to live again
Like a child running to open arms
I'm singing to you, I will scream your name again
I'm taking my steps, with a light to guide to my way
I'm ready to live again
I'm singing to you, I will scream your name name again
