It was a divine mission, given from eternity
Immutable course charted into adversity
Unspoken by the waves, rejection crashing down
Humility displayed, set aside the crown

Diving to the depths of the sea
Sinking like an anchor to save your enemy
Just for unjust, the strongest for the weak
It was the great exchange to save your enemy

Promised as the vessel to carry them to shore
Transcendent cost
Of those you sought, not one lost

Breakers you didn't deserve
Set them free from the curse
Breakers meant for the defiant
And through it all You were silent

Perfection took corruption
Fulfilled redemption
Traversed a thousand oceans
A sign of your devotion

Diving to the depths of the sea
Sinking like an anchor to save your enemy
Just for unjust, the strongest for the weak
It was the great exchange to save your enemy

Promised as the vessel to carry them to shore
Transcendent cost
Of those you sought, not one lost
