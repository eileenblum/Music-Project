Suppressing truth without excuse
Degenerate
Never knowing peace, straying from youth
Degenerate

None can stand fractured from the fatal fall
All have turned aside of our own volition
Into death every word, every thought
And intention maligned
Misery and malice lead to way to shed blood

We are all slaves corrupted from within
We are all slaves, defiant, depraved

Worthless, our throats are open graves
Using tongues to deceive
Words blend poison with flattery
Ignorance saturated the lies we speak
Profess wisdom, becoming fools

We are all slaves
Corrupted from within
We are all slaves
Defiant, depraved
We are all slaves
Without the power or will to change
Defiant, depraved

Suppressing truth without excuse
Degenerate
Never knowing peace, straying from youth
Degenerate

The image has been distorted
All are bent towards rebellion
