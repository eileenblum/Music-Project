Narrow path of pain
Never ceasing process
Tempted to refrain
From the grueling distress

Frail bones from the cold
And scoffers in the plains
Though others fall away
Hope still remains

Weathered by the rain
Along the narrow path of pain

Steadfast, overcome
Scars of the past
Steadfast, You sustain
From first to last

Author, Perfecter
Defender, sustain

Weathered by the rain
Along the narrow path of pain

Steadfast, overcome
Scars of the past
Steadfast, You sustain
From first to last

Ascending gradually
Losing grip, as fingers slip
Down below the endless pit
Keep eyes fixed on the summit

Fall seven times
Rising eight
Fall seven times
Hope still remains

All things, every trial and pain
One day will all fade away
We know the narrow path leads to redemption
Though all shall fade, hope still remains
