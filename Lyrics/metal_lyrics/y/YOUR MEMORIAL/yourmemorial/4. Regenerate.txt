No sign of life on the horizon

Truth unknown from nature's light
Breaking through the darkest night

A valley immense full of dry bones
Can life come from death? Only You know
Bringing forth life never to return void
Regenerate

Dry bones, take on flesh
Breathe again, regenerate

Truth unknown from nature's light
Bringing what was dead to life

The bones once scattered join together in place
The shadow of death disseminates, regenerate

Dry bones, take on flesh
Breathe again, regenerate

A truth unknown from nature's light
Bringing what was dead to life

Wind blows through the valley
Moving sovereign and unseen
Bones rise as an army
Standing resolute and free

Called out of darkness into marvelous light
Once degenerate, now regenerate
