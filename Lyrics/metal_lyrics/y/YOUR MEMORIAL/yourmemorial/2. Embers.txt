We struck the match and watched the flames ignite
A fight we cannot win, the enemy inside
No one to blame except ourselves

Infinite treason that scorches everything
Trapped inside this place, set to disintegrate
Some granted mercy drawn by the hidden hand
While others turn away left to incinerate

As the walls collapse, enslaved by the flames
We are lost in this poison that we made
As the walls collapse, hope is fading away
We are lost in this prison that we made

Infinite treason deserves eternal pain
Terror overtakes, set to disintegrate
Some granted mercy drawn by the hidden hand
While others turn away left to incinerate

We struck the match and watched the flames ignite
A fight we cannot win, the enemy inside
No one to blame except ourselves
No one to blame

As the walls collapse, enslaved by the flames
We are lost in this poison that we made
As the walls collapse, hope is fading away
We are lost in this prison that we made

Pardon displayed for the guilty soul
Will not the Judge of the earth do right?
Nothing deserving of rescue
Ash filled lungs, smoke stained eyes

Embers pulled from the fire
Seeking justice, we all burn
Embers pulled from the fire
Without mercy, we all burn

As the walls collapse, enslaved by the flames
We will die in this prison without grace
As the walls collapse, hope is fading away
Chosen captives delivered from the grave
