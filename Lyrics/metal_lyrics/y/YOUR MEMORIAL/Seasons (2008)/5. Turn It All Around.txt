Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around
We live our lives hoping that in the end everything will fix itself
Find the truth in the words that you speak and the things that you do
Do what it takes to change at any cost
Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around
The reward will be greater than the sacrifice when its all said and done
Reach out your hand to someone, and make a difference
Your flesh must be willing to die, willing to die
BUILD YOUR WALLS, TEAR THEM DOWN, AND OPEN YOUR HEART!
