It takes some time to learn your lies
Shut your gates forever, guard your walls
Run quick your enemy pursues behind you
Lost buried in envy and deceit
So you stand and so shall you fall
Lying in your blood
Death for defeat
Spoils to the victor
Misery and pain for those left standing
Watch your city burn and your enemies triumph over you
The angel of death passes before your throne
