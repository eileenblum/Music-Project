Vanquished at the hands of the master
Taken and destroyed
Broken is your sense of salvation
Waiting on the line
Lifeless is your mindless perception
Open up your eyes

This life that you lead is nothing
This animation a broken design open your eyes
This life is broken inside you've met your demise
There is nothing left to give, give your life away

Broken salvation, broken inside

This life stained with hate open up your eyes
Can you find a reason to live this life?
To live without it you will die
Screaming opened eyed will you live this lie

Screaming for your attention to see me waiting on the line
