Something from nothing
Gold from stone
Turn the key and open the box of secrets
Inside are the answers to life's tormenting questions
What one would give to gain
The knowledge the world seeks to find
The ends of the earth cannot hold all its power
Forged in the darkness before there was light
Look to the skies
It rolls on the thunder it dances with lightning
It rides on the wind and flows with the tide
The mysteries of life have never been found
But I've opened the box and I've seen whats inside
Only one knows the answers and it is I
