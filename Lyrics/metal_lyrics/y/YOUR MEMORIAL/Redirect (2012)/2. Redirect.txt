For so long IÂ´ve lived my life
as if it were my own
Rarely did I ever think of you
or that you could ever change me
My eyes were too blind to see

Your thoughts are not like mine
Your ways extend
outside the lines of space and time
redirect my steps towards your light

Eyes open [3x]

Now IÂ´m beginning to see
this narrow path you have
laid out before me
I know many are called
but few will answer
Thank You, Oh Lord!
for reaching down to me

Your thoughts are not like mine
Your ways extend
outside the lines of space and time
redirect my steps towards your light

SHINE THROUGH ME [3x]

That moment
when you stepped in
The encounter the day
I turned and ran to you

Your thoughts are not like mine
Your ways extend
outside the lines of space and time
redirect my steps towards your light

I will give thanks
through my walk
and through my faith
My life is Yours, you set the pace
You are worthy of all my praise
