Looking back on everything until this moment
Stretch existence to itâs limits, and you start to see that

Unless youâre guided by the truth and the light that sets us free
You will never break away, you will never break away
From the pain abandonment brings
Now that youâve been crushed Ñe can start rebuilding

It is finished and reality grips your heart
Start to realize what this all means, now you can finally have rest
Unless youâre guided by the truth and the light that sets us free
You will never break away, you will never break away
From the pain that abandonment brings
Now that youâve been crushed he can start rebuilding

Reaching the end of ourselves 
we fall time and time again
In weakness he can transform us

Unless youâre guided by the truth and the light that sets us free
You will never break away, you will never break away
From the pain that abandonment brings
You can break away, you can start rebuilding
