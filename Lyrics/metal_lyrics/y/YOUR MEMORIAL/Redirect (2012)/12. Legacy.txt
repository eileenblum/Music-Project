I once heard a man say, 'a lot of time we hear and nod our heads,
nothing changes, it all just stays the same'
But why is that so true today?
Spanning from when time began, our actions rarely change
More than ever the heart becomes a stone
Instead of a beating drum with a purpose
Something's missing, I can feel it
Something's missing, a feeling that's incomplete
You could hear the most profound thing ever spoken
And wake up the next day as if it never happened
I heard another man speak today continually using the phrase
'We need to leave a legacy for our families'
But what I want to know is where did our lives change from father and son to dad on the run?
A vicious cycle of deviation, the time is now for an act of restoration
You could hear the most profound thing ever spoken
And wake up the next day as if it never happened
No longer will I settle for the standard of society, I will leave a legacy
No longer will I conform to the patterns of this earth, I will leave a legacy
