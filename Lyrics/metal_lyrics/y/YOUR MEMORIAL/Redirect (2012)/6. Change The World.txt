Never seeing those who really need
Eyes and fists are stained with greed
Injustice plagues this place we call our home
Why does it have to be this way? Never seeing

Every life is precious to the corners of the earth
What can we do in this moment that we share to change the world to change this?
Every life's a journey running through the lines of time
What can we do in this moment? Lets do more than just exist
Change the world

At times it's overwhelming and as I turn to look away
God, give me the strength to serve the ones in need
To do your will, to serve the ones in need
Give us an answer, help us endure
Break our hearts for what breaks yours
Break our hearts for what is always breaking yours

Every life is precious to the corners of the earth
What can we do in this moment that we share to change the world to change this?
Every life's a journey running through the lines of time
What can we do in this moment? Lets do more then just exist
Change the world

This is a battle cry for justice, it begins with us!
We cannot let our voices go unheard, don't go unheard!
