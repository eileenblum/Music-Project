Lost while I'm holding the map
Heading straight to the shore
But selfish ambitions pull me further
Pull me further out to sea
Wandering aimlessly
It feels like a constant toil
A losing battle, the endless struggle
That can never be conquered

Time will reveal the weakness in my soul
The anger, the fear and tempting trials
The weakness in my soul
I know nothing to certain apart from grace that saves
I have fallen away, bring me back
Don't let my faith be ship wrecked

I watched my life being tossed back and forth
Serving myself instead of doing this for you
All of this will fade
One thing will remain
I need you to lay the foundation
Keep me anchored in what you want for me
You are everything I need

I have fallen away, bring me back
Don't let my faith be shipwrecked
I have fallen away, bring me back
Don't let my faith be shipwrecked

(Time will reveal the weakness in my soul)
The anger, the fear and tempting trials
The weakness in my soul
I know nothing to certain apart from that grace saves
I have fallen away, bring me back
Don't let my faith be shipwrecked
