Today still feels the same as the last
I walk the same path but I cannot see what's ahead
It's frustrating I want to know everything You have in store for me
What if this is the last breath you'll ever breathe?
What if this is the final song you will ever sing?
What would you say if you saw the face of God today?
What would you say? Could you even speak?
I know I must diligent, calm-hearted, patient, and respond to the call 
Because it's about the here and now, not the down the road, and the someday I will
What if this is the last breath you'll ever breathe? 
What if this is the final song you will ever sing?
What would you say if you saw the face of God today?
What would you say? Could you even speak?
In light of eternity, all of this but a vapor fading
Everything is vain, only one thing remains unchanged
What if this is the last breath you'll ever breathe?
What if this is the final song you will ever sing?
What would you say if you saw the face of God today?
What would you say? Could you even speak?
Keep our eyes fixed on eternity 
When He returns, will He find faith?
Keep our eyes fixed on eternity 
When He returns, will He find faith?
