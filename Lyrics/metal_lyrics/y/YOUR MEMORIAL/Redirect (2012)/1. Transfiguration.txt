"...the Christian life is simply a process of having your natural self changed into a Christ self, and that this process goes on very far in time. One's most private wishes, one's point of view, are the things that have to be changed...As long as the old self is there its taint will be over all we do. We try to be religious and become pharisees. We try to be kind and become patronizing. Social service ends in red tape of officialdom. Unselfishness becomes a form of showing off. I don't mean of course that we're to stop trying to be good. We've got to do the best we can...The real cure lies far deeper. Out of our self and into Christ we must go."
