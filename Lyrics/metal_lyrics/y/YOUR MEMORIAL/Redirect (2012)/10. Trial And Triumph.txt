Rejoice, be glad, it's hard to take
When you're beaten down in a broken home
In suffering and disbelief, the hope is gone you feel alone
I need strength, I'm hoping for so much more
Rejoice, in your sufferings
Build yourself on solid ground
Rejoice, don't be ashamed 
The price was paid, He wore the crown, Rejoice!
I believe this flesh I carry is not my own
So let the world cast the final stone
Though we walk through the valley of shadows
We are not alone
Rejoice, in your sufferings
Build yourself on solid ground
Rejoice, don't be ashamed 
The price was paid, He wore the crown, Rejoice!
Let the world cast the final stone
Rejoice, in your sufferings
Build yourself on solid ground
Rejoice, don't be ashamed 
The price was paid, He wore the crown, Rejoice!
