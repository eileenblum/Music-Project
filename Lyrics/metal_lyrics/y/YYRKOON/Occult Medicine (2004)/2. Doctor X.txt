Stifle screams coming from
That unknown room
Go through the thick wall
And break the silence

The doctor is here to share
And experiment on stolen
Souls some new theories

Through the tinted lenses
Of the mad doctor
A dark and vicious look
Pierces the heavy atmosphere

Is he a genius acting for darkness
Or for the useful universal discovery!?

Save me!

When science does not progress
According to account of the law
Doctor X starts to
Operate

The sound of the rain rocks
His tricky and crazy experiments
Alone surrounded by lifeless bodies

Making use of his secret substance
And his cutting precision to breach the laws of life
