I have created a life of my hands
I have just succeed in creating a thing
Nor any female belly
Will never know how to realize

Blasphemy!?
But before which god?!
Blasphemy!?
But before which god?!

A god rejected by the miserable humanity
He said he created in his own image
I wonât let myself be hindered
By the failure of your idol

Blasphemy!?
But before which god?!
Blasphemy!?
But before which god?!

The only blasphemy is to take pleasure
In the insignificance that I refused
I want to try what your God didnât succeed
And I have just triumphed
