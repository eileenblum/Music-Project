From here to there
In those places of suffering
Several faces are moving silently
Through the night
A green and shining fluid seems to run along their wounds
And their light feverish groans
Resound forever

Revenant horde
Revenant horde

Their heavy steps
And their twisted steps
Awakening a vision of terror
Freezing each humanâs brains

Revenant horde
Revenant horde

Killing creative
Creeds creative
Crew creative
Eradicate
Beastial evasion
Force evasion
Soul evasion
Eradicate

This is the army of a horrific and damned cause
They were repaired and are back from this side called death

Revenant horde
Revenant horde

Killing creative
Creeds creative
Crew creative
Eradicate
Beastial evasion
Force evasion
Soul evasion
Eradicate
