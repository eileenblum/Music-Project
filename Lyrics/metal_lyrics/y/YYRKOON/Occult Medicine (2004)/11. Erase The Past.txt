Killing time gets closer to me
Itâs next to me
Remembering pain
And spiritual hate
Defying my deepest imagination
Dark and gloomy visions are passing away before my eyes

Kill
Kill
Erase the past
Kill
Kill
Erase the past

The door that leads
To no-rules world
Slowly just became to close itself
And thousand eyes behind it
Are piercing my hidden murders my past acts
