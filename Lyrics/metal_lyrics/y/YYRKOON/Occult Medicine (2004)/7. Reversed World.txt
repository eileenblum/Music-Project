Welcome
In this black and cold place
That no pace
Has ever treaded upon

With midnight
Mists are creeping and all the land is sleeping
Around me tread the mighty dead
And slowly pass away

Reversed world
Reversed life
All is back future is past
In the path where goes the light
Darkness shines with millions neons

But here
In dreamlandâs center
No spoilerâs hand
May enter... Lost
Nowhere
In time
Where is
The helpful hand that I need

Reversed world
Reversed life
All is back future is past
In the path where goes the light
Darkness shines with millions neons

The blaze of noonday splendor
The soft and tender twilight may charm the eye
Lost
Alone
Nowhere
In time
And yet shall die

Reversed world
Reversed life
All is back future is past
In the path where goes the light
Darkness shines with millions neons
