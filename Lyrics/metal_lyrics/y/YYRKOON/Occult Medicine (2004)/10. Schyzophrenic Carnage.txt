Itâs a normally night of winter an enormous full moon white
Rocks the land in the violet little cracks could be heard
Of tiniest leaves in the wind around this farm lead astray
Where a familyâs preparing to eat and to live
A big bloody nightmare

Carnage
Family
Carnage
Schyzophrenic

Three sons a girl and the two parents
Installing to the table and begin to eat
The father beats rotten chicken
Shit!
Fuck!
Bitch!
Youâll pay me this
He said to her

Carnage
Family
Carnage
Schyzophrenic

Standing up a fist
He begins to oil his old chain
Starts the engine playing with the trigger
Itâs time for me to show
Good manners and respect meaning to these bastards

Carnage has begun and blood covers the floor
Shrill scream are piercing the air here and there
Stop it stop it
Crying the little girl but his dad is loyal legs and arms are falling down
