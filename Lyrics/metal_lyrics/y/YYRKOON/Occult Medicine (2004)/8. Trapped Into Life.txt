Enclosed in space
Enclosed in time
Numbers and words are nothing
But humanâs sins

Try to breathe water
Try to cross fire
Thereâs nobody that you can rape
Nobody that you can disgrace

Like treeâs roots
Your hands are opening to find in the darkness
Lifeâs meanings

Wait and wait again
The light of reason
Realize that youâre trapped
Trapped into life

Through the invisible walls
Youâre following the critical mass
Delighting into this
Common meaningless
Your frozen mind
Suffers silently
Not to wake
To this hurtful truth

Realize that youâre trapped
Trapped into life

Stop trying
To control things on earth
For once forget about your imprudence
