Using of their flesh and their blood in excess
To show the world the real benefits of mutilation
Jubilant discovery of mental torture
Control your souls so that you can suffer

Surgical distortion
Will give a meaning to your lost souls
Surgical distortion
Will give a meaning to your lost souls

Itâs so hard to keep any awareness
Madness begins where your reason stops
Be that as it may going on with the pains
May the fluid spread itself with an unconcealed pleasure

I need guinea pigs
Of a better resistance
Iâm disappointed by the latest
Who hasnât been up to it yet

More generous
I will be
The more grateful
They will be
More generous
I will be the more grateful
They will be
