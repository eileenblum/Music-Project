Cryptic place, crystal cult
Where sighs a million dark desires
Drugged mass of black priests
Is moving around an ivory altar
Thousand eyes everywhere on walls
Are scanning with insistence next victims
sinister Offering, wasted blood
To an unknown pagan civilization

Opening gate, dimension hell
Holy ritual to stroke the old ones
First monarch on the ancestral throne
They are the ones who defeat the time

Gods, in a motion of nightmarish figure
Rise, their worshipers in a complete unholy trance

Cryptic place, crystal cult
Where sighs a million dark desires
Mystical dirge, abyssal song
Awaking the walls of the lair
Breathing space of energy and life
That will open us unknown perspectives
Silver blade's shining to the light
Hitting the white and pure flesh
