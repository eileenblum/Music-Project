I reach the point of no return I can't go back
The fluid doesn't alter the mind success is closed to me
I have to be careful with the dose of the substance
subjects must control their minds and don't loose reasons

Enter in my lair devoted to the science
Hidden worlds existences
Living through the dead

It is very hard to find guinea-pigs
Who can resist to the fluid and to the experience
They must have a mental health as good as possible
I think it was the problem with the previous try

Enter in my lair devoted to the science
Hidden worlds existences
Living through the dead

Treatment of shock, new formulas
You are the one I need to heal
Trust in my work don't be afraid
My scalpel knows where to slide

I'm sure he saw the truth he wasn't able to resist
Now he's in an excruciating state of decay
The worst is that he seems to keep all is consciousness
Although he would lost his mind

Enter in my lair devoted to the science
Hidden worlds existences
Living through the dead
