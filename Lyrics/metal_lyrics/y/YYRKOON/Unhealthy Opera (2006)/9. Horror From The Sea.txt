All around our sinister coasts
Buried under the iced waters
Sleeps and dreams ancient underworld
The foaming sea behind its quiet appearance
Hides a complex reign of horror
A mutant race between fishes and men
Even sand turned red in the past
And seems to be thirsty as the birth
Which is not dead can eternal lie
And with the strange aeons even death may die
In his lair made of silver scales
Cthulhu waits dreaming

Just here to conquer human race
Just here to serve thy ancient gods

All those twisted trees are the witness
Of this demonic existence
One day all this navy kingdom
Will crawl over the earth
As for a new departure
The one you can't pronounce is waiting
The last humanity's breath
To come an spreading his tentacles

Just here to conquer human race
Just here to serve thy ancient gods
Just here to conquer human race
Just here to serve thy ancient gods
