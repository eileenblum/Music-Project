I can not even give the shadow of an idea
Of what this strange and scary thing resembled
She was an horrible combination of all is
Frightening, importunate, abnormal and foul on this earth

Chaotic messenger
From underworld
Unreal figure
From the depths

It was like the rot's reflection
From disappeared times and desolation
Which pitiful planet should
Forever mask the naked appearance

Phantasm putrid of a pernicious revelation
God knows this thing is not from this world

And yet in my dread I could recognize into this gnawed matter
Where showed bones, like a ludicrous and sneering transvestite
With human shape
There was in this rotting apparatus and decomposed
A sort of vile quality which frozen my blood

Chaotic messenger
From underworld
Unreal figure
From the depths

Phantasm putrid of a pernicious revelation
God knows this thing is not from this world
