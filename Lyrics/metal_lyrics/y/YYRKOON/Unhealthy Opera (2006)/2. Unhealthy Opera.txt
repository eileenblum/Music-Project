Welcome to the dark corners of the earth
Madness river full of old bitterness
Black growns rule the world
Drowned deep in abyssal night

Psychotic dawn of new era
Archaic wind of twisted truth

Unhealthy opera
Ode to the ancient stars
Unhealthy messiah
Quest for the healing seed

Into infinity of the sea
You can hear the voices of decline
Tearing away all of your dreams
Passing away through human kind
Throwing away each guilty crimes
To indoctrinate you in its side

Behind this irreversible theater
Water runs like a blinding acid reign
Burning to the bones
Opponents resistance

Psychotic dawn of new era
Archaic wind of twisted truth

Unhealthy opera
Ode to the ancient stars
Unhealthy messiah
Quest for the healing seed
