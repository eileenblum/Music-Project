What do we know about the world
And the universe that surround us ?
The means that we possess
to receive impressions

Black spiritual health

Plague of psychotic
Black spiritual health

Plague of psychotic

Are ridiculously not numerous
We only see things from our standpoint

We will cross time, space and its dimensions
And without budging, we will be able
To examine the creation's heart

With five weak senses
We claim to grasp complex cosmos
While others being
Perceive entire universes of matter

We will cross time, space and its dimensions
And without budging, we will be able
To examine the creation's heart

Thanks to this foul machine
That will emit waves
Open us unknown holy perspectives
