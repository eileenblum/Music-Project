A mystical aura flies across the place
The mists where take a walk only the gods
The brightness of thousands of silver-plated forms
A twisted figure came up to the open sea

Screaming shores
From here to the end and still bleeding over the hills
Blue abyss
From here to the end full of hybrids

In dark waters
The mosaic of the graves and ruins of temples
Shine like beads
Look on those ivory thrones our messengers

The sky is flecked with loud clouds
That only the antique skies contemplated the gods
All are half closed eyes
The music resounds for them
They slept a long time but didn't lost their power

Screaming shores
From here to the end and still bleeding over the hills
Blue abyss
From here to the end full of hybrids

In dark waters
The mosaic of the graves and ruins of temples
Shine like beads
Look on those ivory thrones our messengers

In dark waters
The mosaic of the graves and ruins of temples
Shine like beads
Look on those ivory thrones the devil
