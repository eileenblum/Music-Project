Make shine your blade to serve your honor
You asked for nothing, I decided on everything
Go my nice make reign my cause
Stay upright along your mortal trip
The reaper is waiting at the death hill

Innocent's screaming
Death Loss Bleed Corpse
Sharing the night
Death Loss Bleed Corpse
Start the legend

Go to the front
My mind is your reason to die
Kill and exist
Share my victories and my defeats
Stay upright to honour my greatness
Thrash'em all
Stay upright to honour my greatness

Listen to your major
To my orders
Listen to the force
For ever
To ten miles lives against a will
It is what one calls war
It is not an even time
When you gain your rest
Run to victory

Innocent's screaming
Death Loss Bleed Corpse
Sharing the night
Death Loss Bleed Corpse
Start the legend

Go to the front
My mind is your reason to die
Kill and exist
Share my victories and my defeats
Stay upright to honour my greatness

It doesn't much matter the opponents
Their blood will not make us our star
Tears will not resuscitate the victims
Why the men think of justifying the death
By the fire and the steel
Bodies collapse for invisible causes
Epic or tragic shouts appear
Engendering forgets it of the cause

Go to the front
My mind is your reason to die
Kill and exist
Share my victories and my defeats
Stay upright to honour my greatness
Thrash'em all
Stay upright to honour my greatness
Thrash'em all
