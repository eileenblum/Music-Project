I have some words to say
Trenchant as razor edge
In my head they are
Upped like a spear

What's ruling in their brains
Something that I don't care
Please change your way
When you cross my road

The fire burns my eyes

I'm waiting for the sign
To shoot a venomous arrow
Let me time to find the inner power
For the final explode

Screamer
Raise your harms to the top
Scream
The words that burn yourself
Call the devil's forces
To break the claws
Of this jungle

Screamer
Raise your harms to the top
Scream
The words that burn yourself
Call the devil's forces
To break the claws
Of this jungle

With a sword in a hand
And a shield in the back
You can try to lead your way
Never look back
Never try to give away

Please someone help me

Screamer
Raise your harms to the top
Scream
The words that burn yourself

Screamer
Raise your harms to the top
Scream
The words that burn yourself
Call the devil's forces
To break the claws
Of this jungle

Screamer
Raise your harms to the top
Scream
The words that burn yourself
Call the devil's forces
To break the claws
Of this jungle
