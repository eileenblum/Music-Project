For a long time now, the night reigns over the world
We face a new climate: wet and cold
Far are the brilliant and warm recollections
The brilliant star died and it is no more than a doubtful memory

Lands, rot
Everything is only swamps and tortuous trees
The herb, is not any more and plains are transformed into desert of grey sand

Back to the cave
The sun will nevermore rise up
Back to the blind
Black carry on and reign everywhere

Trees were transformed into sinuous and chaotic forms
Dropping their branches tortuous and desperate on the uniform dark ground
Along
Torches and candles seem to be reflected the stars of the system
In the spirits, the hostility grows, men pray for a superior help

Back to the cave
The sun will nevermore rise up
Back to the blind
Black carry on and reign everywhere

Lands, rot
Everything is only swamps and tortuous trees
Sacrifices
Make run blood on altars, welcome in this new world, the world of eternal night

Back to the cave
The sun will nevermore rise up
Back to the blind
Black carry on and reign everywhere

Back to the cave
The sun will nevermore rise up
Back to the blind
Black carry on and reign everywhere
