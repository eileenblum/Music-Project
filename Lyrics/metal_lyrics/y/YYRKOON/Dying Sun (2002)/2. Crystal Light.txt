In this part of the country unknown by all
The earth moistened and the air cooled
In a strange fight without force
Darkness recovered the horizon

Dying sun
Prepare to the eternal night
It's spectrum vanishes
Crytal Light
Our will is our illness
Dying Ray
Chaos is imminent

The increasing darkness
Was noticeable through all the moors
And already it began to tarnish
The common mental of the men

Dying sun
Prepare to the eternal night
It's spectrum vanishes
Crytal Light
Our will is our illness
Dying Ray
Chaos is imminent

The last beams of this declining sphere
Shone more than ever
In all the eyes filled with terror
Where they saw their ultimate brightness

Crytal Light
Our will is our illness
Dying Ray
Chaos is imminent

Crytal Light
Our will is our illness
Dying Ray
Chaos is imminent
