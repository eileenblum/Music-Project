You took the year that I'll never get back
For most of the time felt under attack
Down on my knees, lonely and scared.
Close to defeat as our eyes never met

You played a game which made my life shit
But I saw it through as a relationship
Tried to get a reason, tried to get a clue
You carried on it meant nothing to you.

DO IT, Break my fucking neck
DO IT, this time i wont look back
DO IT, slit my fucking throat
DO IT, your life's a fucking joke

So it meant nothing to you
Thought you'd see a year and thought you'd see it through
But it took to much, our time got too shit?
Maybe I meant nothing no not a little bit

Could be its worth it to let it all out
But it's much too late as you just found out
You've taken up a great year
Taken up my fucking fresh air
You fucking bitch

DO IT, Break my fucking neck
DO IT, this time i wont look back
DO IT, slit my fucking throat
DO IT, your life's a fucking jokes
You fucking prick

How is it right and how is it fair
I put my heart on the line you left my mind impeared
You know I've got feelings I don't think you care
You'd fucking see it different if our thoughts were shared
Played a fuckign game and you fucking won
So have it your way now I'm fucking done.
Down on my knees lonely and scared
So do your fucking worst and break my fucking neck
