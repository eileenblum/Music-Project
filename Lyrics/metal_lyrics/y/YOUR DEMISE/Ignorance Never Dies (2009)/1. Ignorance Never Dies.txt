I wont shy away from anything I've done
I'm so fucking proud
Of even my biggest mistakes
If I didn't make them
I wouldn't be where I stand now
You can act so fucking righteous
But you won't ever learn until you fucking burn
At least once or twice in your life
And if you haven't someday it'll all backfire on you.
Ignorance is golden
Suffering its path to happiness
Letting go is the one good feeling
That's brought me to stand, where I stand today
And now's the time to ask yourself why
Ignorance never dies
