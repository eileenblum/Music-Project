If one of us goes in then we all go through it,
Through it all in the worst of times.
Not a penny in our pockets, but you know we're as rich as kings.
Never a dull moment for life, itâs us against the world,
We'll make a moment out of nothing just so we don't forget.
So we burn one towards the night sky with our breath held tight,
With our peace signs held up high and this song in our minds.
You know we'll never stop till the last heart sings,
I'm telling our story âcos this ones for life.
Weâre making memories outta trouble and strife, living on this knife edge.
Never a dull moment.
Â
