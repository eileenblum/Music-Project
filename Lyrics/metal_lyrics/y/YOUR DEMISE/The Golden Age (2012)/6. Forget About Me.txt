[feat. David Wood of Down To Nothing, Terror]I know youâre proud, cos Iâm living my dream and Iâve got my fucking team.

Best friends become good acquaintances and acquaintances donât even speak my name,
I donât blame them, Iâm a ghost, a ghost that mixes with the most.

It feels good to be home, itâs been a long time, I lose track of life by the sea,
Changing faces just forget about me.
You know it feels good to be home, itâs been a long time, I lose track of life by the sea,
Changing faces just forget about me.

Hanging out is what we do best...

Losing track of life by the sea, donât forget about me, I know youâre proud
âCos Iâm living my dream and Iâve got my fucking team
You might think Iâd forget you âcos Iâm not the kid I used to be...
But Iâm still burning and smile whenever you see me,
Now you know nothing has changed when you see me.

I know youâre proud
Cos Iâm living my dream and Iâve got my fucking team, but this life by the sea is not mine
And it wonât heal with time.
