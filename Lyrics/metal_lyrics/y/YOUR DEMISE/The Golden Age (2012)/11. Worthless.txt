Trying to make a monster out of me, just met with somber tone,
Hate stronger than me? A love greater than mine? A life better than ours?
Put me down and leave me for the dogs, you can't choose who dies, âcos you ain't God.
I'm in this âtil the end, so suck up every last drop,
Weâre in this moment âtil our hearts stop.
Forever hated, you think that I'm lucky, but I lost everything that Iâve got.
I do this for the love, not what I receive.
Yeah you wanna get on it, and yeah you wanna hit on it,
But I could take a shit on it and it'll shine brighter than you.
Fill the air with opinions and judgement, you say you hate me, but there's no hope for you,
The bastards try to bring us down, you run your mouth like youâre fucking God,
But I'll cut you out like a worthless fucking dog.
