Born a fucking snake and die one too,
You hate your life and the world, lucky cause it hates you too.
Two faces, liar and a gutless fool, making enemies of people you call friends.

Into the void, thatâs where you'll stay.

A life of nothing in that place you call home,
You hang on to past memories and remind yourself each day that everything's okay,
But you can hear it coming closer, I think it's time you stepped in the way.

A snake just scared of its own bite, so sink your teeth into my fucking neck.
A knife in my back, just leave it there as a reminder of the spineless kid you are.
"Dead end nights" - is that all you got?
