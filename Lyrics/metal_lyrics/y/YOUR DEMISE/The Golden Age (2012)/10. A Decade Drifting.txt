All I got are these maps in my head, an evening in my lungs and a compass in my heart.
I follow these roads to false hope, they guide nowhere, they always lead back to the start.
Iâve got you forever âtil the day I die, but Iâve got to ask myself why,
And how can you die if you were already born dead?
A decade drifting, a decade sifting through this ill life that you bring,
My own words are gospel âcos who else can I believe in.
I'm sleeping alone tonight, I'll be fine on my own tonight,
I've found my own way home for years all alone.
I'm sleeping alone tonight, I'll be fine on my own tonight,
I've found my own way home enough.
I'll sleep alone tonight, cold sheets cover up this empty bed,
Warming up my empty head.
Just so you know I'm sleeping alone tonight, I'll sleep alone tomorrow,
But not forever. (Fuck you).
