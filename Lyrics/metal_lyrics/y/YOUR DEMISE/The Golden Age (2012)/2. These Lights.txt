Sitting on the six, take the long ride home, just me, myself and I.
Noise in my ears, gutless self pity swarms this journey here tonight.
Goodbyes and hellos, but I still sit on my own.
Over thinking thoughts of the day, writing stories for the souls that I barely know,
Common ground are the seats we share - day in day out, take care.
All these lights illuminate the streets and this green light lightens up my mind,
I'll stand forever just to be kind.
Maybe I make these people scream and shout every night, but I still share these late night sights.
Maybe losing their love make these people talk to no one (who knows - I could be one of them)
Goodbyes and hellos, but I still sit on my own.
All these lights illuminate the streets and this green light lightens up my mind,
I'll stand forever just to be kind.
