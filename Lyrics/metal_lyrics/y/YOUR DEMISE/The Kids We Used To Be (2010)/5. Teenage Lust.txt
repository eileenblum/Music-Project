Falling down, falling down into the deepest blue,
The world may be delicate, but it's still so fucking cold.
Being so young, not wanting to die old and alone.
Will you make it through the night without choking on half-baked words and inane flattery?
Being so scared feels so fucking perfect.

Breathe in, breathe out, keep your heart on your sleeve,
Every day wanting to give up on the world,
Living your life waiting for someone else,
The best part about falling in love is before you even know it.

Falling down, Falling down, so hold your breath,
Prepare for the worst, cut your losses.
In the perfect word this would all be so real and you would be this charming man,
In a perfect world this wouldn't be so fucking hard.

You never want to look in another direction
Cause she is all you want see, and all you can think of is you and me.

That's teenage lust, mixed signals and heartache.
But that's growing up.
