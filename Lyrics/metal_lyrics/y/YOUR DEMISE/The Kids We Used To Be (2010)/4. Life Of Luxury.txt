[Featuring Mike LTA]Home is where the heart is, but my address is in my suitcase.
I carry my world in my hands around this world we live in.

I'm letting go of everything I used know, diving headfirst all alone.
I wouldn't change it for the world, cause this is the only thing I have come to know.

I left my love by the sea, slowly you're drowning âcos of me,
But just know I will be home.
Like passing vessels in the night, slowly we sail by,
But just know I will be coming home.

My eyes are wide, and I cannot sleep,
My body aches, and my mind is weak.
My coffin shakes, but I'll keep living,
I'm so scared of what comes next.

I'm just another stranger in a city I can't remember.
My bed is where I lay my head,
This is my life of luxury.
