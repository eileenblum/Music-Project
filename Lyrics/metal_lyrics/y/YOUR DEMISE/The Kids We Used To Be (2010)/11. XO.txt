My brown eyed girl, all alone.
You've been so low, all alone.
I would like to know you,
Rather than have known you,
But I really fucked it up this time,
Two years ago you made me think I was beautiful,
But that was you.
Late calls are never enough,
Writing blind notes to a love I can't see,
This is the life you live with me.
Together we will live forever,
Cold and blue, that's me and you.
Her blue eyed boy, all alone,
He's been so dejected, all alone,
He ruined the perfect love story,
Yet the end hasn't been written,
But he really fucked it up this time,
A year ago he promised her every thing would be okay,
But that was me.
Together we will live forever,
Cold and blue, that's me and you.
