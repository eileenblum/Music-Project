I gave up on you, like I thought the world gave up on me,
I hope you know that this is for you, the worst person that I ever knew.
Scared of the light and sun deprived, and you think the world owes you;
You say you sing the blues, but you've never stepped foot in my shoes.

I've never been so blunt but Fuck You.
Petty words are all your worth.

I won't pretend that I didn't feel the breaks, 
but I wasn't counting the cracks.

âBrothers till we dieâ: truer words were never spoken.
Let me drown.

I never thought I would find myself being the scapegoat, 
and that you would find it so effortless 
to make horses drink water just because you led them there.
Cromwell Road will remain so fucking cold, 
and I will never place my feet there again.

I hold this hate close, closer than the most.
I leave you behind.
