[Featuring Mike Hranica]Goodbyes are meaningless when you know it's forever,
Endless nights were closing in, never knowing that was fucking it.
I don't believe in God, but I still feel you so close,
A mother, sister, lover taken away to young.
All roads may lead to here, but they shouldn't end so soon.

So shine on, shine on, never forgotten and only missed.
I couldn't bare to see you in deaths arms,

Watching the life being stolen from your body.
The mind is dying but the heart stays strong,

In the end, you let go,
In the end, you gave up,
In the end, I said goodbye.
