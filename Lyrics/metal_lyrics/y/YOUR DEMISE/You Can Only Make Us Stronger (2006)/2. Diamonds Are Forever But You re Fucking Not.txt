The clocks been ticking for a very long time
You've tried our patience, in your heart this has died
You just amused us with the shit and the lies
But now you're gone this is something you can't lay to rest

We've come this far
You can only make us stronger!

It's not about friendship
It's the way we want to go
You played us for fools and you fucking know 
as long as I live i won't let this go
This is one thing I've always been sure of
One thing I've always known
That will be there with my true friends
A show doesn't end at the end of our set
I hope you'll look back soon and fucking regret the friends we've made
How you moved away, you left our side and made no effort to stay

Fucking prick
You said you tried
But it wasn't enough
I won't be saying sorry
Cos it's fucking tough
Now you've departed the same fucking way
You followed his tracks
Now you're dead to us, so fucking GO!
