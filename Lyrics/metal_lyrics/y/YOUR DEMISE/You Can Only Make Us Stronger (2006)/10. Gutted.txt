Slit open your throat and piss down your neck
Tie you to my car and drive til you're dead
Break into your house and set fire to you in your bed
When you get out cunt, better watch where you tread
Cos there's hundreds of us who are after your head
We'll come down on you like two tonnes of lead
You've fucked yourself over and you better regret
We'll end your life for you there's no need to fret
You're fucking dead
You fucking cunt

It takes quite a lot to crush my family
A sight that I guess I will never see
It's not as if we do as we please
But we stick to the rules and get justice you see

And don't ever think you'll get away
Take more than 15 years for us to forget
We'll take you down when you least expect
Break your face, break your eyes, break your legs, break your neck
We never expected this, it's what makes it worse
Your time is waiting for your ride in a hearse
When i see your face i just know 
that i'll burst and explode my first on your face, 
and crush your brain to the dirt
