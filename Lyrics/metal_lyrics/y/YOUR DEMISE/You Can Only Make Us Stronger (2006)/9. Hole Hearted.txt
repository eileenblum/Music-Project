I still don't know who the fuck you are
Been disputing that for many years now
Still don't know why you've come this far
Still trying to be friends with me
What's the point in pretending one thing?
Then making a fool of yourself to us
Trying to please every hand that feeds you
But double standards is another fucking story

You never meant a thing to me
And now you're making it worse
You've changed so many times, I couldn't stand you at first
Now you're talking as if you're my friend
But you've already left us behind
I know for sure you talk behind my back
I've got proof from my best friends
You've made your life into more of a joke
Hand over heart
I promise you now
I wouldn't care if i never see you ever again
I still don't know who the fuck you are
Been disputing that for many years now
Still don't know why you've come this far
Still trying to be friends with me.
