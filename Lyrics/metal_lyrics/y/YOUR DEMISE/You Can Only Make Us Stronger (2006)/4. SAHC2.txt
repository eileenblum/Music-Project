This is my city
This is my pride
Something that you won't stop
Something i won't hide
This is my family
These are my friends
It's something that you won't stop
We're fighting to the bitter end

No matter what you want me to be
I'm true til death SAHC
No matter what you want me to be
I'm true til death SAHC
No matter what you want me to be

This is my city
This is my pride
Something you won't stop
Something i won't hide
