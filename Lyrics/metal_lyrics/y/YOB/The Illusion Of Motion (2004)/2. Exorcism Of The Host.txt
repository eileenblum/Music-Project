Can't hide the darkness within
Darkness and the light entwined
No chance for mercy and salvation
Endless struggle for dominance

Oil and water
Fuel for the slaughter
Breeds remorse and breeds regret
The false prophets scream their disease

Burn the bridges to feed the wolves
Cannot find solace in this state
Duel nature of the possession
Reaching for heaven finding hell

Oil and water
Fuel for the slaughter
Breeds remorse and breeds regret
The false prophets scream their disease

All right-the inner war begins
Clear sight-past an future dead
In the eyes-delivered from dispair
In the all-the host be banned and broken

All right-the self takes charge of thee
Clear sight-the truth is clear to see
In the eyes-the rigpa is dawning
In the all-for once a true life begins

Within. Within
Set free

One for man, one for the all
One for peace buried in earth
One for souls who pray for mercy
Cannot feel any pain

In the darkness on knees and crawl
Trying to find the way out of the mental maze
Pursued by the ghosts of what is and what will be
To escape the iron will of the host
