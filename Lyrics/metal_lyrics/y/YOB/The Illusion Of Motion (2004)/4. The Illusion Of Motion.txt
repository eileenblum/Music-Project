Can no longer stand the pain
Life and death both chains
Try to climb the human walls
Tear them down and see what remains
Emptied of the embattled false
Will to resist disappears
Emptied of half truths taught from birth
With the dawn of emptiness

Overjoyed with our pain
Fall asleep another thousand years
I hope we find eternal rest in the bed that we've made

All around is the sutra
All phenomena empty
With no beginning and no end
Nothing lost and nothing gained
The mind grasps at fleeting phantoms
Nothing is seen as it is
The world seen through tainted eyes
The Illusion of motion

Overjoyed with our pain
Fall asleep another thousand years
I hope we find eternal rest in the bed that we've made
Solace within the grasp
Of those who embrace this life

The ball of hot lead burns in the back of my throat
The doubt mass burns the doubt mass the doubt mass remains
To far to turn back now
Spectre revealed godhead removed

[Tibetan Chant]

Brothers sisters unite
There's no reason to die
Tear to pieces we're torn apart
Slaves to this battle slaves to this war

For life for life
To quell the sorrow
Born from belief
All of our knowledge
All of our tragedies
Risen from dust
Tears of yesterday
Recreated today
