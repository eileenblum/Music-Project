Inside two worlds explode
Two words made up of dust
The dust the essence of ageless pain
Never will I see the sun again
The planet the race
Enthralled with ice and snow
Glacial rivers of compressed hate
Never will I see the sun again
Never will I be the same again
Never will I be able to defend
Never will I be the same again
Awake in ageless time
No place to call home
Searching the expanse for a sign
Never will I see the sun again
The tears sting my eyes
Like liquid diamonds fall
Ablaze in the all in the ecstasy
Never will I see the sun again
