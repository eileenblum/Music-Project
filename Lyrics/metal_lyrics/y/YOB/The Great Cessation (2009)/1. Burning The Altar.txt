Burning eyes brim with tears
Heavy heart clenched like a fist
Grasping hope with hands in flames
Burning ashes
Burning to the core

Wretched fools suffer fate
In worlds that they made
Sand slipping through fingers
Wisdom in decay

Burning the altar
Ashes billow across the sky
Burning the altar
Burning the altar

The ignorant rule the weak
With iron law and wrathful deeds
Eyes within eyes
All seeing
All mass delusion
Trumpets to the fall

Hollow psalms
The drums of war
Beating the stretched skin of the fallen
Redirect the vision within now
While the world ends
