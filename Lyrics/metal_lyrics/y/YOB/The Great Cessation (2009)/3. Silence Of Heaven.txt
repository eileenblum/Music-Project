War obliteration war 
Within the whole
Sow seeds of sorrow
Sow the morrowâs first death

For virtue
For mercy
For holiness
We destroy

All canât escape
The all cherished beliefs
They fall like tears of lead
They fall like the silence of heaven

The war of ideas
Strangle the miracle
In the name of the gods
We destroy
