Will we ever see a time
When it's enough
When we see what we know
Isn't all
Of all that is
Creating a world
Of broken hearts
Of tired eyes
Living in this shell
Like it was forever

Close your eyes
And let it go
Breathe in the space
Before you were born

Crashing waves
Grief and pain
Is washed away
Open to
The great cessation
Waves wash away
Memories
Wane and fade
Open to
The great cessation

Will we ever see a time
Without cause
When we see what we know
Never was
It never was
Churches
Altars, shrines
Caves in the heart
Within the womb
Raising our hands
To a sky without end

Watch the river pass by
Passive on the shore
Giving temptation
Space to explore
Dense guilt and guile
Gently put to rest
Reverberate through time
Lives pass on and pass on
The witness triumphant
The death of the deathless one
