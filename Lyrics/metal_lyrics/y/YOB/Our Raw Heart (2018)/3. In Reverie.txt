Entangled
Spun in confusion
In a world whose soul
Is taken
In freedom
Unbound power
That you hold in your hands
But donât understand
Unquestioned
This source of disease
It brings a blindness
To drive every hate
No matter how lost
You find yourself
The sun rises still

Skin breathes mystery
Lungs reach in reverie
Free in eternal sea
Sink into the deep
Lungs reach in reverie

Tired
Of a weary mind
Whose vision is dust
Long dead life
Whatever you believe
In these red times
There is more
Than errors of sight
From anotherâs body
From anotherâs body, anotherâs flight
No matter the suffering
You find yourself
The sun rises still
