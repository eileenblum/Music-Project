"We have been brought up to experience ourselves as isolated centers of awareness and action, placed in a world that is not us, that is foreign,ï»¿ alien, other, which we confront, where as in fact the way an ecologist describes human behavior is as an action what you do is what the whole universe is doing at the place you call here and now. You are something the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is something that the whole ocean is doing. Now, this is not what you might call a fatalistic or deterministic idea. You see, you might be a fatalist if you think you are a sort of puppet which life pushes around, and you are seperate from life. That's fatalism." - Alan Watts, The Tao of Philosophy
