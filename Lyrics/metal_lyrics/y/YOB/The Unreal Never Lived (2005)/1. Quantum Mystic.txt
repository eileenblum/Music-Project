Teacher of endless grace was born in India
A modest shopkeeper living in the seat of Bombay
He raised a family, a common, simple life
Until he met his master and through grace opened eternal eyes.

[Chorus:]
Spirit opened wide
Heart held in his hands
Quantum mystic arise

Without education his grasp of truth was deep
A fearless lion
Delivering souls from ageless sleep
Though he lived in poverty
His wealth was limitless
Past and future abandoned
To eternal living presence

[Chorus]

His message to this world
Still resounds for all time
The unreal never lived
And the real does not ever die
Beyond all birth and death
The real is timeless
Open the shutter of the mind
And it will be flooded with light

[Chorus]
