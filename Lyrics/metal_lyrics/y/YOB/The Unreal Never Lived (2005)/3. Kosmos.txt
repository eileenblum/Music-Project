Insight into the one sublime magnified
Unspoken sacred oath the universe in all life
Dawn of the rising sun burning the timeless
Living equilibrium of the Kosmos

[Chorus:]
Clear light-personified divine-clear light-no thing is denied expansion-pervading the void-Kosmos-vast eternal sky

Atoms vibrate
The chanting begins
Hymns to the funeral pyre
Give birth to tomorrow's dead
Subsonic sage drones reach to the stars
With ancient insights into the Kosmos

[Chorus]

Oh mani padme hum
Oh mani padme hum
Oh mani padme hum
Each thought creation's dawn
Each breath one with the all
Hearts pulsate with the mantra
Vibrant in the Kosmos

Faith of fear
Empire of old
Fear in disguise
Seething false power
The empire withers and falls
The world revealed
To be in the mind
To be in the mind

Personified divine
The dreamer sleeps no more
No thing is denied
The whole drama is witnessed
Diverse in the void
The Kosmos is within
Within us within us
Within all
