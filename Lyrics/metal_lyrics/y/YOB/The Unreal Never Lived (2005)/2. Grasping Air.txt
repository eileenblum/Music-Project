Entwine with despair like a lover
Bleak obsession take its toll
Burnt souls in the wake
Embers at stake
The cycle internal unfolds

Ancient wounds fester and bleed
Empty food from which they feed
Sustain the wealth subliminate
The self
Create the suffering we need

[Chorus:]
Slow crawl
Timeless call
Watch it burn down burn down
The egos fall
Nothing lasts forever
Grasping air
Peace lives in the space where
No one is there

Rigid dogma breeds disease born from needing to believe
There is a reason for all this pain
Fear of life creates the stain

[Chorus]

Darkness and light
Shadows call
Colors and sight
Blind us all
Each moment a brand new day
Each life is all
Don't believe your eyes
