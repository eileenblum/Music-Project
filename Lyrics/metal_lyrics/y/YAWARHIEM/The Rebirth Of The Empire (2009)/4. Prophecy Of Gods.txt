Katran, count down your days again, show me indignation
I was prey of your evil fury, youâll die without pardon

Between chaos and destruction the Inca asks for help
The majestic Ayarhiem brothers return to Earth for death

[Chorus:]
Gold Mountain, Lord of the hills, wisdom of the wind,
Now you support this war, this prophecy of gods

Ayar Tawar, our dark
time is coming, flames are raining from hell
In vain is my immense weeping,
shadows are inside of you.

Forgive my heart, my madness is crying, but my anger doesnât forget.
Now I will kill the god of evil, avenging all your pain.

[Chorus:]
Keep on shining father Sun; shine for us, your sons
You can help us to win our destiny of gods.

Oh! my tears are falling, at the end of my dreams about you...

Oh! Only in that silence I will touch your face.
Close your eyes and sleep the eternal dream,
Feel the skies with the breeze of my wings.

This is not the end; this is the rebirth of our Majestic Lands
After these wars where we spilt blood, (the) calm will come back again.

The sons of the Sun will reign the empire; theyâll drink the blood of the gods
But now, the war awaits salvation, with the rage of our veins.

[Chorus:]
Gold Mountain, Lord of the hills, wisdom of the wind
Now you will support this war, this Prophecy of Gods

Ayar Tawar, our dark time is coming, flames are raining from hell
In vain is my immense weeping, shadows are inside of you.

Forgive my heart, my madness is crying but my anger doesnât forget.
Now I will kill the god of evil, avenging all your pain.
