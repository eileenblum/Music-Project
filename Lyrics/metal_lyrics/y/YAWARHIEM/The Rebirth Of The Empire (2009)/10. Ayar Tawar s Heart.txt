Wars of wars, anger and faith, for Tantaricaâs lands
Fortresses and valleys were taken by the evil forces of Katran.

Loneliness, on his heart he wants (searches for) forgiveness
From the clouds Ayar Tawar, comes to save us from the dark

Between the mountains heâs coming back, to the land where his heart, someday found love.
Now he is returning for revenge, between hills and forests, on his madness searches for her.

[Chorus:]
You will feel the pain of death, the sacrifice of your sweet loneliness.
Your tears are gonna fall, (you) are gonna tremble and amnesia will fall upon you.

Donât see again, your wings in the sky...
Now you are the sacred god of the world
He is crossing the shadow lands trying to remember...
Forgetting the whispers and the dreams we had...
Agony of time, in my mind, you will come back.

Go my warrior, you have to fight, donât see tears, donât try to cry.
Itâs your soul which claims revenge; kill the demons of the land.

When the light illuminates his flight, his wings...
Next to condors (he) searches for her soul, looking for the waterfalls.

Between the valleys and the clouds, between hills,
between mountains, on his madness (he) searches for her
Hundreds of thunders crash the earth, when on his fortress his agony awakes.

[Chorus:]
In the heart of the sky â¦ blood of darkness, of passion and faith.
If you lost your fearâ¦ you will see how the heavens fall down.
Courage my warriors, to carry the truth is your mission in life.
Soon, itâs written in the land, (and) you will feel the sea, heaven and earth...
Come in.
