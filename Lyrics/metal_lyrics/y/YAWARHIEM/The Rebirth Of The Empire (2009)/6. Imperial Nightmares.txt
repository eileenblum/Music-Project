Between my veins, I kept my strong and sweet poison that calmed the pain.
And if the wind was some time more free, god! It finally escaped.

Towards the screams of the innocents of this tragedy, (they) were burning in flames.
The skies were stained, the ground and the holy valleysâ¦ sprayed of hope.

Blood scattered inside the empire, meaning hate and strong pain.
Tantarica's death broke out all the anger of this holy war.

[Chorus:]
When all my nightmares, finally ended,
I felt some visions of eternity

This is the bloodshed wasted in each of my dreams, of tears and pain.
From the rivers where her blood runs to the sea, holy life emerges.

(Oh!) From those black nights where I used to walk through rivers, decipher my steps.
There lie the secrets to create realms of harmony, and end with this war.

Holy guardians of the hills, keep the fortress... the temples of the Sun.
Holy rain consecrates your empire, condors fly high.

[Chorus:]
When all my nightmares finally ended,
I felt some visions of eternity
