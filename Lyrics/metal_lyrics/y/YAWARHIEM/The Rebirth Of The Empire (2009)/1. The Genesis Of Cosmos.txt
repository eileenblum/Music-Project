In the genesis of cosmos, the prophecies of the
galaxies arose; and the gods were born from them. To fulfill the mission of the
northern Sun, in a world of darkness, blood and tears. The Ayarhiem brothers
gave their souls to create the Empire of the Sun, innocent beings mutilated by
treason, Tantarica immersed in waters, Ayar Tawar crossing the mountains
searching for salvation. His brothers Ayar Kithwa, Ayar Narak, Rauta, Ayar
Tano, winged gods, inheritors of the Rising Sun, will return the balance to the
cosmos, fulfilling the plan of the constellations.
