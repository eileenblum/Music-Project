Madness went all over the god, Tantarica's
blood runs through the rivers between the mountains, fortresses of gold and
stone keep the wind prisoner, buried under Lake Pearl. Near the mines, the
secrets were being revealed; the treasures of the full moon who weeps for her
death. From the heights, Ayar Tawar looks for the revenge his madness conceals
in every dusk.
