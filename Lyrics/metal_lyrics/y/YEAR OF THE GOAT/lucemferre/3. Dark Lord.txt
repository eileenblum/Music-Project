[originally by Sam Gopal]Black wings across the sky
Bring the nightfall
Wings wide around the stars
Black cloud has come

Light fading
Time's wasting
Hell's waiting for
The Dark Lord

Towers lean glowing red
Eyes in their walls
Watching the roads that lead
That lead to the downfall

Eyes flashing
Rain lashing
Death in the name
Of the Dark Lord

Doom stands astride the plains
Watched by the eye
Whipped by the dying rain
From the dead sky

Death swirling
Smoke curling
Burning the mane
Of the Dark Lord

Tunnels of darkness yearn
The moment draws nigh
Too late, the black wings beat
Too late, too late to cry

Death flying
Light dying
Tearing the veil
Of the Dark Lord
