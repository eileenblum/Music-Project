Today the Sun will not rise
The world's waiting for the sign
A new water is here for all

A gloom of fire
And vermillion clouds
Overcomes the horizon
The bringer of chaos is here

Souls of the condemned
Rips the sea apart
Seven heads and ten horns
On it's back she rides, the whore

Souls of the condemned
Rips the sea apart
Seven heads and ten horns
On it's back she rides, the whore

Witness we pay them a ration
As she enters the world
Profane names are written
Graceful on her face

Oh! Feel our power
On chain of chaos

She pours cataclysm
From her golden cup
The restless of the weak
Drowns in her tide

Oh! Feel our power
On chain of...

Liberate the souls through chaos
Liberate the souls through chaos
