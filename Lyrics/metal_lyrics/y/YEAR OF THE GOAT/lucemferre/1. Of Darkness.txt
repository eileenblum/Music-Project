They walk through the mist
To an ancient place
Gather for the king
To invoke his name

Chaplain of the dark
Chants with serpent tongue
Black monolith
Rises from the mist

Potion from the darkest well
Opens for pagan souls
Hear the angels of Heaven wailing
When he calls on the Lord of Darkness

Black shapes pouring out
From the chaplain's mouth
A ruffle chaos spreads
Into ancient ground
Coven starts to dance
Into static trance
Monolith opens up
Their return is here

Potion from the darkest well
Opens for pagan souls
Hear the angels of heaven wailing
When he calls on the Lord of Darkness
Of Darkness
Of Darkness
Of Darkness

Potion from the darkest well
Opens for pagan souls
Hear the angels of Heaven wailing
When he calls on the Lord of Darkness
Of Darkness
Of Darkness
Of Darkness
