Slow as a mule wanting of gold
All you need you can find there
Dreamer of wealth,âyouâcan have itâall
I'll guide you, I'll help you,âI'll show you
Where all you long for will be yours
You can have it all

When you step into the light
It's truly the darkness
Grab my wings and I'll lead you

You see, man is wise, wiser than God
With me you can be all that you want
And truly unholy
Who knows where real truth resides?
Man is wise, wiser than God

When you step into the light
It's truly the darkness
Grab my wings and I'll lead you
When I step into the light
Free from your weakness
Come and follow you home

Don't you worry now
Don't waste your time
Go with the flow
Will make everything shine

Leaving world of sorrow
Open your mind to what's behind
The true nature of man, oh
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Don't waste your time on making your plans
See where you stand
See where you stand

When you step into the light
Truly the darkness
Grab my wings and I'll lead you
When you step into the light
Free from your weakness
Come and follow you home

Sei destinatio aglinferi
Il tuo trono attende
Sei destinatio aglinferi
Il re sono
