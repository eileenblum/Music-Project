Many years I've wandered
Growing stronger by the hour
My goal was certain and clear before me
Byâwhatâmeans, no oneâknows
A great sign appeared in theâheavens
And I saw her there
A scarlet beauty, moon under her feet
Her head in the stars

A clear voice like water
Pearls and gold on scarlet
A woman bidding me to enter

My eyes lusted for what I saw
My heart drew me in
A bitter taste on my tongue
Left by the sweets I was served

A clear voice like water
Pearls and gold on scarlet
A woman bidding me to enter

The screams of the harlot froze the land (Froze the land)
Her gems shining brighter than the sun (Ooh, the sun)
A glowing trident from the dragon's hands
Luxuria, I'm falling
Blessed by the queen of curses
Her brim full womb submerged me in blood sermons
I'm drowning
Ooh, I'm drowning
Oh, I'm drowning, drowning

Pleasure turned to pain
The sand turned into blood
The veil was lifted from my eyes
I saw her face for what it was
I ran blindly for days and nights
Moon turned into a ravenous beast
Finally found a place to rest
I am weakened
I am weakened again
