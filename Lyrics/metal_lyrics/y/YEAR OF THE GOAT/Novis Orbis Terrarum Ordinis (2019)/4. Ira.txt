Slowly it's awakened
Silent this time
A growing rage like a serpent
With a cunning grin, I tookâaâbite
Blinded by fury
Whoâknows evil from good
I hear himâlaughing, that old serpent
It echoes through the night

Some say it's over now
The days when we were glorious
A sharp sword from my mouth
Will strike their nations down

Those gentle answers
Humbly given by wise
Turns to a steel edge sharpened
At the end of a fool's knife
I'll be the righteous judge
No calm when I'm reborn
For those fallen short of the glory
I'll be the tempest, I'll be the storm

A fool says it's over now
The days of my father's wrath
The hate dwelling in the soul
Merge with the returning son

I'm cleansing the dirt from the evils of man
But a foul taste of sour grapes lingers on
My words like a blade and my teeth are set on edge
A fire grows a thunderstorm over the world
(Fire)
(Like a thunderstorm)
(Like a thunderstorm)

Regenerate yourself through my blood
A dark red poison through your veins
Now drink it all
For this is my blood (This is my body)
Like glancing through a window melted by the sunlight
(Praise the morning star)
The stories of the father turns to vapor as a new sunrise
(All is gone)

The ruler of the dolorous
On the throne before us
His light will never find you
Through the ice around you

A longing for the coldness far away from sunlight
(Praise the morning star)
The memory of the father
Shattered in this new sunrise
(All is gone)

The ruler of dolorous
On the throne before us
His light will never find you
Through the ice around you
No one there to guide you

I'm cleansing the dirt from the evils of man
But a foul taste of sour grapes lingers on
My words like a blade and my teeth are set on edge
A fire grows a thunderstorm over the world
