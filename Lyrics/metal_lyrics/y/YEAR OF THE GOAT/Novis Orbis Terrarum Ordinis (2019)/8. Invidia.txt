The ground was cursed here so quote the snake
And you, the son, were sent hereâtoâredeem man's mistake
Onceâthe greatest king of kings, nowâan orphan soul
Take a stand and claim your rights, all this should be yours

Envy of a man leads his soul from the dawning
Virtue for a god

Look at the pride of man, claiming that they're gods
A will that's truly free, shining brighter than the stars
"You can have all that you're longing for", said the serpent to the son
All your pain, all your tears, leave them by the cross

Envy of a man leads his soul from the dawning
Virtue for a god
Envy of a man leads his soul from the dawning
Virtue for a god

The bright colors of the sky
The heavens only knew
A faded memory
Now a darker blue

I've been torn apart and rebuilt
Bitter tears fuel my rage
Wearing the eternal crown of guilt, of jealousy and hate
I'll rule until the end of time
The slayer of mankind
I can clearly see it's all about
It's all about me
It's all about, it's all about me (I can clearly see)
It's all about, it's all about me
It's all about me

Envy of a man leads his soul from the dawning
Virtue for a god
Envy of a man leads his soul from the dawning
Virtue for a god
