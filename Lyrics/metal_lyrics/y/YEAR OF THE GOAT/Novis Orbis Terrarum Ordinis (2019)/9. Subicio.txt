Like a newborn
Sensing the world for the first time
I stand abandoned
Alone with no faith

Is thisâmyâkingdom?
Where the sinâoutshines the lordly grace
A void longingâfor the sun
The healing words from my father's tongue

Lost and in doubt
Is this my maker's will?
The preserver of souls
Himself now a pillar of salt
I'm the capstone and the arch
Above the salt of the earth
I eclipse the father and son
Drunk on the evil soil

Is this my kingdom?
Where the sin outshines the lordly grace
A void longing for the sun
The healing words from my father's tongue
Is this my kingdom?
Where the sin outshines the lordly grace
A void longing for the sun
The healing words from my father's tongue

Cast from the heavens, chased by the morning
(Cast from the heavens above)
Son of the dawning awaits in the end
(Son of the dawning, oh, Lucifer)
Demons among men, nailed to the Earth
(Demons inside you and me)
If the truth shall set them free
Let them all lie
(True lie)
I'm crowned by the rotten guilt of men
All their betrayals are mine to bear
They'll stand before me and pay for their crimes
I'll be the omega, I'll be the end times
How can I live if I have to die to live again?
How can I live if they have to die to live again?
How can I live if they have to die to live again?
How can I live if they have to die?

There's a sickness inside me waking up
The notion of all that I've become
I gave my body to save all that I was
But temped and lost, I'm falling

I can still hear the children cry
Though they've been blessed by the water
Screaming in pain and scorn, by plagues they die
Those blessed by water

The seven princes drag me down
Through oceans of those that I have failed
From waves a legion is storming out
Drown me in flaming laughter
Enclosed and frozen, I pay for my sins
The one unchosen, rotten within
Useless redemption for the mindless mass
Those who've been blessed by the water

I can still hear the children cry
Though they've been blessed by water
Deep into the void where their souls will ignite
Those blessed by water
I can still hear the children cry
Though they've been blessed by the water
Screaming in pain and scorn, by plagues they die
Those blessed by water

Those blessed by water (Ah-ah)
Those blessed by the water (Ah-ah)
Those blessed by the water (Ah-ah)
Those blessed by the water
