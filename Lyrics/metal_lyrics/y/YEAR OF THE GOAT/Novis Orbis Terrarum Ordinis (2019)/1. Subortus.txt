Just like a dog returning to his vomit
I'm child again in the mire among humans
Aâcleanâwhite slate soonâwell immersed in their hate
Anew Iâteach the elders of the temple

My gospel this time ambrosia
Divine fire, brimstone and wine all tempered
Spells and curses spills from the world
I'm the fallen king to rule the fallen world

Ooh, corrupted Earth seething with the darkest of currents
Your ley lines lay charged by the evils of man
That the sun now may become more than a lion

My name shall be adversary
Earth's power are mine, celestial bodies in unity
I will harrow heaven and weed out the usurper
Bleed for me
Oh, bleed, Lucifer

I'm the morning star (Belphegor)
I am the son, oh (Mammon)
What can you do (Legion)
Against such power? (Satan)
Minute monsterum (Leviathan)
Little lizard (Ho Drakon)
Fun size phantom (Shaitan)
See me tower (Lucifer)

Sown with salt is the land
Poisoned every stone and grain of sand
Upon these rocks I shall build my church now
Angels, demons, and men
Shall fear my rebirth

Demons and men can never rival
Fearful angels bow for this lord
