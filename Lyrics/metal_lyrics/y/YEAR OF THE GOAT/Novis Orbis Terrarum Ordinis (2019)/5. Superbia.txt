I am the truth, the way and the life
I am the star that lights upâtheâmoonless night
All ofâthe heavens and all of theâearth
Given by the father, this should all be mine

When I rise, then I'll be praised again
The lord I'll be to all

Oh, I will show no mercy for dogs and swine
I will hate the priceless goods all the time
All will adore me, keeping me above them
I'm the son, the saviour of this world

When I rise, then I'll be praised again
The lord I'll be to all

Make them bow down
Men with pride residing in their hearts
Make them bow down
I alone honoured on this day
I've come to terrify the world
Son of the morning at his knees
I want it all (I want it all)
I want it all (I want it all)
I want it, all of the universe, I want it all

I, I'm the truth, the way and the life
I, the shining star for mankind

When I rise, then I'll be praised again
The lord I'll be to all men

Make them bow down
All who walk with Lucifer that day
Make them bow down
All of the blasphemers will pay
I've come to terrify the world
Son of the morning at his knees
And I'll be me

I want it all (I want it all)
I want it all (I want it all)
I want it all (I want it all)
I want it, all of the universe, I want it all
