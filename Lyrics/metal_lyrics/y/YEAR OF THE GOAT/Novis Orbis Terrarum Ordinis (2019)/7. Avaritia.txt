Down through the circles of Hell
You'll see the ones you've saved
In gold they melt away
Nowâforsaken

Hideâyour face andâlet them perish

You better run, betterârun now
Hiding from yourself
You better run, better run now
While you think you can

To this very hour, all wealth
Stolen in your name
Watch them rot away
While you're falling

Nothing anywhere can save you

You better run, better run now
Hiding from yourself
You better run, better run now
While you think you can

You had wings
Bright shining wings
But they're blackened now
A golden crown
Now turned to ash
By your enemy

You better run, better run now
Hiding from yourself
You better run, better run now
While you think you can

You had wings
Bright shining wings
But they're blackened now
A golden crown
Now turned to ash
By your enemy
