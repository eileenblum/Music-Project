Mystic Mountains
The unspeakable lingers here
Mystic Mountains
White hills kept their secrets

Before men walked this earth
And the moon had left to greet the sun
Over years of their existence
They built their cities here on this ground

Abandoned stone city
Where is your path?

Mystic Mountains
What fears hide in your ruins?
Mystic Mountains
What horrors deep in your caves?

If these walls could tell the tale
Of the fright and horrors they have seen
This far into their existence
Here we are, and their city only sleeps

Abandoned stone city
Are you all that you seem?
Abandoned stone city
What hides, what hides in the deep?

In the darkness boils like mud
An ancient being arise from the blackest blood
In the darkness boils like mud
An ancient being arise

Abandoned stone city
Here is your path
Abandoned stone city
Here is your path
