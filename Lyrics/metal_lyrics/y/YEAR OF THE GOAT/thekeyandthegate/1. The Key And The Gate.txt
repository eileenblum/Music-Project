From darkness we came
To let our souls transcend
The bounds of a holy earth
And be delivered to
The depths of a deep dark truth
All things are known by you

The cry of the birds will lead us to

La chiave, la chiave e la porta
La chiave, la chiave e la porta

The book of the dead is calling
From pages of human skin
Words burning in my mouth
Bow down and greet the old ones
As they repossess the earth
You watch from the great beyond

The howl of the horde is calling on

La chiave, la chiave e la porta
La chiave, la chiave e la porta

You're the passage open for them
You're the passage open to us
All in one and one in all

La chiave, la chiave e la porta
La chiave, la chiave e la porta
La chiave, la chiave e la porta
La chiave, la chiave per l'inferno
Per l'inferno

[Music by T. Sabbathi. Lyrics by T. Sabbathi &amp; M. Popovic]
