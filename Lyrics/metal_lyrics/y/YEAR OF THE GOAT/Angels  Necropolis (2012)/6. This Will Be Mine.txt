I'm falling down
I've been cast out
My belief is stronger than my maker
I'm crashing down
I'm stronger now
My hate creates this foundation

Green flames rise, building my throne
Above the stars, above his kngdom
My name is sung by his parish
LUCEM FERRE!

This will be mine
All this... Will be mine
This will be mine
My hate will burn
All his creation

All souls merge into
A path to my throne
I walk without grace or mercy
His flock of lambs
All gathered now
They build my throne from his ruins

Green flames rise, building my throne
Above the stars, above his kngdom
My name is sung by his parish
LUCEM FERRE!

This will be mine
All this... Will be mine
This will be mine
My hate will burn
All his creation
