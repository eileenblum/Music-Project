My Lord, we hear you calling
We're ready to raise our swords for you
With dignity and obligation
We will fight for you

Prepared soldiers for your advent
We stand strong and ready, ready for you
Just give us the sign
And we will strike
Down your enemies

The sky opens up
Down come the sons
That despise our king

Gates of the abyss are opening
The reaper rises
Black endless eyes
Towards the sky

He commands you now
With the voice of a dragon
He commands you now
Hear his voice!

The left handed reaper
He harvest the holy
We feast on the corpses
That were served by his strike

He commands you now
With the voice of a dragon
He commands you now
Hear his voice!

Heaven's weeping now
Dade are the sons
That despised our king

My Lord, we hear you calling
We're ready to raise our swords for you
With dignity and obligation
We will fight for you

Prepared soldiers for your advent
We stand strong and ready, ready for you
Just give us the sign
And we will strike
Down your enemies
