With unholy shadows
Push away the light
And let her
Feel my presence here
In the shadows I see
The realm of her power
Please come to me - my queen! Oh!

I can feel her fire
So great
So spirited and majestic
Owl's carols, our psalm
Psalms of fornication
Black flame
Rises for me
I sacrifice all for her
Please come to me - my queen! Oh!

A circle of serpents around me
Chanting spells
Her black flaming palms command me
A circle of serpents around me

Bow down before the queen

I feel her fingers impaled through my chest
Dragging out the last drop of life
Now I'm an empty vessel guided by her spell
Two lovers merge in creation as one

A circle of serpents around me
Chanting spells
Her black flaming palms command me
A circle of serpents around me

Bow down before the queen
