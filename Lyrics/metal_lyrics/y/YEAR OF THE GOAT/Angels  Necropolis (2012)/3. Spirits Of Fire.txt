Let the stars be the candles on your grave
Awakening of the ancient one they seek
Hands from hell laying you down
In a hole, hole in the ground

Spirits of fire encircle you now
Their soothing voices call out for him

Burning hands and their faces are grave
Coven stares with ravenous eyes at you
The air filled with death, the night filled with love
Love for the master, love for the master

Spirits of fire encircle you now
Their soothing voices call out for him
