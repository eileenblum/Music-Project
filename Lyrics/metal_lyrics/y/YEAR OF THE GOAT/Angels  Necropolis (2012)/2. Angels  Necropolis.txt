This journey on earth
Has come to an end
It is time to become
Imperator over all
I have sought the oak feather leafy
Red pulsating veins on it's crust
Feeding on angelic corpses
Over aeons of time

And I know the power it holds deep within
I will now drimk the sap from it's veins

I abandon all control and let the oak decide
I bow down my head and raise my hand, to form the king seal
My wings unfold! My wings unfold now, my mouth thirsting!
I fly towards the tree with hunger! With hunger for it's might

Time has come for me, to drink the sap of the old tree
Aroused I release a wellspring from it's trunk
Deceased heavenly creatures manifest in great jubilation
A pale choir erupts on sacred ground

Angels' Necropolis
Hear me angels
Bow down before me, I'm the new God now
Hear me Angels
Angels' Necropolis

I breach the gates of Alpha to become his Omega
I smash God's armor and break his sword and scepter
The son of man is kneeling as he's given the choice
Pitiful king of sorrows, your kingdom is now mine

Angels' Necropolis
Hear me angels
Bow down before me, I'm the new God now
Hear me Angels
Angels' Necropolis
