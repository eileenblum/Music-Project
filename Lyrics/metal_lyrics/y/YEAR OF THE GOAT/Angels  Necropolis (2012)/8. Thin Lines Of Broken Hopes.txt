Children, this is what you become
Servants crippled by Christ
Must break through the walls of stupidity
Free yourselves in the light of Lucifer
Powerful is this dark light, like blood from the oak, blood from the oak

Come and taste the elixir
Tuning your soul in
Virginity is a sin
In this temple of dark gloom

Children, embrace this blood from the beast
This will set you free from Christ's prophecy
A prophecy that makes you weak, like lies from their lord, lies from their lord

Come and taste the elixir
Tuning your soul in
Virginity is a sin
In this temple of dark gloom

Never again will you walk the thin lines of broken hopes
All of you are sons and daughters of Lucifer

Come and taste the elixir
Tuning your soul in
Virginity is a sin
In this temple of darkness
