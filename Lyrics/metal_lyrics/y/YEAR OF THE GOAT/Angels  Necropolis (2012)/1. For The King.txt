Carry this offering
To the imperator
Evangel for the unholy
A hymn sung by his children

Obedience
For The King

Shine, shine so bright, son of the morning star
Free us from chains, chains of lies

Black wings rise and surround the blood red moon
His majesty's eyes follow you in mesmeric solicitation

Obedience
For The King

Shine, shine so bright, son of the morning star
Free us from chains, chains of lies
Lies...
