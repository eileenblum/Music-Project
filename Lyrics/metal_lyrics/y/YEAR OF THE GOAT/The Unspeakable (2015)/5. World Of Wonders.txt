Close your eyes
Let the spirit of dreams show you
In your mind
A hidden gate awaits you
Open now - "open now"
Open now - "open now"

Guarded by ghouls, raising your hands saying,
You may enter this world
With claw like hands, grasping your vessel
Throw you into the void

Oh! A world of wonders
Ride the flame into the night
Bow down pledge your soul to this nightmare
Is it real or is it death

A golden road to the forest
Charred trees on the sides
Magic vibrates in the air here
An omen of demise?
Over the oceans
Through the wastelands
A new world at the end of those steps
Counting seventy ways to die here
See the pathway
Open now

Oh! A world of wonders
Ride the flame into the night
Bow down pledge your soul to this nightmare
Is it real or is it death

Feel thread lightly over the floor
A silent movement saves you
Watch your steps beware of your foe
Death or worse awaits you

Open now - "open now"
Open now - "open now"
Close your eyes
Let the spirit
Show you the way

Oh! A world of wonders
Ride the flame into the night
Bow down pledge your soul to this nightmare
Is it real or is it death

Majestic shadow spreads it's wings
Rising upon glorious
Take me home
On wings of gold
