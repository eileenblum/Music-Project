The night falls upon the old ruin
Like dark wings, caressing the stones
Something hides just above the silence
Disturbing the peace of my mind

And in the darker corners of the night
While I twist and turn in my cold sweat
Mystic shadows seeking out their pray
Hiding away, from the light

I'm pulled from a dream, at o-five-o-nine
The source of the sound remain unseen
From under the floor and inside the walls
The maddening scraping, chills through the bones

And in the flicker of a candle light
A mystic shadow of a faceless soul
Showing the way, into the night

I feel - Eyes stare at me
I'm crying - Out for mercy
I hear them - screaming in anguish
From under the floor boards and up through my spine

I feel - Eyes stare at me
I'm crying - Out for mercy
I hear them - screaming in anguish
From under the floor boards and up through my spine
I can feel the compulsion growing strong in me
Insanity, a ferocious stream of destiny
