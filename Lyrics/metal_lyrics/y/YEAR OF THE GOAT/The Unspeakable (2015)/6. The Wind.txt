In a deep dark ocean, where the Ancient rest
I can hear them whispering, inside my head
In the horizon I see glowing eyes
They seduce me, and break me like ice

A million voices bursting out
Coming on like a wave now
Dragging me down

I can hear the wind call out their names
Ah, I can hear the wind calling out

A hundred miles out in the cold
Spirits dancing in the rays of the moon
It's slowly rising a fear with no names
This is the ending, nothing will remain

A million voices screaming out
Stronger than a wave now
Dragging me down

I can hear the wind call out their names
Ah, I can hear the wind calling out

Ah, I can hear the wind call out their names
Ah, I can hear the wind calling out
Ah, I can hear the wind call out their names
Ah, I can hear the wind calling out

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
