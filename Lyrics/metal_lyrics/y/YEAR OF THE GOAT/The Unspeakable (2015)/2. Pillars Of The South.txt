Black starlit sky, embrace the moon's halo
Out of the glowing portal a white ship paints the ocean
I see it shine, shines so bright, a path to the journey
Pillars of the south
Oh, rises up!

With sails of souls through the echoes of the aeons
Sirens of Cathuria guide us through the mist to the carven gate
See colonnades, bone temples, in the land of Thalarion
It ends here!
Oh, this early bound!

Look to the land of bones, the demon's calling you
Calling you!
No trace of man, only mad things walking here
City of Thousand Wonders many souls have passed
But none come back!
I see the spears of the temple as they impale the skies
So high
The sounds of falling waters
Cries
Of men and what is not man
Before me lies the raging ocean
The sounds of falling waters
I shut my eyes and I shut the world out
And wake up from this darkness

Suddenly I found myself, back from where I once was
A secret well kept, by the sea
On the shore, a white piece of wood
Hiding itself in the sand
And my guide forever resting

I saw the land of bones, I heard the demon's call
Calling you!
No trace of man, only mad things walking there
City of Thousand Wonders many souls have passed
But none come back!
I saw the spears of the temple as they impaled the skies
So high
