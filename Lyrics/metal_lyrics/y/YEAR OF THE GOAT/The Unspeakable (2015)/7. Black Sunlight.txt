A morning breaks from light into nothing
A rebirth into a void
Sounds in my ears
A vacuum of whispers

A shapeless shimmer with eyes like coal
Leads the way into our world
See all their secrets
All those souls, exposed

Black Sunlight
Like star light
Black Sunlight
Like star light

A dark cloudy mass before me
Absorbs the falling stars
A chill down my spine
Euphoria and fear

Black Sunlight
Like star light
Black Sunlight
Like star light

Shine down on me
Black Sunlight
Calling out
Black Sunlight
Bringing me in
Black Sunlight
Make me whole

Shine down on me
Black Sunlight
Calling out
Black Sunlight
Bringing me in
Black Sunlight
Make me whole

From deep beneath the sea
Emancipate the chosen
Calling out to me
From down in the deep

Black Sunlight
Like star light
Black Sunlight
Shine down on me
