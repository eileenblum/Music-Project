I read of her fate under the starlight.
Pulled into the deep by a nameless madness.
A silhouette of a foe on the horizon arose.
See scattered men afloat in a sea of sorrow.

The beauty of the ocean
The ones who call out the unspeakable name of the one.

Wants her gone
Not to return
But into my mind her name was burnt
Stuck in my head her name lingers and waits,
For me to find out why most of her men are dead.

The beauty of the ocean
Who wants her gone?
She, a beauty...
The ones who call out the unspeakable name of the one.
Wants her gone

The beauty of the ocean
Who wants her gone?
She, a beauty...
The ones who call out the unspeakable name of the one.

The Emma Of Auburn has sharpened her senses.
She sails through the mist, with armed defenses,
The ones who call out the unspeakable name of the one.

Now she's gone...
