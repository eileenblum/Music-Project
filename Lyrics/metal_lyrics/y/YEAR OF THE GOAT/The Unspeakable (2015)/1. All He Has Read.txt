A monolithic terror stands - at the edge of the end
Hands surrounded by flames - glowing mist in the eyes
These are the keys - open the seals
All he has read will now come to pass
The raging thunder will witness as Chaos unfurls

He has seen the days that will come - the fate of man and gods
All are his to deliver - into the cruel ancient hands
Behold the sky - the clouds will burn
All that he has read - will now come to be
His witness is the thunder - as Chaos unfurls
All he has read - will now come to pass
This is the true rebirth - of the new World

Under the crimson moon shadows dancing upon the hills
The sky was clear and the vast reaches of the desert still
The earth cracks open and a river of blood leads the path
Voices of burning souls howls from under the northern star

The mouth of the earth is open now
See it, feel it
Channeling the ancient in!
Man's soul is released in the universe
Replaced with a god born in the dragons fire

Fiery ornaments appear in the shape of an open gate
On its threshold awaits countless aeons of hate
Pale faces cross a shapeless mass
Neither man nor demon, neither good nor evil

The mouth of the earth is open now
See it, feel it
Channeling the ancient in!
Man's soul is released in the universe
Replaced with a god born in the dragons fire
Man's soul is released in the universe
Replaced with a god

All he has read - will now come to be
The raging thunder will witness - as Chaos unfurls
All he has read - will now come to pass
This is the true rebirth - of a new World
All that he has read - all he has read
Will now come to be - all he has read
All that he has read - all he has read
Will now come to be - all he has read
