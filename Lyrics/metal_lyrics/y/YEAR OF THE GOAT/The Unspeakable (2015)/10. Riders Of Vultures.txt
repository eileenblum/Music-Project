Ride into the midnight mist,
Guided by the glimmering stars.
Look at the twisted willows
As they dance in the miasma.

Follow the tail of the slithering line,
To the Riders of Vultures.
Follow the tail of the slithering line,
To the Riders of Vultures.

Old man, tell me is there a trail
To this world of phantoms?
His empty eyes rest on me.
"Endless darkness is coming", he said

Follow the tail of the slithering line,
To the Riders of Vultures
Follow the tail of the slithering line,
To the Riders of Vultures

Poisoned flames,
Dancing upon the old tombstones,
And into the swarming
Temple of the unknown.

Let the sermon begin, light the candles.
Here we are prepared to meet the Master.

I see them coming from the pitch-black sky,
The Riders of Vultures.
I see them coming from the pitch-black sky,
The Riders.

Endless darkness follow us,
Ancient starlight on our path.
