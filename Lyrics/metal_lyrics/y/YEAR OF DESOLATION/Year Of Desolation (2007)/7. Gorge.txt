This is a thing of legend: I've made my own, you won't control my destiny.
Die for yourself and no one else, don't be fooled cause they won't stop.
Deadly fires, you're burning alive.
I've got nothing else, I'm not the one to be controlled.
My face pushed down, I rise up to one knee, my eyes deceive, yet I still dream!
I found my god in this bottle, destroyed my fears now there's no turning back.
Goddamn this fucking place, I had no chance to cave, these walls are closing in bringing back my pain.
It's all so untrue: how your pride killed my faith.
The biggest lie ever sold, is now a household name.
I've risen from the dead to bring back my own heart.
This is my saviour: my one true friend.
Lies and deceit abundant, I'll break your fuckin' neck.
