Before our last talk, I booby-trapped my heart
I tried not to laugh as you ripped it out
You walked away with it cupped in your hands
I pictured you grinning as I pressed the detonator
Now that you want me back
You're all apologetic in your new prosthetics
I think your stumps are sexy
But my love for you is just another one of your phantom limbs
