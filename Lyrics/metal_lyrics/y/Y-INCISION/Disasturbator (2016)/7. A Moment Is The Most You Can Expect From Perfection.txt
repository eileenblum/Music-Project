I either spend the present yearning for satisfaction to arrive or nostalgic over events even if they weren't that great of time
Drugs, dreams and a thousand forms of delusion grant serenity in the second and if you attach to me, it's cool, cause I'm already attached to you
We commit to each other and yearn for one another with never a moment together
Ignorant, crave and suffer
