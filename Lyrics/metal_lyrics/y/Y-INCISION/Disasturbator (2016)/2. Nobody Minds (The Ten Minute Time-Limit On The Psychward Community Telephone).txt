"Who I am is enough!" Is carved across the wall in my room
I refuse to go to group therapy
It's either pace the length of the unit or bull-shit with some of the staff
Psychoanalysis, psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, humanistic, integrative or holistic
FUCK YOUR COPING SKILLS!
GIVE ME COPING PILLS!
ALL I NEED ARE MY GET-RIGHTS!
The coolest staff were once patience themselves
FUCK YOUR COPING SKILLS!
GIVE ME COPING PILLS
ALL I NEED ARE MY GET-RIGHTS!
Dude, my psychiatrist is way hotter than yours
That girl never stops rocking back and forth
It doesn't matter that I discharge at four
It'll just be the same as before
