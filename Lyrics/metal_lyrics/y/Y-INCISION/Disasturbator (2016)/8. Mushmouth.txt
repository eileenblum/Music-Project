t's like the harder I try to speak the more my tongue trips over itself
Docs say my speech impediment is social anxiety
I rarely talk at school because my classmates laugh at me
Some like Big Johnny call me "Mushmouth" before they sock me
I never stutter when I'm talking to my friends
My speech only cd skips with everyone else
If they'd give me a chance my anxiety'd go away and they'd find out what a great friend I could be
Today, my friends'll get to meet the kids from school
I'm going to try talking to my classmates by making them imaginary too
I point the gun at Big Johnny
He uses Sally as a human shield
They are the first I greet with a perfectly pronounced "Hello"
