Tearing out of the night, I'm racing down Main through your ghost town
Closet skeletons and other whores haunt the street
The traffic lights flash as yellow as their complexion
And I run through each one sans caution
And I run through each one sans caution
Drifting through town's square, I see you crucified
The eyes your demons have taken reminds me of when I saw this dystopia in them
Buildings burst into flame I floor the accelerator
Buildings burst into flame I floor the accelerator
The city ablaze in my rearview
Maybe now I won't dream about you
