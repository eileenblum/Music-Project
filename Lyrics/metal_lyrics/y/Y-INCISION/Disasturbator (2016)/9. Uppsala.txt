Guided by the light of the full moon
Three burial mounds come into view
The holy temple where the heathens meet
Lies just beyond where the deities sleep
Every nine years over nine days lavish the gods with offering &amp; praise
Every nine years over nine days seventy-two male creatures bled &amp; hanged
The vernal equinox at Old Uppsala
Christians are welcome but refuse to come
They shun the disciples
They shun their idols
They shun the dogs, horses &amp; human corpses hung in the sacred grove
But what distresses them most is through ritual all those Pagan can be forgiven while all those Christian will be forsaken
Every nine years over nine days lavish the gods with offering &amp; praise
Every nine years over nine days seventy-two male creatures bled &amp; hanged
Chants unseemly
Incantations manifold
Only the profane believe they should remain untold
