I've lost my drive,
self deprivation.
Beauty I've seen only in dream,
and I can no longer close my eyes.

I bite my tongue as I spied an image tried and true.
A ray of hope has cleared my clouded eyes.
You called my name, reached in and ripped out my despair.
Shedding light on shadows, cold and dank.

You called my name and I...

This ray of hope,
Has cleared my eyes.
You called my name,
I heard you say...

"We fall. We all fall.
Just take my hand,
and stand up again"

I bite my tongue as I spied an image tried and true.
A ray of hope has cleared my clouded eyes.

This ray of hope,
has cleared my eyes.
You called my name,
and I heard you say...

"We fall. We all fall.
Just take my hand,
and stand up again"
