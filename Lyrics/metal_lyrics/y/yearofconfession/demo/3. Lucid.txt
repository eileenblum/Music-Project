Is this fate or illusion?
A call of the mark? A rung of the spine?
A blind man's vision, unseen yet knowing.
forbidden sight.

Abscess forming, infection decays what we strive to fulfill, hopes and dreams.
Claw the growth out, to begin anew we refresh the seal.
Slash and burn.
Now divided. One to his own but soon all shall find the call still yearns.

Two hands in bind, forming a whole they become the solution.
Souls they intertwine, forming a new hope which may lead to suffering...

Hopes fail. Dreams fail. Life fails. We've failed.

Two hands in bind, forming a whole they become the solution.
Souls they intertwine, forming a new hope which may lead to suffering...

Now divided. One to his own but soon all shall find the call still yearns.
