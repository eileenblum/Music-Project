Awakened by the sound,
this moment seems to last an eternity.
time slows down,
and my love won't respond to my frantic cries.

Draw your weapon,
eyes of steel and a heart of coal, a big mistake.
Horrid truths, tasteful likes,
turning heads they'll realize, you're a fake.
Pseudo hero, tuck your tail, turn tide, and run away.

I lose my breath as innocence runs down her chest,
she looks at me with eyes so full of fear.
Time goes and I pray to God that you don't die,
for you're my inspiration to go on.

Draw your weapon, eyes of steel and a heart of coal, a big mistake.
Pseudo hero, tuck your tail, turn tide, and run away.

I lose my breath as innocence runs down her chest,
she looks at me with eyes so full of fear.
Time goes and I pray to God that you don't die,
for you're my inspiration to go on.

Now you'll face my wrath,
my vengeance a will too strong.
A love, a vindication, one moment just to shed your blood.
Shed, Your, Blood.

I lose my breath as innocence runs down her chest,
she looks at me with eyes so full of fear.
Time goes and I pray to God that you don't die,
for you're my inspiration to go on.

I lose my breath as innocence runs down her chest,
she looks at me with eyes so full of fear.
I close my eyes and thank the Lord that you survived,
the beating of our hearts is now in time.

The world can rest now that you're not gone.
