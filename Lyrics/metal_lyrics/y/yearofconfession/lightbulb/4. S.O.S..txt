Go

So you left me,
Left me here.
Broken/tortured.
Blind to all the pain.

I just walked away that morning.
Hidden from the truth.
I no longer feel the warming,
The deeper nail had torn me through.

Save our Sanity.

Two times the grace, two times the fear.
Crushed below one minute's hand.

Nothing can be done for now,
Although I still believe that there still is time,
But I can see that you don't care, they still don't belong,
In a world that never thought that they could be wrong.
Nothing.

Forcing malice,
On those who are,
Weaker than me.
These devils eyes,
Are focused on you,
They bring the ache.
Can you believe that one can turn,
To face their fears and learn the truth.
One can make the difference in this.

Nothing can be done for now.
Although I still believe that there still is time.
But I can see that you don't care, they still don't belong,
In a world that never thought that they could be wrong.
No.

A toss up between good and evil, A dramatic and life altering decision.
On that fateful day I was to either brand myself a bigot or a saint.
I would burn that day into the molded scroll of history and relive it
Everyday for the rest of my feeble existence. This point, although
Moot to me, still acts as a guideline for all those who will come
After me... for generations.

Break through,
Examine the structure.
Still can't see,
Water through mud.
Tragedy,
Spill my own blood here.
Fallen,
Angels will suffer. [x2]

Tragedy.
