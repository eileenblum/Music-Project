All this time has gone to waste,
You've burned me through and through.
Choices made, paths now clear,
The truths have turned to lies.
Fortunate enough to take this,
The time to make things right.
At least I know, within my heart, the reasons that I fought.

I have become the stone wall.
I am the truth be told.
I've tread on shallow waters.
I am, I am the will to fight.
For those who are my brethren...
For those who braved the pain...
finally we've smashed the walls down.
of their insanity.

I bled for,
I bled for you.
Now can you just find the strength and bleed a little for me. [x2]

I've died so many times inside, I'm just an empty shell.
You've redesigned my seamless structure,
To fit your, to fit your greed.

I bled for,
I bled for you,
Now can you just find the strength and bleed a little for me.
I'd die for,
I'd die for you.
Now will you please shut your mouth and just die for me.
Just die for me.

Empty soul,
Taken control,
This fragile mind,
You've taken all that I am,
This time,
You're mine.
No more empathy,
For me, this day
To know that I am free,
Of you, of hate,
Of this depression.
I can not believe.

I have become the stone wall.
I am the truth be told.
I've tread on shallow waters.
I am, I am the will to fight.

Just die, you just, you just die for me.
