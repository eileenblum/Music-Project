Never,
Again. [x2]

I've been given a choice to make.
To believe or forget my faith.
Your mind, it's on the other side,
Oh God, no more fucking mistakes.

Never,
Again.

You minds made up, mine in a day or so.
Anger, sorrow all that's now left.
This living hell, that grows inside of you,
Clings on by a single breath.
A single breath.

Everyday, same old pain, time will never erase.
Twice a day, a child's face, haunts me, never will be.
The one chance in the past, oh Never again.
Will I taste bitter grace for I'll never forget.

Now you'll see why I should die.

Blood, pus, shit now all that's left,
of what I could of kissed.
Twisted soul inside the glass.
All because I moved too fast.
Skin, bones, tissues cut to none.

Hypocrisy, is all I know, and all I'll ever see.
I had the choice but took the life from this I'll never be free.

Everyday, same old pain, time will never erase.
Twice a day, a child's face, haunts me, never will be.
The one chance in the past, oh Never again.
Will I taste bitter grace for I'll never forget.

So throw your head right back and, and take a swig, of life's complexity.
And don't forget, to wear the hat, the hat that makes us free.

Immoral.
Sanctified.
Blasphemy.
No one cried.

Fuck.
