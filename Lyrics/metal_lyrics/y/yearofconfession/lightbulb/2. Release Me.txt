Fate is just a term, that's used without a thought.

What about me?
What about all the time we've shared?
All I'm left with...
Sharpened blades of agony.
Why pose?

This day has put me in the way.
Chronicled Misery,
To pray for forgiveness as I shed my blood,
As the world cries for me to beg.

No I can't breath.
No I can't...

No more can I sit and stare.
Can you hear me father?
Bleeding forth with silent words,
But do you even really care?

No you can't see.
No you can't...

Turn away, this emptied mind of mine.
No longer wait, has been long past the time.
I lay awake, restless from the pain,
Here hides the snake, coiled for the strike.
Poisoned venom bite.
What was I to do that day.
Poisoned venom bite.

.... Why?
I'm so scared.
Try... to overcome,
This... form of abuse.
You, you can't see the

Broken hope, lies of lies, twisting knife,
I can no longer see that your,
Forming hate, blackened soul, nothings left
Of the man I once knew who was,
Loving me, teaching me, apathy
In this world that no longer cares
For me, or life...

Me

Release.
