I would tear out my own eyes
Just so I donât have to see your pretty face
Staring back at me again
These memories inside your eyes
Are too much for me to take
This pain I feel will never end

These memories are what break me
Constant reminder of the way you made me
I canât believe that you betrayed me
And now I want all this pain to go away

And as I taste your skin again
I feel your eyes on me
Then I wake up and realize
That it was just another dream
I want to wake up
And never fall asleep again
Stuck here on this state of mind
A dead end road in my head

So many questions without answers
Just for once I want the truth from you
Why do you keep it from me?
Were you afraid of what Iâd say?
Were you afraid Iâd walk away?
You always were afraid of that before

These memories are what break me
Constant reminder of the way you made me
I canât believe that you betrayed me
And now I want all this pain to go away

And as I taste your skin again
I feel your eyes on me
Then I wake up and realize
That it was just another dream
I want to wake up
And never fall asleep again
Stuck here on this state of mind
A dead end road in my head

I would tear out
My own eyes just
So I donât have
To see your face

You betrayed me bitch

I wander
Down this road alone
Without your voice to guide me
The stars will take me home
