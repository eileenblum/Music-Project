Come on everybody
Lets party

Here we go
Tonight's the night again
Come on lets roll
Fuck it we don't have a plan
Girls and boys
Were on a mission to
Make some noise
And make some bad decisions

Lifes a party
And we will party hard
So pass that forty
And we can live it large
Grab a dutch
So we can roll that shit up
Now lets get fucked
And play some pong and flip cup

Here we go

Come on lets roll
Lifes a party
So pass that forty

Beer pong flip cup we'll put you to shame
Don't be embarrassed though its all in the game
G-g-g-girls go from watchin' to screamin' our names
Half serious half party yo were one in the same (Bitch)

We are always making it rain
Watch your back or you'll get the brain
Bend over and take your two kicks
Thats payment for seeing these dicks

Look at that kid left his shoes on
He's about to get his face drawn
Oh my god this nights been so long
I passed out on my own front lawn

Sometimes
We drink too much
Sometimes
We end up on the floor
Sometimes
We all lose touch
But its ok
Were just trying to stay young

Sometimes
We smoke too much
Sometimes
We get a bit too burnt
Sometimes
We all lose touch
But its ok
Were just trying to have fun

Da da da da da da, da da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da da da da da

What The Fuck Did I Do Last Night
Repeat tonight
