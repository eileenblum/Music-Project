Number one rule is donât get caught
Iâm a very neat
Monster!
Tonightâs the night and it will happen again
I need to bring order
To the chaos

Everyone deserves just what they get
When they meet me
Iâve found ways to control my darkest
Urges to kill
Each killer my victims just one more
Blood drop to me
No matter what
Iâll always be
One step aheadâ¦

And if I had a heart
Itâd be breaking right now

Sometimes I feel As if The mask is Slipping
But it Makes me Feel alive

Open your eyes and look at what youâve done

Your victims innocent now your time is up
My step father Harry he taught me so well
I may be a killer but I have my standards

Chopped up all of your body
Trash bags of you fill my boat
Toss you out into the ..Gulf Stream..
Letâs just say that the ..North Atlantic.. âs a big grave
