His family looked down on hers
Hers thought he was a selfish jerk
They said she wasnât good enough
They said heâll never stay faithful
Sitting on opposite sides
During the ceremony
Shooting hateful stares
Powder keg ready to explode

There was no good way for this to end
Time after time they would always pretend
Handshakes and smiles were all counterfeit
Who would have thought it could come to this?

Beautiful day to get married
Too bad theyâll now have to be buried
Soon theyâll be lying in their coffins bedding
Itâs Just Another!!!
Shotgun wedding

Made up their minds the stage is set
Almost breathing their final breaths
Such a sad story itâs so upsetting
Itâs Just Another!!!
Shotgun wedding

When the priest
Spoke the words

Speak now or forever hold
Your peace the peace was broke
Shotgun blast to the head
Bride and groom now lie there dead

Everyone is dead
Buckshot to the head
Everyone could see
They werenât meant to be

Bride and groom
Youâll meet your doom
Load Pump Aim Pullâ¦

Boom!!!
