Iâm sorry I couldnât be
Everything you wanted
And you know Iâd give
Anything to be that lucky
After all those times
You told me
Never to give up on you
You turned your back and gave up on me

How could you end it all just like this?
How could you leave it all behind?
Weâve been through hell and back
And we always made it out alive
But are we going to this time?

How can this make you happy?
How can leaving me make things right?
I canât give you up that easy
I wonât go down without a fight

You might as well killed me
You might as well put a hole in my head
Your words were like bullets
And you said so much that you shot me dead

I need you
And I know you need me
I love you
And You Turned Your Back On
Me!!

Blank eyes stare
Into space
Reflecting
Only memories

What do I do now that I have nothing to live for?
What do I do now that I have nothing to die for?
