On my own. Itâs easier to be alone. Itâs everything Iâve ever known and I am stronger than youâll ever know. You always knew how to get the best of me. For the longest time I was blind I couldnât see. But I opened my eyes, and I opened my mind, and now I'm finally free.
I try to think of one time, one time in my life when you made your presence known. Solely because I needed you, and not just to be your stepping-stone. I grew sick, grew tired, of feeling useless and all your excuses. Of why you were never there, though you still claimed
to care. So now just let me go. Let me go! ALONE, ALONE! That's all I've ever known. ALONE, ALONE! That's all I need to know. Regress and regret until I realizedâ¦ On my own. Itâs easier to be alone. Itâs everything Iâve ever known and I am stronger than youâll ever know.
Iâve relied on you for way too long, but now all the fucked up feelings I had are gone. If there's one thing that I've learned it's to rely on myself, because you can't trust your heart with anyone fucking else. There is a monster inside of you, and if there's one thing
that I live to proveâ¦ You may have blood, bone, and skin; but nothing about you will ever be human! You always knew how to get the best of me. For the longest time I was blind I couldnât see. But I opened my eyes, and I opened my mind, and now I'm finally free. IâM
FINALLY FREE FROM YOU!
