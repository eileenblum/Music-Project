You're ever so enticing, object of my TEMPTATION. I feel your touch, it's too much. I can't fucking take it. It's getting hard to think straight. Suspense is driving me insane. My hungerâs getting harder to contain. That look inside your eyes, my subtle invitation to
come inside and explore my fascination. So seductive, I can't help but fucking love it. Self-destructive, but I can't get enough of it. Fiery friction, the urge, the addiction. My conviction, I'm finding pleasure through affliction. Oh god I fucking need it. I want you
in front, behind, bottom to top. And once you start, start, start don't you ever stop. I wanna fill, fill, fill you up to the top. I want you BEGGING, BLEEDING, ACHING FOR MORE. In front, behind, bottom to top. Start, start don't you ever stop. Fill, fill you up to the
top. Begging and pleading and needing and bleeding; aching and dying for more. So seductive, I can't help but fucking love it. Self-destructive, but I can't get enough of it. Fiery friction, the urge, the addiction. My conviction, I'm finding pleasure through affliction.
I am the branch, you are the bush, and I will do what nature intended me to. I'll take my time, unwrap my vines, and entangle myself in you. MYSELF IN YOU! This is the only thing that makes me feel anything. Your skin, my bone, it's all I have; it's everything.
