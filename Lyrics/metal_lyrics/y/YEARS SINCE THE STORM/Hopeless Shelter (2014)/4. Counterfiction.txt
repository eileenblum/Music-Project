You walk through life deaf and blind, as everything unfolds around you without reason or rhyme. Because itâs not about why, itâs simply all about time. And no, itâs not about when the fucking stars align. Everything around you is within your control. Itâs not decided by
the supernatural. It makes me sick that your head is so thick. Open up your eyes. Why donât you open up your eyes? You control your own fate. Donât listen to a word they say, THEREâS NO SUCH THING AS DESTINY. And when you wish upon a star, it wonât get you very
((fucking)) far. Your view on life is through foolish eyes, believing all you see when all you see is lies. Hate to break your spirits, I can't help it I'm a realist. I don't rely on fairy tales to justify why I exist. You can try but you'll never convince me; I don't
believe in the make believe. Call me egotistical, overanalytical. All I want to do is to explain the inexplicable. It doesn't bother me that we disagree. Your views, your values, they don't mean shit to me! Everything is coincidence. Every situation is created by chance.
You control your own fate. Donât listen to a word they say, thereâs no such thing as destiny. And when you wish upon a star, it wonât get you very ((fucking)) far. You are no more predetermined than the VERMIN, the FILTH that lurks in the sewers and the streets.
