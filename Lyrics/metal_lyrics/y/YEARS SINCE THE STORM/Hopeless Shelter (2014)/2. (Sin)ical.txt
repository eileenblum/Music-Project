DECEIVER! How can you believe in someone you havenât seen? While heâs stealing your thoughts and theyâre collecting your green. If there's a God then what the Hell is he waiting for? Immaculate Conception was nothing but a LYING WHORE. All you know as biblical is nothing
more than fictional. Thinking that youâre noble, but youâre just hypocritical. Donât attend your Sabbath Day, yet you still continue to pray; believing it will save you while you waste your life away. The power of Christ compels you to be nothing but a slave to selective
morality. So shut your mouth, get off your knees; and follow me, follow me if you want to be free. You will be CRUCIFIED, cross your T's and dot the I's. And then I think youâll find that everything has been a lie. Fooled for thousands of years by something created from
fear, the fear that death is the final frontier. You think your savior can fix the broken? You think your savior can heal the sick? You think your savior can fix the broken? Well fix this, you motherfucking hypocrite bitch! âYou will sit and wait for your king to arrive,
while he sits atop his throne and he watches you die!â All you know as biblical is nothing more than fictional. Thinking that youâre noble, but youâre just hypocritical. Donât attend your Sabbath Day, yet you still continue to pray; believing it will save you while you
waste your life away. The power of Christ compels you to be nothing but a slave to selective morality. So shut your mouth, get off your knees; and follow me, follow me if you want to be free. The only reason I wish that there was life after death would be so that I could
see you in hell next to me. But you gave your whole life to a hope and a dream, that turned out to be as fake as who you pretend to be. DECEIVER! You lived a meaningless existence, and I will laugh in your face as you reach your death. You will rot six feet under just
like everyone else, while the stench of foolishness lingers on your last breath.
