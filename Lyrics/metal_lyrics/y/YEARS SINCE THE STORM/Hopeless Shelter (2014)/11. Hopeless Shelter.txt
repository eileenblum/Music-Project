I've been drowning in this darkness for far too long. I've been pulled down to the lowest of the lows. I've lost all hope, but I don't wanna die slow. I'm ready to leave this hellhole now. Everything Iâve seen has sucked the life out of me. I am ready to set myself free.
All alone, I turn to STONE and ERODE. I no longer have anything to live for. I know I'll simply rot in the ground when I die, and that's fine. Anything is better than this life. This hatred that I hold inside me, it drives me insane, please take it away. All my misery,
all these feelings of dread, they helped create this prison cell thatâs inside my head. ((Born and raised to think we're free, but we've been trapped, trapped inside our heads. These tainted sanctuaries, where our minds are the streets, and these streets are a dangerous
place to tread.)) This life is a NIGHTMARE that I canât wake up from, so I lay myself down to an endless sleep. You might say that it's a cowardâs way out, but I can't go on with a future so fucking bleak. This hatred that I hold inside me, it drives me insane, please
take it away. All my misery, all these feelings of dread, they helped create this prison cell thatâs inside my head. ((Born and raised to think we're free, but we've been trapped, trapped inside our heads. These tainted sanctuaries, where our minds are the streets, and
these streets are a dangerous place to tread.)) THERE IS NO LOVE, ONLY HATRED, IN THIS HOPELESS SHELTER IâVE CREATED.
