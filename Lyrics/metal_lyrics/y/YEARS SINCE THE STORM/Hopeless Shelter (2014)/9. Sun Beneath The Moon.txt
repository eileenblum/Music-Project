Something's not right, can't put your mind at rest. Uncomfortable emptiness. That sinking feeling inside your chest. I'm right over your shoulder, lingering around every corner. Waiting, watching, wondering who is next. You can't run from me. You can't hide don't try.
You can't run from me. RUN, RUN, RUNâ¦ But I will find you and I will tear you apart. I AM DEATH, I am the ultimate. Rest assured that there is nothing beyond this. No matter who, no matter how, you all will end up where you belong; under the ground. Most cannot handle
it. The thought, the fear, the threat. The idea of only one last breath. My hands embrace your throat; you begin to let go. Left with only my cold caress. Fading in and out, you try to scream and shout, but words they won't come out. SHOUT, SHOUT, SHOUTâ¦ But I'm not
listening. No, I'm not listening. I am death, I AM THE ULTIMATE. Rest assured that there is nothing beyond this. No matter who, no matter how, you all will end up where you belong; under the ground. I am the constant, the inevitable. A pattern that repeats over and overâ¦
