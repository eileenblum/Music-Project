I know the pain isn't real, but I'm way too, way too scarred to heal. And thereâs a fire burning at my heels, but I'm way too, way too fucking cold to feel. TOO COLD TO FEEL! Fearing this feeling of instability. Something wicked is growing inside of me. Trying my best to
avoid a catastrophe. Demons in my head, but I wonât go willingly. And I can feel my heartbeat racing. My veins are about to burst. I look in the mirror to see my own worst enemy. MY ENEMY IS ME! Sometimes I feel like a broken man. There are times when I'm not sure how
much more I can stand. All my childhood left alone, an exiled mind is all I know. Donât try to take me, donât try to change me. I feel a darkness growing every day. Donât try to bend me, donât try to break me. I'm already broken. Always finding new ways to destroy
myself. It's the only thing I know, I have nothing else. I canât feel anything anymore. My reality is far from yours. Bleeding distress, my thoughts are my temptress. I don't give a shit if the thoughts I think are logical. I just wanna lose my fucking mind, âcause I'm
broken inside. Iâm a stranger to myself and youâre all strangers to me. Donât try to take me, donât try to change me. I feel a darkness growing every day. Donât try to bend me, donât try to break me. I'm already broken. I DONâT HAVE TO SLEEP WITH THE DEVIL TO WAKE UP IN
HELL. I know the pain isn't real, but I'm way too, way too scarred to heal. And thereâs a fire burning at my heels, but I'm way too fucking cold to feel!
