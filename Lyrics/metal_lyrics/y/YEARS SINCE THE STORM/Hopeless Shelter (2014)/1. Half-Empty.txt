GET UP, GET UP! Drowning in my darkness, Iâve been tried, Iâve been tested, and Iâm being pulled down. WAKE UP, WAKE UP! The more I see, the more Iâm sick; and the more we seem so pathetic. LOSE HOPE, DIE SLOW! Never reach towards anything just let go. âCause if you
always try, then youâll always know, that life will let you down; so stay cynical. Lost in my mind with nowhere to hide. I donât want to lose my faith in humanity, but I canât help it I just hate what I see. Never finding silver linings in these black clouds that hang
over my head, while Iâm hanging from a thread. GIVE UP, GIVE UP! Iâm losing all of my hope. Itâs getting harder to breathe. They tell me Iâm a FUCK UP, FUCK UP, but every single one of you are just like me. Why canât you see? Pitiful, a species so despicable. Making life
unlivable. Polluting the earth with our stupidity. What we've become, yeah it makes me sick. This is our reality. REALITY! Iâve been living a lie, waiting to die. Exile myself until I meet my demise. Ashamed that it took this long to realize; the truth in our existence
has been right before my very eyes. Iâm not unconventional, nothing more than typical. Realize Iâm not shit, while youâre all thinking youâre formidable. Everyoneâs a hypocrite, everyone is full of shit. Robotic and psychotic so much more than we all want to admit. I
donât want to lose my faith in humanity, but I canât help it I just hate what I see. Never finding silver linings in these black clouds that hang over my head, while Iâm hanging from a thread. This world is dead.
