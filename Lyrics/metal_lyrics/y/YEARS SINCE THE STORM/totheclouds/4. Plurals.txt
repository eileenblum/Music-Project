Think! Before you say what is on your mind. Your credentials are lost, your
views are blind. So THINK! Youâd be making a big mistake. How could you beâ¦ how
could you be so BLIND! How could you be so BLINDED! Youâre shit-eating grin
will defend you no more. So Think! Before you say what is on your mind. Your
credentials are lost, your views are blind. So THINK! Youâd be making a big
mistake. How could you beâ¦ how could you be so BLIND! How could you live with
yourself. Youâre a fraud and youâve been found out. Youâre a fraud and youâve
been found out. Youâre eyes hide lies, and weâve figured you out. Youâve got a
handful of sand, and its all spilling out. Youâre a fraud! Youâre a fraud! And

seeking out your pray. So hereâs to you. Hereâs to self-titled debut albums,
Doing everything that you think is âhipâ, and hereâs to molding to every trend,
meaningless songs with monotonous riffs. Youâre a fraud! Youâre a fraud! YOUâRE
A FRAUD! Youâre a fraud and you reek of deception. Speaking in one word plurals
and contradictions. [plurals and contradictions]
