The journey to the clouds begins now! Its time that I ascend from the darkness.
You are ordinary. You wont get my sympathy. Call me vain, call me selfish, call
me arrogant. But I have come to find thatâ¦ YOUâRE INSIGNIFICANT!!! And you will
never get my sympathy. Cause life is beautiful!! You treat it like a curse.
Though life is beautiful. But so much ugliness surrounds me. Built up rage and
negativity. Searching for some piece of mind. A novelty thatâs so hard to find.
Weâre building an army to bring you back down to earth. Is there anybody with
us? Youâre life is not as important, as you make it out to be. Weâre building
an army to bring you back down to earth. Is there anybody with us? Cause so
much ugliness surrounds me. Built up rage and negativity. Searching for some
piece of mind. A novelty thatâs so hard to find. So much ugliness surrounds me.
Times like these can go on forever. I wont let this go on forever. So much
ugliness surrounds me. Times like these can go on forever. I wont let this go
on forever. Your timeâ¦ your time is up. You are a blister to this world. And
Iâm taking names! Too much ugliness surrounds me. A world full of negativity. I
will one day find some piece of mind. This novelty thatâs so fucking hard to
find! So this time is calling you out. You spread your words like a train
thatâs off its tracks. I remember every single name and face. And Iâm not here
to make peace with anyone! Your Time is up! Weâre building an army to bring you
back down to earth. The journey to the clouds begins now! Its time that I
ascend from the darkness. You are ordinary. You wont get my sympathy. Call me
vain, call me selfish, call me arrogant. But I have come to find thatâ¦ YOUâRE
INSIGNIFICANT!!!
