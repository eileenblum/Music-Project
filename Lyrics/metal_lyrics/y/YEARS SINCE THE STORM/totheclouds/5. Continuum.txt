a fear of regret eats a hole deep inside of me. The torment of failure gives me
chills at night and makes it hard to breathe. But, in my dreams Iâve found a
way to hide. From the horrible thoughts that keep me up at night. A place where
wrong is right and failureâs undefined. Please donât take me away from here.
This is a place thatâs free of harsh decisions. Iâve once again chosen to leave
my life behind. In here I can live how I desire. In my dreams I know I control
everything! But, as I wake up from this dream,  Iâm reminded of the ugliness
that surrounds me. I think Iâll just go back to sleep. Because my dreams are
the only place where I can feel peace. Am I awake or am I still dreaming? iâm
growing nervous itâs getting hard to tell. Would I miss this life if thereâs no
turning back? Could I even turn back if I wanted to?! But, in my dreams Iâve
found a way to hide. From the horrible thoughts that keep me up at night. A
place where wrong is right and failureâs undefined. My decision is final, Iâm
never coming back! Iâve made a terrible mistake. Iâm trapped in a dream and I
need to get out. How did this happen? I now know that life is worth living. Not
just in itâs beauty, itâs the pain, sorrow, and the heartbreaks that make me
who I am. And makes me feel aliveâ¦ if thereâs anyone that can hear me. Anyone
at all. I have made a mistake, and Iâm not sure if there is any coming back
from this now. Now I see that it would be impossible. For any kind of dream or
fantasy. To even come close to the brilliance of simply being alive. This is MY
future on that line. This is MY destiny. No one can tell me whatâs right for
me. Only I can decide. I can see life with such clarity now, and it all makes
sense. I just hope that thereâs a way out of here. Is there anyone out there?
Can you hear me? I am stuck in a dream, and I need to get out. Iâm at the top
of my lungs! Can you hear me now?!
