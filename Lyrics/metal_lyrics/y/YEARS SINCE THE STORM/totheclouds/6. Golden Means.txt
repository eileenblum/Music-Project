I will chose my own destiny! Iâve traveled from the inside out. I was gone, now
Iâm back, and Iâve figured it out. I may be vain, may be selfish, may be
arrogant. but without a doubt, I will live for myself! What ridiculous puppets
we are. What a strange stage we dance on. Dancing, fucking, not a care in the
world. But I wouldnât have it any other way. So keep sitting there counting
your days. Because its time we start making them count. And stop running away
from all your fears. We all fear what we donât understand! Why live your life
preparing for death? It seems to be plain to see this is good as it gets. This
is a one-time opportunity. And nothing worth fight for is ever easy. What
ridiculous puppets we are. What a strange stage we dance on. Dancing, fucking,
not a care in the world. But I wouldnât have it any other way. So stop  sitting
there counting your days. Because its time we start making them count. And stop
running away from all your fears. We all fear what we donât understand! Our
lives are open books, in a world of endless opportunity. And to fill the pages
with are hopes and dreams is not a job. But itâs whatâs meant to be. What
ridiculous puppets we are. What a strange stage we dance on. Dancing, fucking,
not a care in the world. But I wouldnât have it any other way. So stop  sitting
there counting your days. Because its time we start making them count. And stop
running away from all your fears. We all fear what we donât understand! So when
you start to think all hope is lost. Say to the world. âI will chose my own
destiny.â Even in times when all is lost. We will let them knowâ¦ THAT WE WILL
NEVER QUIT! We will never quit. I will chose my own destiny. I will not fear
what I do not understand! Will you chose your own destiny?! I will chose my own
destiny. I will not fear what I do not understand.
