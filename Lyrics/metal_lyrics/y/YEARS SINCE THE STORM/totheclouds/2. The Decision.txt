standing at the crossroads. The hour grows late. I have tasted the road less
traveled. So this is the path I will take. And this is the decision that I have
made! This world is too beautiful to be left unseen! With a life too short and
a chance too slim. To be anything but greatful. I have chosen to be the pen.
Iâll lay my life down as parchment. My future will not come from someone elseâs
pocket. Life is way too short to indulge in such guilty pleasures. This is a
time for drastic measures. Id rather live with my mistakes, than live a life
with regrets. One life is all we got! You never know the worth of water till
the well is dry. I was brainwashed before. But, now my eyes are opened wide.
This is everything Iâve worked for. I wanted nothing handed to me! I will leave
no stone unturned, and no thoughts unspoken. Iâve got my priorities
straightened out. This is the life Iâve chosen. And Iâm willing to risk it all.
I will not feel guilty for the life I chosen. Iâm willing to risk it all. I
will not feel guilty. I will not feel guilty. I will not feel guilty. I will
not feelâ¦
