Solely watching life passing by
Stranded helpless at withering sky
Straying through these mazes bleak
With no other place to seek

Not far from here
Can you hear my dear
How the moon sings your croon
Through the night in your sight
and the stains on the wall
As you wait for the call
From outside demonworld
In their eyes only gloom

When the feathers of your wings have burned
In solemn slumber to which you've turned
Blackbirds sings a tune of daze
Hollow silence follows these days

And stars are raping your cold eyeholes
When tors of old fall down and crumble
To the seas of black utter helpless grief
Await me, please don't die now
It ain't no time for you,
Undying
