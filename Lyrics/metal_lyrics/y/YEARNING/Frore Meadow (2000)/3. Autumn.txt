Desolate October grief
Falls heavy like boulders of decay
Upon crestfallen life which soon
Is to be gone

And as the days go by
All living seems to die
Quiet they stand upon the shore
The shore of no hope

Gone - with freezing rain
Gone - with deadly pain
Gone - as it was all the same
Gone - spell grim reapers name
