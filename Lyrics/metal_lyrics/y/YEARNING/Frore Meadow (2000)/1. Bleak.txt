Walking out of nowhere
Still no place to go out of life
Shadows haunt the evening
Through all quiet skies
Where I am nowhere is to?

Fragmented icon, declined spectre
Sleetstorm flags inert dam
Deeper to the absent stare
Crippled by present maze
All around you
Numb cold walls

In grey they didn't see the way
Through haze my bleak
Perception in grey
Life scattered to the rain
Gracelorn one couldn't bare this
