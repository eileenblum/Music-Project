I'm alone with you tonight
I can't find my way out of here
The memories we've never left behind
Will come alive this broken night

Through the days where empty quiet rain will pass away
Fading to gray
Wreathe yourself to pale and lifeless bliss
And all will soon be done for nameless grave
I can't see your face here at all
Who are you?

The colonies of useless lives go by
Pleased with their own way to die
Hope is dim and vague in here
Can't even wait the forthcoming with fear
