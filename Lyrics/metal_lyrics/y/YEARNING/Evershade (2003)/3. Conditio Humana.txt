There's no words
Just quiet world around that disappears with me
Without sense
The flock of ruin swarms everywhere
With only hollow emptiness inside

You try to speak to me
But words escape to the unknown lands
We're trying desperately to reach each others
But the spaces remain unchanged

Night prevails the sleeping world
While tomorrows become yesterdays on and on
Colours fade from your dying face
And I'll promise to be there for you
When you're gone from here

You try to speak to me
But words escape to the unknown lands
We're losing finally our last hope for living
And at last the pain will cease
