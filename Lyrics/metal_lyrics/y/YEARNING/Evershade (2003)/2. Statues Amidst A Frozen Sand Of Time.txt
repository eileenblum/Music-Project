Through the eyes of suffering
They've seen it all - the frames of being here
When time draws near and everything is closing
Life has remained the same as it used to be

Shadows are falling onto the plains that always were
Now and then weeping and bleeding again
Towards the nightfall walking in rain that never ends
The hours keep crawlings until the end

Through the eyes of suffering
they watch the end of life now coming
Its icy claws flicker in the dark
When life is through they're coming for you
