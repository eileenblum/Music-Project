The wind blows through a broken window
Bringing the leaves of autumn inside
As I'm sitting here trying to catch a thought
And try somehow not to cry

It should be easy to start
But day after day it's getting harder
The walls are cracking and it's cold in here
Water comes through the ceiling
But I don't mind

Past are the days when the rays of sun still
Shone to this place forlorn
And this share memory is really painfull enough
To wish they'd never have been

And I'm riding high to freezing atmosphere
Above the lonely clouds
And I will never return
Never coming back for I'm no more

Like brothers we walked the miles through
Unholy land of alienation
Until the dew settled down in the forest
We saw the faces of the dead

I'd never seen what's wrong with me inside
Until I saw the light and knew it was not for me
