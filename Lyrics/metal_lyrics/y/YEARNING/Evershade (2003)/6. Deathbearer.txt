Plae lights are fading for final times in my eyes
For soon I realize I may never awake again
Shapeless figures crying for the dawn
' Cause a cloack of the night has drawn
To make it seem like there's deadends in every way
And the absence of a light of day
Makes the world of a screaming creatures ruin
For a day and night are alike

I saw you there wandering in the fields your final journey
And now when everything just had to go this way
And you're not here with us anymore
I do not know what I should say or do to make it now undone
I just could not know it would remain a last sight
Of you alive

Embrace the endless sleep and let your nightmares go away
When gloom spreads its wings
There won't be another day

I bear it everyday for memories will remain
Struggles within our sight until the coming night
