Heavenly streams I reach
My wings are open
This blissful sea is here for me

In releasing skies the sun is awoken
I can hear them now
They are calling me
Away...

As dusky velvet veil
Winds around the landscape
I close the timeless gate
Charmed by the dark embrace of yours
My way...
As a voice in the night I shall reign
