Vines climb up on your side
To garnish a stonewalls around
And I stand on barren field
My eyes in delusion waving to me

Balcony where you watch brook to follow
You cannot see the death this early morning
And I have walked far away
Someday we will meet each others crying

The miles cannot heal the wounds in my soul
Your smile tears my forlorn heart
I cannot find my life

"There has been a time to forget, but you will always come
back to me and then I realize again that I can
never reach my happiness..."
I cannot feel
"...There is only the pain for not been able to forget."
