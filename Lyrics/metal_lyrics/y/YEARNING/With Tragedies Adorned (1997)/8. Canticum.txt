Ride to the silent shores and fly through the gardens of time
You will find your heaven
Your god had closed his eyes
Alone, free you are

View, immortalized by the crave for what
There is beyond the fields of gloom
Far from the useless lives of those empty slaves

There is no place for your life to go on
Who told you ignorance would be better?

"I wandered to eternity,
through the woods where dew
was still shining in the trees after the rain
and sight from the highest hill opened before my eyes,
taking my soul to its own"

Way out from thousand lies opens before your eyes
The end of path you go is always out of reach
Death is your plea

"shall I come to your dreams as you're asleep?"

Come to me and show me your godly wounds
Cry for me crushed tomorrow
Can you make me born again
And never to grow in shade of sorrow?
No
