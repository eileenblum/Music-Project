All wasted moments breed
This nameless grown in me
I crawl in the cold through a tired dream
And seek for self that holds all strings in me
No way out for me

Time will pass and I will forget all as soon
As it happened
Blindly I walk through hazy way I think is mine
Though I have lost my life to the evil shade of mine
