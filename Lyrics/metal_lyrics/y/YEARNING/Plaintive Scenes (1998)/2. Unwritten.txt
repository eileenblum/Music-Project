Hark!
Whence chant of thine
Starlit frames
Tunes witheld the same
That oceans strive
Through this time
Falling for our dying grace
Fading sunset paints a woodlands face

As weather bleak as ever
Shows its form to be mine

As darkness falls

Through the never
And wherever light may follow
It's still hollow

Grey

Void lies still in the morning
Grey is face of each day
Evening stares to you frozen
Night will kill you one more time

Every moment you are closer to the end

Curtains stay shut forever
Some have said it is like pain
Colours fade and their meaning
Is like life itself

No reason to think or do anything
You are closer to the end every moment

See your blood flowing free from your heart
Forming beautiful pond
And you smile for last time
