Leave me now, I will rest forever
Below this frozen earth
All that's left are memories

Loose your hand from mine, so pale and cold
Turn away, spare yourself from sorrow

There beyond the stars I wonder
Where meadows spread out vastly, endlessly
And the pain is gone forever
Those who sing me to sleep come from eldest stream

Silent shrine with my deliverance
Left alone to grieve with thee
Twilight besieges your collapsing universe
Which long ago was doomed to vanish
