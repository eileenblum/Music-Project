Plaintive scenes awake in moments care
Still, unlike our time that leaves the one who dare
To go again back there to time that never was
Motionless stone with non-existant eyes:

Sees the sky in red
The kingdom of the end
Engraved its soulles name
To relics, future shreds

Plaintive scenes surround the hearses ride
Through a mourning veil the one could see
The side of concealed joy in death
When pain is far to real
For just once we will see the end of time
Soliloquy II

All wasted moments breed
This nameless grown in me
I crawl in the cold through a tired dream
And seek for self that holds all strings in me
No way out for me

Time will pass and I will forget all as soon
As it happened
Blindly I walk through hazy way I think is mine
Though I have lost my life to the evil shade of mine
