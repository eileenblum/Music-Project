When the dawn of dying cries through the shrines of aeon
Everlasting foul disguise mocked by contrasts disunion
Sudden silence, irresolution appears
All alone passing life
Through forever, tribulation is gone
Your weakened essence has gone out
When the dawn of dying cries through the shrines of aeon
Nothing last forevermore, but the reapers might
Sudden silence, now the darkness appears
All alone passing life
You have fled away much too far
Now it's too late to go on
There is no heaven in the dark
Nor a hell except the one you've lost
Mourning hearts without consolation
We've all failed in cheating existence's fate
