Lost again inside a dream
Not understanding me
Fog descends into my brain
I'm falling deeper now
Walking on alone through the grey
Shattered view escapes my sight
Contemplate just for awhile
I know I'm dying now
Slowly merging into landscapes of concrete and frost
Reaching out for existence inside the sickening sphere
Human experience fading, uniting to nothingness
Inside the nightmareworld, Relentless unfading hell
You may try to drift anywhere outside this world
Torrid flow inside your mind subsides
Connections fade...
