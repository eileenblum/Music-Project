I have been dead all my life
and now I know I will never live again
Empty streets follow my way on the road
This dead end that leads to nowhere
I have been dead all my life
and now I am waiting for the second death
Near the end I wished at last to feel alive
But sensation never came
I know the way how to end it all
I know the way
I'm not of kin to human filth
But mirror never lies I must admit
Decline and fall of human kind
Is all I see, all I can find
So fucking many ways to die
Instead of being dead alive
The demons of my consciousness
Lull me to sleep in hollow darkness
