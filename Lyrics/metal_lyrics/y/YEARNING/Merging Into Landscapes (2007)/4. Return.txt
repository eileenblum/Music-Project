On the balcony where you were thought to be
Years ago I carried my burden
Now these times are gone and the things have changed
I have seen the uttermost horrors
On the balcony where you were thought to be
Now I've seen how world keeps turning
Yes, those times are gone and the things have changed
For better or worse - I could ask anyone
Now I'm returning to home of my yearning
Songs I have sung remain this day
Now I'm returning - not anymore feeling longing for you
For I've found my way
