Your future looms in gloom
Wretched examinate bloom of utter deep decay
Yet another day slips into another night
Where you cannot fight against illusion's tide  amidst the ceaseless ride
Constructions whirl and turn
and every bridge you burn becomes an empty space
filled with frozen haze
Speak to me no more, I know your rotten core
We're all alone and die
Reaching for the sky
Your splitted tongue and foolish ways
scream your pathetic being
I'll remain while you're gone
and still you're not seeing
