The life has fled from your face
This immaculate place where you were laid to rest, all alone
The night is blooming full of emotions storm
Now I'm here for you eternally
You never saw how I felt and maybe nor did I
When you were alive in this pathetic life
October rain washes away all the tears and pain
and you're with me in my embrace eternally
I kiss your naked face, something I couldn't do
while we were lost in life's cruel disguise
The world should praise your looks
I have opened my eyes to see the real you now
Beautiful..
They say I'm sick,but this darkness is only apparent
I've learnt to see the beauty
When I'm lost in the night and look into your eyes
I praise the reapers blessing hand
