Divest the excess
The apex wanes
The pinnacle of our effort
Bled dry on display
The scales tip with masses of shame, culpable

Magnify exponential
Sentience unearthed
Run the futile course
Rules of nature shatter in growth

Colliding lifetimes blinded and fused
Guilt echoes still sound
Rapid vibrations punish cochlea in vile waves, shielded by enmity

Stone silence begs pity
Stagnant methane ripens the air we need
Noxious head swells from what we breathe
Depth of impact
This terror implant
Dream state guide this quaking hand
Stagnant methane ripens the air we need

Steaming earth friction pour from stress cracks
Dream state revive the loss
Embolden binding visions
Led to ache in vile waves
Catatonia
