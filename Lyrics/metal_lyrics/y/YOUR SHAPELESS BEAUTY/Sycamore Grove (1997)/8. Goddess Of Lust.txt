[music: Abate, lyrics: Blachier]

entombed in a city only known
by the ones who once loved
you lie for eternity but you haunt
the dreams of those doomed

in your necropolis you rule
the hearts of your servants
you're filling your chalice with the love
and blood of those who kneel down to you

my beloved you are here
spreading your wings like a bird of prey
my beloved you are here
waiting in the shadow the end of the day

goddess of lust, you're my goddess of lust
a vampiric soul for an age of doom
in your breast of fire are hidden
all the treasures you stole from men
(beneath the azuream ring you rule supreme)

a beautiful whore
this is what you are
my goddess of lust

lie

beyond the edge of night
as a silent wind you cross the fence of human desires
the night bird of a dark nature
repelling the spell that gods cast on you

you're still flying through
my demonic witch
my beloved queen of night
queen of night

among the vanished souls
that you once devoured
you roam to me

and you smile at my sight

and I die at your sigh

whispers that surround me
your wings are my coffin

secrets unveiled, secrets unveiled
secrets unveiled, I pledge to your poetry

take me in your arms and drown me
in the neverending sea of your eyes
I sink in my destiny, my destiny
