[music: Cozzi, lyrics: Blachier]

it rains in my soul someday
it rains on my soul
it rains

I feel the shadows overwhelming me
from the bottomless pit of sunken dreams
tearing my tormented soul apart
they call me from beyond...

beyond the horizon...
beyond their reason

twisted minds for perverse tastes
a lust consumed by a neverending fire
burn my son, light their path, behold their weakness
why am I denied

by your own hand
why have I to stand against this world of pain

drape me in this velvet veil, a rose on my skin
the thorns spread my bloody fear...sin

oh, pulsating beat of my inner storm, I hear the cries of thousand 
frightened
funeral crows that haunt human deepest deviances
seeking a truth for I canât see reality, I search for a long time disappeard
heavenly ground where I could stalk, majestic...

embrace of the new Aeon
is like the weight of my crown
the whip to lash your faith
for Iâll soon be the conqueror of this dying world

I will unleash my wrath (oh black rain)
pour yourself into me

and I still long for a new day
trying to know how to keep me sane
withering like teardrops in the ocean
withering like flowers in the dust...

the sands of time over my shoulders (oh black rain)
show me the way...

feel the bitter tears falling into drops of wine
I reborn under the wings of the black rain
