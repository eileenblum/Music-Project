[Music &amp; lyrics : Abate, Blachier, Canavaggia, Cozzi, Lavail]

I have no sympathy for humanity
I dream of my end.................In this world of pain.
I bet there's no future, I know there's no true,
I wait for the silence finally to come through.
I am egocentric, I am as useless
As a needle .........................in the arm of Death
Withstand my wrath
But unveiled I am
For the ones who seek behind the painting.
That we all drawn from our darkest sins...
My colours are fading ............All appears so bleak.
Twisting the knife slowly and cutting my flesh,
There is no redemption, there is no regrets !
No fucking models, no bloody reasons
Nothing is done, nothing is said
We are meant to be wasted...
All is withering and dying, we are so futile and so blind
Contempt is flowing in my veins, can't you even drown in my eyes?
I'll pay the price to kill that plague,
Ignorance is still source of denying.
The path we are striding on
Is made of the attempts of former slaves
To believed in existence.
But we are all condemned to remain silent,
Contempt!
Is the key for the for the tyrants to lock our door,
The door to reality...we are too blind to see!
Once denied and still rejected,
You hate the ones who dare
To raise against your corruption
And break the chains of despair.....
But I am the kind of fool you can only fear!!
I swear I'll never bow to you
A lord of flies, a shadow, a lie !
And now I know that I was true
As I hold you all in contempt.
