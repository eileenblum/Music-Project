[Music &amp; lyrics : Abate, Blachier, Canavaggia, Cozzi, Lavail]

I've never asked
To live this life of pain and suffering
I've never asked
To be part of this game.
My soul is tired
Of all the wars that are raging inside of it,
And I have no more choice
But to see the depths of my void...
Even if I breathe
The same air as everyone,
I know I am not
The kind that you'll try to understand!
Living in a dreamland is not my aim,
My eyes are open wide on my fate.
From the day I was born
I feel I am wrong,
But have I to die to fit in such a lie...?
My self Am hell,
They play with existence,
Generations made to obey,
I don't want to be this way...
To fulfill my few desires,
And to find a meaning to that,
I have no other solution
But to end the game...
I dream about days...
But I live in the night...
The dark side of life
Is only a game for the children
Who want to play evil
But that are nothing but clowns!
I understand clearly
That there is no other way for me
But to sink in my own tragedy
And to bear my cross in silence... I am already dead.
