[Music &amp; lyrics : Abate, Blachier, Canavaggia, Cozzi, Lavail]

When the light is in your back
And the eve in your eyes
Do you feel the breath of anguish?
Will you ever know
The fear to awake?
Will you face the truth?
I will...but it ain't a victory
Every night is a never ending book
Unread by many,
Written by all,
But once you stare at it,
Addiction to this doleful experience is a bargain
Without the sun, there is nothing
As I know it so well,
Then I can't be no more,
For I live out of the sun...
But if only...
Shadows are so close,
Even if I hate them
Now it is time to make a step further
Life is not on my side
But I will never surrender
I believe in this sun,
I believed in this life
I won't
The circles in the Circle,
Don't you know legions of pain
Always march on your light,
I am not the bringer of darkness
I am not the king of fools,
Just the river that streams through the ethereal landscapes of my own loss
And that carries the fallen leaves of your dying trees
The cycles in the Cycle,
Don't you know oblivion never forgets you...
Don't you know
To die in a sigh,
To live in a lie,
It is the same
The sound of the busy bees in my glass,
Reveals to me my destiny and its pleasure in agony
