Eternal night, internal fight a struggle
Within never ceasing,
Enter my world, the secret landscapes I rule,
The land of the dancing shadows...

God the enchanter,
A soul devourer
Seen holy only by the blinds,
But she is no more,
Thy will be done
From this chaos I rise
Enthroned god of bloody tears...

Day by day your image fades,
And your face as an icon
Will be the key to my kingdom,

As a new born child I cry out with pain
The thorns of my crown carve my wounds so deeply
And I dance on your grave,
But they shall old no barriers between you&amp; I...

God the enchanter,
A soul devourer
Seen holy only by the blinds,
But she is no more,
Thy will be done
From this chaos I rise
Enthroned god of bloody tears...

Our pale embrace survives beyond dawn,
Like two stars in the early morning haze,
Although not visible to common eyes

We are IMMORTAL...
An endless HEARTBEAT...

Now I'm dead but yet my life has just begun,
On this winter's day my prison of flesh,
Become palatable for worms,

On this winter's day... I rest in peace,

Eternal night, internal fight a struggle
Within never ceasing,
Enter my world, the secret landscapes I rule,
The land of the dancing shadows... SHADOWS

God the enchanter,
A soul devourer
Seen holy only by the blinds,
But she is no more,
Thy will be done
From this chaos I rise
Enthroned god of bloody tears...

Day by day your image fades,
And your face as an icon
Will be the key to my kingdom,

On this winter's day... I rest in peace
