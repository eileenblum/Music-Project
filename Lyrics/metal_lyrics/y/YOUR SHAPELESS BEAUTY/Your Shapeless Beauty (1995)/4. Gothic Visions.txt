As time passes above the men
I'm still here under my black veil
Unseen, unknown but feared by all
Wandering through eternity... eternity
As time passes above men
My scythe falls ever...
My scythe falls ever... ever
Making all my puppets dance
I see through the veil
What you can't even understand
Gothic visions sublime image as time
Black wisdom is my pain
All I see is tour misery
Just a velvet kiss from death
And you'll be... free
My name is carried by the winds
Riding the stream of your nightmares
My heart is only your grave
Feel the velvet kiss from death
