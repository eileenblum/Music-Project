Under the dark sky of clouds
Amongst the ancient trees of eternity
I behold you, wrapped in the mist
I can't see you dead at least...
I'm calling your name through the stone of the tomb
I want to cut my veins, to die and join you soon
On her black wings, death took you
Now you walk on the cold marble, cold as ice
I want to die, let me die
And I hear the whispering
Your name through the readows of darkness
In the temple of fire
Beyond my dreams, your shapeless beauty...
I call the spirits of thousand dead
To help me to find my path
In the realm of blackness...
I see your eyes
Abigail, Maggots your friends
But still I see, your shapeless beauty...
I want to die, let me die
I crave for you
Now I die
I'm wish you
In your eyes...
