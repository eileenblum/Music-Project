My spirit wanders in the darkness
For ever I will worship her
Free from all times
Alone with my lost soul, ... my lost soul
Roaming like the majestic swan of my dreams
Lurking at the threshold of all minds
From all lives I was and from all wars I'll be
Son of the moon
I am my own god,... my own god
Ethereal landscapes of the night are my kingdom
No love allowed to enter my world
Sorrow,.. I am a tear of the moon
I shall stay an ever blowing wind
For ever I will cry, the night,.. my bride
Darkness my bride, a wild heart of the unlight
I shall bleed for thee, for death is my lust
Darkness my bride...
