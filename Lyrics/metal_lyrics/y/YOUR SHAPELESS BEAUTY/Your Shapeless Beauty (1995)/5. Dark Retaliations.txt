Once upon the cross
When mankind was lost
A human rised and stood against god
He gave light to men
He brought them the flame
To see the lies through the darkness
Oh lord
Throne of blood
Creator of lost souls
Ignorance fades away
They found their own way
Delivered from the dictatorship
Seeing his defeat
Lost of benefits
The altar needs a sacrifice
God of none and all
Fake bloody idol
Crucified the new messiah
Prometheus his name
The innocent condemned
By fear of god to loose his ship
