Living a life of dishonour
Hoping in vain to touch happiness
Day after day I've built a world of lies
The dreams were my aim
The stream in my veins
What is to live in a world
That doesn't need you...
And the pain tore my veins
I close my eyes on the sunset
No more suffer no more deceptions
Life is nothing but damnation
As the bloody spilled on my naked skin
I feel my body ready to leave this earth
This is my long awaited rebirth
And I die, I die alone
No one to cry for me
No tears to regrets me
The bereavement of a nameless body
This is what I see... damnation
Oh blackness embrace me
My goddess take me
Black is my destiny
But darker is yours
I face alone this immortal throne
Now I hear them, they're guiding me
The necrowinds are welcoming me
Listen to them and you'll know
What's hidden beyond the dawn
Draped in black thus I appear
I drink the blood of your throat
Not a demon, not a vampire
I'm just a child of darkness...
