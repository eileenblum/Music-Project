I have got to be going
I have got to keep on
I know that I'm dying
I know I will be gone
Now the light is going away
I fear it's not gonna stay

The steel that is pushing
My heart like a knife
Will soon do it's work now
To burn out my life
Do you know I will fight you!
Do you know I despise you!

Dying Man!

Now the forces are sharing
The remains of my soul
This was the last journey
Definitely the end
Do you know I will fight you!
Do you know I despise you!

Dying man!
