Climb up the mountain
That reaches to the sky
When you're trespassing the surroundings
Then you will die!

There is the castle
I can see it through the fog
And in there dwells the wizard
Who can fight evil and the dark

Climb up the mountain
That reaches the sky
When you're trespassing the surroundings
Then you will die!

There is the castle
I can see it through the fog
And in there dwells the wizard
Who can fight evil and the dark
