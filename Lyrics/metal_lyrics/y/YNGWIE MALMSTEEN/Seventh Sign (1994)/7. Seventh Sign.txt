The earth is crumbling, the end is near
no one's listening, I'm filled with fear
hear the warning, in the prophet's word
day by day, we're destroying this world
no more water
no more blue skies
no one cares, no one tries
to save what we once had
world at war (a world at war)
rich and poor (rich and poor)
burn in hell (burn in hell)
hear dooms days bells (dooms days bells)
ringing loud (ringing loud)
I see black clouds
we are making lucifer so proud
world at war (a world at war)
rich and poor (rich and poor)
burn in hell (burn in hell)
hear dooms days bells (dooms days bells)
ringing loud (ringing loud)
I see black clouds
we are making lucifer so proud
blind leading the blind
no one sees the seventh sign
we're left behind
there's no more hope, the day has come
what we have done, can't be undone
too many years, we've lived in sin
we know for sure, the beast will win
fight fire with fire, to start to run
don't trust a liar, like we have done
we've lost the battle to the evil one
blind leading the blind
no one sees the seventh sign
we're left behind.
