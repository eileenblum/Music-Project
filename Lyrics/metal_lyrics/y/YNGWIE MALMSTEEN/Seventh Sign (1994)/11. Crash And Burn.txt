The smoke has cleared
and I'm still standing here
my world's gone down in flames
but still i have no fear
you've lied
you told your tale
you tried
to make me fail
you took your best shot
left me to rot
through all this I'll never crash and burn
lesson learned
wearing suits
and driving shiny cars
you money hungry fools
what gives you the right to say
who gets to win, who is to lose
you've lied
you told your tale
you tried
to make me fail
you took your best shot
left me to rot
through all this I'll never crash and burn
lesson learned
you're such fools.
