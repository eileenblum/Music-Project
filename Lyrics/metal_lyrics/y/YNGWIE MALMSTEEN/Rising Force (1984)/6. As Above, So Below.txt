There's a hole in the sky
But don't ask me why
Because I don't know
There is a long way to go
Future will show
Where the road is leading me

I will never die
'Cause I will fly
To the other side

I'm trying to fight
For what is right
But evil spirits pass me by
They do what they want
They just don't care
What you feel or what you say

I will never die
'Cause I will fly
To the other side

There's a hole in the sky
But don't ask me why
Because I don't know
There is a long way to go
Future will show
Where the road is leading us

I will never die
'Cause I will fly
To the other side
