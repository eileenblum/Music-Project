[Deep Purple]

Sweet child in time 
you'll see the line

The line that's drawn between 
the good and the bad
See the blind man 
shooting at the world
Bullets flying 
taking toll
If you've been bad, 
Lord I bet you have
And you've been hit 
by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes 
and bow your head
And wait for the ricochet
