Been trying to run
Run with the Devil
But finding the sun
Burning forever

Been trying to fight
Fight fire with fire
But finding the light
Burning forever

Let sleeping dogs lie
And don't even try
To mend what has not been broken

Been trying to find
To find peace of mind
But I've been running blind
Been running forever

I've been trying fight
Fight fire with fire
But finding the light
Still burning forever
