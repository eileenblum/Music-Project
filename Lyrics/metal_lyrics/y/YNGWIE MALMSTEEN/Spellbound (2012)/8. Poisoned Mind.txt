Now at last your eyes are open
And finally you can see
It's not what you've been hoping
And freedom is not free

They say the savior is here
Here to deliver us
From all your fears

But there is no substance here
There's only hollow words
Drowning in falling tears

Well, it must be said
He had you fooled
But I say "Better dead than red!"

Now this evil man
Must disappear
From our land, from our land
