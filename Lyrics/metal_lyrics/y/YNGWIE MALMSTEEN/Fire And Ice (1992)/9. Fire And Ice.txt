Everyday is like a set up race
And the world is still a lonely place
To be or not to be is this the final quiz

A flash in the pan goodbye
Still shooting for the open sky
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
I cannot find a compromise

It's still just treason
They bring me down with their lies
Don't know the reason
My life is fire and ice

Tomorrow will be different
All you need is just come confidence
I dream of being a warrior
So far beyond

There's a voice that whispers I can fail
I believe it's just a trick of the tail
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
There is no way no compromise

It's still just treason
They bring me down with their lies
Don't know the reason
My life is fire and ice
