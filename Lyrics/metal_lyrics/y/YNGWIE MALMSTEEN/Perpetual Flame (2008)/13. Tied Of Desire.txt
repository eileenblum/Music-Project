There is no shifting
My will of steel
Just like a freight train
Pushing on through
There is no stopping
The tied of desire
Just like a fever
Perpetual fire

No stone unturned
The flame is still burning
In my quest
I will never rest

There is no wall high enough
Fr me to scale
No pit deep enough
I cannot fail
To slow down my charge
I am on fire
No distance to far
I'll touch the stars

No stone unturned
The flame is till burning
In my quest
I will never rest

Fight for your life
There is no more crying
The darkness must fall
Into the night

No stone unturned
The flame is still burning
In my quest
I will never rest
