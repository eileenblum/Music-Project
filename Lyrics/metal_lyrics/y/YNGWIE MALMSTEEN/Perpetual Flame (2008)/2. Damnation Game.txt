Damnation Game
Damnation Game
Now I won my freedom
But I had to pay the price
I keep on searching
But I never seem to find what I need
It's all just like a dream
The European I had to fight
I had no choice but it made me wiser
And now I won't fall into the night
Now you must roll the dice
Roll the dice
And meet your own demise
The European always lies
Always lies

Nobody wins
In this damnation game
No body wins
In this damnation game
I draw the card
It's the ace of spades
I always play for keeps
And I'll never ever fade away
It's the devil to pay
Patience is a virtue
But now it's wearing thin
You play the game
But you will never ever win
Your living a sin
Now you must roll the dice
Roll the dice
And meet your own demise
The European always lies
Always lies
Nobody wins
In this damnation game
Nobody wins
In this damnation game
Nobody wins
In this damnation game
Nobody wins
In this damnation game
