Burning down the avenue
Carburetor's breathing
Feel the torque push on through
Hear the tires screaming
Pedal to the metal
Drop the clutch and run
Now the tires are burning
And the racing has begun
Hear the engine roar
In this mean machine
Times standing still
And My red devil is flying
Catch me if you can
Full speed ahead
In this read brutal beauty
Four hundred horses running wild
Sayonara see you later
Now you disappear
In my rear view mirror as I am changing gear
Screaming down the boulevard
You will eat my dust
This fire breathing beauty
I will always trust
Hear the engine roar
In this mean machine
Times standing still
And My red devil is flying
Catch me if you can
Times standing still
And My red devil is flying
Catch me if you can
