I live by the sword
and never surrender
Die by the sword
and I don't give in
Now I must rise
and take the journey

Blood, sweat and tears
is what you will find
All these wasted years
in immortal sin
Angels of death
will always follow you

I must live to fight another day
I will see the light again
Now you must learn
how to burn

For eternity relentlessly
Oh, no!
The battle cries
or getting louder
Now it's time for you
to face the truth
There is no higher ground
For you to run to

Must sacrifice
Now it's all or nothing
You must lift the curse
Haunting you
Forever lost
but never found

I must live to fight another day
I will see the light again
Now you must learn
how to burn
For eternity relentlessly
Oh, no!
