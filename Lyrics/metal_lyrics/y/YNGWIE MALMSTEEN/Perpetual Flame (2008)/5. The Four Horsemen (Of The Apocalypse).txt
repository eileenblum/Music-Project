The fallen angel show the signs
He is no stranger in your eyes
He is immortal,
He is forever
From the portal his demons shall dance
Under burning skies now the four
Horsemen ride along the shore
Across the sea the beast shall rise
You will be sacrificed
Revelation tells the end of days
The never ending masquerade,
All pretending in death's charade
Under burning skies now
The four horsemen ride along the shore
Across the sea the beast shall rise
You will be sacrificed
