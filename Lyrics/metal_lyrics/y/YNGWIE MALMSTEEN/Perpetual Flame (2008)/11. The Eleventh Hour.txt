Read the signs
Upon the horizon
Your turning blind
No one can see
We're hypnotized
Seems like forever
To realize what this must be

Now eons have passed
Since the dawn of time
When our lord turned water into wine

It must be done
In the eleventh hour
To be undone
There is no time
It slips away like an illusion
Forever lost
Gone forever

Now eons have passed
Since the dawn of time
When our lord turned water into wine

No be trend just like a stranger
I lost the way in this strange land
We're hypnotized
Seems like forever
To realize what this must be

Now eons have passed
Since the dawn of time
When our lord turned water into wine
