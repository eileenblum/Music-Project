Born out of fire
evil rising
Now we must pay the price
And sacrifice
It's no grand elution
this demon dance
Eternally black
now there's no turning back

Lift the veil of mystery
and this masquerade
Lay your weapons down
surrender now or die
Die!

Priest of the unholy
Priest of the unholy
Burning with vengeance
Burning forever
There is no mercy to give
No time to live
The final curtain
Comes down at last
Repent all your sins
All of your sins

Lift the veil of mystery
and this masquerade
Lay your weapons down
surrender now or die
Die!

Priest of the unholy
Priest of the unholy
Into the darkness
Your soul must fall
Your gamble has failed
Gamble has failed
At the mountains of madness
There will be no mercy
We must pay the price
And sacrifice
Lift the veil of mystery
and this masquerade
Lay your weapons down
surrender now or die
Die!

Priest of the unholy
Priest of the unholy
