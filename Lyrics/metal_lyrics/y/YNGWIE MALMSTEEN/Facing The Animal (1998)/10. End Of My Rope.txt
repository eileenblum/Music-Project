Don't make a move
Don't amke a sound
I've got my eyes trained on you
The target is found

You waited too long
I'd rather stand on my own
Ain't no more blanks left to fill
In my list of sins
I'm at the end of my rope

The louder you speak
The less I hear
I gotta let off some steam
and driven by fear

Tell me I'm wrong
'cause this can't go on
I'd rather stand on my own
Ain't no more blanks left to fill
In my list of sins
I'm at the end of my rope

Leave me alone
This can't go on
Not anymore, no

You waited too long
Listen and soon you''l be gone
Tell me I'm wrong
'acause this can't go on
