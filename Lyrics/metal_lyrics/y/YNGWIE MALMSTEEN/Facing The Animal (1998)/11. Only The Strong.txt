Ask yourself where you're
hearding for
Deviate - no need
to conform

All it takes is some
confidence
Seize the day, it might not
come again

Only the strong will survive
Stand tall and never die
Come out from where you hide
No need you swallow your pride

Only the strong will survive
get up and reach for the sky
Don't wait for no-one and
Don't let your heart be denied

Face the truth and
control your fate
Set the pace
never hesitate

All that scares you and
makes you doubt
Break the silence, just
spit it out
