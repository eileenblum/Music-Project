[Japanese bonus track]

The seconds are ticking and time's slowly slipping away, yeah
Th stakes getting higher, fight fire with fire again

[Chorus:]
Casting pearls before the swine
I know it's wrong, it's out of line
I would rather die than follow you
Yeah, I'd rather die

Try to poison my mind, had enough of your kind
You're all blind
So little you know, 'bout my heart and my soul and my pride
Get a life!

[Chorus]

Yeah, I'd rather die
You're all blind, yeah
