I'm back to life
from the walking dead
no more demons in my head

I'm sick of uglly lies
Leave this bal and chain&lt;
as the hatred dies, so does pain

My soul is free
I've got wind beneath my wings
Yesterday's gone
My heart sings

Time to believe
In the better part of me
Tomorrow is here
Awaiting

My resurrection
My resurrection

One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make a right
I have never felt so alive
