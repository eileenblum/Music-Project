I paint a smile on you
'cause you want me to
then I unmask you
laughing in your face

If you had half a mind
I wouldn't even try
But you're so naive
just can't let you be

Make me glorious
and victorious
I'm superior

Time to pay the price
Throw off my disguise
Poison in your veins
So easily deceived
The lie that you believe
Poison in your veins

You follow my advice
and feed my appetite
WWhat you leave behind
I will claim as mine

In the end you'll see
what you're meant to be
Something obsolete
mission is complete

Call me disgrace
To the human race
I don't give a damn

Time to pay the price
Throw off my disguise
Poison in your veins
So easily deceived
The lie that you believe
Poison in your veins
