You always hypnotized.
But now I realize.
That I have been drinking with the devil.
Well, I must lift this curse.
It went from bad to worse.
My over flowing cup is filled again.

It's so hard to tell you no.
"My friend let's have another".
No!!
Why do you tempt me so?
Be gone you bottled demon.
Be gone!!

I've seen the darkness visions.
Inside my lonely prison.
You show no mercy, you're my nemesis.
Well, I'll take the consequence.
My bleeding soul will mend.
Now I have saved myself from myself.

I'm never giving in.
I'm delivered from this evil.
You'll lose and I will win.
So say my revelation.

[guitar solo]

Because you lied.
I almost died.
But I know you well.
So go back to hell
