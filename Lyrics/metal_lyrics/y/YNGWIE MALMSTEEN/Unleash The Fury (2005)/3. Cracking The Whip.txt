Well, you have always been too slow.
And you have always been too late.
You should have known oh so long ago.
That your life is at stake.

'Cause you never could keep up.
And you never read the signs.
Now you are turning dust to dust.
You are running out of time.

Cracking the whip.
It's a new kind of pain.
Cracking the whip.
Don't try in vain.

Well, you were always in despair.
And it seems like you were born to lose.
Now you are dying but no one cares.
You're just a cannon on the loose.

Look's like you missed the boat.
And you didn't catch that train.
Now you're crying and trying, in vain.
You just can't take the pain.

Cracking the whip.
It's a new kind of pain.
Cracking the whip.
Don't try in vain.

Cracking the whip.
It's a new kind of pain.
Cracking the whip.
Don't try in vain.

[guitar solo]

Cracking the whip.
Cracking the whip.

Cracking the whip.
It's a new kind of pain.
Cracking the whip.
Don't try in vain
