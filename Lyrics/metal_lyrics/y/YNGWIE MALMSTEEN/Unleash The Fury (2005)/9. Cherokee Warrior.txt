You know what I'm talking about.
Yeah that's right.

Well, many years ago.
There was a man.
He was doing things.
That no one could seem to understand.

But those times were strained.
Some things went bad, I can't explain no.
All I know for sure is.
His spirit still remains.

Cherokee warrior.
You lost the battle, that's for sure oh no!
But what you left behind.
Let me tell you, is still shining.
Cherokee warrior.
You lost the battle, that's for sure oh no!
But what you left behind.
But what you left behind.
It's still shining.

When you came out of nowhere.
You set the world ablaze.
But you didn't belong here.
So you left us all amazed.

In our hearts your still alive.
Though you tasted all the forbidden fruit.
Now it's so hard to describe.
Why in the end you had to lose.

Cherokee warrior.
You lost the battle, that's for sure oh no!
But what you left behind.
Let me tell you, is still shining.
Cherokee warrior.
You lost the battle, that's for sure oh no!
But what you left behind.
But what you left behind.
It's still shining.

You lost the battle, that's for sure oh no!
But what you left behind.
Let me tell you, is still shining.
Cherokee warrior.
You lost the battle, that's for sure oh no!
But what you left behind.
But what you left behind.
It's still shining.

Still shining
