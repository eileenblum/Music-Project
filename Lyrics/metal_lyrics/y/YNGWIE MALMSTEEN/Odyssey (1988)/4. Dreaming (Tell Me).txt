Shades of night, fall upon my eyes
Lonely world fades away
Misty light, shadows start to rise
Lonely world fades away.
In my dreams your face is all I see
Through the night you share your love with me.
[Chorus:]
Dreaming visions of you
Feeling all the love I never knew.
Here we are on the crossroads of forever
Shining star lights the way.
Walk with me on the winds of time
Love's mystery is for us to find.
[Repeat Chorus]
Until that day, until the day I find you
I won't rest, I won't let go
Somehow some way, I know I'll be beside you
To warm my heart and fill my soul.
