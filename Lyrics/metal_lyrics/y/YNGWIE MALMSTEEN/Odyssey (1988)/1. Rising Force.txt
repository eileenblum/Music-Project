Out of the darkness the voices are calling
Riding the wings of a song
The Fury is screaming and Heaven is falling
I feel it coming on strong.
[Chorus:]
The lightning strikes cracking the night
It feels like never before
Thunder and sparks in the Heart of the Dark
I hear a Rising Force.
Searching my soul I find something else
I take my life in my hands
From the gates of Heaven to the altars of Hell
The Power is at my command.
[Chorus:]
The lightning strikes cracking the night
I'm not the same anymore
Thunder and spark in the Heart of the Dark
I feel a Rising Force.
Burned by the glory of a sacred fire
A Rising Force starts to shine
Alone in the inferno it soars ever higher
Leaving the demons behind.
[Repeat first and second Chorus]
