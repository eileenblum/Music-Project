You know I have seen the dark side
But evil is not my friend
And you know Iâll die trying
Keep on trying to the end.

You know Iâm superstitious
But the devil never pays
My victory is delicious
When you fall, fall from grace.

My holy sacrifice
Itâs time for me to rise
The demons chained me down
Itâs time to rise
Rise upâ¦

I have had my share of fighting
But I still could fight some more
Now I can see the horizon
Much better than before
What Iâve been giving all these years
My blood, my sweat, my tears
Iâll carry on forever.

My holy sacrifice
Itâs time for me to rise
The demons chained me down
Itâs time to rise
Rise upâ¦

My holy sacrifice
Itâs time for me to rise
The demons chained me down
What Iâve been giving all these years
My blood, my sweat, my tears
Iâll carry on forever
Itâs time to rise
Rise upâ¦
