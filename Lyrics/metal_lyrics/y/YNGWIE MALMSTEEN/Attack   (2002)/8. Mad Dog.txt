Ever since that day
I met you
Well I just knew
You must be mad
But thatâs okay
Cause Iâve been thinking
And Iâve had worse
It ainât that brad
But now it has reached.

Another level
A lesser man would be scared
Live as you preach
And not as the devil
Weâre all the same
Breathing air.

Madâ¦
Mad dog
Mad, mad dog
Mad dog
Mad, mad dog.

Now itâs too late
Much too late
To fix your problem
Your brain is dead
You should have tried
Yo set it straight
Now you missed that boat
And thatâs what I always said.

Youâre mad
Mad
Mad dog
Mad, mad dog
Mad dog.
