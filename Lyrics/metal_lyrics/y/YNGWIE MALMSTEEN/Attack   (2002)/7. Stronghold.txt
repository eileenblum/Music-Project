Alrightâ¦
You sacrificed
And worked all your life
But now youâre
Bleeding, crying all for nothing
Nothing
You waiting for that day
And youâre always praying
For the gates
To finally open, open.

Into my stronghold
You will never take my
Stronghold
Yeah.

Well you can bring
And armyâs might
But I will always fight
Until the end, the end
You can never break
Through my walls
And Iâll never fall
Whatâs mine I will defend
Defend.

Into my stronghold
You will never take my
Stronghold
And I will show you.

No mercy
Into my stronghold
You will never take my
Stronghold
Yeah.

Into my stronghold
You will never take my
Stronghold.

Well donât believe
What you have beard
Just donât believe
A single word
Not a word.

Into my stronghold
You will never take my stronghold
Yeah.
