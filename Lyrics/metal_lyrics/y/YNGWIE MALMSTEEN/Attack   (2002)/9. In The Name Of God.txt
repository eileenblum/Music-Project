In the name of God
We didnât know for sure
That evil is right outside our door
And now all the bad and ugly
Showing their faces more
So now we have got to work it out
And think with precision
Make sure we make the right decision
In the name of Godâ¦

Together weâre standing tall
Together we will never fall
Together weâre living free
And the truth is all for all to see
But since weâve all been blinded
Blinded by evil
Now is the time to stand and fight
In the name of Godâ¦

In the name of Godâ¦
