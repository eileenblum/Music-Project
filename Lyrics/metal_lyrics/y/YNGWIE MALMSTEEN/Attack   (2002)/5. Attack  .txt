Living large, living free
Living the life that dreams are made of
Dying proud, dying free
Dying the death of heroes.

But what youâve down now
Makes me want to cry
You keep on pushing
Well now youâve pushed too far
You must die nowâ¦

Once we were free
Living in perfect harmony
Itâs much too late
And now thereâs no turning back.

Attackâ¦

Out of the blue
Out of the sky
The world comes crashing down
Not itâs out of true
Weâve been blown sky high
And the king has lost his crown.

We must be fearless
And be relentless
Kill these insects
Show no mercy
You must die nowâ¦
Once we were free
Living in perfect harmony
Itâs much too late
And now thereâs no turning back.

Attackâ¦

Once we were free
Living on perfect harmony
Itâs much too late
And now thereâs no turning back.

Attackâ¦
