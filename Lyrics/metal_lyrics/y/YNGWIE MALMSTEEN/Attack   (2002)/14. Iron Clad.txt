I canât believe youâre even trying this
And the fact that you donât know what my power is
On the battlefield all the angels will fall
And you canât hide behind your crumbling walls.

Evil dreams they try to pull you in
But nowâs the time to pay for all your sins
When itâs even way too late to repent
So maybe your death is just heaven sent.

No shackles can hold me down
You can never understand
Youâll never take my crown
And all the power in my hands
Forever I shall stay this way
And youâll never take whatâs mine away.

I just love when vengeance tastes so sweet
I just love when you must taste defeat
Now you know you must die by my blade
Soon enough your soul will fade away.

It makes me laugh you even took your turn
You canât be serious, wonât you ever learn
Iâm the man that you can never take out
Youâve must forgotten what itâs all about.

Threw caution to the wind
Are you really all that blind
Committing ancient sins
Are you really that behind
We all have a cross to bear.

You can seek but never find
Canât you feel the sadness there
Did you loose your mind
Now it seems that way to me
Did you commit those crimes
Open up your eyes and see
Are you really all so blind
No wonder you were left behind again.

No shackles can hold me down
You can never understand
Youâll never take my crown
And all the power in my hands
Forever I shall stay this way
And youâll never take whatâs mine away
Did you loose your mind
Now it seems that way to me
Did you commit those crimes
Open up your eyes and to see
Are you really all so blind
Will it ever set me free
No wonder you were left behind again.
