Valhallaâ¦
Pick up your swordâ¦
And get your ass on to the battlefield
This hell on earth
That you call your life
Weâll snuff it out
And youâre gonna die.

We come from the north
We come from the ice
We live dangerously
And very short lives
We fight day by day
Sailing the seas
Weâre natural born slayers
We live by the sword
And die by the sword
Weâre never afraid
And to drink with the Gods
To be singing their songs.

I raise my cup in Valhalla
To feast in their halls
And laugh with them all
I raise my cup in Valhalla.

Valhalla
You live by the swordâ¦

The hammer of Thor
Beating you down
The thunder crashing
Through your door.

With the gods by our side
We follow the stars
As weâre sailing into
This holy war.

We come from the north
We come from the ice
We live dangerously
And very short lives
We fight day by day
Sailing the seas
Weâre natural born slayers
We live by the sword
And die by the sword
Weâre never afraid
And to drink with the gods
To be singing their songs
I raise my cup in Valhalla
To feast in their halls
And laugh with them all
I raise my cup in Valhalla.

Valhalla
We live by the sword
And die by the sword.

Valhallaâ¦

We come from the north

And die by the sword
Weâre never afraid
