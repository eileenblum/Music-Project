Can you remember all the times
We were rehearsing all the lines
Way too high
But still weâd try
We were loosing sleep
But for the cause
Rocking out without a pause
Way too highâ¦
Then it seemed so cool
But it wasnât true
And what I was told
There was no lies
And now I wonât die until Iâm old
We were way too high
Trying to reach up and touch the sky
Touch the sky
We were way to high
Trying to reach up and touch the sky.

But the end would justify
All the lost time that went by
Do or die
Way too high
Well, I canât believe itâs true
And all the things that we would do
Way too highâ¦
Then it seemed so cool
But ir wasnât true
And what I was told
There was no lies
And now I wonât die until Iâm old.

We were way too high
Trying to reach up and touch the sky
Touch the sky
We were way too high
Trying to reach up and touch the sky.

All was told
There was no lies
I wonât die till Iâm old.

Trying to reach up and touch the sky
We were way too high
Trying to reach up and touch the sky
We were way too high
Trying to reach up and touch the sky
We were way too high.
