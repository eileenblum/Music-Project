Youâre a being of the darkest descend
You donât belong anywhere
Youâre always hungry, but never content
All of your sins, you could never bear
Now youâre feeling good
But youâre really dead
And youâre wearing make up and perfume
In the gallows you were hung
But now I see you walk instead.

Razor eater
Heâll never ever die
Razor eater
Heâll never ever die.

Well you kept your secrets
And locked them up
Then drained their blood
As you read your books
See the show and rink from your cup
And then hang your darlings.

From the hooks
Slice them up, no one will ever know
But still you smell that smell
And now youâre dead since long ago
You better burn in hell.

Razor eater
He will never die
Razor eater
He will never die.

Razor eaterâ¦
