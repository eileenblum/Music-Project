When the rats are bailing out
And you are just signing on
Then you turned and walked away
There is no love lost here, my friend.

But you have made a great mistake
You ate the hook, the sink and bait
Now you canât get out
Itâs much too late.

The ship of fools keeps sailing onâ¦
And on and on and on.

But I can be merciless for sure
And youâll sail for many moons
I canât believe you lost your mind
Iâll watch you falling down, again.

You have been living in a dream
And I can heat the same old theme
But nothingâs ever what it seems.

The ships of fools keep sailing onâ¦
And on and on and on.

The truth is always hard to face
Especially when you are in that place
Like the ship of fools.

The ship of fools keeps sailing onâ¦
And on and on and on.
