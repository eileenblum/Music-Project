Oh Yeah!

I am a Viking Iâm going out to war
I've got death upon my mind
As I was leavin' oh yesterday
I've got no fear in my heart

[Chorus]
As the shores of my home disappear
I sail over the sea without fear
Dragon ships are charging through the waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah!

I am a warrior my mind is set to kill
Life or death is on the line
I am a slayer and you will taste my steel
I've got your life right in my hand

[Chorus]
As the shores of my home disappear
I sail over the sea without fear
Dragon ships are charging through the waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah yeah! yeah!

You are a loser and it's such a shame
That you're a fool and you don't know
That Iâm a Viking I'll walk all over you
And by my sword you will die

[Chorus]
As the shores of my home disappear
I sail over the sea without fear
Dragon ships are charging through those waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeahâ¦yeah!

No No Noâ¦ No!
