Beams of light up in the sky
Malfunctioned machinery, lost in time
Don't understand, I'm wondering why
How can this happen its so out of line
Strangers among us
from beyond the stars
Whatever you know keep your silence
Unearthly ones from galaxies afar
There will be violence

They know something
that we don't know
What cannot be seen they'll never show
Hangar 18, Area 51

Hangar 18

For me to recall, they hypnotize
It's all part of investigations
They say that I just fantasize
Just try to explain mutilations

They know something
that we don't know
What cannot be seen they'll never show
Hangar 18, Area 51
We're victims of grad illusion
Now we're lost in mass confusion
Hangar 18, Area 51

Hangar 18

Hangar 18

They know something
that we don't know
What cannot be seen they'll never show
Hangar 18, Area 51
We're victims of grad illusion
Now we're lost in mass confusion
Hangar 18, Area 51

Hangar 18
