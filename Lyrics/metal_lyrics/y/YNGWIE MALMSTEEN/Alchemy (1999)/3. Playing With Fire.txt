As the Pendulum of time
Smoke is clearing in the aftermath
Finally know the truth, the crime
We're the authors of the epitaph

Playing with fire
You'll get burned
Flames grow higher
You'll never learn

Playing with fire, Fire
Playing with fire, Ah
Playing with fire

Architects of war still rule
Turning white souls into black
Do they really think we're fools
In the end we will play them back

Playing with fire
You'll get burned
Flames grow higher
You'll never learn

Playing with fire, Fire
Playing with fire, Ah
Playing with fire

Playing with fire
You'll get burned
Flames grow higher
You'll never learn
Playing with fire
You'll get burned
Flames grow higher
You'll never learn
Playing with fire, Fire
Playing with fire, Ah
Playing with fire

Fire
