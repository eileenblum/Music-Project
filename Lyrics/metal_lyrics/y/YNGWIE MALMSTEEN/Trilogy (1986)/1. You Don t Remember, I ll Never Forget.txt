It was you, it was me,
And we would last forever.
Any fool could see, that we were 
Meant to be

Without you, there is no meaning to
My life.
You're gone and it cuts me like
A knife.
How could you leave me?

You don't remember, I'll never forget
You just don't remember, I'll never forget.

Why did you turn away,
Let your love fade away and die.
You became so cold, you made me feel
So old.

When you left, you broke my heart
And just to see.
How many pieces there would be,
After you leave me.

You don't remember, I'll never forget
You just don't remember, I'll never forget
