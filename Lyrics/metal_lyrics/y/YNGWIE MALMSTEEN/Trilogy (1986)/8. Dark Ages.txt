In the time, when darkness ruled
No one saw the light
In the cold black emptiness
Victims of the night

You can't fight what you can't see
To be or not to be

In the dark ages
In the dark ages

Those evil days will still remain,
Till someone breaks the chains.

Just the strong survive,
You have to try, or you will die.

In the Dark ages
In the Dark ages
