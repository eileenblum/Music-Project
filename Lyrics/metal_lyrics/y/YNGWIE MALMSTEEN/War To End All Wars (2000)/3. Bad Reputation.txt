Well, you must reap 
What you have sown 
You're into deep 
You're standing alone 
What you have done 
Can't be undone 
Hear what they say 
They're talking about you 
It's time to pay 
Pay for your dues 
You must be strong 
You know they are wrong 
Enduring Lies 
They will die like flies 
Wheather the storm 
Always, above the norm 
Just listen to them 
Saying 
You've got a bad reputation 
Bad reputation 
You've got a bad reputation 
They're quick to judge 
And they drew first blood 
They held a grudge 
And dragged your name through the mud 
What they have done 
Can't be undone 
You sleep with the devil 
They say you've been had 
You're living in peril 
They say you've gon mad 
They're looking at you 
saying 
You've got a bad reputation 
Bad reputation 
You've got a bad reputation 
Bad reputation 
Hit me with your best shot 
Just do your worst 
But Ha, I've got the jackpot Baby 
And I'll always be first 
You've got a bad reputation 
Bad reputation 
You've got a bad reputation 
Bad reputation
