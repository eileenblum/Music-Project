Climb up the mountain 
That reaches the sky 
Up there's a tower 
A thousand miles high 
There you must tresspass 
Escaping His knights 
In there dwells the Wizard 
His breath like a blizzard 
Ancient incantation 
Evil revelations 
For thousands of years 
They have been searching for him high and low 
The Wizard is here only to disappear 
He hides from the world 
In through the dungeons 
Weapons are drawn 
Passage in hiding 
Dead before dawn 
Master of witchcraft 
Friend of the beast 
Wisdom through tempest from the East 
In there dwells the Wizard 
His face like a lizzard 
Ancient incantations 
Evil revelations 
For thousands of years 
They have been searching for him high and low 
The Wizard is here only to bring you fear 
He hides from the world 
For thousands of years 
They have been searching for him high and low 
The Wizard is here only to bring you fear 
He hides from the world 
The Wizard
