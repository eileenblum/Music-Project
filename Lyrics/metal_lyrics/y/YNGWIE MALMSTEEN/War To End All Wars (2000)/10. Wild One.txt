Once upon a time 
When I was younger 
On a hellride without brakes 
Nothing in the world 
Could still my hunger 
No matter what the stakes 
I was the viking 
I saw the light 
The force was rising 
Shining bright 
I was the soldier without faith 
The Black Star's glowing rage 
Running wild 
I was the wild one 
Not a man, just a child 
Running wild 
I was the wild one 
Wild, Wild, Wild one 
Not a man, just a child 
Running wild 
Things were simple then 
I had no worries 
Never stopping for red lights 
Invincible in mind 
Speeding through lide 
Just another barfight 
I was the viking 
I saw the light 
The force was rising 
Shining bright 
I was the soldier without faith 
The Black Star's glowing rage 
Running wild 
I was the wild one 
Not a man, just a child 
Running wild 
I was the wild one 
Wild, Wild, Wild one 
Not a man, just a child 
Running wild 
I was the wild one 
Wild, Wild, Wild one 
Not a man, just a child 
Running wild 
I was the wild one 
Wild, Wild, Wild one 
Not a man, just a child 
Running wild
