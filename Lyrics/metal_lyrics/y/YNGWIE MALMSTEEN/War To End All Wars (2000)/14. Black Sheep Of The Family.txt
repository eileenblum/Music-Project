I walked down 
That lonely road of life 
Got my fair shar 
Seen a differnt light 
Well I tried so hard 
So don't you know I'll always be 
The black sheep of the family 
Don't you know I'll always be 
The black sheep of the family 
Alright, I've got this car 
It's shiny and black 
So don't fuck with it 
Or I'll attack 
And if it weren't for bad luck, man 
I wouldn't have no luck at all 
No, no luck at all 
So don't you know I'll always be 
The black sheep of the family 
Don't you know I'll always be 
The black sheep of the family 
So don't you know I'll always be 
The black sheep of the family 
Don't you know I'll always be 
The black sheep of the family
