Run, Run Run for your lives 
Swiftly take cover 
We're paying the price 
The Sun, The Sun 
The Sun is falling down 
I can hear the people cry 
I feel it, I see it 
The End is drawing near 
No one can stop what has begun 
Prophet of Doom, The End is coming soon 
Hear the Thunder, Thor's wonder, 
Of doom, of doom, of doom 
Of doom, of doom, of doom 
Time, Time 
There is no Time 
To make it right 
To see the light 
Lies, Lies 
Those were all lies 
So now we are fighting 
Yes, we must fight 
The earth is quaking 
We are shaking 
The End is drawing near 
No One can pray 
And make it go away 
You feel it 
You see it 
The End is drawing New 
No one can stop what has begun 
Prophet of Doom 
Hear the Thunder, Thor's wonder, 
Of doom, of doom, of doom 
Of doom, of doom, of doom 
The earth is quaking 
We are shaking 
The End is drawing near 
No One can pray 
And make it go away 
You feel it 
You see it 
The End is drawing New 
No one can stop what has begun 
Prophet of Doom, The End is coming soon 
Hear the Thunder, Thor's wonder, 
Of doom, of doom, of doom 
Of doom, of doom, of doom
