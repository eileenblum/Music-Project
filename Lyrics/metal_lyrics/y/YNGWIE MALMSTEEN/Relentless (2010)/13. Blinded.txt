Brother killing brother
Senselessly
Dog eat dog mentality
It's the end of days
We must face our destiny
Its much to much
Our world will cease
The blind leading the blind it seems
The end will justify the means
Blinded by the blind
Relentless spirits
Wants your soul to burn
Plagued by death
You never learn
The fallen angels
They will rise again
There is nothing left to defend
The blind leading the blind it seems
The end will justify the means
Blinded by the blind
