No more blood, no more sweat, no more tears
Now it's all gone
Those wasted years
It's all burning down
In the End
In this world, only the strong can survive
Just the fools believe those lies
It'll crash and burn
In the end
Take a look at you now
Do you like what you see
Those who fell and rise again
I know it well, my friend
You're in the shadows, but you can't hide
You keep on living
Living a lie
The truth must prevail
In the end
Take a look at you now
Do you like what you see
Those who fell will rise again
I know it well, my friend
You saw the devil and then you sold your soul
Now the evil one is in control
You are gonna crash and burn in the end.
