The eye in the sky
Its watching you
You must tread easily
And break no rules
We are the victims
We are falling prey
And now the world is turning grey
In your ship, your sinking fast
It's reaching critical mass
Gaze into the future
You and me
California will fall into the sea
Critical Mass
Critical Mass
Too many lives
Too many lies
Our destiny seems dark indeed
We'll turn into stone
Were paralyzed
The devil is laughing now
With pride
In your ship your sinking fast
It's reaching critical mass
Now we must obey
The spell that has been cast
There's no time to waste
It will not last
Critical mass
Critical Mass
Now hear the words
From the wise
You draw first blood
You're hypnotized
An avalanche comes down on you
You never had a chance, my lord its true
Critical Mass
Critical Mass
