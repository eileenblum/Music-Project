Divide &amp; conquer
It always seems to work
There is no wonder
We cannot lift the curse
When the sun rises
In the east
They have all begun
Worshipping the beast
We must see
The true enemy
The wolves are at the door
Can't you see
Those evil minds Hypnotize
The enemy is within
The enemy is within
Do or die
This battle can't be lost
Well burn the sky
No matter what the cost
We have been deceived
The kingdom has lost its crown
I can't believe
The madness all around
Now we must lift the curse
Its gone from bad to worse
Evil minds hypnotize
The enemy within
The enemy within
We must see the true enemy
Wolves are at the door
Can't you see
The enemy within
The enemy within
