There's no shifting
My will of steel
Just like a freight train
Pushing on through
There is no stopping
The tide of desire
It's just like a fever
Perpetual fire
Leave no stone unturned
The flame still burns
In my quest
I shall never rest
There is no wall high enough
For me to scale
There is no pit deep enough
I cannot fail
Nothing can slow down my charge
I am on fire
There is no distance too far
I will touch the stars
Leave no stone unturned
The flame still burns
In my quest
I shall never rest
Never give in
No more crying
Darkness must fall
Into the night
